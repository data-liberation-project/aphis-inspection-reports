2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
9 CFR 2.40(b)(2) requires use of appropriate veterinary care methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries.
An adult, brown and white guinea pig housed within the pen next to the exterior door of the animal facility was
observed to have an approximately walnut-sized swelling under its chin. Additionally, a brown, black, and white
guinea pig housed within the fourth pen from the exterior door had an area of reddened, non-haired, moist skin with
lesions spanning the width of its hindquarters, as well as a reddened, non-haired, approximately egg-sized swelling
under its chin. Additionally, the brown, black, and white guinea pig's left eye appeared to have a small grey-to-blue
area of opacity.
Large swellings, areas of reddened, non-haired, moist skin with lesions, and changes in eye clarity can be indicative
of disease or injury, and can be painful for guinea pigs. Areas of reddened skin can affect the overall health and
well-being of guinea pigs. A veterinarian has not been consulted about this condition.
The licensee must have these two animals examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and
treatment plan. Correct by December 15.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the representative.
