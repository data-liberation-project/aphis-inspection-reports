2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee had acquired 14 hedgehogs from several different sources since the previous inspection on 11/6/2013
but no records of acquisition had been made. Records of acquisiton for animals acquired for use in regulated
activities are required so that APHIS can determine that animals are acquired legally and so that they can be
identified and tracked throughout the inspection process.
Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the required
information under the AWA concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned,
held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control.
To be corrected by 5/12/2014.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
Thirteen hedgehogs in the licensee's quarantine housing were being fed directly on the bedding of their primary
enclosure. The food cannot be kept free from contamination when fed in this manner since the animals' excreta
may come directly in contact with the food or can be tracked through the food when the hedgehogs move around
the enclosure. This poses a health risk to these animals due to the potential for contamination of the food.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health
To be corrected by 5/12/2014.
