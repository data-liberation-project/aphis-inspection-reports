3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The floor pens are not being sanitized every two weeks and there is a build up of shavings with debris caked into the floor.
These pens need to be scraped down to the concrete and all organic material removed prior to sanitizing to effectively
clean the enclosures. This needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs in the pens.

In the puppy room there are shavings and fecal debris trapped between the wood board and the grooves in the vinyl
siding on the floor underneath the enclosures. The placement of this board makes it challenging to remove all organic
material trapped behind the board to effectively clean and sanitize the puppy room. This needs to be addressed to
facilitate cleaning and sanitizing of the room between litters.
