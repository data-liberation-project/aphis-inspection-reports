***In the walk through area, there was a muntjac outside of his enclosure and eating grass in the area where the
public is allowed. It was stated that this muntjac had also escaped his enclosure yesterday and the staff had placed
a cable on the fence. The fence around most of this enclosure was constructed of chain link, yet there was a section
on the north end that was constructed out of net wire. The net wire portion was bowed in between the T posts and
not attached to the T posts at the bottom. The chain link fence had numerous patches in corners and along the west
side. These patches were constructed with pieces of hog panels, horse panels, logs, boards, cross ties and rocks.
There were hooks made out of rebar that were inserted into the ground and hooked onto the chain link fence to hold
it to the ground. Despite the patches and attempts at repair, this fence was still warped and buckled in several
places. Loose, buckled and warped fencing creates the potential for injury to the animals or escape of the animals
from the enclosure. The licensee must replace or repair the fencing within this enclosure and assure that all fencing
is structurally sound to securely contain the animals and keep them free of injury as required.
This inspection began at 1100.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative, Dr. Erika Leisner, VMO and
Beverly Hicks, ACI.
