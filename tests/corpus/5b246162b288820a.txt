3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** There were various locations on the primary enclosure for antelope and zebra where the fencing has been
damaged, causing an opening of up to eight inches in diameter. In some places the ends of broken wires protrude
into the animal enclosure. Damaged fencing with openings in the fence that are large enough in some places for an
animal to put its head through could lead to entrapment, injury, or escape. Protruding wires could cause eye
injuries or other wounds.
A system should be put into place in order to ensure that fences are inspected regularly, and that repairs are made
in a timely manner.
This is a repeat issue, cited previously on the 4/27/11 inspection report, with a 5/6/11 correction date.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
