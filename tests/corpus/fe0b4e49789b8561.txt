Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
I called the licensee and honked the horn. The number did not allow you to leave a message so I texted them. After
waiting about 30 minutes, I called again without being able to leave a message. I texted the licensee again letting them
know I was leaving the premises. A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the
inspection process at 11:00 am on 6-July-2022.
