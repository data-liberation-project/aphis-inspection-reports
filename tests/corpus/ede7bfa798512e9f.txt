3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On January 30, 2017, a 6-month old Chinese Goral was found dead adjacent to its enclosure. There was a gap
found under the gate separating the enclosure from the neighboring one, which contained a Persian onager. The
necropsy report indicated death of the goral was due to trauma to the thorax and abdomen. According to the animal
management team, they had not believed that the gap was sufficiently large to easily accommodate an escape, and
no report had been made in the daily observation logs stating that the gap had been identified and needed to be
filled in to prevent escape/entrapment. The staff immediately added more stone to fill in the gap and also placed
cinder blocks to prevent the creation of another gap. As evident in this incident, enclosures that allow an animal to
become entrapped and/or escape pose a risk of harm and injury. Enclosures must be constructed and maintained
in good repair so as to prevent injury and to safely contain the animals housed therein.
This particular non-compliant item was self-identified and corrected by the facility prior to this inspection. Continue
to correct by identifying, correcting, and documenting enclosures that are in need of repair.
This inspection was conducted on 4 October 2017 with the Vice President and the Director of Animal Management.
An exit interview was conducted on 5 October 2017.
