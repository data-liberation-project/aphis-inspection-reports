FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the time of inspection, there was a lack of perimeter fencing around several outdoor housing enclosures, which
include servals, lynx, camels, and dingos. Perimeter fencing must be of sufficient height (6 feet) for potentially
dangerous animals. The fencing is important to keep unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from the facility.
Perimeter fences must be properly constructed as a secondary containment so as to protect and contain the
regulated species and prevent unwanted entry by animals and unauthorized persons.

WATERING.
The Asian small clawed otter enclosure consist of an outdoor swimming pool due to the aquatic nature of the
animals. At the time of inspection, the water within the pool was cloudy and green with larvae present on the
surface. The water is used for both drinking and swimming purposes. Dirty water may harbor disease hazards and
this poses a health risk to the otters. With the pool in this current condition, the licensee should provide an alternate
source of fresh water for the animal. The water that is used for its drinking must be kept clean.

SANITATION.
At the time of the inspection, there was exposed wire bed within the dirt floor of the enclosure for a goat and two pot
bellied pigs. The exposed wire bed wrapped within the entire perimeter of the enclosure and indoor shelter. The
exposed wire poses a threat of harm and injury to the animals. The facility must keep the group premises clean and
in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury. Correct by: June 30, 2017
