FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The building's temperature inside during the inspection was 58 degrees Fahrenheit (F). While the guinea pigs,
hamsters, gerbils, and ferret aren't displaying signs of being cold today, it was colder 3 days ago, with a low in the
30's at night. Cold temperatures may cause discomfort to animals and increase risk for health problems. The facility
must install a heater or take other measures that do not allow the indoor temperature to fall below 60 degrees F.
The licensee must provide enough heat in the animal area to provide a minimum temperature of 60 degrees F and
to not exceed 85 degrees F.
