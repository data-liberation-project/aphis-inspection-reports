HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On July 26th, 2019, a young French bulldog was transported from Amsterdam to Boston on KLM Flight 617 on air
waybill #074-27691145. According to documentation accompanying the animal, the dog was observed and food and
water were offered at 15:00 CEST in Amsterdam, prior to a scheduled departure at 17:00 CEST. There was a 36
minute flight delay, according to publicly available flight information, and the plane departed the gate at 17:36
CEST, taking off at 17:57 CEST. This flight landed at Boston Logan International airport at 18:45 EDT after a flight
time of 7 hours and 20 minutes, and the plane arrived at the gate in Boston at 18:56 EDT. Recorded temperatures
on July 26th reached 97 degrees Fahrenheit at Schiphol International Airport in Amsterdam, and at 16:00 CEST it
was 86 degrees. The temperature was 81 degrees Fahrenheit at Boston Logan International Airport. At 19:38 EDT,
the KLM duty manager on the aircraft notified the intermediate handler that there was a deceased pet on board the
aircraft.
Post-mortem findings revealed that this animal was at high risk for heat stroke due to the unique upper airway
anatomy of brachycephalic breeds like French bulldogs. The necropsy report concludes that the cause of death was
respiratory distress and heat stroke.
While in transport, this animal was subjected to a combination of temperature and time that was detrimental to the
animal's health, especially considering the known susceptibility of this breed to heat-related health problems. The
combination of these climatic conditions, compounded with known risk factors associated with this breed of dog,
resulted in the death of this animal. When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being,
appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of these conditions. An animal may never be subjected
to any combination of temperature, humidity, and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking
into consideration such factors as the animal's age, species, breed, health status, and acclimation.
This inspection was conducted at the cargo handling office at Boston Logan Airport. A final exit interview was
conducted by phone on 8/12/19 with a representative of the registrant.
