Sanitation.
A few of the lower Guinea pig pens remain wet and/or heavily soiled. Effected enclosures are too dirty, the guinea pigs
are unable to rest in a clean, dry area. A dirty enclosure contributes to animal stress and disease. Primary enclosures
shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and debris. A program must be
developed and maintained which provides effective cleaning and sanitation.
