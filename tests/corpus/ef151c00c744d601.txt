3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the Great Ape Escape area, the Chimpanzee Day Room #4 contains numerous logs connected together
providing climbing/resting structures for the enclosed primates. There are logs that are deteriorated to the degree
that they are no longer fully anchored to the floor. Due to the wood loss, their structural integrity is affected and they
cannot be cleaned and disinfected properly since the wood is cracked, jagged and no longer adequately sealed.
The facility must repair or replace all affected logs, and must ensure that all climbing structures are safe and sound
and free of excess rust and jagged edges. This affects 7 Chimpanzees.
- In the Great Ape Escape area, the Gorilla Day Room #1 contains numerous logs connected together providing
climbing/resting structures for the enclosed primates. There are logs that are deteriorated to the degree that they
are no longer fully achored to the floor. Due to the wood erosion and splitting the structural integrity is affected and
they cannot be cleaned and disinfected properly since the wood is cracked, jagged and no longer adequately
sealed. The facility must repair or replace all affected logs. The surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed in
a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when
worn or soiled. This affects 8 Gorillas.
