ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- At the time of the inspection a chinchilla was individually housed and had lesions on both ears. The ears were red
and had cuts and scabs present. The chinchilla's eyes were squinted and the animal's face appeared to be
grimacing in pain or discomfort and it did not move in the enclosure the entire time the inspectors observed this
animal. The facility representative stated the chinchilla was in a fight last week and was injured and under
treatment. The treatment consisted of placing Neosporin on the ears. The inspector called the AV and the AV stated
the animal had been examined in mid November but not since that time. According to the Attending Veterinarian the
facility representative told the AV the animal was much improved since that time. The inspector asked the AV if he
prescribed the Neosporin to be applied to both ears and he stated no that was not his treatment plan. The licensee
must have all animals examined by the AV and follow the AVs instructions and treatment plans at all times.

- There was a guinea pig that arrived at the facility 2 days prior to the inspection and had dry, crusty lesions on the
back of the left ear and on the right side of the face by the nose. This animal was not under treatment at the time of
the inspection. There was no documentation present that addressed these injuries or indicated that the attending
veterinarian had been contacted. All animals must be observed daily and any veterinary care issues must be timely
and accurately relayed to the attending veterinarian. The facility must make certain that a program is in place to
ensure that all injured animals receive prompt and adequate veterinary care at all times.
