Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
There were no acquisition and disposition records, health records, or program of veterinary care present at the time of this
inspection. The inspector was told these records were at the licensee’s home. Review of records required by the Animal
Welfare Act facilitates the inspection process by allowing the inspector to determine compliance of documents and
evaluate animal welfare. The licensee must, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to examine records required to
be kept by the Animal Welfare Act and the regulations.
