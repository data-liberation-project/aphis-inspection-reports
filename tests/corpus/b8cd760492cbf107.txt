2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult, female, Yorkshire terrier ("Little Daisy", Tag #32, DOB 2008) had hair-loss on both ears. Nearly all of the
hair was gone on both ears and both ears were moderately thickened and dark in color. There were dark
scabs/crusting on the inside and outside of both ears.

One Morkie puppy (DOB 4/13/16, Microchip # 7E10033722) had severe crusting and matted hair around both eyes.
The left eye had severely matted/crusted hair tightly adhered to the entire surface of the eyelid/eye which prevented
visualization of the eye/eyelid itself. There was a yellow-green discharge seeping out from under the matted hair
and the skin around the eye appeared slightly reddened. The inspectors observed the puppy scratching its left eye
with its back foot. There was matted hair and crusting around the right eye with a mild amount of yellow-green
discharge present. The eyelids were partially closed and the inspectors were unable to open the eyelids to view the
entire surface of the eye due to the severe matting/crusting on the outside corner of the eye. The surface of the eye
that was visible to the inspectors appeared mildly cloudy.
One adult, female, Yorkshire terrier ("Fluffy", Tag #84) had hair-loss on both ears and severe dental tartar. Nearly all
of the hair was gone on both ears. Both ears were mildly thickened with dark scabs/crusting present on the surface
of the skin. The severe dental tartar covered nearly all of the remaining front and cheek teeth. In some areas the
gums were pulled back from the teeth and there was a creamy white discharge present along the gumline. One of
the upper left front teeth was severely loose and moved when the dog stuck her tongue against the tooth.
One adult, female Yorkshire terrier (ID #78) was observed to have excessively overgrown toenails on her front feet.
The nails are curling under and lay out sideways from the foot when the dog is standing. Closer inspection of the
dog revealed a buildup of a thick dark brown tartar encasing the entire surface of the cheek teeth and the majority of
the upper canine tooth on the left side of the mouth. A light brown tartar is encasing the entire surface of the upper
and lower cheek teeth and the majority of the upper canine tooth on the right side of the mouth. The gums were
moderately reddened and a creamy white substance was located along the gum line of the upper left cheek teeth.
One adult, female, Yorkshire terrier ("Jewel Sue", Tag #97, DOB 2009) had severe dental tartar. The severe dental
tartar covered nearly all of the remaining front and cheek teeth and part of each canine. The gums were severelyred and swollen and in some areas the gums were pulled back from the teeth with a creamy white discharge
present along the gumline. One of the lower right cheek teeth was severely loose. The hair around the mouth was
severely wet and there was a large amount of clear discharge present below the left eye.
One adult, female, Yorkshire terrier (Tag #80) had hair-loss on both ears and severe dental tartar. The hair on both
ears was thinning with small patches where the hair was completely gone. The severe dental tartar covered nearly
all of the remaining front and cheek teeth and part of the canines. In some areas the gums were pulled back from
the teeth. There was a creamy white discharge present on the surface of the teeth and/or along the gumline. One of
the lower right cheek teeth was severely loose and moved when touched.
One adult, female, Yorkshire terrier ("Dolly Ann", Tag #89, DOB 2006) had hair-loss on both ears and severe dental
tartar. Nearly all of the hair was gone on both ears and the tips of both ears were mildly thickened. The severe
dental tartar covered nearly all of the remaining cheek teeth and part of each front tooth and canine. The gums were
severely red and swollen and in some areas the gums were pulled back from the teeth with a creamy white
discharge present along the gumline.
One adult, female, Maltese ("Dolly", Tag #82) had severe dental tartar. The severe dental tartar covered nearly all of
the remaining cheek teeth and part of each front tooth and canine. The gums were severely red and swollen and in
some areas the gums were pulled back from the teeth with a creamy white discharge present along the gumline.
The inspectors observed this dog excessively licking.
Hair loss can be an indication of an underlying health problem. Overgrown toenails can cause pain and discomfort
to the dog as well as affect the dog's natural gait. Poor eye and dental health can also cause pain and discomfort to
the dog and lead to further health complications. The licensee must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be
documented and available to the inspectors upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate
veterinary care at all times.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure, containing one dog, the sharp ends of multiple screws have penetrated through the wall and are
located at the level of the dog. In another enclosure, containing two dogs, there is a gap at the bottom of the gate.
One of the dogs in the enclosure was observed to put her face, snout and foot through the gap. Within the same
enclosure, the wire front panel has broken resulting in a sharp point next to the feeder. Sharp points and gaps in
fencing can cause injury to the dogs. Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair and protect the dogs from injury. The licensee must close
the gap below the gate and remove the sharp points in order to eliminate the injury risk towards the dogs. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The hard, plastic water bowls in two enclosures, containing a total of one adult dog and four puppies, has been
excessively chewed by the dogs. The chewing damage is concentrated around the upper edge of the bowls and
brown material has become embedded into the grooves.
The self-feeders for the dogs are constructed of either hard plastic or metal. The feeders in at least six enclosures,
containing at least eight adult dogs and six puppies, have become soiled and worn. The front edge of the cup of the
plastic self-feeders have become chewed and damaged and brown food debris has become caked along the inside
of the cup. The metal self-feeders have food debris caked on the inside of them and hair has also built up within
them. Damaged and dirty feeders and water receptacles cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized which could
increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface, including food and water
receptacles, which cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee
must replace the damaged and/or dirty food and water bowls or alter them in a manner that allows for proper
cleaning and sanitization of the surfaces. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are
regularly maintained and in good repair at all times.
