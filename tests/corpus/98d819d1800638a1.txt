3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
This facility does not currently have a perimeter fence. The Licensee has obtained a perimeter fence variance for
some of the species at the facility in 2012. However; there are species that were not present at the facility at the
time they received the variance and/or are not covered on the variance request at this time; red fox, raccoon,
wallaby, ground hog, ferret and bob cat. The Licensee stated that he has had individuals come on to the property
and let mink out of their enclosures. Perimeter fences are required to act as a secondary containment in the event
of an escape. In addition, perimeter fences are to be designed to protect the animals from contact with wild animals
and the public from making unwanted contact with the animals at the facility. The Licensee must ensure a
perimeter fence is properly in place or request and receive approval from the Administrator for a variance for the
species that are not currently covered on the current variance from 2012.

WATERING.
About 75% of the water receptacles for the fox, raccoon and skunk have rust or chew damage that do not allow for
proper cleaning or sanitation. In addition, several of the water receptacles have a build up of green organic material
or brown/red matter buildup. Having water receptacles that are not properly cleaned/sanitized expose the animals
to unnecessary hazards. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
