Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
The facility used a method other than full committee review or designated member review to approve an amendment to a
protocol. Based on a chain of emails reviewed, the IACUC administrator emailed the amendment to the IACUC members
for review on February 3, 2022. After receiving reply emails from the members stating their approval, the amendment was
considered approved. This polling of IACUC members is not an approval method considered in compliance with the
Animal Welfare Act. Full committee review or designated member review are the two approved methods of protocol
approval to ensure a fair and complete review of all protocols as well as modifications to protocols. If full Committee
review is requested for a proposed activity, approval of that activity may be granted only after review, at a convened
meeting of a quorum of the IACUC, and with the approval vote of a majority of the quorum present. Correct by 9/30/2022.

Miscellaneous.
Two handling incidents occurred resulting in Animal death:
- On February 3, 2022, Yorkshire pig # 7418, died due to a significant amount of air entering the heart during a procedure
under anesthesia. The pig was being administered intravenous fluids during a procedure from a fluid bag encased in a
pressure sheath. Unnoticed, the bag ran out of fluid, filled with air and introduced air into the pig’s vasculature resulting in


death.
- On February 15, 2022, Yorkshire pig # 397 part of study LV15P, died from having been administered an excessive
amount of intravenous fluids. During the procedure, both the veterinary team and the researchers administered
intravenous fluids to the pig without coordinating with each other resulting in fluid overload. An attempt was made to
correct fluid abnormalities detected during the procedure but the pig died shortly into recovery. Findings on necropsy were
consistent with fluid overload being the cause of death.
Mistakes in handling, mainly involving fluid administration and monitoring, during these procedures contributed to the
death of these pigs. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does
not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Corrective actions had been developed and implemented at the time of inspection.

Separation.
In an enclosure housing 3 Yorkshire pigs, two were seen with a significant amount of red scratches on their skin. Pig #
7592 had a large amount of red lines dispersed throughout both the left and right sides of the body, extending from the
neck to the hindquarters. There was a cluster of red scratches on the left and right shoulder areas, but some scratches
could also be seen on the outside of both ears and on the face. In addition, there was a small wound on the right
eyebrow. Pig # 7591 had less scratches with the red lines mainly on his left and right shoulder areas. A facility
representative explained that the scratches were caused by the pigs interacting with one another since being housed
together 3 days ago. The current group housing situation has resulted in mild injuries and may be causing stress as well
as discomfort to both these pigs. Animals shall not be housed near animals that interfere with their health or cause them
discomfort. Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. Corrected at the time of inspection.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
