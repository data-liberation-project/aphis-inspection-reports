Item 2.33 b 5 Veterinary Care
At the time of inspection protocol 20318 indicates the use of Bupivacaine/Lidocaine topically following biopsy. A
review of post-op records indicate that the post op treatment of bupivacaine/lidocaine failed to show the
administration according to the approved protocol. In addition the protocol indicates fluids will be administered, but
the records failed to show the administration of the fluids as required.
The protocol needs to be followed in order to insure proper veterinary care.
