ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:10am on
28-MAR-19.
I arrived at the facility. I knocked at the door and rang the doorbell. I called the phone number in the file and left a
message. I honked the horn several times. I waited 30 minutes, after which I knocked on the door and rang the
doorbell again. After no answer, I left at 11:45am.
