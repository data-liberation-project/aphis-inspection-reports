TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are 30 Golden Retrievers located in the sheltered housing facilities that do not have an official form of
identification.
Official identification is needed to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the
inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are officially identified by tags, tattoos or microchips.
