INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A researcher was not following their approved post-surgical care protocol for hamsters and not providing analgesia
medications. The category D protocol (#1632) described postoperative pain control procedures including at a
minimum an injection of buprenorphine immediately postoperatively. Procedure/treatment cards, observed at the
time of the inspection, showed that no buprenorphine had been given to the first set of animals (approximately 17 of
them) undergoing the surgery between the dates of June 9 -14, 2017. When the attending veterinarian was notified
of a hamster that was not doing well after the surgery, she discovered the omission of buprenorphine. The IACUC
must ensure that activities that involve surgery must include appropriate provisions for post-operative care of the
animals and that researchers and staff are trained in appropriate surgical and postoperative care. The lack of
appropriate post-operative analgesics, as approved by the IACUC, can result in unnecessary discomfort and pain
for the hamsters.
The following corrective action has been taken: The attending veterinarian stated that a review, observation, and
corrections of the surgical procedures and care was conducted and staff were re-instructed on following protocols
as approved. Treatment cards starting on June 14, 2017 indicated that buprenorphine was being administered.
Appropriate changes were instituted by the attending veterinarian to correct this noncompliance.
2.31(e)(3) CRITICAL
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A principal investigator conducted a surgical procedure on hamsters using a surgical approach and post-operative
care that was not approved in their protocol. The procedures/approach that were used differed significantly form the
IACUC approved protocol. An animal was euthanized following complications in this surgical procedure. The
category D protocol (#1632) for hamsters contained an ovariectomy procedure indicating the use of a ventral
midline approach. At the time of inspection, multiple hamsters on this protocol were observed to have lateral flank
incisions. The IACUC approved post-operative procedures also included pain management with buprenorphine, but
this was not provided for the initial set of animals.
The attending veterinarian indicated that she was notified by the staff caring for the animals that one of the first
animals to have surgery was not doing well. After assessing the animal it was euthanized and a necropsy was
performed. The veterinarian indicated that the incision site had not been sutured closed appropriately and there wasintestinal herniation/entrapment. Two additional hamsters have been euthanized post-operatively but the cause is
still under investigation. The veterinarian stated that a review, observation, and corrections of the surgical
procedures and care was conducted and staff were re-instructed on following protocols as approved. Written reports
on the this incident and corrective action were not yet available at the time of the inspection. The attending
veterinarian stated that a revision of the protocol is being submitted by the researcher to the IACUC and that they
plan to report the matter to OLAW.
A proposal to conduct an activity involving animals or to make significant changes in an ongoing activity involving
animals must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals and must be approved by the
IACUC. Changes to procedures must be approved prior to their implementation to ensure the changes are in
accordance with this subchapter and to ensure the procedures avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to
the animals. Failure to have the changes approved by the IACUC can lead to unnecessary pain, discomfort and
distress. The researcher must submit a proposal that accurately describes the procedures to be performed and
demonstrate that personnel performing the procedures are adequately trained.
Correct from this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.
