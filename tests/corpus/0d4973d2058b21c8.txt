ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Direct - There was an adult tricolor guinea pig with an abnormal right eye with discharge. The right eyeball could
not be visualized and appeared sunken. Mostly white tissue was observed covering the eye. There was a small
portion of reddened swollen tissue present in the corner of the eye. A mucoid-like greenish white discharge was
observed in the corner of the eye. There was some hair loss surrounding the entire eye. According to the licensee
he had not noticed this animal's eye condition prior to the inspector's pointing it out. This eye condition could be the
result of injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition which could be painful or may result in blindness. The
licensee agreed to have this animal seen by a licensed veterinarian no later than July 30, 2014 for an accurate
diagnosis and treatment plan.
***Within the main indoor facility, there were multiple enclosures that contained one or more guinea pigs with
localized to generalized hair loss. The exposed animals' skin in many of these areas of hair loss was flakey,
reddened, thickened looking and/or had the presence of scab-like lesions. Within one enclosure in the main
building, there were at least three guinea pigs with hair loss. These animals included an adult tricolor with hair loss
over the back and sides, an adult tricolor with a thin amount of hair over its sides and a young adult white guinea pig
with an approximately 1 inch diameter circular patch of hair loss on the top of the head. Also, there was an adult
black and white guinea pig with patches of hair loss over its back and both sides. The exposed skin had a circular
reddened flakey lesion which was approximately 1 cm in diameter near the top of animal's back on its right side. It
also had a smaller, similar looking lesion on the skin on the top of the animal's back on the left side. Surrounding
both of these lesions on the skin there appeared to be several tiny specks of black to brown material observed in a
few of the strands of surrounding fur and on the skin. Another adult dark brown and white guinea pig was observed
with generalized hair loss over it's body. The exposed skin was flakey with multiple scab-like lesions present. An
adult white and brown guinea pig had hair loss present over its rear end on the back, sides and legs. There was an
adult brown and black guinea pig with hair loss over the animals back, sides and tops of the rear legs. The exposed
skin on the left side had an approximately 1/2 cm circular, reddened, open, sore-like lesion. The rest of the skin
appeared flakey. There was an adult tricolor guinea pig with generalized hair loss over its body including the front
legs and flakey exposed skin in these areas. Another adult tricolor guinea pig had hair loss over most of its back,
sides and rear legs. The exposed skin appeared flakey and at least one pinpoint sized reddened irclular skin lesion
was observed on the animals right rear hip region. There was also a young adult tricolor guinea pig and an adult
brown/white guinea pig that each had hair loss on their back, neck and sides. The animals' exposed skin wasreddened and flakey. A mostly white young adult guinea pig with a patch of brown hair over the left eye also had
hair loss radiating approximately 1/2 inch out and around the nose. The exposed skin was also flakey in
appearance. There was also an adult dark brown and brown guinea pig with a thin hair coat over both sides.
Flakey and circular scab-like lesions could be seen on the exposed skin on both sides as well.
***Within the quarantine building there were two wire enclosures containing a total of 28 additional young and adult
guinea pigs with varying degrees of hair loss and skin conditions. According to the licensee, the enclosures
contained animals that he had previously identified and isolated from the main building for hair loss.
When asked if he had any of these animals with hair loss seen by a veterinarian or if he had consulted with a
veterinarian regarding these animals' current conditions the licensee replied, 'no'. According to the licensee, he was
not administering any treatment to the animals besides isolating those animals he had identified with hair loss into a
quarantine enclosure. There were at least 13 guinea pigs with varying degrees of hair loss and skin conditions that
were identified during the inspection that had not previously been identified by the licensee or placed within an
isolation enclosure. Hair loss with flakey skin and/or skin sores can result from injury, infection, illness or other
medical conditons which could be contagious, uncomfortable and/or lead to further health complications of the
animals. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding these animals with hair loss no later than
August 4, 2014 in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed.
The licensee must ensure that all treatment plans are followed and that all animals receive adequate veterinary care
at all times.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There were at least 41 guinea pigs located throughout the facility that had varying degrees of hair loss and skin
conditions. The licensee had previously identified and isolated 28 of these animals prior to our inspection, however,
a veterinarian had not be contacted regarding their conditions. According to the licensee, the isolated animals were
being monitored but were not receiving any other form of treatment. Guinea pigs with hair loss and/or skin
conditions have been included on four reports from past inspections since January 17, 2012. Following through on
the treatment recommendations from a veterinarian has appeared to be inconsistent by the licensee. The licensee
did initiate a diet change to address the hair loss at the recommendation of his attending veterinarian since the
inspection that occurred in January 2014. However, the hair loss and skin conditions are still occurring and neither
an exam nor a consultation regarding these animals' conditions with the attending veterinarian has occurred for
approximately the past 6 months (January 2014). There was also an adult guinea pig with an abnormal eye
condition identified by the inspectors during the current inspection. The licensee stated that he had not previously
noticed the animal's condition. Daily observation of the animals is important to assess the health and well-being of
the animals. It is also important that accurate information with regards to animal health from daily observations is
being relayed to the veterinarian in a timely manner so that appropriate treatment recomendations can be
established and followed by the licensee for the health and well-being of the animal. The licensee must establish amechanism of direct and frequent communication with the veterinarian in order to ensure that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health are conveyed to the veterinarian at all times. TO BE CORRECTED BY:
This point forward.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The licensee does not have a record or form which discloses all of the required information for the animals that
are currently in his possession or those animals which have been disposed of from the facility. The licensee had
some documentation regarding the disposition of some of the animals sold; however, the documentation did not
include all required information such as the addresses of the persons to whom the animals were sold or given. The
licensee also stated that he was giving the animals which had been moved from the main building to the quarantine
enlcosures in a separate building to another individual. The building containing the quarantine enclosures was
housing 31 guinea pigs, was located on the licensee's property and has previously held regulated animals by the
licensee. The licensee did not have any documentation regarding the disposition of these animals. Complete and
accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to
facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. The licensee must make, keep and maintain records which fully disclose all of
the required infromation concerning all animals acquired, owned, held or otherwise in possession of, or which are
transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of by the licensee. TO BE CORRECTED BY: August 11, 2014.
2.131(b)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***During the inspection there were several instances when the licensee handled the animals in a manner that could
cause unnecessary discomfort. Some of the enclosures in the main building contained large carpet squares that
covered most of the wiring flooring, After having lifted the carpet squares up for animal viewing and counting, the
licensee would repeatedly let the large carpet squares fall back on top of some of the animals. The licensee would
also pick up the guinea pigs, sometimes by pulling them from their back end and/or legs, and then toss the animals
back down into the enclosure. In at least one instance with an adult guinea pig, the licensee was standing and
tossed the animal he was holding a distance of approximately 2 feet back into its enclosure. Tossing animals and
letting the carpet squares fall on top of them increases the risk of trauma, injury and/or discomfort. The licensee
must ensure that all animals are handled in an careful manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm or
unnecessary discomfort. TO BE CORRECTED BY: From this point forward.
3.25(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength.
***There were several enclosures within the main building housing guinea pigs that were not maintained in goodrepair and two adult guinea pigs were observed outside of their enclosures. At least six enclosures were observed
with gaps between the wire wall in the front of the enclosure and the wire flooring. One of these gaps measured
approximately 1 inch by 9 inches and another gap measured approximately 1.25 inches by 12.5 inches. These
gaps were large enough for a guinea pig to fit its body through. Two adult guinea pigs were observed outside of
their enlcosures and running loose on the floor during the inspection. At least two enclosures contained wooden
support boards at the back of the enclosures that had been chewed. In one of these enclosures the wooden board
had been chewed approximately four inches down to the wire flooring. The edges of this wood appeared splintered
and roughened. Many of the enclosures contained metal self-feeders that had been screwed into enclosure divider
walls and the screws end were protruding into the animals' enclosures on the opposite side. These protruding
screw ends were located approximately 8 inches up from the flooring of the enclosures. These enclsoures increase
the risk of injury to the animals. The gaps present in some of the enclosures do not allow for secure containment of
the animals. The licensee must ensure, at all times, that all animal housing facilities are kept in good repair, and
that they protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. TO
BE CORRECTED BY: August 4, 2014.
3.25(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Storage.
Within the main building, the hay for the guinea pigs was being stored on the floor within the room adjacent to the
guinea pig room. Only a partial bale of hay was left and most of the floor surrounding the remaining bale of hay was
covered in strands of hay with strands of straw directly behind it and intermingled in with the hay. String and debris
from some of the adjacent empty feed bags were observed in the hay on the floor. There was a soiled looking
circular section of intermingled straw and hay strands on the floor that was discolored dark brown to black. When
asked if the hay was fed to the guinea pigs, the licensee responded, "yes". This storage of hay increases the risk of
contamination by vermin and debris. The licensee must ensure that all supplies of food and bedding are stored so
that they are adequately protected from deterioration and/or contamination. TO BE CORRECTED BY: August 11,
2014.
3.25(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
d) Waste disposal.
***In the main facility, there was an accumulation of dirt, hair and grime hanging from the edges of the washdowns
beneath the primary enclosures. Also, the alley way drain had standing water where it appeared that a brown to
green algae-like substance was beginning to form along the edge. There were also numerous cobwebs above
primary enclosures and on the support beams of the building. There was an excessive amount of gnats within andaround the animal enclosures. Accumulations of dirt, hair and grime can cause odors, attract pests that can
transmit disease and creates an unhealthy environment for the animals. The licensee must establish and maintain a
program that ensures that animal waste and debris are removed and disposed of in a manner that reduces or
eliminates the risks from pests, odors or disease. TO BE CORRECTED BY: August 11, 2014.
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
(a) Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures. (1)
***Within the main facility and quarantine enclosures, there was an excessive amount of dirt, debris, waste and/or
grime within several of the guinea pig enclosures. Within the main facility, there was a build-up of dirt and grime on
the PVC pipes of the automatic watering system in some of these enclosures. There was also a build-up of dirt,
debris and grime along the ledges and side walls of some of these enclosures. Many of the enclosures with carpet
squares on the floors were mostly wet. Also, cobwebs were observed directly above some of the guinea pig
enclosures. Within the quarantine enclosures, the wire flooring was in contact with the ground and the animals
inside the enclosures had direct contact with the material on the ground. This flooring was covered in straw and hay
that appeared wet as did most of the exposed flooring. There was also an abundance of fecal material observed on
the flooring and intermingled throught the strands of straw and hay. Debris and multiple strands of straw and hay
were on top of the wire covered enclosures as well as attached and hanging from the sides of the wire enclosures.
Failure to properly clean and sanitize primary enclosures can attract pests, odors and potential disease hazards.
The licensee must establish and maintain a program to ensure that primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized
often enough, but not less than every two weeks, to prevent an accumulation of dirt and debris.
3.31(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.
(b) Housekeeping.
***Within the main facility and the building with the quarantined enclosures housing guinea pigs, there were areas
with accumulations of debris and cobwebs. There were numerous spider webs along the sides and above the
primary enclosures as well as hanging from the ceiling in both buildings. Along some of the ledges above the
primary enclosures there was an accumulation of debris. An excessive amount of gnats were observed within and
around the guinea pig enclosures in the main building. Within the the quarantine building, there was an
accumulation of animal bedding and food waste on the flooring surrounding the 2 primary enclosures.
Accumulations of cobwebs, waste, bedding material and debris can lead to pests, odors and potential disease
hazards. The licensee must establish and maintain a program to ensure that the premises are kept clean to protect
the health and well-being of the animals.
3.31(c) REPEATSANITATION.
(c) Pest control.
***An excessive amount of gnats were observed within and around the guinea pig enclosures inside the main
building. The licensee had at least 2 bags of "Fly Predators" for fly control in/around the facility, but they were not
being effective in controlling all of the insects present in the building. Insects increase the risk of disease hazards to
animals. The licensee must establish and maintatin an effective program of pest control.
The inspection was conducted with the licensee on July 28, 2014. An exit interview was conducted with the
licensee by phone on July 29, 2014 during which all correction dates were discussed and were acknowledged to be
understood by the licensee at that time.
