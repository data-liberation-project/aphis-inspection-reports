Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee gave an adult male Bactrian camel two oral doses of Banamine on 7/3/21 and 7/7/21 to treat a wound on the
left hind leg, in accordance with instructions from a veterinarian. The medication used by the licensee expired on 02/2020.
Expired medications may be less potent or less effective at treating pain and inflammation, resulting in poor treatment
outcomes or poorly controlled pain in the animal that was treated. Correct by July 10, 2021 by using medications that are
not expired in consultation with the attending veterinarian.
