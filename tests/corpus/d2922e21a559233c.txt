WATERING.
***In the Tiger enclosure, one water receptacle had a stalk of a plant, feathers and a piece of turkey meat floating on
top of the water. There was also a white milky film floating on top of the water. Multiple flies were in the water, on
the debris in the water and on the receptacle. In the second water receptacle, the water level could not be seen. On
the side of the receptacle there was a dried layer of thick, green algae like substance and a layer of white, hard
crusty substance. The facility representative stated that it had been awhile since the receptacles had been cleaned.
Clean water and receptacles are essential for promoting good health to the animals and reduce the risk of disease.
The licensee must clean these receptacles assure that the animals are provided with potable water as required.
This inspection began at 1333.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.
An exit conference was also conducted via phone with the licensee on 09/24/14.
