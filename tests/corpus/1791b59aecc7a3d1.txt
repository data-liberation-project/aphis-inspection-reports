Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the
animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.
Corrected at time of inspection.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
