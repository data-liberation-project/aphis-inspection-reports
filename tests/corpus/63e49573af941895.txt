3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility has two lemurs but there is no documented environmental enhancement plan that is approved by the
attending veterinarian. The plan for environmental enhancement is necessary to ensure the mental health of the
non-human primates. Approval by the attending veterinarian is important to affirm the type of enrichment is
appropriate for the species. The licensee must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for
environmental enhancement for the lemurs and the plan must be approved by the attending veterinarian. The
documented plan must be available to the inspector upon request.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Within the enclosure that contains ten pine squirrels, there is a wooden den structure that has received damage and
the sharp ends of two nails are exposed.
In the enclosure housing male black bear “Gibby”, the resting platform is attached to the frame by metal wire. The
ends of the wires have created sharp points that the bear can come in contact with.
(cid:9)
In the enclosure containing two lemurs, there is a raised platform for the animals to sit on. There are two nails
sticking out of the surface of the platform and the lemurs can come into contact with the sharp ends of the nails.
In the enclosure containing two grey foxes, there are two raised platforms that are attached together by wire and the
ends of the wires have created sharp points that the foxes can come in contact with.
In the enclosure containing female black bear “Molly”, there are multiple sharp points created by wire and broken
fence prongs. Some of the sharp wires are attached to the top of the enclosure but “Molly” was observed to climb
the primary fence to the top of the enclosure and can come into contact with these sharp points. At least two
broken fence prongs were located along the bottom of the primary fence and bent inward toward the bear. Attached
to the primary fence is a metal self-feeder that the bear has damaged resulting in sharp points and edges. Sharp points and edges can cause injury to the animals. The housing facility shall be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury. The licensee must remove all sharp points and
edges or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the animals. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosures are safe for the animals at all times.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
In the enclosure containing ten pine squirrels, there are two water containers that have a thick layer of algae coating
the inside surfaces. The algae is also floating in the water and the water has turned a dark brown and dark green
color.
In the enclosure containing male black bear “Gibby”, the water contained in the water receptacle is a dark brown
color, contains a large amount of hair and appears slightly thickened.
In the enclosure containing female black bear “Molly”, the bottom surface inside the water receptacle is coated with
a layer of green algae.
Water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary. The licensee must remove the algae from all water receptacles
and must ensure that all water receptacles remain clean and sanitary at all times.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
In the enclosure containing male black bear “Gibby”, there are multiple large piles of feces, old food items, and hair
scattered across the floor of the enclosure. These waste items are attracting a large number of flies. Flies were
observed swarming around and sitting on the feces and old food. The flies were also sitting on the resting platform
and on the areas of the primary fence located near the piles of feces. A buildup of waste materials and flies can
increase the disease risk towards the animals.
Excreta shall be removed from the primary enclosure as often as necessary to prevent the contamination of the
animals and to minimize disease hazards. The licensee must remove the feces, food, and hair as often as
necessary to reduce the number of flies attracted to such waste and to promote the health and well-being of the
animals.Correction date: August 24, 2016
Female ring-tailed lemur has been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian.
