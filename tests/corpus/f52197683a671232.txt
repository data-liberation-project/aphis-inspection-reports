HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning
In all of the outdoor enclosures, affecting approximately 64 dogs, there is an heavy accumulation of old bedding,
hair, dirt, fecal material, and other organic material.
There is a heavy accumulation of this material around and underneath several of the shelters. Some of this material
has been there long enough for rodents to make burrows and trails. In several of the enclosures there is some old
bedding in front of around the shelters that has become soaked with urine and other liquids and has a very strong
odor of urine.
In several of the inactive receptacle areas of the self feeders there is a heavy accumulation of what appears to be
dirt, organic material and rodent droppings.
In an outdoor enclosure the majority of the floor was covered with fecal material and bedding. This amount of fecal
material made it difficult for the dogs to move around the enclosure without stepping in it.
This accumulation of hair, dirt, old bedding fecal material, and other organic material has created a habitat for
rodents to flourish and could become a disease hazard. The licensee must clean these enclosures and ensure that
all enclosures are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks to reduce disease hazards,
eliminate odors, insects, pests, or vermin infestation. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and
sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shelter Space
In an outdoor enclosure, housing 8 young Labrador Retrievers, there was one shelter provided. This shelter did not
provide enough space for all of the dogs to sit, stand, lie down or turn around at the same time. The licensee must
provide an additional shelter or move some of the dogs so that they all can perform the aforementioned postural
movements and for the health and well being of the dogs.
It is noted that at the time of inspection the licensee moved 4 of the dogs to a different enclosure.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Minimum Space Requirements
There are two Boston Terriers housed in an enclosure that does not provide them with enough floor space. The
enclosure was measured at 30 inches x 30 inches which gives these dogs 6.25 sq. ft. of available floor space. Both
dogs were measured to be approximately 17 inches in length. The minimum required floor space for these dogs is
(17+6)(17+6)/144 x 2 = 7.35 sq. ft. These two dogs do not have enough floor space. Adequate floor space is
required in order to ensure that the animals can make normal postural adjustments and for their health and
well-being. The licensee must provide these dogs with an enclosure with adequate space and ensure that each
animal is provided with adequate floor space for the health and well-being of the animals at all times. The licensee
did move one of the dogs after inspectors pointed it out during the inspection.

3.9(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
Contaminated Food
Inside of a food reservoir area of a self feeder, affecting 4 dogs, the inspector found one live mouse and one dead
mouse on top of the food. The licensee quickly removed both the live and dead mouse and disposed of them.
In at least 3 of the trough areas of self feeders, affecting 6 dogs, the inspectors found bird and rodent droppings.
Rodents, rodent and bird dropping can transmit disease to the dogs.
The food in these self feeders have become contaminated. The licensee must remove the remaining food from the
affected self feeders, clean and sanitize these feeders.
The licensee must ensure that the food be uncontaminated at all times.
The licensee was verbally instructed to correct this issue by 31 Jan 18.
3.10 DIRECT
WATERING.
Access to Water
In all of the outdoor enclosures, affecting approximately 64 dogs, the water lick-its in the all of the enclosures were
shut off due to cold temperatures. Dogs were observed licking and chewing the lick-its, inspector moved the lick-its
to try and get water, and nothing or very little water was coming out. The licensee stated the water was shut off at
10 pm the night before. The inspector instructed the licensee to supply water to the dogs. After the licensee turned
on the water all the dogs were trying to drink, many continuously for 30 seconds, and all the dogs were pushing and
crowding to get to the lick-its.
At the time of inspection this placed the amount of time elapsed at approximately 14 hours since the dogs wereoffered fresh water.
Lack of water could cause the dogs to become dehydrated or succumb to other health issues. The licensee must
provide and ensure that all dogs have access to fresh water twice a day for at least an hour each time, or more
often if necessary to ensure the dogs do not become dehydrated or succumb to other potentially serious health
issues.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest Control
The outdoor building had a heavy coating of what appeared to be bird droppings on the enclosure divider walls,
affecting approximately 64 dogs. The dogs' self-feeders where directly below the area with the bird droppings, and
self-feeders had bird droppings on them. Several mice were observed scurrying around in the enclosures. Birds,
mice and bird droppings can transmit diseases and parasites to the dogs.
The licensee must establish and maintain a safe and effective pest control program to protect the health of the dogs
and puppies.
