Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An approximately 5 year old female Pomeranian (microchip # 7E10152526) was found with a heavy substance built up on
the teeth. On the left side the gums were reddened and back near the cheek teeth they were starting to recede from the
gum line. The upper canine tooth was more than halfway covered with a dark, almost black material. The cheek teeth are
completely covered in a dark brown material. The right side upper canine was about halfway covered in a dark brown
material and the cheek teeth are almost completely covered in a brownish material. The licensee stated that she had not
noticed this dog’s dental condition. This dog’s dental condition could result in pain and discomfort as well as lead to
further health issues. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and develop and
follow an effective treatment plan. All dogs must receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

Primary enclosures.
Within an indoor facility, there were enclosures housing young and/or small breed dogs that did not have the required
amount of minimum floor space. A primary enclosure, housing three weaned Yorkshire Terrier puppies, measured 30
inches by 19 inches providing a total of 3.96 square feet of floor space. Two of the puppies measured 12 inches in length,
therefore, each puppy required 2.25 square feet of floor space. The third puppy measured 14 inches in length and

required 2.78 square feet of floor space. All three pups together in one enclosure required 7.28 square feet of floor space.
Another primary enclosure housing a Maltese x Poodle was in an enclosure also measuring 30 inches by 19 inches
providing a total of 3.96 square feet of floor space. The dog measured 18.5 inches in length and required 4.17 square feet
of floor space. Another primary enclosure providing the same 3.96 square feet of floor space contained a singly housed
Golden Retriever x Poodle puppy that was visually longer in length than the Maltese x Poodle in the adjacent enclosure.
Another primary enclosure housing three recently weaned Pekingese x Maltese puppies were in an enclosure measuring
18 inches by 24 inches providing a total of 3.0 square feet of floor space. Each of the puppies measured 10 inches in
length and each required 1.78 square feet of floor space. All three puppies together in one enclosure required a total of
5.34 square feet of floor space. These dogs must be provided with the minimum amount of floor space in their primary
enclosures as required in this section in order to ensure their comfort, health, and well-being. The licensee must ensure
that all animals in all enclosures have access to at least the minimum floor space required by this section at all times.

Primary enclosures.
A Golden Retriever x Poodle puppy was housed in a primary enclosure that did not have the required 6 inches of head
space. Dogs that are not given adequate head space can decrease the dog’s ability to exhibit its normal behavior or
postural movements. The licensee is to ensure that all dogs have at least 6 inches of space from their head to the top of
the interior height of the enclosure when standing in a normal position.

Watering

A singly housed adult male Standard Poodle had two empty water receptacles in his enclosure. When asked by the
inspector, the licensee provided the dog with water. The dog was observed immediately accessing the water from the
filled receptacle and excessively drinking for approximately 1 min and 29 seconds. He only stopped continuously drinking
twice during that time; once for approximately 3 seconds and another time for approximately 5 seconds. Dogs that go a
prolonged time without water can become dehydrated and if continues long enough it could lead to additional health
issues including death. The licensee must ensure that all dogs have continuous access to potable water at all times.
The licensee provided this dog with potable water at the time of inspection and must continue to do so for all dogs from
this date forward on 12-7-2021.

The inspection and initial exit interview was conducted with the licensee on 12-7-2021 and the final exit interview was
conducted with the licensee on 12-9-2021.
