2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
*** A current written program of veterinary care was not available during the inspection. The program of veterinary
care was last reviewed by the attending veterinarian in September 2015, however. did not have a current listing of
regulated animals at the facility. The marmots and 13-lined ground squirrels were not listed on the program of
veterinary care. Failure to have an accurate written program of veterinary care that has been reviewed by the
attending veterinarian does not provide for adequate veterinary care of the animals. It is the responsibility of the
licensee to ensure the written program of veterinary care accurately reflects the species of animals utilized at the
facility so that the appropriate veterinary care will be provided.
