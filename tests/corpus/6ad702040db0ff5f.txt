2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***Protocol NLS-417: Animals under the approved protocol will be anesthetized to conduct procedures using a noval
device and / or a standard procedure for canalization. However, there is no detailed description or SOP that
describes how the procedures will be performed. A proposal to use animals for research must contain a complete
description of the proposed activity so that the IACUC can effectively determine that discomfort, pain, and distress
will be minimized and the proposed activity is not deemed unnecessarily duplicative in accordance with subchapter
2.31. A step-by-step description of the canalization and cut-down procedures ensures an accurate review of the
proposed activity by the IACUC. The protocol must be amended to include a detailed description of all procedures
that will be conducted on the animals under Protocol NLS-417. Correct by August 14, 2017 or before any activity is
performed on animals assigned to this protocol.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC Chairperson, the IACUC Vice Chairperson, and
the Chief Operating Officer.
