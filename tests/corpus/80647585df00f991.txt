PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Minimal floor space was not being provided in one indoor enclosure housing 20 adult rabbits. The floor space
being provided for the rabbits measured 16 square feet. Calculation revealed that the 20 rabbits would need at
least 30 square feet of available floor space. Lack of minimum floor space can affect the freedom of movement and
the ability to make normal postural adjustments. The licensee must provide a minimum amount of floor space for
all rabbits at all times. Correct by 2/6/15.
* The facility inspection done on 1/23/15 and the exit briefing done on 1/26/15 were conducted with the facility
representative.
