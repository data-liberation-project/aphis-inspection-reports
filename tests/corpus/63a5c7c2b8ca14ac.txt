2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The attending veterinarian had not visited the premises since 1/30/2020. The licensee’s program of veterinary care states
that the attending veterinarian would make, at a minimum, annual visits. Each dealer shall employ an attending
veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the
formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of
the dealer or exhibitor. Correct by 12/7/2021.
3.26(d)

Facilities, indoor.
There is a room in the back of the facility housing over 40 animal cages. The room has an exposed beam ceiling with
exposed insulation and ductwork. The beams and insulation were covered in spiderwebs and dust. In the same room,
there is an unsealed concrete block wall that is approximately 3 feet in height that borders the left side of the room, and a
full height unsealed concrete block wall that borders approximately half of the right side of the room. The interior building
surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that they are substantially impervious to
moisture and may be readily sanitized. Correct by 4/30/2022.
3.28(c)(2)(iii)

Primary enclosures.


One of the dwarf hamster cages, out of approximately 40, was noted to have too many hamsters housed within. The
cage measured 20 inches by 10 inches, and was housing 36 hamsters, with an average weight of 30 grams. In a cage
that size, in order for each hamster to have the required 10 square inches of minimum floor space, there could be no
more than 20 hamsters. Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
