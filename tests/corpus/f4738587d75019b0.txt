ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*The written and signed program of veterinary care (PVC) form does not reflect the currently performed veterinary
husbandry practices performed at the facility and needs to be updated. The vaccinations currently are not
administered at the same intervals as listed on the PVC. The parasite control section does not include all the drugs
being used. Two of the drugs for internal parasite control (fenbendazole and Marquis) used are not listed on the
PVC. In addition, three of the drugs (fenbendazole, Marquis and Noromectin) are not labeled for use in dogs and
their use needs to be overseen by the vet with written instructions (to include drug name, concentration, formulation
and dosage).
*The current PVC does not include any written dental care plan for the dogs. Three of the older dogs are in need of
dental care with large amounts of accumulated tartar on their teeth. These dogs do already have an appointment
scheduled for 9/24/15 for a visit to the veterinarian for dental treatment. However, a written dental plan needs to be
developed with the attending veterinarian to help address dental health of the dogs before excessive amounts of
tartar are allowed to build up.
The facility and the attending veterinarian need to develop a complete written program of veterinary care that
addresses all routine veterinary health related procedures to be performed and drugs to be used at the kennel in
order to ensure adequate veterinary care for the dogs. All drugs prescribed for individual animals need to be labeled
with instructions for the use of the drug and for which animal it is to be given. Correct by Nov. 1, 2015.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The sundowner building housing dogs was damaged during renovation of the inside of the building resulting in
damage to the washdown drainage system. Washdown material is collecting on the ground at the end of the
building where the drainage pipes exit. Thick dark brown/black material has accumulated on the ground causing
odors and attracting some flies. The odors and flies may lead to discomfort to the dogs and spread of disease may
occur. The odor and drainage should be mitigated as much as possible until the renovation construction can be
completed. Correct by Nov. 15, 2015. Chihuahua #0056 cited on the previous inspection is no longer at the facility.
Inspection and exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
