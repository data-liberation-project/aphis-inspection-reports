WATERING.
The water receptacle in the raccoon enclosure is a black plastic bowl that contains brown, cloudy water with an
accumulation of dirt, debris, and food waste on the bottom. This is the only source of drinking water for the raccoon.
The raccoon was seen drinking this water during the inspection. Unclean and unsanitary drinking water can be
unhealthy and cause illness in the raccoon. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

SANITATION.
There is an accumulation of excreta inside the raccoon's enclosure, especially around the area where he is given
food and water. The raccoon must walk through this area to get to his food and water, and he is therefore at risk of
contamination by the excreta. There is an excessive overgrowth of weeds in the enclosure, and excreta is present in
this weedy overgrowth. The weeds are sufficiently thick so as to prevent removal of all excreta within the enclosure.
The excreta is attracting flies which can present a disease hazard to the raccoon. Excreta shall be removed from
primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to
minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. It may be necessary to remove the overgrowth of weeds in order to
facilitate removal of excreta.

SANITATION.
There are flies swarming on the raccoon's food that is present on a sheet of plywood that is the feeding area on the
ground inside its enclosure. Flies transmit diseases that could cause illness in the raccoon. The written program of
veterinary care directs the licensee to use fly strips to control flies. The licensee is not currently using any measures
to control flies.There are bird droppings present on the ground in the feeding and watering area inside the raccoon's enclosure.
Bird droppings are also present on the metal bars and chain link fencing of the enclosure above the feeding and
watering area. Bird droppings can be a source of germs that can cause illness in the raccoon.
There is shade cloth and a sheet of plywood on the top of the raccoon enclosure. These materials provide shelter
from sunlight and inclement weather over a log inside the enclosure where, according to the licensee, the raccoon
often resides. On the exterior of the enclosure on top of the plywood and shade cloth, there is an accumulation of
mammalian feces. This feces cannot be from the raccoon, because it is on the outside of the enclosure. Therefore it
must be deposited there by mammalian pests that are accessing the top of the enclosure. This fecal matter can fall
into the enclosure or be washed into the enclosure by rain and be a source of germs and parasites that could cause
illness in the raccoon.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained.
