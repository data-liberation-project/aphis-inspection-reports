2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 on
24-APR-18. Voicemails were left at the licensee's home and cell phone numbers. The property is gated but the
inspector honked several times to try to roust someone. After 30 minutes with no response, the attempt to inspect
was aborted.
Lack of availability for inspections renders the regulatory process impossible. The licensee must ensure a facility
representative is available for inspections during normal business hours. Contact your inspector to discuss
additional hours of availability and to submit an itinerary if applicable. Correct from this time forward.
