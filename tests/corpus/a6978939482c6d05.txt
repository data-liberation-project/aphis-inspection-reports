FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The southeast corner of the barn there were two electrical wires running from the ground up, part of way along the
side of the barn. These sets of electrical wires were covered with PVC pipe and had plastic electrical boxes at the
top. One of the sets of electrical wire is exposed at the point where the PVC pipe cover and plastic box meet. The
plastic box was missing the cover exposing the electrical wire.
At the bottom on the ground, the electrical wire was not covered with PVC pipe and exposing the wire.
Approximately two feet of wire was exposed.
This exposed electrical wire allows the animals to have access to the wire, thus potentially causing injury to the
three goats, five sheep, four llamas and two camels. All animal facilities must be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury.
To be corrected by, 9-April-2016.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
* There is a perimeter fence under construction around the enclosure housing the two camels. The outdoor
enclosure, housing the two camels, must have a perimeter fence at least six feet high (including all gates) be a
minimum distance of three feet from the primary enclosure fence, and not contain gaps for a person or animals to
go through or under the fence. As of the last inspection, this non-compliant item has not been corrected.
A perimeter fence will provide protection to the camels by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence also function as a
secondary containment system for the camels in the facility. Perimeter fences less than 6 feet high for
non-dangerous animals must be approved in writing by the APHIS administrator.3.130
WATERING.
* The outside watering receptacle (tank) had an excessive accumulation of green algae and green slime on the
walls and floor of the tank. This watering receptacle is not being kept clean and sanitary. As a result, this can
increase the disease potential for the three goats, four llamas, five sheep and two camels.
All watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary. Thus, decreasing the disease potential and providing
potable water for the animals.
To be corrected by, 29-March-2016.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
* The barn, housing two camels, three goats, four llamas and five sheep, had an excessive accumulation of fecal
waste and soiled bedding on the floor. This can cause strong odors, disease hazards and contamination risks for
the animals.
The excessive accumulation of fecal waste and soiled bedding must be removed more often or more frequently.
This will prevent contamination, minimize disease hazards and odors for the animals.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
* On the ground in various areas of the enclosure, there were strands of orange and grey bale twine. Possible injury
can be cause to the animals from chewing or ingesting the twine.
All grounds must be kept clean and free of trash or bale twine. This will prevent injury to the two camels, threegoats, four llamas and five sheep.
