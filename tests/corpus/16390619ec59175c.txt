WATERING.
During the inspection I noticed a dog walk up to the watering line nipple to get a drink of water. The dog was there
for a split second and immediately turned away from the nipple. It did not appear the dog got any water from the
nipple. I asked the licensee to demonstrate to me that the watering line nipples were working. He could not get the
watering line nipples in two of the enclosures to work. I asked the licensee to provide a cage of three dogs with a
bowl of water. One of the dogs in the enclosure stayed in the outside part of it's enclosure and did not appear to
see the licensee provide the bowl of water, but the other two dogs immediately went to drink from the bowl. The
licensee fixed the watering line and many of the dogs on the half of the building where the watering line was not
working immediately went to drink from the watering line nipples. The licensee informed me that he tested the line
earlier this morning, but did not check all the enclosures. He stated that he last saw the enclosures that were half
way down the row from the watering source dispense water the night before.
Not ensuring that the watering line nipples are working or that water is being provided to the dogs on a more regular
basis doesn't ensure the health and well-being of the dogs. Water must be provided as often as necessary to
ensure the health and well-being of the dogs. Correct immediately.
Note: The licensee corrected this during inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
