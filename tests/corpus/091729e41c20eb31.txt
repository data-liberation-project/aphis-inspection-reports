Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 1,432 adult,
weanling, and newborn guinea pigs were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the
number of adults, weanlings, or newborns present for the last few months.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.
2.134(a)

Contingency planning.
There was no written contingency plan on file at the facility.
Failure to have a written contingency plan can result in lack of readiness for emergencies or disasters.
Facilities must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment,


transportation, housing, and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster.

Facilities, indoor.
There were nine windows in the guinea pig housing facility that required framing. The unframed windows have exposed
wood and insulation which is not impervious to moisture.
Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be cleaned and sanitized and may harbor pathogens that can cause
disease in the guinea pigs.
The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities must be constructed and maintained so they are impervious to
moisture and may be readily sanitized.

Primary enclosures.
The metal self feeder in Pen 22 contained a sharp point on the lower lip. The wire mesh around the automatic water
nipples contained sharp points in the 11 stacked guinea pig pens.
Sharp points can cause injury to the guinea pigs.
Primary enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.
