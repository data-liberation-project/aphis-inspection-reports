2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 6-year-old female Jacob sheep, ID #207, was visualized walking on only three of its limbs, holding its right
hindlimb up completely and demonstrating pain. The licensee indicated that the sheep had caught its limb in the
fence upon attempting to jump over it, thereby breaking the limb. The licensee also indicated his attending
veterinarian evaluated the sheep’s injury and discussed the acceptability of the licensee selling the sheep for
food/fiber, which the licensee had planned to do but had not yet done so. Via phone call, the attending veterinarian
relayed to the USDA that the sheep with the broken limb was evaluated several weeks ago, and also confirmed the
licensee was planning to sell the sheep promptly for processing. The licensee had not followed the veterinarian’s
instructions.
Appropriate methods for prevention, control, diagnoses, and treatments of diseases and injuries must be employed
as part of a program of veterinary care, in order to ensure sheep health and well-being. The lack of appropriate
methods for treatment of limb injuries can create pain, stress, and more advanced disease conditions for the sheep.
The licensee must follow treatment recommendations from the attending veterinarian of record for Sheep #207.
