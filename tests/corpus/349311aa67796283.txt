2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
This was a focused inspection for an incident involving the 9 year old male lion "Zawadi(cid:29)" that was injured during a
public exhibition on June 13, 2016. During a keeper talk/demonstration with multiple lions, the animals entered
through a hydraulic door onto an indoor stage. "Zawadi"(cid:29) was the last lion to enter the stage, and as he stopped
inside the door his tail was not fully through when it closed severing the tail approximately 4 inches from the end.
This was a guillotine-style door, and the keeper operating the switch was unable to see the bottom of the door as
her view was blocked by a large wooden table. As soon as the injury was noted, the door was opened, and an
additional keeper behind the scenes recalled "Zawadi"(cid:29) back to his holding area and contacted the veterinary staff.
The animal was examined by a veterinarian within 15 minutes of the incident and treatment was initiated.
Handling of animals must be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm. At the
time of the inspection, the zoo had instituted procedures to minimize the risk of injury in the future as animals enter
the indoor stage. The wooden table was removed and additional training on shifting animals has been provided to
staff.
Correction: Ensure corrective actions instituted by the facility are properly followed.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
