ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete as it has not been changed in two years and was only written
for the llamas and alpacas. There are now pigs, sheep, goats, and rabbits which need to be included in the plan.
The Attending Veterinarian does visit every 3 months. The Veterinary Care program needs to be completed by the
licensee and the Attending Veterinarian and include all veterinary care to be provided the animals. To be corrected
by 10-2-17.
2.75(b)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are no records of animals on hand showing the animals acquired since the license was obtained. Records
need to show all births, deaths, sales, and acquisitions. When an animal is sold or given away, the name and
address of the buyer is required. When an animal is acquired, the name, address, USDA number or driver's license
number and license plate number is required to be recorded. As much as possible, an inventory list with the
above required information needs to be completed. To be corrected by 10-2-17.
3.53(c)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the rabbit room is a cage of five lion head rabbits which were returned to the licensee two weeks ago. They are
in a wire bottom cage with 4.7 square inches of floor space. Five rabbits require 7.5 square feet of floor space, so
this cage is only large enough for 3 rabbits. More space needs to be provided. To be corrected by 9-5-17.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There are 15 rabbits on the property in various cages and some are also rotated out into the paddocks for exercise.
A horse stall was converted into a rabbit room with rubber mats on the floor and multiple cages of groups of rabbits.
Rabbits are released for exercise onto the floor for exercise. Although the rabbit room was cleaned 5 days ago,
there is an accumulation of feces on the floor along the wall edges, and one of the cages has an accumulation offeces on a ramp. The rabbits loose on the floor are under some cages which have wire bottoms, and therefore they
can have feces and urine falling on them. This entire area is full of spiders and spiderwebs on the walls, cages, and
ceiling. The tops of the rabbit hutches in this area are excessively dusty.
All primary enclosures are to be kept reasonably clean of feces, hair, spiderwebs and other debris. Rabbits need to
be kept where other rabbits cannot defecate on them. Solid floors need to be cleaned often enough to keep the
rabbits clean and dry. To be corrected by 9-11-17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the company president.
