ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 300pm on
03/19/2015.
I knocked on the door with and left a message on the phone voice mail, however no one was home at the time. I
waited in the driveway 30 minutes. I left a message for the licensee to advise if days or times of optimal days for
inspection have changed to let me know.
