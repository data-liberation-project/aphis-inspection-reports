At the time of inspection it was noticed that animal 0705113 had exhibited the stereotypic behavior of hair pulling on
both front legs. In June the Veterinarian had seen the animal and recommended measures to address the
behavior. Since then there is no record of what has occurred or if the animal has improved. The Facility manager
has indicated that she spoke to the veterinarian on occasions but there is no documentation as to courses of
action and how the animal has progressed.
Facility needs to insure that documentation occurs when addressing animals with behavior problems, how they are
monitored and resolution of the problem
