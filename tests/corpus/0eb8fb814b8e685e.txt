2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The current Program of Veterinary Care does not have written guidance for the use of chickweed salve that the
licensee stated she uses to treat the guinea pigs for ringworm. The use of drugs/preparations such as this without
guidance from the attending veterinarian can be harmful to the animals. The licensee must obtain additional
guidance to ensure the administration of this product is approved by the attending veterinarian.
2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) has guidance for euthanasia that includes the use of CO2 by the
licensee or by lethal injection to be done by the attending veterinarian. The licensee was not able to demonstrate
how to use the CO2 device on hand and stated that she has never used the device. The CO2 tank was found to
be empty, which the licensee was not aware of. When asked how animals have been recently euthanized, she
stated she started using the unacceptable method previously found to be out of compliance on the 12 June 2017
inspection. This unacceptable method does not ensure a rapid unconsciousness in the animals without evidence of
pain or distress. Failure to provide an acceptable method may lead to suffering in the animals. Failure to follow the
written PVC does not give the attending veterinarian the authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary
care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. Correct this by ensuring the written plan
of veterinary care is followed as written.
Correct from this day forward
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** Several of the primary enclosures are excessively dirty or wet and have an accumulation of feces. At least 4 of
the enclosures need a thorough cleaning to ensure a clean environment for the animals and to satisfy this section of
the regulations. The licensee stated that she is cleaning the enclosures weekly. Several of the enclosures were
found to be wet enough, especially in the corners, that weekly cleaning may not be adequate to ensure a clean
environment for the animals. Correct this by increasing the frequency of cleaning.3.31(a)(4) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** It is obvious by the current condition of this facility that no sanitization schedule is in place to ensure the
enclosures are sanitized with a disinfectant at least every 2 weeks. Failure to provide regular sanitization can lead
to an increase of potential disease hazards to the animals. Correct this by developing a sanitization schedule to
adequately sanitize all enclosures at least every 2 weeks as required.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
