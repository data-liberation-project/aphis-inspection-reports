OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The plywood roof protecting a Common Marmoset enclosure was found to be extremely damaged / rotted.
Approximately a 1/3 of the roof length was affected, particularly in the corners; several sharp wood splinters / points
were present in the affected areas. Outdoor housing facilities for nonhuman primates must provide adequate
shelter from the elements at all times, particularly rain. To prevent discomfort, health conditions and potential injury
to the animals, the plywood roof should be replaced as soon as possible.
