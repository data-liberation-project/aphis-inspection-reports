3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the upper pen there was orange hay bale twine on the ground within the goats enclosure that could possibly be
ingested. Towards the far left end of this pen the top barbed wire strand was not completely attached to the top of
the fencing. Also there were several areas at the bottom of the fencing that were buckling and gathering. The
animals could potentially get their hooves caught if they were to step into it. All of the enclosures should be
constructed to prevent injury of the animals including the materials used for the fencing and keeping it in good
repair.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with owner.
