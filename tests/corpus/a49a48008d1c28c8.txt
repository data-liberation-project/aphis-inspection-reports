ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The kennel consists of one sheltered building. During the inspection one six year old female Pomeranian was
observed non-weight bearing on her right front leg. On the top of the right front foot there is a red open sore with
drainage. The animal also has a old sore on the top of the left foot. The dealer did not have any documentation of
the animal receiving any previous treatment. The animal needs to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian. The
dealer must maintain written documentation of the evaluation and all treatment to protect the health and welfare of
the animals.
