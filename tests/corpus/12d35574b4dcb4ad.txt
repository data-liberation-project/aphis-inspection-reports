PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* The outdoor chimpanzee exhibit consists of a 3+acre, wooded lot. There are no trees near the enclosure's
cement wall, but many large branches are left in the center of the enclosure, after they fall from trees, to serve as
natural enrichment. On 10 April 2014, approximately seven chimpanzees used a large (approximately 6.25 foot)
branch to reach the top of the enclosure wall. The wall measured 12 feet and 4 inches at the point where the
branch was wedged against it. Once on top of the wall, the chimpanzees had easy access to leave the enclosure.
According to the staff, at least one chimpanzee completely exited the enclosure and was observed outside the front
door of the holding building. None of the chimpanzees ever entered any public areas. The staff executed their
dangerous animal escape plan and all animals were safely returned to their holding areas within approximately 1.5
hours, without the need to tranquilize any of them. No animals or people were injured during this incident.
** Animals must be securely contained at all times in order to protect them from injury and to protect the public.
*** The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so they contain the
nonhuman primates securely.
This non-compliant item was corrected at the time of inspection.
This was a focused inspection to gather information surrounding the incident of escaped chimpanzees which was
self-reported by the facility to the USDA inspector. The inspection was conducted on 11 April 2014 with facility
representatives. An exit interview was conducted on 18 April 2014 with facility representatives.
