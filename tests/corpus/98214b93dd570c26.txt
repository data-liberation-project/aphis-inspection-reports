2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**The IACUC minutes from 4/29/16 mention that SOP #11 had been rewritten indicating the attending veterinarian
would be notified of animal related health issues so that appropriate veterinary follow-up would be performed.
However while reviewing SOP #11 there was no mention of the communication of animal health related issues to
the attending veterinarian in a timely manner to allow for appropriate veterinary intervention if needed. Animal care
staff should observe the animals on a daily basis and communicate health related issues to the attending
veterinarian. A mechanism of communication should be maintained by animal care staff in order to relay animal
health issues to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner.
THIS INSPECTION AND EXIT BRIEFING WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE FACILITY REPRESENTATIVE.
