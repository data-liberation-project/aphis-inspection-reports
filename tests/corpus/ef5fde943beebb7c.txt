ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female French Bulldog (Sweetie Pie; M/C# OA1272452C) had skin and ear conditions that needed
veterinary care. Both hind legs had missing hair on the front and inside portions of the legs from the hocks to the
toes. The skin in these areas was red and thickened. The dog's abdomen was slightly reddened with patches of
skin that were rough and thickened. The dog repeatedly scratched her abdomen during the inspection to the point
of producing blood next to one teat. The dog also repeatedly shook her head. Inspection of the ears revealed
crusty, blackish material inside the ears, with the right ear being more severely affected. The licensee stated that
the skin condition had been present for months, but not treated by a veterinarian. The ear condition was examined
by a veterinarian in July, 2014 and the owner treated the ears for 3 weeks with an otic solution as prescribed by the
veterinarian. However, the owner had not recognized that the ear condition had returned and was not treating the
ears. Untreated medical conditions can worsen, can be painful, and may be contagious to other dogs in the kennel.
The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian. The licensee must keep records of the diagnosis,
treatment, and follow-up care and must make these records available to the inspector upon request. If the animal's
condition does not resolve during treatment or returns, the licensee must consult a veterinarian for further evaluation
and treatment.
THE DOG MUST BE EVALUATED BY A VETERINARIAN BY FEBRUARY 12, 2015.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
