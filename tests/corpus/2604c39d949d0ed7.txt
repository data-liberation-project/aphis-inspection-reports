MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on15-Nov-16 at 1:00 PM.
The inspector arrived on campus at 1:00 PM on 11/15/16 to conduct an inspection but both of the individuals
authorized to accompany the inspector were not in their office. The inspector tried to contact them by text message
and e-mail then waited for 30 minutes for a reply. A reply by telephone confirmed that both of authorized individuals
were teaching classes and would not be available until later that day.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other authorized facility
representative available to accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA
are required to assess the facility.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection. Report delivered by e-mail 11/17/16.
