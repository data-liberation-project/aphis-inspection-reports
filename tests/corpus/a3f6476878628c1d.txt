2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- Five wolf hybrid cubs were being kept in an enclosure near the petting zoo area. There is no public barrier for this
enclosure, and no park attendant was close enough to monitor these animals and zoo visitors. The cubs are
approximately 3 months old. Without an attendant or a public barrier, it is possible for members of the public to
have physical contact with these animals through the chain link enclosure fence. This is a potential source of injury,
both to the animals and to members of the public. The facility must construct an appropriate public barrier for this
enclosure, or must have an attendant present any time members of the public are in the walk through area of the
facility. The licensee did bring an attendant to the enclosure at the time of inspection.
Correct from this point forward.
This was a focused inspection in response to an official complaint.
