2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A current/updated written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available for inspection. In order to comply
with this section of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) a written PVC must be in place and available for inspection at all
times. Under formal arrangements, as directed by the AWA, the establishment must have an updated PVC by the
current Attending Veterinarian (AV). Also, the establishment must ensure the AV conducts regularly scheduled
visits to the premises where regulated animals are kept. To ensure adequate veterinary medical care to regulated
animals, a current/updated PVC must be readily available for inspection, and at a minimum, the AV must visit the
establishment's premises once per year.
