**At least 4 of the adult dogs at the facility were identified as having excessively long toe nails; female MC#
4B09654D55, Male MC# 0A02227007, Female MC# 032849359, Male MC# 0A0155020. The female MC
identification # 4B09654D55 had extremely long nails that curled to the side of her digits. Excessively long toenails
can become entrapped and torn or can result in abnormally positioned toes, which is painful. The licensee must
establish an effective program of toenail maintenance.

**A puppy with the identification # 15279 was unresponsive and lying curled up in its enclosure. This puppy along
with its 3 litter mates identification # (cid:24)s 15280, 15281, 15282 were evaluated by a veterinarian during a routine 7
week check-up on October 14, 2015. The veterinarian verbally confirmed to the inspector that the puppies were in
acceptable health at the time of their appointment; (cid:28)they displayed a slight decrease in appetite and a small amount
of clear nasal discharge(cid:29), which the veterinarian did not find uncommon for puppies of that life-stage. The puppies
were administered a routine regimen of "(cid:28)parvo mix(cid:29)" and Zithromiacin, which the licensee made record of providing
from 10/14-10/18. One of the puppies, identification # 15282 died; the licensee could not provide the date of death.
The licensee did not consult with a veterinarian concerning the change in health, resulting in death of this puppy
(#15282) or the shared symptoms and deterioration in condition of the second puppy (#15279) which was observed
in distress during the inspection. Direct and frequent communication of an animal(cid:25)s health and behavior in
conjunction with formal examinations by a licensed veterinarian are required to provide adequate and timely
diagnosis and veterinary care.
Inspectors requested that the licensee have the sick puppy evaluated by a licensed veterinarian to obtain a
diagnosis and treatment plan, and that a written record of the visit be made available during the next inspection.
Note: the licensee made an appointment with the attending veterinarian and departed directly following the
inspection on October 22, 2015.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee and an inspector with MoDA.
