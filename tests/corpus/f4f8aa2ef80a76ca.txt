Watering.
The water trough for the goat is not being maintained in a clean and sanitary manner. There is a collection of leaves and
silt sitting at the bottom of the watering trough. Green algae is growing on a floater ball in the center of the water. The
water sitting on top of the silt and leaves appeared clear and potable.
Water receptacles that are not kept clean can lead to contaminated drinking water and potential disease or illness.
Correct by February 1, 2022 by ensuring all water receptacles are maintained in a clean and sanitary manner.
