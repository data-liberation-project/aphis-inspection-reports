SANITATION.
Several flies were seen on the cows' legs and goats' legs during the time of inspection. The animals appeared
irritated at times with the flies. The facility is currently using a fly spray on the animals, but it isn't completely
deterring the flies. A single fly jar that was hanging from the ceiling in the oldest animal barn. The fly jar was old,
covered in black fly spots, and was no longer effective. There were no other provisions to control the flies at the
facility. Flies carry and spread disease.
Implement and maintain provisions that will effectively control the fly population to promote animal health.
