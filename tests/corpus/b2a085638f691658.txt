2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Since the last inspection, the new attending veterinarian has visited the facility for a formally scheduled visit to the
premises and has signed a written program of veterinary care. However the written program of veterinary care does
not include all species currently at the facility (zebu and bison) and does not include pertinent details regarding the
veterinary care of the animals. There is no information about what dosages or frequency of administration are
recommended for the few drugs and vaccines listed. There is no information as to parasite control methods, capture
methods or TB testing for the exotic species. There is no information included regarding vaccinations, parasite
control methods, emergency care or euthanasia of the domestic species. The facility shall ensure that there is a
complete written program of veterinary care approved by the attending veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility keeps a few animals year round and acquires other animals for the fall exhibit season only with
disposition of the animals once the exhibit season is over. Acquisition and disposition records for the animals
currently at the facility and those exhibited last season are not complete. The facility lacks a system for keeping the
required records. Some animals currently present or exhibited last season have no recorded acquisition and/or
disposition information. For other animals, the information recorded is not complete. The facility shall make and
keep records for all animals acquired and disposed of that includes all the required information.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The new attending veterinarian has signed a written environment enhancement program that is not complete. It
does not include all the non-human primate species currently at the facility (snow macaque), does not cover all
special considerations currently in place at the facility (isolated spider monkey) and lacks species specific
recommendations for socalization and environmental enrichment. Non-human primates are highly social animals
whose psychologically well-being, to include socialization, environmental enrichment and special considerations,needs to be cared for in order to ensure their overall well-being. Under the direction of the attending veterinarian
and in accordance with accepted professional standards, the facility shall develop, document and follow an
appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of the non-human
primates.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Since the last inspection there have been no changes to any perimeter fencing and the owner states that no
amended variance request has been submitted to the Regional Office. The facility currently has a perimeter fence
variance for four species (macaque, lemur, kangaroo, camel). The facility has added the following species: zebra,
bison, cavy, deer and African Crested porcupines. A secondary perimeter fence is required to ensure that the
animals are not injured/distressed by outside animals/wildlife/humans and to act as a secondary containment
system in case of escape. The housing facilities for all the outdoor non-farm animal species exhibited must be
enclosed by a secondary perimeter fence of at least 6 ft height or an addition to the current variance needs to be
obtained.
The veterinary care citation 2.40(b)(2) from previous inspection is corrected-animals are no longer at the facility.
Inspection conducted with owner. Exit conducted with owner and assistants.
