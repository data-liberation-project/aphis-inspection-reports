2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A female, red King Charles Cavalier ("Pickles" no ID#) had sores with missing hair on the top of three paws. The
rear right paw had an open wound (approximately 1 inch long), oozing a small amount of clear discharge. The
licensee stated the dog was not under any treatment at the time of inspection and had no medical records
documenting the condition of the dog's paws. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian by 26 April
2014 to determine an appropriate treatment plan for "Pickles".
* A female Shih Tzu (#0A02340836), had clumped, matted hair on her face, in front of her eyes and dangling off
her face.
* A brown and white,female Shih Tzu (#070-580-340) had a golf ball size of matted hair hanging on the side of her
muzzle. She also had matted hair that dangled over and adhered to her nose.
Matted hair which is being pulled away from the skin is likely to be painful and can interfere with sight and eating.
This matted hair was hardened and in close proximity to the eyes, and could therefore easily scrape the eye and
possibly cause an ulcer. The licensee must remove the matted hair from these dogs and ensure that excessive hair
matting does not occur.
* The licensee had one bottle of expired medication (Strongid expired 1/2014). This expired medication was
intermingled with other medications and was available for use on all the dogs. Expired medications may not be
effective and could even be harmful to the animals. The licensee must ensure that no expired medications are
administered to the animals.
2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* The licensee is currently using microchips to identify the animals. During the inspection, seven dogs were
scanned. Four of those dogs (male red Pomeranian, female Shih Tzu, female red King Charles Cavalier, and a
female blenheim and white King Charles Cavalier) did not have a microchip which could be read by the licensee'sscanners.
Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate
record keeping requirements. The licensee must ensure all dogs are identified by an official tag, a tattoo approved
by the Administrator, or a microchip.
2.75(a)(1)(6)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* The APHIS Form 7005 (Record of Acquisition) was not updated properly. The licensee indicated that many of the
dogs had recently been re-microchipped, however the current/correct microchip number was not recorded on the
form. For example, a male Yorkshire Terrier had a microchip that scanned as 445D65542D however the APHIS
Form 7005 indicated that the dog's microchip number was 073-424-117. The licensee must maintain records or
forms which fully and correctly disclose information concerning each dog to allow for individual and accurate
identification.
* To be corrected by: 5/21/14
3.6(c)(1)(3) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(c) Additional requirements for dogs--(1) Space.
* A male, red Pomeranian was in an enclosure which only provided him with 3 inches of head space.
* A female, red Pomeranian with puppies, was in an enclosure which only provided her with 4 inches of head space.
* A female, black Cocker Spaniel with puppies, was in an enclosure which only provided her with 3 1/2 inches of
head space.
Dogs need six inches of head space for their well-being and to be able to make normal postural movements. The
licensee must ensure that the interior height of each enclosure is at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest
dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
* There were at least five enclosures (housing 14 dogs total) that had more than one day's worth of feces in them. Some of the feces were hard and dried with a white appearance. The licensee stated that she did not remove the
excreta from the enclosures the previous day. A build-up of fecal material in the enclosures poses a health risk for
the animals and can result in them easily becoming soiled. The licensee must ensure that excreta is removed from
primary enclosures daily.
3.11(b)(1)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(b) Sanitization of primary enclosures and food and water receptacles.
* A red, male Pomeranian was placed into an empty enclosure that still had an accumulation of dried feces in it from
the previous dog housed in the enclosure. Enclosures which are not properly cleaned and sanitized between use
by different dogs pose a risk for disease transmission. All enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized prior to
housing another dog to help prevent the spread of disease.
** To be corrected: Immediately. The licensee was instructed of the correction deadline at the verbal exit interview
on 21 April 2014.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(b) Sanitization of primary enclosures and food and water receptacles.
* There were multiple enclosures (affecting nine dogs) in the sheltered building which had an excessive build-up of
fecal material, hair, and grime on the bars of the door, and along the edges of the enclosure, indicating these
surfaces are not getting properly cleaned and sanitized. In an outdoor hutch-type shelter (containing two dogs) there
was dirt, dust and cobwebs in the interior portion of the enclosure. There were also several dog doors and the
flashing around them which had a build-up of dirt and grime on them. Surfaces in contact with the dogs which are
not properly cleaned and sanitized pose a health hazard for the dogs. The licensee must ensure primary enclosures
are sanitized at least once every two weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris,
excreta, and other disease hazards.
The inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted with a facility representative on April 21, 2014.Additional Inspectors
