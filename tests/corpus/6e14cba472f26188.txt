2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
No current written formal arrangements with an attending veterinarian could be provided during the inspection. The
licensee stated she had it but did not know where it was. Formal arrangements with an attending veterinarian must be
written, approved and followed to ensure that adequate husbandry practices are in place and being conducted in a
manner which is satisfactory to both parties.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of the inspection the licensee indicated that she was administering a deworming schedule on an as needed
basis, as opposed to the schedule directed by her Attending Veterinarian (AV). Failure to follow the directions of the AV
could negatively impact the health and well-being of the animals. Each dealer shall assure that the AV has appropriate
authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care
and use.
2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).


An expired (September 2022) bottle of Safeguard dewormer was being used to treat the cats for internal parasites.
Usage of expired medication can lower the efficacy of said drug, prevent treatment, and prolong illness.

There was a female adult Asian Leopard cat (microchip ID #: 933000320250935) in the cattery that was displaying ocular
issues in the left eye, where she was squinting, had a moderate amount of clear discharge, showed sensitivity to light,
and there was an accumulation of black crust about a quarter of an inch below the eye. The licensee was unaware of her
condition. There was also an enclosure housing three Bengal kittens in the living room of the home where one of the
kittens had diarrhea (the color and consistency of melted chocolate), another had a slightly rounder abdomen than
normal, and the other had a thin body condition (body condition score was 2.5/9 – including sunken flanks; prominent
spinal processes, shoulder blades, and hip bones; and a mild distended abdomen; microchip #: 985141005230533)
despite a seemingly healthy appetite, that the licensee was aware of but had yet to address with her Attending
Veterinarian (AV). Lack of an adequate assessment of the health and well-being of the animals delay the onset of
diagnosing and treating ailments and can consequently lead to unnecessary suffering.

Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. In addition, all four cats need to be examined by a
veterinarian.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors


No records could be provided during the inspection which disclose acquisition information for any of the animals on the
property or any that have perished in the past, including adults and kittens. At the time of inspection there was also a litter
of kittens that were born on the premises, but the licensee did not have the required paperwork documenting their birth.
Without proper documentation of animals associated with the facility both past and present, there is no way to adequately
track animal movement, nor ascertain if any abnormality in animal births or deaths are present. Each dealer shall make,
keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information under this section concerning each
cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned held, or otherwise in his/her possession or under his/her control, or which is
transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer, including any offspring born of any animal while in
his/her possession or under his/her control. Furthermore, each dealer shall use Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats
On Hand (APHIS Form 7005) and Records of Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS Form 7006) to make, keep, and
mantain the information required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
3.1(a) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
Animal enclosures must protect the animals from injury. The licensee currently has several cages with heating pads that
have electric cords exposed to the cats. The cats could easily chew on these cords and be electrocuted or swallow a
piece of the cord or pad. The pads need to be removed or the cords and pads need to be covered in a manner that
prevents the pads and cords from being chewed on. Housing facilities for cats must be designed and constructed in a
manner that protects the animals from injury.
3.1(e) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
At the time of inspection, some of the cat food and litter were being stored on the floor throughout the premises. The
buckets containing litter did not have a tightly fitting lid. Storing food and litter in such a manner can lead to spoilage,


contamination, and allows vermin direct access. Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects
the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away
from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. All open supplies of food and bedding must be kept
in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.
3.11(b)(3)(iii) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Many of the metal cages - that were approximately 12” x 48” – in addition to the other primary enclosures had a large
amount of grime, organic matter (hair and cat litter), and mineral deposits built up along the edges/perimeter of the
enclosure, and cage bars. The licensee stated she does not deep clean and sanitize the enclosures as frequently as she
should. Inadequate cleaning and sanitization can foster poor health conditions that negatively impact the well-being of the
animals contained therein. Hard surfaces of primary enclosures must be sanitized, and all soiled surfaces must be
washed with appropriate products (i.e., disinfectants and detergents) with a thorough cleaning of the surfaces to remove
organic material, so as to remove all organic material and mineral buildup, and to provide sanitization.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
