well-being of the animals.

located so as contact with the dog in the enclosure is unlikely, but possible and could cause injury to the animal in
the enclosure. The wire points must be removed and maintained. All enclosures must be free of sharp points or
jagged edges that could injure the dogs. To be corrected by: 03-14-14.
