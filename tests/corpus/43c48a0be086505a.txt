3.1(c)(3) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The indoor facility housing cats has accumulations of dust and cat hair along the walls, and dirt and debris on the
windowsills and blinds. There is also a large volume of spilled litter and debris covering the floor under and around the
enclosures.
Having excessive dirt and debris can lead to increased risks of disease or illness.
Correct by cleaning and sanitizing all surfaces of housing facilities to maintain generally accepted husbandry standards
and in accordance with 3.11(c) to maintain all animals’ health and well-being.
3.2(d) Repeat

Indoor housing facilities.
The indoor facility housing cats has areas of the wall that are not impervious to moisture. Large areas of paint have been
peeled off the walls, removing the protective and impermeable outer layer and exposing absorbent material below.
Absorbent materials do not allow for adequate cleaning and sanitation of the room.
Ensuring surfaces are capable of being adequately cleaned and sanitized is critical for eliminating disease risks.
Correct by ensuring all floors, walls, and ceilings of indoor housing facilities are impervious to moisture.
3.4(c) Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.


Two of the three outdoor cat enclosures are constructed with wood permeable to moisture and cannot be properly
cleaned or sanitized. One of the enclosures is constructed and framed with unsealed wood. The enclosed shelter box and
wooden ramp are also constructed out of unsealed wood. The second enclosure with a corresponding shelter box and
resting platform is constructed with a mixture of painted and unsealed wood. Surfaces permeable to moisture cannot be
properly cleaned and/or sanitized as contaminated material can penetrate into the surfaces. In addition, these structures
and items are not designed or constructed in a way that they can be easily removed once they become worn or soiled.
Having surfaces in contact with the animals that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized can expose the cats to
unnecessary disease hazards.
Correct by ensuring that all enclosures, den boxes and furniture type fixtures are designed and constructed of materials
that are impervious to moisture and able to be properly cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced once they become
worn or soiled.
3.11(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Excreta is not being removed from the outdoor cat primary enclosures daily or frequently enough from the indoor cat
enclosures to reduce disease hazards and odors. All three outdoor cat enclosures, housing a total of 9 adult cats, have
large accumulations of excreta mixed in with the mulch and dirt floor. Most of the feces present are dry and did not occur
within the last 24 hours. Inside, there are three cat enclosures, two housing adults and one with kittens. All litter boxes
had accumulations of urine and feces. According to the licensee, litter boxes are cleaned daily and completely dumped at
least every other day. However, upon entering the room, a strong odor of excrement was immediately detected by
inspectors.
Excreta and food waste accumulation inside primary enclosures can lead to increased disease hazards or discomfort for
the animals, odors, and/or attract unwanted pests.


Correct by removing excreta and food waste daily from primary enclosures or as often as necessary to prevent the
excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the cats in the primary enclosure, and to reduce
disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
3.11(b) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Enclosures for the domestic cats are not being sanitized once every two weeks. The two, wooden, outdoor cat
enclosures have multiple surfaces such as the ladder ramps, surrounding wood of the hide box, walls, and shelves that
are discolored yellowish-brown and have accumulation of brown debris. The ceilings in the shelter boxes and enclosures
have collections of dust and fur. The plastic carriers and furniture within all three outdoor enclosures are covered in dirt
and discolored. Inside, all three cat enclosures have dried accumulations of debris and dirt covering the horizontal and
vertical bars in the corners where the cage wall meets the floor. On inspection this coating was scraped away with a
fingernail.
Infrequent and improper sanitation of primary enclosures exposes the animals to unnecessary disease hazards, odors,
insects and pests. Adequate cleaning and sanitization are critical for eliminating disease risks.
Correct by sealing all wood surfaces, cleaning, and sanitizing all primary enclosures at least once every 2 weeks and
using one of the approved methods listed in 3.11(b)(3).
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Three fox enclosures remain in disrepair and continue to pose a risk of injury to the animals inside. Along the back fence
the wooden red fox enclosure, the fennec fox enclosure directly adjacent to the pig enclosure, and the kit fox enclosure
have gaps in the flooring that could cause an animal to injure themselves or become entrapped. The floors of the
enclosures are comprised of either wire mesh or concrete paving stones. In all of the enclosures, the dirt has eroded out


from underneath the flooring, leaving wire mesh exposed or causing the concrete pavers to shift, creating gaps in the
flooring. In the red fox enclosure, concrete pavers have shifted exposing cracks around 1-2” wide along the front of the
enclosure. In the fennec fox enclosure, along the left and right walls, the underlying dirt has shifted, causing the wire
bottom of the enclosure to become exposed. The wire mesh in the enclosure is approximately 1” x 1.5” and large enough
for a smaller paw to fall through. In the kit fox enclosure, the floor has eroded directly underneath the food and water dish,
leaving behind wire mesh suspended over a hole. At the time of inspection new leaves and pine needles were lying on top
of the mesh but the erosion underneath the flooring had not been fixed. The wire mesh in the kit fox enclosure is
approximately 1” x 1” and the exposed area is approximately 6-7” wide and 1.5’ long.
Flooring with gaps, exposed wire mesh with openings larger than the animal’s paw, and unstable cement pavers can
cause serious injuries and pose a risk of entrapment.
Correct by ensuring all enclosures are structurally sound and are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and contain the animals.
3.125(d) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Food waste, trash, and debris are present in both red fox enclosures. The metal red fox enclosure along the side fence
contains multiple torn and shredded pieces of plastic tarp from the tarps surrounding the enclosure. There is also trash
and debris present in the wooden red fox enclosure.
Trash and debris inside primary enclosures can lead to increased risk of injury and illness from potential ingestion or
entrapment, and can also attract pests and vermin.
Correct by ensuring waste and debris is removed and disposed of from primary enclosures to minimize risk of injury,
illness and/or disease.
3.131(a) Direct Repeat



Sanitation.
There are excessive amounts of feces present in the Patagonian cavy enclosure and both red fox enclosures. The
Patagonian cavy enclosure has accumulations of feces that cover the majority of the floor, making it nearly impossible to
avoid sitting on, walking on, or otherwise encountering feces. In the front right corner there is a pile of fresh shavings that
have been added on top of the contaminated floor for extra warmth. The cavy consistently preferred this area of the
enclosure to lie down. The plastic food bucket is placed on the ground and frequently knocked over, mixing the food with
the feces. The dirt floor of both red fox enclosures is compromised of a mix of dirt, feces, debris, trash, fur, and mulch.
There is no clear area of flooring that doesn’t contain this mixture, which doesn’t allow the foxes to avoid their own
excreta.
Large volumes of fecal matter and waste that animals cannot avoid in their primary enclosure can lead to soiling of the
animal and act as source of odor and serious disease hazards which are detrimental to the animal’s health.
Correct by removing excreta from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained within and to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
