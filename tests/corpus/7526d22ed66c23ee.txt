RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are multiple inventory/Acquisition records that are incomplete with missing 'sold dates' and missing animals
that are in the facility, however they have not been added on the inventory and there is no record of where the
animals was gotten from. There are several Disposition records that are missing the dates of sale, 'buyer' addresses
and puppy/dog ID numbers.
Complete paperwork is required for proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.
The licensee must keep complete and up to date records of ALL regulated animals that come into the facility on the
Acquisition/Inventory 7005 records. And, there must be complete and thorough Disposition 7006 records maintained
for every animal that is sold, transferred, traded or given away that leaves the facility.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are 5 primary enclosures that have a wood paneling for walls that have been chewed in multiple places. The
chewed walls have been open in some areas to expose the 2x4 framing, which has also been chewed. The chewed
wood does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of the surfaces that come in contact with the regulated
animals.
Chewed wood can be a source of possible injury due to splinters getting into the gums, mouth and digestive tract.
Also, chewed, unsealed surfaces does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of the primary enclosure.
Chewed surfaces can hold bacteria and possible health issues.
The licensee needs to replace or repair any chewed or broken surface in the primary enclosure.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Currently the primary enclosures and food bowls are only being sanitized once per month, with occasional every 3
weeks. There is a large accumulation of dust on the top of the pen dividers, and on the heating lamps in the facility.
There is some buildup of brown grime on 2 of the food bowls and inside door flaps.
The lack of frequent sanitizing and thorough cleaning of the facility at least every 2 weeks can create a buildup of
dirt and grime and dust that can be a source of bacteria that can be a possible health issue for the animals.
The licensee must increase the sanitizing of the primary enclosure surfaces and food/water sources to at least once
every 2 weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt, grime and dust.
