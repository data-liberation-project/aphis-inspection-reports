FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The enclosure housing one male fox (outside of the perimeter fence) has at least 2 areas where the buried
flooring has been significantly uncovered or the ground has eroded. These areas are no longer a solid walking
surface for the fox and are also a potential injury hazard for the legs/feet of the animal. Correct this by repairing or
replacing this area and ensuring all animal enclosures are maintained to properly contain the animals and protect
them from injury.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***One male fox is being housed in an enclosure outside of the facility perimeter fence. The licensee stated that this
was a temporary area for this animal and that they plan to move the entire enclosure inside the existing perimeter
fence. Currently, this enclosure does not have adequate secondary containment to keep unwanted persons and
animals out or to act as a secondary barrier should the fox get out of the enclosure. Correct this by providing an
adequate perimeter fence for all animal enclosures.

SANITATION.
*** The area behind the enclosure outside of the perimeter fence has many items that need to be removed and
discarded or placed in a suitable storage area. There are building materials, extra caging supplies, and other
miscellaneous items in this area. This area is a potential breeding ground for pests and does not satisfy the
acceptable standards for cleanliness. Correct this by cleaning this area, and removing items not needed for animal
husbandry.
