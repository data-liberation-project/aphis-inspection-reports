3.25(d) Repeat

Facilities, general.
In the southwest corner of the building there were empty feed bags stacked next to an enclosure with guinea pigs in it and
the east half of the building where guinea pigs aren't housed but in the same room there were empty bags, soiled bedding
and other waste material. Piles of old waste material and trash around the space for guinea pigs creates areas for pests
to live and could create disease hazards. Ensure that trash, waste and soiled bedding is removed promptly away from
animal housing areas to decrease risk of vermin/pest infestation, odors, and disease hazards.
3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
10 enclosures had a build-up of wet soiled bedding by the watering valve. Wet soiled bedding could cause discomfort or
cause guinea pigs to get sick. Ensure that enclosures are cleaned and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or more
often in order to prevent any build-up of wet soiled material.
