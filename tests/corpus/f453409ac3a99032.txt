FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The enclosure housing the alpaca contains a shelter with damaged metal panels on the front and rear north side.
The damaged areas have holes and jagged pieces of metal that are not out of reach to the alpaca. Sharp metal
edges have potential to cause injury to the animal.
*The enclosure housing the sheep and goats has a large metal free standing round bale feeder that is excessively
rusted with resulting damage to the metal. Multiple bars on the sides of the feeder have broken contacts on the
ends. The exposed ends of the bars are sharp enough to cause potential injury to the animals. The rounded rim at
the top of the feeder is completely rusted through with multiple holes and flaking metal pieces. The feeder was filled
with hay and animals were observed eating and climbing on the feeder during this inspection.
Outdoor housing facilities and furnishings shall be structurally sound and kept in good repair to protect the animals
from injury. The damaged feeder and shelter should be repaired or replaced. Correct by: May 11, 2019.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with a family member.
