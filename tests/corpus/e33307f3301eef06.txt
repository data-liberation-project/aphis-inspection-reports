Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility does not have medical records for the dogs. Medical records are necessary for APHIS officials to ensure that
animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Facilities must keep copies of medical records for dogs and have them available during inspections. The licensee shall
ensure that medical records are maintained for all aspects of veterinary care to include vaccinations and examinations.
To be corrected: from this time forward

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
