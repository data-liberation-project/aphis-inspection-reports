ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In an animal treatment room, six unlabeled 3cc syringes of an unknown solution were being stored in a drawer.
According to the clinical veterinarian, the syringes contained saline solution from the liter bag adjacent to the
syringes. Without proper labeling of the syringes, there may unintended use of the contents of them.
Furthermore, in a locked, controlled drug cabinet, there was a 3cc syringe which was labeled (cid:28)Ketamine/Xylazine(cid:29)
however no indication from which bottle of Ketamine it was drawn from and no expiration date was included for the
medication in this syringe.
Medical items intended for animal use should be properly labeled.
Corrected at time of inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
