2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
One Boston Terrier Microchip #0A02184332 has a cloudy film over its left eye and the fur around the eye is wet.
The licensee is currently treating the eye with a Neomycin cream under the guidance of his attending veterinarian,
however there are no written instructions from the attending veterinarian which states directions of use, methods,
dosages, length of treatment, etc.
There is a self mixed bottle of Alcohol and Ivomectin, and a self mixed bottle of Ivomectin and Mineral Oil in the
kennel area. Though some of these ingredients have expiration dates, there are none listed on the bottles, so there
is no way to prove how old the mixtures are.
Using medical products incorrectly or after they have expired can cause serious side effects, or may not work as
originally intended. The Licensee must have clear written instructions on how and when to use medications that
have been directed for use by the veterinarian, and all medications must have clearly annotated expiration dates to
ensure that the medication is still able to be used efficiently.
Exit interview was conducted with the undersigned individual.
