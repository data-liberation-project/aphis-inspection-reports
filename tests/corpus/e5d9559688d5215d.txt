3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
We observed the facility has replaced and repaired many enclosures and some feeders and the facility reports checking
enclosures weekly, however some remain in need of repair or replacing: At least nine feeders were in disrepair during the
time of inspection. The feeders had rusted, sharp and rough edges exposed to the animals. Seven enclosures' wire
floors were in disrepair during the time of inspection. The affected floors had missing and/or broken wires with sharp
points exposed to the animals. Sharp metal points and rough edges could potentially injure the animals**.


Ensure that affected feeders are repaired or replaced and repair/replace the affected enclosures prior to using them
again.


**Note: The chinchillas in the enclosures with broken wires were moved by the licensee to different enclosure during the
time of inspection.
2.40(b)(3) Direct Repeat



Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee had identified at least 8 chinchillas with eye problems and had them on the treatment plan prior to
inspection, however, we observed and pointed out two chinchillas that had eye problems that had not previously been
identified and weren't on the treatment plan: A male (housed in bank 104) chinchilla's left eye was crusted shut and the
eyelids on that side were swollen with some hair loss. Its right eye had some crusting as well.

Indirect Non-compliance:
Grey chinchilla (in 119D); its right eye had some crusting and when handled by the licensee there was some pale
discharge observed around the eyelids.

Eye problems that go un-noticed can worsen and cause pain or if contagious could spread to other animals. Continue to
improve a routine of observing animals daily so that animal health problems can be noticed and treated promptly.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
