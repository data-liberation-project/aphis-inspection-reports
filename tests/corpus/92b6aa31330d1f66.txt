3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Many repairs have been made to the double enclosure fence since the September 2013 inspection. Some new
damage has since occurred. The inner enclosure fence near the Northeast corner is bent and pulled away from the
post and ground creating a substantial gap. Similar damage is apparent to the inner fence near the access road.
Bent, broken, and loose fencing is an injury risk to the animals as well as an escape risk. Housing facilities and
fencing shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair. In addition to correction of deficiencies
noted today, a plan for timely identification and correction of facility defects shall be developed and maintained.
