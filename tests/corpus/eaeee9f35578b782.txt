3.13(c)(3)
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
A cat traveling on a United flight from Ontario to Kansas City, with a stop in San Francisco was inspected at the
United Cargo office. The waybill number was 016-51451396. On inspection it was discovered that the Owner(cid:25)s
Feeding and Watering Instructions attached to the crate had not been completed. There was no documentation as
to when the animal was last offered food and water, nor as to the feeding and watering instructions for the next 24
hours.
Carriers should not accept dogs and cats for transport unless the consignor certifies in writing to the carrier that the
animal was offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery for transport. This requirement helps to assure
that the animal will receive adequate care during transport. Steps should be taken to ensure that all personnel
accepting animals on behalf of United understand and abide by this requirement.
To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with a United Cargo office representative.
