3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
The primary enclosures for the guinea pigs housed in building 13 are not being sanitized at least once every two weeks.
The husbandry manager stated that the enclosures are cleaned weekly, however, sanitization is only performed every five
weeks. During the inspection, the guinea pigs appeared healthy and the enclosures did not have an accumulation of
excreta or debris.
Failure to sanitize primary enclosures at least once every two weeks can allow for an increase in disease hazards in the
environment and negatively impact the health and well-being of the animals.
Primary enclosures shall be sanitized at least once every two weeks in a manner prescribed in the regulations.
