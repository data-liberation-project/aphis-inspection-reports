ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:20pm on
28-Mar-19.
I arrived at the facility at 12:20pm. I knocked on the door. There was no answer. I tried calling both the home phone
and cell phone listed in the file but there was no answer on either. I left a message on the home phone but was
unable to leave one on the cell phone. I honked my horn several times. I waited for 30 minutes before leaving at
12:55pm.
