Sheltered housing facilities.
The indoor and outdoor cement floors of the facility were sealed prior to pre-license inspection in October. The sealer has
worn off, and the cement is no longer impervious to moisture. Spilled water from the water buckets was noted to sink into
the cement.

The following areas in sheltered housing facilities must be impervious to moisture:
Indoor floor areas in contact with the animals;
Outdoor floor areas in contact with the animals, when the floor areas are not exposed to the direct sun, or are made of a
hard material such as wire, wood, metal, or concrete.

Cement sealer needs to be applied as often as necessary to maintain the floors so that they do not soak up water, feces,
and urine. Sealer maintains the floors so that they can be properly cleaned and sanitized to prevent odors, and disease.
