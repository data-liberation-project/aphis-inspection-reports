2.75(a)(2) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The APHIS forms 7005 maintained by the facility remain incomplete. Cage cards are not being utilized by the
facility as the cats are raised in the home environment. The past four litters have not been recorded on the APHIS
Forms 7005. Licensee started to update the APHIS Forms 7005 since the last inspection, but didn't get very far.
Only one litter is partially recorded. The identification numbers for this litter assigned to the kittens on the 7005s do
not match the ID numbers on the APHIS Forms 7006. It is difficult to determine what animals have been born, sold,
or died without accurate, up to date records. Accurate records are needed to trace animals in the event of a
disease outbreak. APHIS forms 7005 shall be used to make, keep, and maintain the required information.

3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The carpet remains worn between the living room and the family room. The carpet is torn and worn away exposing
the subfloor. The frayed, unraveled edges pose a health hazard for the cats if ingested. Housing facilities must be
kept in good repair.
