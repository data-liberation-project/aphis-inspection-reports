3.14(e)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
The primary enclosures used during motor vehicle transport for two Great Danes (microchip #7018 & #7125) and
one Doberman puppy (microchip #5612) are not large enough to ensure that each animal has enough space to turn
about normally and lie in a natural position. Their heads were touching the top of the kennel when standing on all
four legs, and touching each other when laying down. There is only one kennel for larger puppies on the floor,
however it was already being used and the transporter / care taker and myself did observe warmer temperatures in
this area located at the rear of the vehicle.
