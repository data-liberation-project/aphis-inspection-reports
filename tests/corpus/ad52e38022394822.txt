FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A metal pasture gate was damaged by one of the camels. The bars are bent or broken, with sharp edges and
exposed ends. This gate is an access point to an area with hay and shelter. Animals passing through this broken
gate are at an increased risk of injury. The licensee must repair or replace the gait to help protect the welfare of the
enclosed animals.
