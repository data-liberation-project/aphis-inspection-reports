****An adult female white Chihuahua (MC# 0A01475466) named Light's Linda had a right eye that appeared dull,
dry and 1.5 to 2 times the size of the left eye. The eye also had what looked like a layer of film with hair stuck in a
linear fashion on the central surface of the eye. The iris and pupil could not be visualized with most of the eye
appearing dark grey in color; near the center of the eye there was a light grey circular-like lesion. Also a linear red
vessel-like structure was present near the top left portion of the eye and extended approximately from the center of
the eye to under the eyelid. Redness was also observed in the surrounding white tissue. The licensee stated that a
right eye condition had been noticed in the dog in January 2014 and that he had applied medication to the eye at
the time. However, the dog had not been examined by a veterinarian for its current eye condition nor was it currently
receiving any treatment according to the licensee. The licensee was informed to have this dog evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian by close of business July 11, 2014. Eyes that are dry, reddened and enlarged can result from
injury, illness or a variety of other medical conditions which can be painful and lead to blindness. The licensee must
ensure that treatment instructions from a licensed veterinarian are followed to ensure the health and well-being of
the animals at all times.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****There are two King Charles Spaniels (MC# 0A01480017, MC# 0A01476349) which both have excessive matting
of the fur on/around the ears, front of the chest and down the back legs. Excessive matting causes pain and
discomfort to the animal.
In addition, matting can foster skin infections and can hinder the animal's ability to move and defecate normally.
The licensee needs to remove the matted fur on these dogs. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the
licensee must establish and follow a program of regular coat maintenance for all dogs to prevent development of
excessive matting.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
