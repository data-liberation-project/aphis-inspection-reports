There is currently an abundance of flies inside the kennel area and no active program to eradicate or control them.
Insects and parasites, if uncontrolled, can cause illness or infection in animals, can contaminate food, water, and
bedding. An effective method to control insects and parasites must be created and practiced. Correct by 7/13/2014
