2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1345 on
25-Apr-18. I went to the licensee's house and was not able to get down the driveway as the gate was closed. I
contacted the licensee by phone and left a message. After waiting 30 minutes, I then left the property.
End of report.
