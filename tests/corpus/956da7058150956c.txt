3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The deer enclosure does not contain a shelter that would protect the animals from inclement weather. The inability
to shelter from seasonal winter rains could cause discomfort to the animals and adversely impact their health.
The facility should ensure that deer housed at the facility have access to shelter that will adequately protect them
from inclement weather.
