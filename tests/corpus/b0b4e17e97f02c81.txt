2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection process today, USDA inspector observed a female Pomeranian puppy ID# 5114 that was
coughing and raspy sounding. The licensee acquired the animal on 12/27/2019 from an individual that had
previously treated the animal for an upper respiratory infection, but still appeared to have residual clinical signs.
The licensee’s Program of Veterinarian Care specifically states that “if a puppy does not respond to the first choice
of antibiotic then seek veterinary advice”. Prior to today’s inspection the licensee did not communicate the upper
respiratory issue with his Attending Veterinarian. In communicating with the Attending Veterinarian he confirmed
that the licensee should seek veterinary guidance to develop a treatment plan for this animal and that could take
place on 01/08/2020. If repertory issues remain untreated, they can become increasingly uncomfortable or painful to
the animal. The Licensee must have methods in place to prevent, control and diagnose all health issues.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
