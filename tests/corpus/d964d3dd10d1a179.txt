REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
Animals were being exhibited by the owners in a petting zoo at a county fair without a current USDA License.
Without a USDA license APHIS officials do not have the necessary oversight to ensure compliance with the
applicable regulations. All persons conducting regulated activities must have a valid license at the time of the
activities.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owners and ACI Bartels.
