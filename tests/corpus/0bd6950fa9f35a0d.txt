3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements. (4) Contain clean, dry bedding.
***In the outdoor facility where small breed dogs were housed, the bedding in the housing units varied from partially
covering the floor to approximately 4" deep. One housing unit contained bedding that covered most of the flooring,
yet had a large amount of dried, molded feces in it. Small breeds including Yorkshire Terriers were seen
intermittently shivering and holding front paws up for short periods of time interchangeably within these primary
enclosures. The ambient temperature was 11 degrees F at the beginning of the inspection. The lack of appropriate
amount of bedding in cold environments increases the risks of illness, discomfort and hypothermic situations to the
animals. The licensee must add more bedding material to the housing units, clean the housing unit that contains the
feces and assure that the appropriate amount of clean, dry bedding is provided in the outdoor housing units during
extreme cold events.
To be corrected from this day forward.
This inspection began at 0800.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.
