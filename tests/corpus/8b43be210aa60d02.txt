SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The indoor portion of the sheltered facility housing English Bulldog adults and puppies measured 91-94.1 degrees F
(varying by area of the facility) at dog level at 3pm. The temperature outside the kennel was 94.1 degrees F. The
licensee had three large fans running in the facility but had not started use of the mister system previously used to
aid in cooling the facility. All of the dogs in the facility were panting heavily including two weaned puppies that had
been removed from the climate controlled whelping room within the week. One of the adult males displayed rapid
respirations and appeared restless as he moved to different areas of his enclosure to lay. The licensee was
instructed to implement immediate cooling methods by supplying additional cool, fresh water and use of the mister
cooling system. The temperature was reevaluated after the misters were in use for 30 minutes at which it time it
measured 90 degrees F and the dogs resumed normal activity and stopped panting heavily. Heat stress can lead to
serious health complications and may lead to death. The licensee shall ensure that the sheltered part of housing
facility is sufficiently cooled to protect the dogs from temperature or humidity extremes and to provide for their health
and well-being. The ambient temperature must not must not rise above 85 degrees F for more than 4 consecutive
hours when dogs are present. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 6/21/2016
