2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***One male goat and one female alpaca (Padme) have excessively overgrown hooves. The goat had toes that
were curling abnormally as a result of not having routine hoof trimming.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries.
As part of the facility’s program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive
appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
Both animals received hoof care at the time of the inspection.
***The facility’s Program of Veterinary Care indicates that all sheep and goats must receive Clostridium perfringens
types C, D, and Tetanus vaccinations annually. The licensee stated that she vaccinates the sheep and goats
annually, rather than the veterinarian. However, the licensee was unable to provide documentation at the time of
inspection showing that the animals have been receiving their annual vaccinations.
The licensee must follow the treatment protocols indicated on the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) and ensure
that all animals are treated appropriately, as per the attending veterinarian’s written guidance on the PVC. Not
following the plan as described on the PVC reduces the veterinarian's ability to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinary care.
The licensee must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated in a
timely manner by a veterinarian as part of the facility’s program of adequate veterinary care and that the facility use
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries at all times. Additionally,
veterinary and behavioral observations and evaluations by the veterinarian and facility staff must be documented
and readily available to APHIS upon request and include sufficient detail to demonstrate the provision of adequate
veterinary care.3.131(a)
SANITATION.
***In the enclosure housing 23 goats,18 sheep, 2 alpacas, and 1 llama, there was an excessive accumulation of
feces on the ground. Due to the accumulation of feces the animals could not stand or lay in their enclosure without
becoming contaminated by the waste material. In the indoor portion of the enclosure, there was a strong odor of
ammonia and the entire floor was moist. Approximately one-third of the outdoor enclosure consisted of wet ground
and mud. There was a pool of standing water along the side of the barn and multiple puddles of urine throughout
the enclosure.
Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards, to
reduce disease transmission, and to prevent the animals from becoming contaminated or soiled.
The licensee must ensure that excreta be removed from primary enclosures and ensure that all enclosures housing
animals are cleaned as often as necessary to promote appropriate husbandry standards.
To be corrected by: April 6, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
