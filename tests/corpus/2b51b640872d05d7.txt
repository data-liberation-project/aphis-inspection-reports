HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an accumulation of dirt, rocks and food on the floors of the outdoor dog shelters. Infrequent cleaning of
hard surfaces in contact with the dogs can lead to an increase in disease transmission. All hard surfaces in contact
with the dogs must be spot-cleaned on a daily basis and sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b) to reduce disease
hazards. Correct by 1 October 2015.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The wooden floor of one outdoor dog shelter has worn away exposing the ground beneath it. Also there is an
approximate 2"X3" hole in the front of this dog shelter. This shelter may not provide adequate protection from the

maintained on a regular basis. Correct by 24 October 2015.
