HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The camel had a lead chain (approx 3") hanging from the halter. This chain can pose a risk of entrapment and
injury if it should get entangled on something within the exhibit.
This chain should only be attached right before the camel is to be taken on a lead and only under supervision of a
qualified animal handler.
This was corrected after it was observed during the inspection. No further correction is necessary at this time.
The exit interview was conducted with the designated contact person.
