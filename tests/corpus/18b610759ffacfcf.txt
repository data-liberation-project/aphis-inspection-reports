2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee did not perform adequate daily observations on the 13-year-old female rabbit that was observed with
diarrhea and did not have the rabbit seen by their attending veterinarian or communicate all past medical issues. The
rabbit had a large amount of fecal matter stuck to her butt which caused her to have an abnormal hop. Soft watery fecal
matter was observed in the center of the hard dried clumps of feces around her butt. When the dried feces was cleaned
off, it exposed a large area of hair loss and the visible skin was red and inflamed with cloudy purulent discharge in some
areas. Also, the rabbit was seen with an approximately 1.5 x 2.5 inch hairless area on the neck just behind the ears. The
visible skin was pink and there were scabs covering some healed wounds.

The licensee said she contacted her veterinarian about a month ago regarding this rabbit potentially having ear mites and
bought an over-the-counter ear mite treatment. The attending veterinarian was contacted during the inspection and
verified the licensee contacted her about ear mites and made a recommendation for treatment but had never seen this
rabbit for the possible ear mite issue or for other medical issues. The licensee failed to contact their attending veterinarian
to seek proper diagnosis and treatments. It is the responsibility of the licensee to contact the attending veterinarian so
he/she can provide adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.



Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being are
recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior must be
conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate care. Failure to
properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and the increase risk of
development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily observations of all animals to
ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the
attending veterinarian.

Handling of animals.
The public is permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures and feed the animals with food that is on the premises.
At that time of inspection, visitors were seen petting and feeding the goats without an attendant present. The visitors were
also petting a goat that escaped from the primary enclosure. The attendant failed to supervise the visitors’ interaction with
the animals. Unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals. The licensee must
ensure that during periods of public exhibition, a responsible, knowledgeable employee or attendant is present at all times
during periods of public contact.

Sanitation.
In an enclosure housing three adult female rabbits, four tortoises, two Patagonian cavies, and one Brazilian agouti there
was an excessive accumulation of excreta on the floor where the rabbits were sitting, under the cages, and caked on


along the side of the wall. Some areas of the flooring were stained with a brown/red color. The accumulation of excreta
and unclean enclosures can result in illness and discomfort thus having the potential to negatively impact the well-being of
the rabbits. Primary enclosures must be kept reasonably free of excreta, hair, and other debris by periodic cleaning.

Classification and separation.
***The 13-year-old female rabbit had an approximately 1.5 x 2.5 inch hairless area on the neck just behind the ears. The
visible skin was pink and there were scabs covering some healed wounds. The licensee stated this was a healing wound
due to another female rabbit fighting with it when it was reintroduced into the enclosure earlier this month after it was
separated for a few weeks getting treatment for ear mites. Animals housed in the same primary enclosures shall be
maintained in compatible groups and should not be housed with other animals that interfere with their health or cause
them discomfort.
***In an enclosure housing three adult female rabbits, four tortoises, two Patagonian cavies, and one Brazilian agouti,
there was unapproved co-mingling of species. In another enclosure housing one male adult rabbit, one baby warthog, two
Patagonian cavies, one Chacoan mara, and several birds of varying sizes, there was unapproved co-mingling of species.
Rabbits should not be housed with other species due to susceptibility and possible transmission of diseases between
species and risk of injury to the rabbits. Rabbits shall not be housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species
of animals unless required for scientific reasons.

By the end of the inspection the licensee put the rabbits into separate cages, with the except of the two female rabbits that
were not fighting.

Facilities, general.
During the inspection a 3-month-old male goat name Houdini was outside of his enclosure and getting pet by visitors of
the facility. The licensee stated Houdini routinely escapes from his enclosure through possible gaps in the horizontal
wooden fence panels. Enclosures for all animals must be constructed in a manner so that they contain the animals
securely, in order to protect the animals from injury. The facility should monitor all enclosures to ensure they adequately
contain the animals housed within. A system of timely identification, maintenance, and repair of facilities must be in place
to ensure the health and well-being of all animals.
