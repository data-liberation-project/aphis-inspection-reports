2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On May 1, 2021, a member of the public was permitted to enter the enclosure of an approximately 10-month-old female
white tiger. In one video obtained by APHIS, the member of the public can be seen reaching through the enclosure fence
and touching the face of the tiger. In another video, the member of the public is inside of the enclosure carrying a cattle
prod and is accompanied by his pet dog. Allowing public contact with dangerous animals without adequate barriers to
protect both the public and the animal puts this member of the public and their dog at risk of being injured. Also, the
member of the public carrying an electric cattle prod, apparently for protection, also places the tiger at risk for injury.
Correct this by ensuring all animals are handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of both
the animals and the public.

Correct from this day forward
