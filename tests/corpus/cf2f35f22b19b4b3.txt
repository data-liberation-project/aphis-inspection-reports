Several of the tubes used for the animals to move between inside enclosures or to the outside enclosure have a build up
of oil, grime and debris that needs to cleaned. These tubes are being cleaned once every few months according to the
licensee. To keep the enclosures and shift areas clean, these tubes should be cleaned and sanitized as often as
necessary to prevent this accumulation of build up for the health of the animals.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
*** Housekeeping for the facility needs to be addressed. There is an excessive amount of clutter around the capuchin
enclosures downstairs. In the upstairs room, there is a table in the middle of the room with tools, extra nails, containers,
cleaning bottles etc. There are clean hammocks on the floor that you have to step around or over to move about the
room. Housing facilities must be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the nonhuman primates from injury, and
to facilitate good husbandry and housekeeping practices.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The facility has multiple fly strips up around the enclosures, but these fly strips are filled with flies and there is still an
excessive amount of fruit flies in the downstairs area and flies in the upstairs room. The current use of fly strips is not
working as an effective method to control or mitigate the flies in the facility. The facility needs to develop an effective
program to control flies to reduce the risk of disease for the animals.
