USE OF TAGS.
The facility is utilizing the same number on the official USDA tag for two animals at the facility. One adult male
Husky-mixed dog named "Finn" who arrived at the facility on 3/20/2014 and one female Malamute mixed puppy
named "Jinn" who arrived at the facility on 1/29/15 both have official USDA tag number 20. Proper identification
which includes the official USDA tag is essential for the inspection process and necessary to accurately track
animals utilized in regulated activities. Ensure that no official USDA tag number is used to identify more than one
animal.
