ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** The facility does not employ a full-time veterinarian and there was no written program of veterinary care
available at the time of inspection. A written program of veterinary care is required for facilities which do not employ
a full-time veterinarian. That program of veterinary care must be made available for review during inspections to
ensure adequate veterinary care is being provided. The licensee must follow a written program of veterinary care
as directed by the attending veterinarian and make it available during inspections.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****The left front leg of the male prairie dog housed in the jungle area was missing from the carpal joint distal. This
prairie dog was non-weight bearing on the left front limb. The facility representative stated that the leg has always
been this way. The attending veterinarian had not been consulted nor had any treatment been provided at the time
of inspection. Limb problems can be painful causing discomfort. It can affect the mobility and daily activity of the
prairie dog.
****The rear left hind foot of the female prairie dog housed in the jungle area had excessively long toe nails such
that one nail was curled to approximately 360 degrees. Excessively long toe nails can cause the animal pain and
discomfort and can grow into the toe pad, causing damage, lameness, and possible infection. Lack of nail care on a
regular basis can affect the health and well-being of animals. The licensee must establish a nail trim maintenance
program.
These animals must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administrated. The outcome
of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that
all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.To be corrected by: 8/5/14
2.75(b)(2) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
****A record keeping system is not currently in use which can properly identify all covered species. The APHIS
Form 7019, an approved record keeping system, can be used to officially identify all covered species. Copies of the
APHIS Form 7019 were provided to the licensee during inspection. An approved record keeping system must be
incorporated, kept up to date at all times and a hard copy must be provided to APHIS officials during inspections for
proper identification of covered species. Affects all covered species.
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**** In the capuchin enclosure there was a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta on the plastic entryway door to
the nesting box. This area contained their food bowl and allowed the animals to be off exhibit. The affected area
covers approximately 40 to 50 percent of the plastic entryway door. Sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent
an accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could
lead to potential disease or health risks. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are spot cleaned on a daily
basis and sanitized in accordance with 3.84.
3.81(b)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
**** There was not an adeqate environmental enhancement plan (EEP) on hand to address the psychological
well-being of the nonhuman primates. The EEP must be reviewed and approved by the attending veterinarian.
There is no plan denoting the daily enrichment and no log book or calendar showing that enrichment takes place.
The animals do have different items in their enclosures, but there is no schedule of rotating or changing the items in
the pens and the items in the enclosures were not what was indicated on the current written plan. The enrichment
must be documented on the environmental enhancement plan, and the plan must be followed.

3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
****The facility had a refrigerator used for storing food. The refrigerator's lower shelf had an accumulation of spills,
debris, and other build up inside that had not been washed or sanitized for a period of time. The lower shelf isconstructed of a wood material and did not appear to be sealed. Unsanitary refrigerators can lead to odors, increase
flies/pests, and spreading of diseases. All refrigerators and other food storage units must be washed and sanitized
to eliminate build up, decrease odors, and kept clean at all times for the overall health of the animals. Affects all
covered species.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
**** There were small flying insects in the three toed sloths enclosure. These small flying insects were primarily
concentrated on the food and water bowls. Parasites, flying insects and other flies may carry diseases that can be
spread and transferred throughout the facility where the animals are contained. The facility representative corrected
the food and water at the time of the inspection. The facility representative stated that a pest program had been
implemented two weeks prior but no documentation could be presented. A stronger, more effective pest control
program must be incorporated and maintained at all times to decrease disease hazards and spreading of diseases.
