ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One 1,000 Ml. bottle containing Pyrantal Promate Suspension wormer has no written directions for how and at
what rate this drug is to be administered. This drug is intermingled with other products that are currently being used
at the facility and is therefore ready for use. Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information
in order to ensure that the contents and dosage rates of the container can be known with certainty and not used
past their expiration date. The licensee must ensure that all medications are labeled with dosing instructions
specific for the species of the animal being treated. Correct by 6/15/14.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Four outdoor enclosures housing 14 dogs have several holes dug in the enclosure ground floor and along the
enclosure fencing. The holes range in size from six inches to a foot in depth and a foot to three feet in
circumference. This affects the ability of enclosure fencing to contain the dog securely. It could lead to potential
injury affecting the safety and health of the dog. The licensee must keep facilities in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and contain the animals securely at all times. Correct by 5/29/14.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 5/15/2014 were conducted with the licensee.
