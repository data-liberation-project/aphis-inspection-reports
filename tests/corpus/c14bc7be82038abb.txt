2.31(d)(1)(2) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There is no written narrative description demonstrating that the principal investigator has considered alternatives to
a painful procedure. Some of these adjuvants can cause severe inflammatory reactions and acute pain such as the
Freund(cid:25)s complete adjuvant used by the facility. Because of the potential for pain and/or distress, a search for
alternatives for animal use is required. By not considering alternatives to a painful procedure, animals may undergo
unnecessary pain and distress when suitable alternatives exist. Correct by considering alternatives to all painful
procedures and by providing a written narrative description demonstrating alternatives were considered. THIS IS A
REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED.
2.36(b) REPEAT
ANNUAL REPORT.
The annual report signed on 10/16/2014 by the Vice-President for the 2014 fiscal year is incorrect. No animals are
recorded in the annual report; however, the facility acknowledges using both goats and rabbits in the 2014 fiscal
year. Additionally, not all facility locations are listed in the annual report. Accurate reporting of animal species and
numbers is necessary to maintain communication with the USDA regarding animal use and animal welfare in
research. Correct by sending an accurate annual report to the regional office. THIS IS A REPEAT
NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Superintendent.
