2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The attending veterinarian completed a new written program of veterinary care in May 2016. The new program is
much more comprehensive but is still lacking some details. The program does not specify how often the attending
veterinarian is to visit the facility. The information regarding vaccinations, parasite treatments and capture/restraint
needs to be reviewed to ensure that the name of any medications to be administered along with the route of
administration and dosage are complete (missing for a few species) and that there are directions as to how often
the medications are to be administered (missing for all the medications). There is nothing written regarding any TB
testing of susceptible species to include some of the hoofstock and the non-human primates.
The facility and the attending veterinarian need to jointly decide on all preventative veterinary procedures, drugs and
vaccines to be administered to the animals. The facility shall contact the attending veterinarian and obtain the
missing information that then needs to be added to the written program.
3.75(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outside portion of the sheltered snow macaque housing still needs repair. The bottom corner nearest the
currently empty large enclosure composed of a solid sheet of metal has a rusty area approximately 1.5 ft x1 ft. The
rust has led to structural instability with the sheet metal no longer attached to the metal bar at the bottom. The edge
of the sheet metal is jagged and is loose. The presence of excessive rust prevents the required cleaning and
sanitization and affects the structural strength of the surface. The macaques can also injury themselves on the
jagged loose metal surface. Correct by maintaining the surfaces such that they can be readily cleaned and sanitized
and such that they are structurally sound.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
