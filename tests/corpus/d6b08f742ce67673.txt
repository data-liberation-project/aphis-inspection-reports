3.1(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
The beige tenderfoot flooring in two of the outside section of the pens is missing coating which exposes sharp rusty metal
underneath. Also one of the sections is comp[rised of two sections, one section is tilted which leaves a gap approximately
1&1/2 inch high in front of the door. This gap and the exposed rusty metal can cause injury to the dogs. The rust also
prevents adequate cleaning of the flooring in the pen.
The tenderfoot sections should be repaired or replaced to ensure the pens have safe flooring that can easily be cleaned.
