Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs was not available for review. A total of 608 adult, weanlings, and newborns were counted
during this inspection. There were no inventory records since January 16, 2021, indicating the number of adults,
weanlings, or newborns present or animals that died in the last two months.

Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
death or deceased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use. The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and
correctly disclose the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired or disposed of including births and deaths. Remains
uncorrected.

Facilities, general.
Enclosures numbered 11, 40, 45, and 55 had large, chewed holes on the plastic wall surrounding the automatic water
valves affecting a total of 36 guinea pigs. The holes were large enough to allow newborns and weanlings to be injured
from falling from the stacked enclosures from a distance of 1 to 5 feet onto the floor. Housing facilities for guinea pigs
must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals

securely. The above enclosures must be repaired or replaced to protect the guinea pigs from falling through the large,
chewed openings in the wall and to prevent escape from the enclosure. Remains uncorrected.
3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
There is a buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the sides of the guinea pig enclosures. Inadequate cleaning of
scale and debris on the sides of enclosures can increase the risk of disease and health problems. Correct by ensuing that
the primary enclosures are kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of scale and debris. In
addition enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
Remains uncorrected.
3.31(b) Repeat

Sanitation.
Housekeeping. There was excessive amount of dirt, debris, feces, and cobwebs between the 7 racks of stacked
enclosures and on the drainpipe for the automatic watering system. This buildup of dirt, debris, feces, and cobwebs can
expose the guinea pigs to disease and health risks. The area between the enclosure racks and the drainpipes for the
watering system must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the health of the guinea pigs. Remains uncorrected.

This inspection was conducted with a family member and the exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
