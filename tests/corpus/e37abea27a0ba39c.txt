3.11(a)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are 8 outdoor boxes that contain huskies and German Shepherds under a covered cement run area that have
not been cleaned or sanitized in several weeks. There is a large buildup of hair and some feces in several of the
boxes, with a brown/black grime and hair on the walls, inserts and door flap surfaces of all of the boxes. There was
broken glass from a window lying in the box of one of the dogs that had not been cleaned out. The boxes are not
being cleaned or sanitized on a regular basis.
A buildup of dirt and grime, hair and feces in the boxes can be a source of possible disease and health issues, and
broken glass can be a source of injury if left in contact with the dogs.
The licensee must conduct daily pickup in the living area and runs, and sanitize the boxes and run area at least
once every 2 weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt, grime and debris.
