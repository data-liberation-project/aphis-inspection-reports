2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs was not available during this inspection. Approximately 389 adult guinea pigs, weanlings,
and newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records present for this calendar year.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by identifying animal losses by
decreased number of guinea pigs born or raised. The licensee must maintain these records containing the required
information for animals which disclose the number of guinea pigs, held, owned, acquired or disposed of including births
and deaths. Correct by July 21, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
