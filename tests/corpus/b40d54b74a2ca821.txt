3.75(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Whereas some repairs have been made, there are still some areas in the primary enclosure for the male gorilla
where there is missing and chipped paint, even including some paint applied since the last full inspection. Window
frames and grating still have some debris present.
The ceiling above the small yard that comprises part of the outdoor enclosure has peeling paint, and the wood
appears to be deteriorating, and this could allow particles to fall into the enclosure. An estimate for making these
repairs has been obtained from a contractor, and repair planning is still in progress.
All surfaces must be maintained and/or replaced on a regular basis. Failure to maintain and/or replace surfaces can
impede cleaning, create hazards, and otherwise put the health and well-being of the animals at risk.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
