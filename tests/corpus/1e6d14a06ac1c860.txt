ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* Buck III, a male Pug (I.D. # 900118000313329) has a left eye sphere with a slight to moderate conical shaped
protrusion that comes to a point over the pupil. When viewing the eye from the side it also looks like the pointed
protrusion area has a little bubble on the tip. Underneath the conical shape appears to be a hazy white to blueish
discoloration resembling fog. There is a small amount of mucoid -like discharge on the lower eyelid. The right eye
sphere has a slight conical shape with a flattened point over the pupil. There also appears to be a hazy white
coloration underneath the protrusion. This type of disfigurement of the eye sphere may be indicative of injury,
disease or other health issues. Licensee must consult a veterinarian to ensure that this disfigurement is not painful,
indicative of other disease or health issues or cause impending blindness and that any treatment required is
provided for the well-being of the dog.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* A bottom enclosure with vinyl wire flooring on the westside of New Kennel is broken and corroding away along
where the flooring and back wall meet.
The vinyl wire for a top row enclosure on the westside of the New Kennel is broken, separating alon the vertical
seam and coming apart along the bottom of the enclosure door. The broken section of wire is starting to protrude
outward.
These two enclosures, housing five adult dogs total, with broken wire can allow for the dogs feet or face get stuck in
the wire potentially causing injury. Dogs could try to escape from the gap caused by the broken wire in the top
enclosure potentially causing injury.
For the prevention of injury, all enclosures must be kept in good repair and contain the animals.
To be corrected by, 26-August-2017. 3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The outside part of two enclosures on the northeast sided of the Old Kennel had vinyl wire dividers. The vinyl was
coming off these dividers in areas exposing bare wire. This bare wire was excessively rusty and corroding. The
end enclosure had a metal gate that was excessively rusty and corroding in areas. This can prevent the required
cleaning and sanitization of these surfaces that could harbor disease organisms. The structural strength can be
jeopardized as well.
All surfaces must be free of excessive rust that can cause the prevention of required cleaning and sanitization, and
affects the structural strength for the three adult dogs.
To be corrected by, 10-September-2017.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Feces and other waste is starting to accumulate outside an opening approximately 3 yards from the dog
enclosures housing a total of 11 adult dogs. The close location of waste and opening in the building are a insect,
rodent and other vermin attraction. There were also puddles of water on the floor from a recent cleaning. The
attraction of standing water inside and fecal waste located so close to the building with available openings will
attract flying insects (mosquitoes, flies, gnats) that can cause injury, disease and stress to the animals.
Licensee must ensure that regular and frequent collection of waste, fluids and other debris are conducted in such a
way as to minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors and disease hazards.
