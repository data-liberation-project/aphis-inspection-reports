2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility continues to allow public interaction with an Asian Small-Claw otter without restraint on the otter or a
barrier between the otter and the public. The public interaction with the otter started in early February and during
that first month there were two incidents where visitors received minor wounds from the otter. Since February there
have been two additional incidents where visitors received minor wound from the otter.
During public exhibition animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of injury to the animals and the public.
Some of the ways this can be achieved are by a barrier between the public and the animal, a harness on the
animal, or training that requires the animal to respond immediately to commands.
Otters can be aggressive and have strong teeth and a powerful bite. They have the potential to cause serious injury
to a person.
