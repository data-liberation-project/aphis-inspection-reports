2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Direct - there was an adult male Bichon Frise (#081779872) with a dental condition and overgrown rear dew
claws. The left and right rear dew claws had grown, curled around and appeared to penetrate into pads underneath
the nails on each foot. The tissue which the right rear dew claw had grown into appeared swollen, reddened and
split. The tissue which the left rear dew claw had grown into also appeared thickened and split. Overgrown nails
that have curled around and penetrated tissue underneath them can increase the risk of infection and pain. The
dog was also observed repeatedly sticking its tongue out and the fur around the dog's mouth was wet and
discolored dark brown, especially on the left side. On the inside of the dog's mouth, there was an approximately 3/4
inch by ½ inch, irregular shaped, smooth, pinkish red, mass-like piece of tissue present, which appeared at least
partially attached to the gums, behind the upper left canine tooth. A band of greyish white material was present
above this piece of tissue. Many of the teeth surfaces were partially to mostly covered with a heavy amount of grey
to dark brown to tan material. The gums surrounding some of the upper left teeth appeared reddened and swollen.
Written documentation dated 7/29/2014 at the facility, which had been initialed by a veterinarian, stated the dog
"(cid:28)needs dental"(cid:29). When the licensee was asked if the dog had received a dental, he replied "(cid:28)no"(cid:29). The abnormal
build-up of material on this dog's teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. The mass-like
piece of tissue could indicate an illness or other veterinary medical condition. This dog's dental condition could be
painful, may decrease the dog(cid:25)s ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal.
***There were two, approximately 9 years old, female Schnauzers (#087) and (#121) with patchy hair loss along
their backs. One of the females (#087) had an irregular shaped region of hair loss between the shoulder blades
extending down the back to behind the shoulder blades into thinner amounts of hair. Regions of patchy hair loss
and thinner hair were also present over the dog(cid:25)'s right rear leg, hip and abdominal region. The other female (#121)
had a large patch of hair loss over her rear back extending over the hips. For each of the dogs, the skin in these
regions of hair loss appeared flakey. According to the licensee, he had not noticed the hair loss on these dogs prior
to the inspectors pointing it out. Hair loss and flakey skin could be due to parasites, allergies, infection or other
veterinary medical conditions which may cause discomfort.
***An adult female chocolate Poodle (#0A02201570) was observed consistently holding its left rear leg up and not
bearing weight on it. According to the licensee, he had noticed that the dog would sometimes limp, however, hehad not contacted a veterinarian regarding this animal'(cid:25)s condition. This dog(cid:25)'s condition could indicate an injury or
other veterinary medical condition which could cause discomfort.
The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian no later than February 11, 2015 in order
to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The
licensee must develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary
care for the animals in the facility.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(f)Drainage and Waste Disposal.
***Outside and near the vicinity (approximately 4-6 ft.) of four of the outdoor enclosures, affecting 10 dogs, there is a
large pile of discarded bedding and fecal material. This pile of discarded material can attract rodents and/or pests
which could transmit diseases to the dogs. The licensee must remove this pile of discarded bedding/fecal material
from the area of the affected dogs and ensure that any discarded waste material is placed far enough away from the
animals to minimize disease risks.

3.6(c)(1)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(c) Additional requirements for dogs--(1) Space. (iii)
***In two enclosures, housing 2 adult Golden Retrievers, there was not at least 6 inches of space above the top of
their heads to the tops of the enclosures. The majority of the time the inspectors were observing these dogs they
kept their heads in a hung position. For a brief moment the inspector was able to verify that the tops of the dogs'
heads did measure above the level of the required 6 inches of additional space. The interior height of an enclosure
must provide the dogs with at least 6 inches of additional interior height space so that the dogs can stand in a
normal position and achieve normal postural movements. The licensee must provide these dogs with an enclosure
that provides at least 6 inches of interior height space and ensure that all dogs have at least 6 inches of additional
height space so that they can stand comfortably in a normal position and perform normal postural movements at all
times.

3.9(b) DIRECT
FEEDING.***Direct - Inside of the trough area of one of the self-feeders, affecting 1 dog, there are rodent feces present.
There are also rodent feces next to the trough area of at least three of the self-feeders in the outdoor enclosures,
affecting 7 dogs. Rodent feces and rodents could contaminate the feed and increase the risk of disease to the
dogs.
***On the outside section of the north side of the sheltered facility, affecting 46 dogs, the licensee has food
receptacles that are not protected from the rain and snow. This could increase the chance that the food could
become contaminated and may decrease the palatability of the food.
The licensee must remove the rodent droppings from and around the self-feeders, clean and sanitize the feeders,
and protect the feeders in the sheltered facility from rain and snow. The licensee must ensure that all food
receptacles are kept clean and located so as to minimize contamination by excreta and pests, and be protected
from the rain and snow at all times.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(d) Pest Control.
***Inside of the trough of one of the self- feeders of an outdoor enclosure there are rodent droppings present. There
are also rodent droppings present around the outside of at least three self-feeders in the outdoor enclosures with
what appeared to be rodent burrows in the areas next to and underneath the self-feeders and areas inside and
outside of the enclosures. According to the licensee, he was not using anything to control the rodents in and around
the outdoor enclosures. Rodents and rodent droppings can increase the risk of disease hazards to the dogs. The
licensee must remove the rodent droppings from and around the self-feeders as well as establish and maintain an
effective program to control pests and rodents in and around the dogs' enclosures.
