ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The approved written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) did not include goats and hedgehogs. All covered species
should be addressed in the PVC to ensure the facility has a program to follow concerning the care of all the animals.
Failure to do so could adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals. A complete and accurate written
Program of Veterinary Care with consultation from the attending veterinarian must be in place.
