2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee does not have a written program of veterinary care or any recorded site visits from an attending
veterinarian. The licensee stated he has never had a program of veterinary care. He also stated a veterinarian has
not visited the facility.
Good communication and consultation between the licensee and the attending veterinarian in the form of a written
program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premise are necessary to ensure adequate
veterinary care at the facility. The licensee must employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements that
shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee does not have any records or forms that contain the information for the hedgehogs that are sold. The
missing information consists of the date of the sale, species of animals sold, number of animals sold, name and
address of individuals or facilities the hedgehogs are sold to. This information is necessary to track regulated
animals and to ensure that the required information is available to the inspector.
Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the date of the sale,
species of animals sold, number of animals sold and the name and address of the person to whom the animal is
sold or given to. The licensee must acquire in writing the above information for each hedgehog that is sold or given.
This information must be available to the inspector upon request.
To be corrected by: From this day forward
