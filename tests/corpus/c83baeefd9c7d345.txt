Facilities, general.
There was damage noted to three walls of the camels’ stall inside the barn. The camels had chewed several holes in the
wooden wallboard, exposing the inner frame construction of the barn wall, and insulation inside one of the three walls was
also exposed. It was also noted that the bottom corner of 2”x 4” wire mesh at the front of the outdoor camel/alpaca pen
fence near the tortoises' summer pen was still detached and bowing inwards into the pen.

Facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor
and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury. The Licensee needs to make repairs to the walls of the camel stall in the barn and to the camel/alpaca pen
fence.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted 4/11/22 with a facility representative.
