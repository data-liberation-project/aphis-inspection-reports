* One black and tan adult male German Shepherd Dog (microchip number OAO1483334) has moist, swollen red
skin between the toes of all four feet. The dog also appears to walk tenderly at times on all four feet. Sores and
irritated skin between the toes can be caused by a variety of medical and mechanical problems and can be painful
for the dog.
* One buff colored adult female Lhasa Apso (microchip number 048 586 088) was seen holding up her right foreleg
whenever she was at rest. The dog was observed bearing weight on that leg when walking. Gait abnormalities can
be caused by medical problems, trauma, etc and can be painful.
The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian by in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the inspector upon request.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* There are 17 young dogs that did not have official identification on them at time of facility inspection. The
licensee is using microchips as the official identification. The licensee stated that the young dogs are less than 16
weeks in age and have been weaned. Official identification is needed to ensure that each animal(cid:25)s identity can be
known with certainty and to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all dogs have official
identification on them at all times. Correct by 7/3/14.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
