Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Disposition records (spring 2021) for four litters of puppies (2 litters of Boston Terriers, 1 litter of French Bulldogs and 1
Maltese) were not complete. No disposition records (7006 forms) for these puppies exist. Accurate and complete records
are necessary to allow for the tracking of the puppies for legal and medical purposes. The facility shall make and keep
complete disposition records that correctly disclose all the required information for dogs/puppies sold or otherwise
disposed of including: the name and address of the person to whom the dog/puppy was sold, their USDA license number
if licensed, the date of disposition and a complete description of each puppy.
Correct by 10/31/21.
