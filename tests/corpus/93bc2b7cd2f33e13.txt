HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.75(b) Condition and site: The room housing a marmoset, a bushbaby and a ring-tailed lemur has torn floor
linoleum by the door and the right corner. There are also tools and cardboard boxes in this corner by the lemur
enclosure. These were removed during the inspection. Underneath the row of animal enclosures is an
accumulation of dirt and hay that must be removed. The torn floor linoleum allows debris to accumulate and the
floor cannot be adequately cleaned. The linoleum on the floor must be repaired and the floor cleaned as part of the
proper husbandry practices to keep the animals in a healthy environment.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The following areas must be addressed.
1) During this inspection a deer, goat and 3 pigs were inside the perimeter fence around the enclosures housing the
wild and exotic animals. These animals were not inside an enclosure but were walking around the animal
enclosures. In this area were two large fence panels leaning up against trees with a latter and pieces of metal
underneath. There were also three old rabbit hutches with broken wood and wire that were not used to house
animals. The animals had access to these stored and discarded items. The goat and deer could be injured by the splintered wood and broken wire on the old hutches. The animals could
be injured by the leaning fence panels and old metal. These items must be removed to prevent injury to the
animals.
2) There is chain link fencing coming up out of the ground where it was buried in the enclosure housing the
binturong. There is also a gap between the ground and the chin link around the base of the tree. The binturong
may injure itself trying to go under the gap in chain link by the tree and/or injure its legs on the chain link coming up
out of the ground. The chain link must be reburied to protect the binturong from injury.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(c) Drainage: The following areas have an accumulation of water and mud.
1) There is a large muddy area with puddles of water by the gate and water receptacles in the enclosure housing a
llama, 4 goats, 4 sheep and equine. The animals have to walk through the mud to get to the water receptacles or
move to another enclosure. Walking through mud and water can cause hoof problems such as foot rot. The mud
and water can attract insects. The drainage must be improved to rapidly eliminate excess water to prevent muddy
conditions and to protect the health of the animals.
2) There is a large muddy area with puddles outside the capybara enclosure. During the inspection a deer, goat
and 3 pigs were not in an enclosure but walking within the perimeter fence. These animals had access to the
muddy area. The mud and water can attract insects. The drainage must be improved to rapidly eliminate excess
water to prevent muddy conditions and to protect the health of the animals.

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(d) Perimeter fence: The camel is housed in an enclosure with farm animals that is not within the six
foot facility perimeter fence. The camel requires a perimeter fence to restrict animals and unauthorized persons
from having contact with him and to act as a secondary containment system. The camel must be housed in an
enclosure within the perimeter fence of the facility.

SANITATION.
Section 3.131(c) Housekeeping: The following items must be addressed.
1) Fencing, wood, old enclosures, tires, animal crates, and miscellaneous items continue to be stored around the
outdoor animal enclosures and perimeter fence. All this clutter provides good hiding places for mammalian pests
and prevents vegetation from being cut/trimmed around the enclosure fencing. Animal may be injured when
walking through these areas to move to other enclosures or into the transport trailer. Animal areas must be free of
clutter and debris to deter pests and for the safety of the animals.
2) In the capybara enclosure there is a large tub of filthy water. This is its water for bathing and where it defecates.
The filthy water may attract insects, smell and be a source of bacteria to cause the capybara to become ill. The
water in the tub must be changed more frequently to provide a healthier environment for the capybara and to
promote its health.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
