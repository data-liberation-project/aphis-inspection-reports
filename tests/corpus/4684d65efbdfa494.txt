2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Maltese (“Fifi” microchip number 7E10307762) has an abnormal skin condition. A large hairless area is located
on the dog’s lower back near the tail. The exposed skin is reddened and contains numerous small bumps. Several of
these bumps have split open revealing raw tissue beneath. A section of dry, scab-like material is located on the surface
of the skin. The licensee started treatment on October 1, 2021, the affected area has been treated with vetericyn spray
daily since that time, but within the past four months the condition continues to persist, and the facility has not reached out
to a veterinarian to have the dog’s ongoing condition evaluated.
Female English bulldog (“Maybelle” microchip number 93300320459871) has an abnormal condition of the right eye. A
large red growth is located in the interior corner of the eye and is covering approximately a third of the surface of the eye.
The dog has not been evaluated by a veterinarian for the condition of the eye and no treatment has been provided or is
currently scheduled.
Male Maltese (“Billy”) has poor dental health. The dog has approximately three remaining teeth and a thick buildup of
brown colored tartar is coating the entire surface of the two lower left cheek teeth. A grey material is located between the
two teeth and a dark red area is located along the gum line. The dog was evaluated by the attending veterinarian in July,
but the current condition of the dog’s teeth has not been identified and no treatment has been provided or is planned.
Abnormal conditions of the eyes and skin as well as and poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the animal

and can lead to further health issues if not treated appropriately and in a timely manner.
Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan.
The licensee must provide adequate veterinary care at all times.

During the inspection several instances of animals receiving medical treatment which had not been approved by a
veterinarian were identified.
• An English bulldog has been treated by the facility for recurring “staph infections”. The “staph infections” were self-
diagnosed by the facility and a veterinarian was not consulted in regard to this dog’s condition and the treatment plan.

• While discussing the treatment plan for several bulldog puppies who have discharge from the nose, the licensee stated
that whenever a puppy is sick and requires treatment then they will administer the treatment to all the puppies in the
kennel regardless of whether those puppies are showing symptoms of the illness or not. This plan has not been approved
by the attending veterinarian.

Abnormal conditions must be diagnosed by a veterinarian and treatment plans must also be approved by a veterinarian in
order to provide adequate veterinary care. Failure to do so does not ensure the treatment plan is appropriate or effective
which may allow the condition to worsen and place the health and well-being of the animal in jeopardy. Providing medical
treatments to healthy animals without approval from a veterinarian may have a negative impact on the health of those
animals.
Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee

must ensure that all dogs presenting abnormal conditions are evaluated and diagnosed by a veterinarian and all treatment
plans are approved by a veterinarian in order to provide the dogs with adequate veterinary care.
To be corrected by: From this day forward

A bottle of “Ayr Saline Nasal Mist” was found in the refrigerator amongst the medical products given to the dogs. The
licensee stated that this product was given to the dogs but was not “Ayr Saline Nasal Mist” but is actually Gentomycin.
The bottle does not contain a label clarifying the product within is Gentomycin and an expiration date for the Gentomycin.
A bottle of pills labeled "Metronidazole 250 mg" has no expiration date. The licensee does have a list of medication
dosages approved by the attending veterinarian that does include metronidazole.
Improperly labeled medical products and missing expiration date information does not ensure that the appropriate product
is used and the health of the animal may suffer.
Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure the bottle of “Ayr Saline Nasal Mist” is clearly labeled as Gentomycin and contains an expiration date. The
licensee must ensure the bottle of Metronidazole 250 mg has an accurate expiration date.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005) is missing the acquisition information for 4
poodles (Karamel, Taffy, Sunshine, Rayna) and 2 English bulldogs (Lonestar and Bluebell).

Incomplete acquisition records may interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to accurately inventory the animals, identify
individual dogs and to track their movements.


Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain records or forms that fully and correctly disclose all acquisition information for
each dog. The licensee must add the required acquisition information for the 6 dogs to APHIS form 7005 and ensure all
records are accurate and maintained at all times.

Primary enclosures.
There were 3 enclosures containing 3 adult female dogs that were missing a self-feeder. This created a hole in the
enclosure wall approximately 10 inches by 3 inches, large enough for the dogs to stick their head or a limb out of the
enclosure. The inspector witnessed one female dog sticking her head out of the enclosure during the time of inspection.
There was 1 wire enclosure containing 3 poodle puppies that the wire below the door had been bent down and inside the
enclosure. This left a gap approximately 1 inch by 4 inches, large enough for a puppy to get their foot or legs caught. The
facility moved these puppies to a different enclosure at the time of inspection.
Enclosures that do not contain the dog and all their limbs in the enclosure may cause strangulation or injury to the dog’s
feet or legs.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the dogs and cats from injury.
The facility must ensure that the enclosures are constructed and maintained so that the enclosures can safely contain the
dogs at all times.

Primary enclosures.

The inspector observed 3 Bichon puppies’ feet falling through the holes in the flooring of an elevated whelping enclosure
at the time of inspection. Flooring that allows dog’s feet and legs to pass through may cause injury.
Flooring must be constructed in a manner that protects the dog’s feet and legs from injury and does not allow the dog’s
feet to pass through any openings in the floor.
The facility must ensure that the flooring in the elevated whelping enclosures is constructed in a manner that safely
contains the dog’s feet and legs at all times.
