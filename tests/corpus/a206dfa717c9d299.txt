Housing facilities, general.
In an enclosure housing 2 adult Great Dane dogs there is several feet of plastic mesh-type fencing lying on the ground.
The fencing material is in an area of the outdoor enclosure that is near the outdoor shelters for the dogs. The licensee
reports he is in the middle of replacing it and just hasn’t gotten rid of it yet. Loose, netted material in a dog’s enclosure
carries a risk of entanglement and possible injury. The licensee must remove the mesh fencing or alter it in a manner that
eliminates the risk of entanglement or injury. The licensee must ensure housing structures be kept in good repair and
must protect the animals from injury. Correct by: 21-Dec-2022

Watering
An enclosure housing 2 Mastiff puppies has no water. The only water bucket provided is empty and dry with a few pieces
of straw in it. The licensee states that the puppies play in the water bucket so it is difficult to keep it filled. Dogs that do not
have access to potable water can become dehydrated and experience stress and discomfort. The licensee is required to
provide continuously available potable water to the regulated animals. Correct by: from this day forward
