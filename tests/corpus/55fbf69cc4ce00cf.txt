ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult male Dachshund (m/c# 068 055 353) had a buildup of hard brown material on its upper molar teeth and
canine teeth. The gums around the canine teeth had receded away from the teeth. The gums were red and
swollen around the canine teeth. A small amount of white material was in the area where the gums met the right
canine tooth. The inside of the upper cheek was roughened in the area that covered the right canine tooth. The dog
was reluctant to allow his mouth to be touched. Teeth and gum problems can be painful, can affect the animal's
ability to eat, and can result in tooth loss. The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian and must
establish an effective program of dental maintenance.
***An adult female Dachshund (m/c# 481 050 5F5D) was occasionally holding her left front foot off of the ground
when standing. Upon examination, there were no visible signs of a problem; however, the dog winced and jerked
its left front paw away in pain when the paw was touched. Lameness problems can be painful and can progress if
not treated. The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
