INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A current (within the past three years) search of the procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain
or distress to the animals was not available for protocol 1410.3 which was renewed February 2015. No animals are
currently under this protocol. A previous search had identified articles pertainent to one of the painful procedures but
was more than 5 years old. There was no search performed on the other potentially painful procedure. The IACUC
must assure: The principal investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than
momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals, and has provided a written narrative description of the methods
and sources. Correct By:30 April 2015

ANNUAL REPORT.
The annual report for Fiscal Year 2014 listed 3 animals in collumn E and included an explanation of these Column E
animals as required. A review of records showed only 2 animals that should have been included in this column and
the Column E explanation did not match with the animal records or protocol. The annual report needs to be
ammended and include an explanation of the procedures producing pain or distress in these animals and the
reasons it was not alleviated. Correct by: 30 April 2015
