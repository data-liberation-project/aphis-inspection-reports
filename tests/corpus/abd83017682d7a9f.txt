CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(2) Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once
every 2 weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary
to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
* All the enclosures in the two buildings, had a build up of dirt/grime, dust, and cobwebs on the walls, doors and
surrounding interior edges of the enclosures.This type of build up can harbor disease hazards, cause soiling of the
dogs and does not allow for proper sanitization to occur. Licensee must clean these areas as often as necessary to
prevent any type of build up and to allow for sanitization to occur at least once every two weeks to minimize disease
hazards.
