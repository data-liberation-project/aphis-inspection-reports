3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
I detected a strong odor as soon as I walked into the kennel. As I conducted the inspection, I noted dust webs on
the front gate of one of the enclosures. I asked the licensee how often he sanitizes the enclosures. He said he last
did it about two weeks ago, but generally does it once a month. Not sanitizing the enclosures every two weeks or
more often as necessary doesn't ensure that the enclosures are clean enough to prevent the spread of disease
amongst the dogs. It can also allow for strong odors to build up within the kennel. The licensee must sanitize the
enclosures every two weeks or more often as necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste,
excreta, and other disease hazards.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
