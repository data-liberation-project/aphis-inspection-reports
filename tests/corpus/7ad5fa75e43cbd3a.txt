FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There was a distinct ammonia odor in building # 2 housing at least 935 guinea pigs. There were cobwebs and dust
covering the four exhaust vents for the room. There were at least 7 enclosures that had fecal material consolidated
in a moist fecal pad on the floor area by the automatic water valves (see Section 3.31(a) (1)). Ammonia may irritate
the eyes and the respiratory system of the guinea pigs resulting in discomfort and health problems. Indoor housing
facilities must be adequately ventilated to maintain the health and comfort of the animals at all times. Correct by
keeping enclosures clean to decrease odors and by providing fresh air either by means of windows, doors, vents, or
air conditioning to minimize odors. Correct by September 19, 2016.
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There is still a heavy buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the wooden sides and floor of the enclosures
in building # 1. Brown roughened scale and debris are accumulating on the wooden sides and floors in building # 2.
In building # 1, there were at least five enclosures housing at least 50 adult guinea pigs with their offspring that had
fecal material consolidated in a moist fecal pad on the floor area by the automatic water valves. In building # 2,
there were at least seven enclosures housing at least 64 weaned guinea pigs and 42 adult guinea pigs with their
offspring that had fecal material consolidated in a moist fecal pad on the floor area by the automatic water valves.
The accumulations of debris, feces and wet bedding exposes the guinea pigs to potential infections with bacteria,
fungi, and parasites. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are clean and sanitized often enough to
prevent an accumulation of excreta, wet bedding, and debris. Additionally, ensure that the primary enclosures are
sanitized at least once every two weeks.
