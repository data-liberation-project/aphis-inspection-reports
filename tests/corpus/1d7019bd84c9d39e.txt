RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records are incomplete. Since the last inspection animals have died, been born and sold, been acquired and
donated. There are no records which document these events, nor any up to date records which document the
animals on hand. In the event of a disease outbreak, records are necessary to track affected animals and control
disease spread. Exhibitors shall make, keep and maintain records which accurately contain all of the required
information.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several of the facility structures are worn and compromised. Strands barbed wire on the fencing kick ins/outs is
broken, loose, sagging. Animals will sustain severe injuries if tangled in barbed wire. A den box protrudes into the
primary enclosure which is severely chewed and worn, with exposed insulation, popped nails, and loose roof
shingles. A climbing structure/shelter in the primary enclosure is also very chewed and worn. The plywood floor in
one of the shelters is loose, raised several inches on one side which could entrap an animal. A platform in the
"nursery" enclosure is sagging, putting it at risk for cracking and/or breaking. Several extension cords are low
hanging and placed within access of the animals. Animal injury could result if animals chew or are entangled in
these cords. Facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury.

SANITATION.
A pile of excreta and other organic material is placed in the primary enclosure after cleaning the barn. The animals
are allowed to climb on and dig through this pile. This contributes to odors, attracts insects, and exposes the
animals to disease hazards. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to preventcontamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Debris is accumulated in the primary enclosure. Two old pallets, one very broken with popped nails, are lying
about. Additionally, pieces of wood, old feed tubs, hose segments, cement blocks, concrete with bent metal
embedded in it, and various other items have collected. A significant accumulation of dust and cobwebs are
present in the barn. All these items pose an injury or health threat to the animals. Premises shall be kept clean and
in good repair. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the
health of the animals.
