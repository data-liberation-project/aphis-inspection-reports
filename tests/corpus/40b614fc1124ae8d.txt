HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing the Diana monkeys had several base boards that were deteriorating and in poor condition
which could pose a possible risk of injury or result in a gap in containment. Some boards had gaps in the structure
and in some areas the bolts holding the boards were exposed. At the base of an access door the bottom board had
become worn to the point of exposing sharp wire ends. The housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be sound
, kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals securely..
