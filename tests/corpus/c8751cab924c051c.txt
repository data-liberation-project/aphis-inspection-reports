2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One young adult (DOB 18 Jan 2015) female golden retriever (microchip number 900032002163027)is nursing a
litter of five puppies that are approximately 4 weeks old. The licensee reports that 11 puppies were born in this litter
but the others died shortly after birth. This female dog is very thin. Her ribs are easily palpable with no palpable fat
covering them. Her vertebrae, hip bones, and obvious abdominal tuck were visible through her coat and were very
prominent when palpated. The licensee has not consulted a veterinarian about the body condition or nutritional
needs of this dog. While lactation is a known metabolic demand on a female dog, the body condition of this dog is
excessively thin. A very thin body condition shows that the nutritional needs of this dog are not being met or that a
possible medical condition exists. The licensee must have this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian by close of
business on 13 January 2016 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document the outcome of this consultation and make it
available to the inspector upon request.
3.10
WATERING.
There are at least five water receptacles that have an accumulation of dirt on the bottom. This dirt has resulted from
the dogs standing in their water receptacles. Dirty water receptacles can cause an increase in disease transmission
as well as may decrease water consumption. All water receptacles must be kept cleaned and sanitized in
accordance with section 3.11(b) of this subpart. Correct by 13 Jan. 2016.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
One enclosure on the south side of the kennel has an excessive accumulation of feces. According to the licensee
this enclosure was last cleaned several days ago. Excessive accumulation of feces can increase disease
transmission, cause odors, and can soil the dogs. All enclosures must be cleaned on a daily basis. Correct by 13
Jan. 2016.This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO and Kendall
Lundy, ACI.
