2.33(b)(3) Critical Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On 3/7/22, 2 rabbits were mistakenly dosed with fully concentrated Polyethylene Glycol as part of protocol 17A-07. The
laboratory personnel responsible for the error notified the study director but not the veterinary staff of the incident. The
animals were left overnight without veterinary examination or care. The next day when laboratory personnel noted that
the animals were showing symptoms of reacting to the injections, the study director had the animals removed from the
study and humanely euthanized. Neither the attending veterinarian nor the IACUC were informed of the incident. The
incident was instead discovered by the attending veterinarian approximately one week later when a controlled substance
log was reviewed.
It is imperative that a mechanism of direct and frequent communication be provided to the attending veterinarian so that
accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed. This ensures that the attending
veterinarian has the appropriate authority to ensure adequate veterinary care is provided, avoiding any unnecessary pain
or suffering.

Miscellaneous.


On 3/7/22, while laboratory personnel were performing intracutaneous injections on 2 rabbits as part of protocol 17A-07,
the animals were mistakenly given a fully concentrated dose of Polyethylene Glycol (PEG). According to the associated
SOP for intracutaneous injections in rabbits, 16E-05, the PEG is to be diluted to a concentration of about 120mg/ml. The
administration of the fully concentrated dose of this medication directly resulted in the euthanasia of the animals the
following day.
Handling of animals should be performed by trained and qualified personnel ensuring proper administration of all
medications and/or test articles to ensure the animals do not experience unnecessary trauma, behavioral stress, physical
harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Corrected by the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
