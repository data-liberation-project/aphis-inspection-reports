ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
1. While conducting this inspection it was noted that a black and white llama was not responding to our presence.
This animal had been moved up to this pen, along the upper walkway, so that she could be watched. The staff had
noticed that she was acting differently than usual. When we approached her we noticed that she was standing
perfectly still with her head hung downward. She did not respond to our presence. The owner went into the
enclosure and got her to walk around the pen. However, once he left she resumed the same posture. Again, she
was very still and held her head level with her body. This did not appear to be normal behavior for a llama.
However, no documentation was available in regards to her condition and consult with the attending vet. To ensure
that this animal was under veterinary care, documentation will need to be made and kept on the premise.

2. At this time we also noticed that the lynx was in need of veterinary attention. The lynx appeared to be in good
condition. However, she was noted to have drool coming off her bottom jaw. When speaking to the owner we were
informed that she had an abscess in the recent past. He was unsure of when the vet had been out. But the
attending vet had been called and the abscess was treated. There was evidence of a small wound on the right side
of her face, close to her mouth. Due to the fact that she is drooling, the attending vet will need to be consulted on
the progress of this injury.

3. As we approached the red fox enclosure it was noted that one of the foxes had hair loss along the tail and both of
its back legs. There were bare patches on the back of the fox's thighs. Its tail also had small patches of hair loss. In
speaking with the owner he was unaware of this animals condition. Again, this fox will need to be evaluated by the
attending vet to diagnosis and treat this hair loss.

2.131(c)(1)HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the inspection it was noted that the African Crested Porcupine had been moved into an enclosure next to the
otter exhibit. The enclosure is constructed of a 1.2" x 1.2" wire mesh along with a 1' x 6" stone wall inside the
enclosure. Due to the nature of this animal he may come up to the stone wall, stand up on it and have access to the
wire mesh. Due to the size of the mesh, the public can easily extend their fingers into the exhibit. To ensure the
safety of the porcupine and the public this will need to be addressed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. While conducting this inspection it was noted that the chinchilla enclosure was in need of attention. The enclosure
has several wood shelves / ledges that allow for the chinchillas to make normal postural movements. However, the
chinchillas are chewing on these wood shelves / ledges. Therefore, a few screw heads are now exposed. To ensure
the safety of the animals these will need to be addressed.

2. The door to the barn in the pig, goat and sheep pen is in need of attention. The bottom 12" have begun to
delaminate. The top layer of the wood door is peeling away from the base. To ensure that the animals can not be
injured on this door it will need to be addressed.

3. The enclosure for the brown llama had a 1' tall x 3' long piece of wire mesh attached to the base of the primary
fencing. However, the left corner had begun to detach from the wood rails. This section of fencing was now
protruding into the enclosure. To ensure that the animal does not get injured on this mesh it will need to be
addressed.

Items 1 - 3 had been corrected as of 4/5/17
4. The grey kangaroo is being housed in a small, warm barn for the winter. The wood floor is covered with a thin,
rubber, horse matting material. However, an accumulation of hay and shavings were present under the edges of the
matting. This now exposed gaps between the wood floor and the mat. To ensure that the area can be properly
cleaned, and the kangaroo can not be injured on the protruding mat material, this will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: April 15, 2017
5. The barn stall door for the black and white llama was in need of repair. The bottom wood slat had detached from
the framework on the left side. This slat was now sideways within the door frame. There were also gaps present
now between this broken slat and the rest of the door. To ensure that the animal is not injured on this door it willneed to be addressed.
