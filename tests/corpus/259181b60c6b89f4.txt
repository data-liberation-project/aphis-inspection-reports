ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30AM on
15-Aug-19.
Stopped at the closed gates, called the phone number and left a message. After a while my call was returned and
was informed the owner was not available for an inspection.
