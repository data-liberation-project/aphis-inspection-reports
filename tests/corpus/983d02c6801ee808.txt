2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A black and white adult guinea pig in Pen 40 had a firm movable
mass approximately 1 inch in size under the chin. The animal was in good body condition and did not appear lethargic.
The licensee had not observed the health condition in the guinea pig, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, and
was not administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the condition and provided
treatment options.
Masses under the chin can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being of
the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and
treatment for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional
animals if the condition is contagious.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or communicate with the attending
veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.

2.40(b)(4) Critical



Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility is utilizing a method of euthanasia for guinea pigs that is not included in the Program of Veterinary Care. The
Program of Veterinary Care specifies that euthanasia is to be performed by the veterinarian. However, the facility is
performing its own euthanasia by blunt force trauma. This method does not meet the guidelines of the Animal Welfare Act
which requires euthanasia to be performed by a method that produces rapid unconsciousness and subsequent death
without evidence of pain or distress, or a method that utilizes anesthesia produced by an agent that causes painless loss
of consciousness and subsequent death. The licensee said he had performed his own euthanasia twice but was unsure
how many animals had been euthanized.
Failure to utilize a method of euthanasia consistent with the attending veterinarian’s guidance and according to the
requirements of the Animal Welfare Act is likely to result in unnecessary pain and suffering to the animals.
The facility must utilize a method of euthanasia approved by their attending veterinarian and that complies with the
requirements of the Animal Welfare Act.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 269 adult, weanling,
and newborn guinea pigs were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of
adults, weanlings, or newborns present for the last few months.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the


number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.
