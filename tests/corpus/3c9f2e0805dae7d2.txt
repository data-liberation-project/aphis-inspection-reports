FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The northwest outdoor enclosure wall for the older female capybara in the waterfowl exhibit area has gaps where
the animal could potentially escape. This wall is constructed of "electrical pole" sections sunken vertically in the
ground. However, the "electrical poles" have begun to lean outwards creating spaces between poles where the
capybara could become injured or escape. Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by: 9/19/14.
The east outdoor enclosure wall for the younger female capybara in the off-exhibit holding area is leaning inwards
and the animal could potentially be injured or escape. This wall is constructed of 8 foot high sections of wooden
fencing and is 20 feet in width. The keeper access gate adjacent to this wall is made of a welded wire (cattle) panel
which is 5 feet tall and 6 feet in width. This gate is bungee-corded to an adjacent animal enclosure and could
potentially fail to contain the capybara. Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by: 10/10/14.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
