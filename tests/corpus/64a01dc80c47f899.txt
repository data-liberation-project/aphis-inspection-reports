Annual report.
The facility's annual report for FY 2022 did not accurately report all animals used or held for research. The FY 2022
annual report reported 10 hamsters (all in Column D) and zero rabbits. Review of facility records of animal acquisition and
disposition showed that the facility used 1 rabbit in May 2022 which should have been reported in Column D. Facility
records also show that a total of 19 hamsters should have been reported in Column D, and 9 additional hamsters should
have been reported in Column B.
Correct reporting of all required information on the annual report is required so that the public, USDA APHIS Animal Care,
and Congress can have knowledge of the number, type, and pain category of animals used- or held for use in research.
Correct by February 1st, 2023, by submitting a corrected FY 2022 annual report to USDA APHIS Animal Care.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
