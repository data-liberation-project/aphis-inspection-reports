2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility owner acknowledged the attending veterinarian has not made an inspection of the facility in over a year.
USDA recommends that the attending veterinarian make a least an annual inspection of the facility to ensure the
physical conditions of the enclosures and medical health of the animals are adequate. The veterinarian and USDA
inspection are both used to evaluate if the facility is meeting all USDA regulations. A regular program of annual
inspection by the attending veterinarian needs to be in place and followed.
