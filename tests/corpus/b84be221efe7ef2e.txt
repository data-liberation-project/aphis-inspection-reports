2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 pm on
20-Nov-19.
I arrived at the address provided and knocked on the door but there was no answer. I called the two phone numbers
provided, one was no longer in service and I left a message on the voicemail for the second number on file. There
has been no itinerary sent in to indicate the licensee is in travel status and no updated information as to current
status. I am providing my business card with this mailing. Please contact me with updated contact information.
