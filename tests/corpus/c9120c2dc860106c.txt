PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
(a)(cid:9)
On June 16-17, 2014 the licensee transported 2 Coatimundis and 21 Non-Human Primates in a livestock trailer from
Missouri to Texas. During the transport one of the non-human primates, a female capuchin, had died. According to
the licensee, the animal was found dead in its enclosure after arrival at the final destination. A necropsy report,
signed by a veterinarian, for the deceased monkey stated that (cid:28)"Necropsy diagnosis or gross findings was possible
over heating and stress or possible injury".(cid:29) When the licensee was questioned about the means of transport, he
stated that he had transported all of the animals in a livestock trailer (which measured approximately 15 feet in
length). He had sealed up the openings of the trailer to protect the animals from the wind and also to contain them
if there was an escape from their(cid:25) primary transport enclosures. He said that he used ¼ inch plastic boards to cover
the openings. When the licensee was questioned about any openings for ventilation he said that there were a few
cracks in the floor and also a few cracks around where he had sealed the openings with the plastic boards. When
the licensee was questioned as to how the primates were contained inside of the trailer he said that each one had
their own crate and they were placed in a single level. The primary cargo space for the deceased primate was not
designed and constructed to protect the health, and ensure the safety and comfort of the primate. The licensee
must ensure that all animal cargo space of primary conveyances used in transporting live animals shall be designed
and constructed to protect the health, and ensure the safety and comfort of the live animals contained therein at all
times.

CARE IN TRANSIT.
a)
On June 16-17, 2014 the licensee transported 2 Coatimundis and 21 Non-Human Primates in a livestock trailer from
Missouri to Texas. The trip took approximately 13 hours. The licensee stated that he left his facility at 9 pm and
drove straight through to his destination, arriving at approximately 10am on the 17th of June. As they were
unloading the animals it was discovered that one of the primates had died. When asked several times by theinspectors if he had stopped during the trip he said that he had (cid:28)only stopped for gas and then hit the road again(cid:29).
When asked again about stopping and checking on the animals the licensee said that he (cid:28)did not open the door of
the enclosed trailer in case one of them had escaped from its enclosure.(cid:29) Without good visual observation, it is
difficult to know whether or not animals are in distress or in need of veterinary care during transport. The licensee
must ensure that when transporting nonhuman primates in commerce must ensure that the operator of the
conveyance or a person accompanying the operator of the conveyance observes the nonhuman primates as often
as circumstances allow, but not less than once every 4 hours, to make sure that they have sufficient air for normal
breathing, that the ambient temperature is within the limits provided in Sec. 3.88(d) of this subpart, and that all other
applicable standards of this subpart are being complied with. The regulated person transporting the nonhuman
primates must ensure that the operator or the person accompanying the operator determines whether any of the
nonhuman primates are in obvious physical distress, and obtains any veterinary care needed for the nonhuman
primates at the closest available veterinary facility.

must ensure all animals are visually observed well enough and often enough, but not less than once every 4 hours,
to assure that they are receiving sufficient air for normal breathing, their ambient temperatures are within the
prescribed limits, all other applicable standards are being complied with and to determine whether any of the live
animals are in obvious physical distress and to provide any needed veterinary care as soon as possible.

The 2 adult kinkajous included on the report for the June 18, 2014 inspection under 2.40 (b)(2) had been examined
by a veterinarian and treatment plans had been developed.
This was a focused inspection on transport and to follow up on the "direct" non-compliant items cited during the
June 18, 2014 inspection. The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
