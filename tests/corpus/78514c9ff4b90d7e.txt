PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
The licensee purchased a male camel from an unlicensed source on 5-20-16. The camel has been used for rides
and exhibits since its acquisition. Acquiring animals from unlicensed sources doesn't ensure that those facilities
have met Animal Welfare Act requirements in order to be licensed.
Ensure that animal sources are licensed when required.
To be corrected: From this day forward.

PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
The trailer loading ramp has a loose piece of sheet metal that was recently damaged. The sheet metal has
separated from the frame, exposing a gap where the animals could potentially become injured.
The damaged portion of the ramp must be repaired or replaced to protect the safety of the animals.
