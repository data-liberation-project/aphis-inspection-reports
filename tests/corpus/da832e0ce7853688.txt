Primary enclosures.
The lower right enclosure on the front row housing 2 dwarf rabbits needs repair. The wire floor has a hole approximately 3
inches in diameter with broken and protruding wire. Licensee's son place a board over the hole during this inspection until

from injury. Wire floor must be repaired or replaced to prevent injury to the rabbits. Correct by August 1, 2022.
3.53(c)(2)

Primary enclosures.
Five enclosures housing weaned dwarf rabbits had inadequate floor space. Enclosures measure 2 feet by 2 feet or 4
square feet of floor space. Rabbits weighing less than 4.4 pounds required at least 1.5 square feet of floor space each.
Three enclosures had 4 weaned rabbits, one enclosure has 3 weaned rabbits, and one enclosure had 5 weaned rabbits.
Inadequate space can cause stress, discomfort, and aggression in animals. Cannot house more than 2 weaned dwarf
rabbits weighing less than 4.4 pounds in this size enclosure. Licensee must ensure that rabbits are provided with at least
the minimum amount of floor space per rabbit to prevent unnecessary stress, discomfort, and aggression. Correct by
August 2, 2022.
