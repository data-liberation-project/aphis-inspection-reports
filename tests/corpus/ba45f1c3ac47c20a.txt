3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Throughout the petting farm area there are many areas of structural concern.
*Side entry gate to enter barn has rotting wood at the bottom and the gate is not secured to the support post.
*The gate and side fence to the left at the entrance of the pygmy goats stall is unstable and not secured to a proper
support. The plywood board on the right side and back wall of this stall is rotting and giving way under slight
pressure.
*The first outside goat and sheep stall to the west has broken wire mesh where the goats and sheep have been
rubbing on it. Sharp points are protruding and could injure the animals.
*In the outside middle stall for the goats and sheep the upper wire mesh panel is separated from the support post
and is swinging unsecured.
*The wooden play structure for the sheep and goats has eight unsecured boards due to wood rot. The screws have
pulled out of the boards from the supports.
*The east fence and gate leading from the sheep and goats enclosure to the cows enclosure is structurally unsound
and broken wire mesh has sharp points protruding in towards the animal area.
*The north back fence for the sheep and goats has rotton support posts and the top wooden rail is detached from
the post in the center.
*The large east gate in the sheep and goats outside enclosure has many areas of broken wire with sharp points
exposed.
*In the west pig pen the west fence is giving at the area it is supposed to be secured to the barn wall. The bottom
support post is off the fence and laying on the ground.
*The south fence for the cows has excessively rusting wire mesh over the wood rails and is breaking and coming off
the support posts.
*The wire mesh over the wood rails at the north side of the stalls for the cows is not secured and sharp points exist
all along the bottom section.
*The banyan tree at the northeast corner of the cows area is growing into the fence. The top metal post has popped
out of the support. The tree is growing into the mesh on this same side.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. Theindoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
