ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following drugs were found expired in the facility'(cid:25)s emergency "go"(cid:29) kit:
** 1 bottle of injectable glycopyrolate expired 09/2014.
** 1 bottle of injectable doxapram expired 04/2014.
** 1 bottle of injectable oxytocin expired 10/2014.
** 1 bottle of injectable Lasix expired 11/2014.
** 2 bottles of injectable lidocaine expired 10/2014.
** 2 bottles of injectable dexamethasone expired 03/2014.
The use of expired drugs can be dangerous or ineffective. The facility must ensure that only drugs in date are used
on regulated animals at the facility. This is especially important in emergency kits as there may not be time in an
emergency to check for expiration dates before dispensing the drugs.
Correct from this time forward

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***This facility has made significant progress to correct the perimeter fence. Maintenance personnel were present
and met with USDA inspectors during this inspection. A written work order is in place for the remaining areas of
concern. The facility must complete the following improvements to fully correct this non-compliant item:
** The manure holding area has walls that are approximately 4 feet in height and made of concrete. These walls
are a potential leaping point should an animal try to get over the fence. The facility plans to raise the height of the
perimeter fence in this area to be 8 feet above the walls. The higher perimeter fence will also extend 4 feet on both
sides of the walls.
** There is one storage building that is immediately next to the perimeter fence in the maintenance area that has
sidewalls that are not 8 feet in height. Animals could potentially jump to this building and then over the perimeterfence. The facility plans to raise this building so the side walls are 8 feet in height.
** There is still building materials in the maintenance area next to the perimeter fence that need to be removed.
These materials are a potential point where animals could use them to get over the perimeter fence.
The perimeter fence must be kept in good repair and items kept away from the fence to ensure it is functional.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED
*** Inspection conducted with zoo staff. Exit interview conducted with the head keeper.
