2.134(a)(1)

Contingency planning.
The written emergency plan does not identify situations that would trigger the need for the contingency plan. The plan
includes recapture equipment and important contacts, but does not address what potential emergencies may impact the
facility. Contingency plans must identify situations the licensee might experience that would trigger the need for
measures identified in the contingency plan to be put into action to provide for the humane handling, treatment,
transportation, housing and care of their animals.
