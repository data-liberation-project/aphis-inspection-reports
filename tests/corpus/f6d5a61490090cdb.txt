CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning.
****
The facility's enclosures all had more than a days build-up of fecal material. The licensee stated all the enclosures
were last cleaned on Saturday 8/26. Many of the enclosures had smeared feces tracked on the flooring from the
excessive fecal buildup on the flooring. Many of the animals were not able to move around the enclosure freely
without stepping in feces. The outside portion of the facility there was a build up of fecal waste under the
enclosures. The fecal build up was about 2-3 ft. under the dogs' flooring. The licensee stated it had probably been
about a month since that area was cleaned. The accumulation of waste can increase health hazards, attract insects
and pests, and produce odors. The licensee must spot clean daily all surfaces that come in contact with the dogs,
other surfaces must be cleaned at least once every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation
of waste.
