WATERING.
Sec. 3.10 Watering
A brown, female, adult Chihuahua housed in the indoor whelping facility with her 5 puppies did not have water. The
inspection took place at 4:30 pm and the licensee stated that she had filled the bowl the previous evening. The
licensee was asked to provide water to the dog who was anxiously pawing the enclosure door. When water was
provided the dog drank continuously for almost a minute. Lack of appropriate amounts of water can increase the
risk
of dehydration and other medical issues for the animals. The licensee must ensure all animals have access to
water as often as necessary to ensure their health and well-being, but not less than twice daily for at least 1 hour
each time, unless restricted by the attending veterinarian. The licensee corrected this non-compliance during the
inspection.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
