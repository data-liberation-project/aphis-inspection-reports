FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The hot wires in all of the big cat enclosures must be activated.
Activation is necessary to help ensure containment of the animals.
Correct immediately on receipt of this report.
*** In the enclosure containing the tiger "Cocheney":
At the time of this inspection it was noted that "Cocheney" was resting on a platform approximately 4 feet high and
adjacent to the primary fence, which is approximately 12 feet high. The close proximity of the platform to the fence
has effectively decreased the height of the fence to about 8 feet. This is below the minimally acceptable height of
12 feet, and does not take into consideration that, as an additional precaution, 3 foot kick-ins should be added.
Modifications are necessary to help ensure containment of the animals.
Correct by 7/14/14
*** A cyclone wire gate at the bottom of "Cocheney's" enclosure is approximately 10 feet in height. This is 2 feet
less than the acceptable height of 12 feet and does not include the 3 foot kick-ins.
Modification are necessary to help ensure containment of the animals.
Correct by 7/14/14
*** In the enclosure containing the tigers "Makeena" and "Triton":
The front gate appears to be only about 10 feet high.
The gate should be heightened to 16 feet (using the 16 foot existing poles on either side of the gate) or 12 feet with
3 foot kick-ins.
Modifications are necessary to ensure containment of the animals.
Correct immediately on receipt of this report.
All big cat enclosures at the facility must be in compliance with regulations by 9/27/14.3.131(c)
SANITATION.
*** Open garbage cans were noted in the food preparation area. In order to help ensure prescribed husbandry
practices which, in turn, safeguard the health of the animals, these cans should be covered.
This non-compliance was corrected before the inspectors left the facility.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility licensee on 6/19/14.
