2.31(c) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC is not performing reviews of the facility's program for humane care and use of animals and the animal facilities
every six months. According to the meeting minutes, the last review was conducted in December 2021. The registrant
stated that this delay was due to issues with scheduling.
Inspection of the animal facilities by the IACUC and review of the program for the humane care and use of animals by the
IACUC are required at least every six months to ensure that any activities involving animals at this facility are being
conducted in a manner to reduce pain and/or distress and they meet the current standards for the species involved.
The IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research facility's
animal facilities, including animal study areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A- Animal Welfare, as a basis for
evaluation. The IACUC must also review the research facility's program for humane care and use of animals, at least
once every six months, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A.
3.81(a)

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The registrant has an individually housed marmoset, “Bubba,” that is unable to see or hear nonhuman primates of its own
or compatible species. The facility’s environment enhancement plan does not provide any exceptions or exemptions that


require this animal to be individually housed and the registrant is unable to show evidence that a second nonhuman
primate is being acquired.
Marmosets are known to exist in social groups in nature and those that are individually housed can suffer adverse effects
to their psychological well-being. The registrant must provide adequate social housing for this individually housed
marmoset. A corrective plan with a reasonable timeline for completion must be developed and initiated.
To be corrected by October 31, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
