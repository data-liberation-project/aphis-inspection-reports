2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Two Francois langurs escaped their holding area when a keeper left their enclosure door and secondary
containment doors unsecured. The facility representative stated that the keeper thought the langurs were out on
exhibit. The two langurs were discovered by a volunteer, who was training with the keeper, as the animals were
coming around the back of the holding area. The keeper was notified. The langurs walked into a keeper bathroom
and the volunteer closed the door behind them. Both langurs were netted and hand injected for sedation by the
veterinarians. The langurs were returned to their holding areas unharmed.
Although the facility(cid:25)'s procedural manual has a section on Safety Lockout System for Animal Exhibits and an
Animal Care Division Checklist for Animal Keeper Training on Strings that includes 1)Proper methods for locking
gates and doors on animal exhibits / holding 2)Proper methods for securing animals and working safely around
animals, the procedures outlined in these sections were not followed.
Failure to follow procedures for securing animal enclosures and secondary containment doors could adversely
affect the health and well- being of the animals as well as the public, if an escape occurs.
A system should be in place to ensure the handling of all animals is done as carefully as possible.
To be corrected from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
