3.13(c)(3)
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
Two cats were traveling together on United Airlines waybill #016-47703224 en route to Honolulu. According to the
shipper's declaration attached to the top of the two carriers, the cats were last offered food and water at 4 AM EST,
and the owner signed the declaration at 5 AM EST. The cats were on the following itinerary:
- UA Flight # 4959 - Binghamton NY to Newark NJ
- UA Flight # 0637 - Newark NJ to San Francisco, CA
- UA Flight # - 0073 - San Francisco CA to Honolulu, HI
The cats were observed at the SFO United Cargo office at 3:40 PM PST, where they were awaiting their final flight.
Each carrier had a bag of cat food attached, but these bags were unopened. The shipper had failed to complete the
owner's declaration form regarding feeding at watering instructions.
Failure to ensure that the shipper provides certification in writing regarding feeding and watering instructions at the
time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment can put the animal at risk. The airline must ensure that the owner has
provided this information in writing, and that animals are adequately cared for while in transit.
To be corrected from this time forward.
