In 3 enclosures, affecting 4 dogs, the shelters have an accumulation of old bedding and dirt. When questioned by
the inspectors the licensee stated that it had been "About a month" since he had cleaned these shelters. Old dirty
bedding can become a disease hazard to the animals. The licensee must clean and sanitize these shelters and
ensure that all hard surfaces in contact with the animals are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two
weeks or more often if necessary to satisfy the generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
