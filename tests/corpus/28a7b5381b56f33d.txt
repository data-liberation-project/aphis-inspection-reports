Sheltered housing facilities.
Thirty-nine adult beagle dogs were housed in “Kennel J,” a sheltered housing facility in which the temperature inside the
sheltered area exceeded 29.5 degrees Celsius for approximately six hours. The temperature was measured and
recorded by the automated environmental monitoring system as remaining within the range of 29.6 degrees Celsius and
30.9 degrees Celsius with an average temperature of 30.3 degrees Celsius between the hours of 4:45pm and 10:45pm on
June 7, 2022.
Dogs that are hot may experience discomfort, lethargy, or stress. Dogs with medical problems or under study may be
especially vulnerable to the effects of hot weather. The licensee must provide additional / alternate cooling mechanisms
or make adjustments that adequately provide for animal comfort and well-being and ensure ambient temperatures inside
the sheltered areas do not exceed 29.5 degrees Celsius for more than four consecutive hours when dogs are present.
