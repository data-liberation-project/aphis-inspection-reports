2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***** PVC is not completely filled out and the last time the attending veterinarian visited the facility was 03/2012
according to the signature page of the PVC. The program of vet care provides a source of information that tells what
vaccinations will be given, de worming programs, parasite control programs or methods used to euthanize all
animals on the premise and who the vet of record for the licensee will be. When the program of vet care is not
completely filled out information on how the licensee provides for the health and well-being of all the animals on the
premise has not been recorded. The licensee, in coordination with the attending veterinarian, must provide more
specific information on the type of products used at the facility, the frequency of use, and ensure that the attending
veterinarian is observing the animals and visiting the facility annually. USDA regulations require that the program of
vet care must be completely filled out & must be made available at the inspector(cid:25)s request at the time of the facility
inspection.
