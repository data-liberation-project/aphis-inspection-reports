2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the ready to use medication storage area, there was a bottle of Ivermectin that had a labeled expiration date of
03/14 and a bottle of Lactated Ringers Solution that had a labeled expiration date of 6/08. According to the
licensee, the Ivermectin was used regularly on the animals. Medications that are expired and are given to the
animals may not produce the desired result. The licensee must remove all expired medications from the ready to
use portion of the facility and ensure that expired medications are not used past their labeled expiration date. As a
part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must make certain that all medications are within the
expiration date and assure adequate veterinary care at all times.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
