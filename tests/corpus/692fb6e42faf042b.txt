1/3 way with loose pelleted feed. The room's ceiling has water damage that includes mold and hanging insulation
that could contaminate the food. One of the pelleted feed bags was observed spilling food due to a having a hole
likely chewed by vermin. This feed bag was adjacent to a hole in the wall that was open to the outdoors and had
loose insulation present. These conditions could contaminate the food.
Assure all supplies of food are stored in facilities which adequately protect supplies against deterioration molding, or
