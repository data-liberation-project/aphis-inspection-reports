3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The dogs in the outdoor facility did not have adequate bedding. The ambient temperature at the time of the
inspection was 40 degrees F with temperatures falling below 35 degrees F at night. The shelters had a small
amount of hay, but not enough for the temperatures that the dogs were being exposed to. Adequate clean, dry
bedding is necessary to protect the dogs so that they are not in discomfort or at risk for temperature-related health
problems. The licensee must ensure that each dog has access to a shelter with bedding when the ambient
temperature falls below 50 degrees and must provide additional bedding when the temperature is 35 degrees F or
lower.
TO BE CORRECTED JANUARY 05, 2016.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
