Sanitation.
The current program to mitigate pests is not effective. The food storage room adjacent to the barn is overrun with mice.
During the inspection, mice were seen running around food on the floor and among bags that had been opened by them

pest control program must be in place to be effective in reducing the amount of pests in the area. This needs to be
addressed for the health of the animals.
