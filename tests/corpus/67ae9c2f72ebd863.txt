2.31(c)(6)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
During the Dec. 2016 IACUC meeting a noncompliance that occurred on protocol 2455 was discussed. The meeting
minutes state that "the PI and all other protocol personnel will be informed about the halting of the protocol and
corrective actions as soon as possible after today's meeting". There was no notation in the minutes that a vote to
suspend the protocol was conducted. This was confirmed by talking to individuals present at the IACUC meeting.
The IACUC may suspend an activity that it had previously approved if it determines that the activity is not being
conducted in accordance with the description provided by the PI and approved by the committee only with a
suspension vote of a majority of the quorum present at the meeting. Correct from this day forward.
2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Review of the Dec. 2016 IACUC meeting minutes showed that an amendment to protocol 2455 was brought before
the committee for full committee review. The IACUC voted to approve a "revised amendment contingent on" two
items being completed/revised. The IACUC, as the representative body for the facility, is responsible for approving
all animal use protocols and significant changes prior to the animals being used. During a review the committee can
approve, require modifications to secure approval or withhold approval of the proposed significant changes. A
protocol should not be approved 'with contingencies' in order to avoid confusion between the IACUC and
researchers. The IACUC shall ensure that all amendments to protocols, including to protocol 2455, are approved via
an appropriate review. Correct from this day forward.
2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
During a review of an amendment submitted to the IACUC for protocol 2455 the IACUC determined that the
researchers were performing an unapproved procedure during a terminal surgery study on pigs that involved
restricting oxygen to the pigs. This procedure was performed on multiple pigs over multiple study days before a
co-investigator reviewed the protocol and realized that the procedure was not in the approved protocol. This
particular co-investigator had been initially told incorrectly by the surgeon researchers that the procedure was
approved. A protocol must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals in order for allresearchers to understand what procedures can be performed and to allow the IACUC to ensure that all research is
conducted in a manner in accordance with the regulations. All proposals to conduct an activity involving animals
shall include a complete description of the proposed use of animals including protocol 2455. Correct prior to the use
of any additional pigs.

MISCELLANEOUS.
The IACUC meeting minutes and an adverse event report documented an event in which a horse broke its femur
during a transport between the horse's housing area and a teaching area. Seven horses were loaded into a trailer at
their housing site with no complications. Upon arrival at the first teaching venue where six horses were to be
unloaded for the day the arena was locked and no one was present to let the handlers remove the horses from the
trailer and lead them into the arena. While the handlers were waiting in the truck for someone to let them in they felt
a bump and movement in the trailer. They checked on the horses and one of the horses was on the floor of the
trailer and unable to stand up. They were able to get her up and unload her from the trailer but she then laid down
again once outside the trailer. A veterinarian was called immediately and decided to euthanize the horse as it was
suspected that the femur was fractured. This was confirmed by necropsy. After action interviews were conducted
and it was determined that this particular horse was known to be a dominant, high strung horse. Miscommunication
issues between the employees bringing the horses to the arena and the employees at the arena resulted in a delay
unloading the horses which was felt to be the cause of the incident. Appropriate handling of horses during trailering
should include the evaluation of the horses' personality and herd interactions along with proper planning to ensure a
safe transport of the animals. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a
manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. Correct from this
day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned Interim OLAC Director/Interim Attending
Veterinarian and additional facility staff.
