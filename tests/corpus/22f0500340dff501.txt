ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The evening dose of antibiotic was missed for "Pumba" on 5/15/2015. There was no adverse effect evident resulting
from the oversight.
"Boo" was anesthetized and being prepped for a procedure when it was discovered that one drug for a three-drug
cocktail necessary for the procedure was missing. The medication was obtained from an outside source by the time
it was needed. There was no delay in the procedure, nor ill effect on the animal from the oversight.
Medication errors such as these could result in lack of effectiveness of a treatment regimen, or harm to the animal if
procedures were prolonged while medications are procured. While there were no ill-effects at this time, a better
system should be developed to ensure that medication doses are not missed, and that medications are available
when they are needed.
Correct by close of business on 5/29/2015.
The inspection and exit briefing were accompanied by facility personnel.
