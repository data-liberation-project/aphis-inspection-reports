2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1600 on
30-May-18.
I arrived at the facility at 4pm. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I honked the horn several times. I called
both numbers and left a message. As I was getting ready to leave at 4:30, the licensee's wife arrived. She stated
that she was not familiar nor comfortable showing me the kennel and records and that the licensee would be late
arriving home. She also stated that they wanted to cancel their license. I informed her that the licensee needed to
mail his license to the office with a written statement of their desire to cancel the license and until that time, they
would be subject to inspections.
