2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 529 guinea pigs including adults,
weanlings, and newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of
adults, weanlings, and newborns held or on hand or the number of guinea pigs that died in the last few months. Failure to
keep inventory records including births and deaths makes it difficult to track changes in production, losses due to death,
and to assess the animal care program. Licensee must ensure that records are kept and maintained on guinea pigs held,
owned, sold, including births and deaths to help keep track of animals, document changes in ownership, and to assess
the animal care program. Correct by February 15, 2022.
3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
Space. Insufficient space was being provided to two enclosures housing weanling guinea pigs. Enclosures measured 32
inches by 48 inches or 1536 square inches of floor space. These enclosures were housing 30 or more guinea pigs in
each. Weanling guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams required 60 square inches of floor space per animal. Can house
house more than 25 guinea pigs in this size enclosure.

Inadequate space can cause stress from overcrowding, health problems, and increase aggression in animals. Licensee

must ensure that guinea pigs are provided with at least the minimum amount of floor space per animal to prevent stress
and discomfort. Correct by February 11, 2022.
3.31(b)

Sanitation.
Housekeeping. There was a buildup of dirt, debris, and staining on the outside of the piping housing the automatic
watering system which runs vertically along the outside of the enclosures. The lack of sanitation and the presence of
debris may attract insect pests, result in unpleasant odors, and may contribute to the spread of disease. The animal
building must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the health of the guinea pigs and to facilitate prescribed
husbandry practices. Correct by February 10, 2022.
