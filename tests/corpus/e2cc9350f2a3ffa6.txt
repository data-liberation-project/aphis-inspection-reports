2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
On June 20, 2022 keeper records indicated that the opossum “Cordelia”, did not eat her diet from the previous day (June
19th) and she did not eat her egg that day. It was again noted on the 21st she did not eat. Even though she did not eat for
approximately three days, there is no record that her condition was communicated to the AV in a timely manner. Exotic
animals, especially prey species such as opossums will often hide or mask pain and going off food was a clear indicator
that the animal was not feeling well. She was seen by the AV on June 23rd when the vet was at the facility for rounds in
which she was found to have a tongue swollen with ulcers and she was bloated. Notes indicate the AV was concerned
with her kidneys and that she may be in renal failure. The facility provided subcutaneous fluids and Baytril IM. The rest of
the day she was very lethargic and could not hold herself upright, her breathing became shallow by the evening, and she
died overnight.

Direct and frequent communication about her behavior and condition should have been provided to the AV in a timely
manner and if the vet was not able to provide care to the animal including humane euthanasia after her condition was
assessed, the facility should have sought out emergency care to reduce suffering. The facility must correct this going
forward and a mechanism of direct and frequent communication must be conducted so that timely and accurate

information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. This is to
assure a timely diagnosis and treatment can be implemented for the welfare of the animal.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility acquired cows for approximately six months seasonally. There were no acquisition records or disposition
records for the two cows that came through the facility this past year. Records of acquisition and disposition identifying
the movement of animals are required to be maintained at the facility identifying where the animals originated from, and
the date they arrived and then disposition records are required identifying when they leave and where they went to. These
records are an important part of the license process and must be maintained by the facility for APHIS official review.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
There is a section of chicken wire on the inside of the primary enclosure mesh to bobcat holding that is in disrepair and
the bottom right corner is twisted and protruding into the enclosure. This section of wire needs to be removed or replaced
to keep the enclosure in good repair and for the safety of the animal.
3.128

Space requirements.
The facility recently acquired two adult male wolves and are housing them in a large chain link enclosure that is
designated quarantine space. Both animals were pacing nonstop during the inspection process and did not settle down,
which is an indicator of stress. The enclosure is adjacent to the main animal care building which gets a high degree of
keeper traffic and vehicle traffic for deliveries. At the far end of the enclosure, there is a shelter/den box and two solid
panels attached to the chain link which provide a small visible barrier if the animals are in that exact spot and stop
moving. There is no furniture in the enclosure which would allow for the animals to have levels to get on and engage in

normal social adjustments and there are no visual barriers provided that would allow the animals to avoid each other.
Moving from one facility to another is already a highly stressful process for exotic animals and then housing animals in an
enclosure that does not provide opportunities for them to make normal social adjustments such as hiding exacerbates
their stress level which can lead to abnormal behaviors such as pacing. This enclosure needs to be addressed for the
welfare of the animals during their quarantine period.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within (2) more inspection(s) by Jan 31, 2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
