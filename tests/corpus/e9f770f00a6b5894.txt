2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The APHIS 7005 forms maintained by the licensee are incomplete. Various pieces of required information are
missing throughout the forms including missing identification numbers and descriptions for the animals, required
dates, and complete acquisition information. Complete inventory information is essential to facilitate the inspection
process and to trace the movement of animals. The licensee must make, keep, and maintain records or forms which
fully and correctly disclose information listed in 2.75 a 1 concerning each dog or cat purchased or otherwise
acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported,
euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of
any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. To be corrected by 15 Dec 2015.
3.6(a)(2)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One primary enclosure housing a female dog and her puppies had a heating pad in the whelping box. While there
was a protective guard at the base of the cord near the pad, the cord had slipped into the enclosure so that
unprotected section of electric cord was within reach of the dog. Electric cords when chewed can cause injury to the
dogs. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are maintained so that they protect dogs and cats from
injury. Corrected during the inspection.
3.6(b)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is one enclosure housing a queen and her 2 kittens that does not have an elevated resting surface. There are
also two enclosures each housing three cats with one elevated resting surface in each that does not appear large
enough to comfortably accommodate all three cats at once. The use of elevated resting surfaces satisfies a
behavioral preference for many cats. The licensee must ensure that each primary enclosure housing cats must
contain a resting surface or surfaces that, in the aggregate, are large enough to hold all the occupants of the
primary enclosure at the same time comfortably. The resting surfaces must be elevated, impervious to moisture,
and be able to be easily cleaned and sanitized, or easily replaced when soiled or worn. Corrected during the
inspection.3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an excessive accumulation of feces in the outdoor sections of eight sheltered enclosures. The licensee
states she was unable to clean the enclosures for four days due to inclement weather. Excessive accumulation of
feces and food waste can attract pests, increase odors, and play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must
removed excreta and food waste from primary enclosures daily, and from under primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats
contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. To be corrected by 1
December 2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Margaret A Shaver, VMO, and Kendall Lundy,
ACI in attendance.
