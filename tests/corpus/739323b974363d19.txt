CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on at least three metal entryway doors. Four
dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in shelter housing. The affected area covers approximately 25
to 50 percent of the metal entryway doors. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta
and other disease hazards. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease
or health risks. Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the animals. When primary enclosures are
not regularly cleaned and then sanitized, it doesn't ensure that the various types of germs (such as viruses,
bacteria, parasites, etc.) have been killed. Proper cleaning and then sanitizing the primary enclosures can help to
eliminate disease and health risks. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces which any dog comes in contact with
must be sanitized at least once every two weeks to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and
other disease hazards. Correct by 5/19/17.
