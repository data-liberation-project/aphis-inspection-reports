2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
On February 17, 2016, a group of bats was placed in a transport enclosure so as to be taken to a scale to be
weighed, as part of a study. Although the handler was experienced, and this procedure had been carried out
previously without incident, upon removing the bats from the enclosure it was discovered that four had perished,
presumably from the group having crowded into a corner.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
harm to the animals. The facility self-reported this incident, and immediately took steps to prevent a recurrence,
including reducing the number of bats to be placed in the transport enclosure, and additional supervision at the time
of weighing. This incident was initially investigated at the time of the last (3/23/16) routine inspection, but additional
pathology reports were still pending at that time.
Corrected prior to inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
