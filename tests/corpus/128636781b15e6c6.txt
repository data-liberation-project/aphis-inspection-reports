2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*****There was not an identifiable attendant present at all times when the public is allowed access to the reindeer
exhibit. The public was allowed in the area surrounding the enclosure that houses two reindeer. The enclosure
fencing consisted of livestock panels with horizontal bars spaced approximately twelve inches apart. The public
could stand next to the panels and reach inside the enclosure. The absence of an attendant endangers the health
of the animals by allowing activity (rough handling, improper feeding, etc.) that is harmful to the animals. The
licensee must ensure that when the public is present an easily identifiable attendant is present in these areas. The
licensee corrected this non-compliance during the inspection.
To be corrected from this date forward.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
This inspection was conducted at a travel site in West Valley City, Utah.
