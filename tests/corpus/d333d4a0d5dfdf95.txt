2.50(a)(2) Repeat

Time and method of identification.
There were 5 puppies being housed within enclosures in the whelping room with no visible method of identification
present on the puppies nor on the enclosures. Licensee was also unable to accurately identify whelp date and dam for a
poodle puppy named "Blackie" located in the living room. Licensee stated the puppy was born in February 2022. The
puppy was found to have fully emerged adult canine teeth and retained deciduous canine teeth when examined by the
inspector.
Without a visible means of identification at the puppy or enclosure level, incorrect identification of animals may occur. The
ability to accurately identify animals is particularly important when having to identify animals for treatment or medication
purposes.
Live puppies or kittens less than 16 weeks of age shall be identified by an official tag, legible tattoo or plastic identification
collar or other suitable means as identified under 2.51.

3.1(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
Multiple accumulated non-husbandry items and clutter were observed in house areas where dogs are kept and allowed to
roam. There were 8 dogs roaming inside the house at the time of inspection.
Accumulation of clutter and supplies not necessary for daily husbandry practices can hinder the ability to adequately clean
and sanitize dog contact areas. Clutter may also predispose to vermin and pest infestation.
Animal areas inside housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment. furniture, and stored


materials.
Non-compliance under 3.1(b) has previously been noted on inspections and reports dated 25 MARCH 2021 and 04 DEC
2019.
3.1(c)(1)(i) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
Ten primary enclosures located on the south side of the kennel building were found to have areas of corroded and
perforated tin along the interior floor and wall junctions and interior surfaces around the dog egress/entry doors to the
exterior runs. These corroded and perforated surfaces are in dog contact areas and prevent adequate cleaning and
sanitation of these dog contact surfaces.
Surfaces of housing areas must be free of excessive rust that prevents required cleaning and sanitation, or affects the
structural strength of the surface.
Non-compliance under 3.1(c)(1)(i) previously noted on prior inspection and report dated 25 MARCH 2021..
3.1(c)(2) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
During inspection there were visible gaps in flooring observed in the south room, whelping room and the kitchen areas of
the house where dogs are allowed to roam.
Broken and loose flooring with exposed gaps may allow moisture, urine and excreta to build up between or underneath
the floor surface and floor tiles.. This makes it difficult to adequately clean and sanitize those floor areas in which dogs are
being kept.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized, must be
replaced when worn or soiled.


Non-compliance under 3.1(c)(2) has been previously cited on previous inspections and reports dated 04 DEC 2019, 21
AUG 2019.
3.6(a)(2)(i) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
Two primary enclosures located on the south side of the kennel building were found to have areas of corroded tin with
exposed sharp points on interior wall surfaces that are in potential direct contact with dogs in these enclosures. The
corroded tin with sharp points and edges pose a potential injury risk to dogs occupying the kennels.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points which could injure the dogs.
Non-compliance under 3.6(a)(2)(i) previously cited on inspection and report dated 21 AUG 2019.
3.11(b)(2) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Buildup of grime and debris is present on the floors and items located in rooms in the house where dogs are kept and
allowed to roam. There is dense accumulation of grime and debris around door threshold/room entry areas in the house
and also on the interior surface of the back door. There is also a strong odor of urine in the kitchen and south room of
the house. Eight dogs were present and roaming in the house at the time of inspection.
Buildup and grime is also present on the walls and floor surfaces of enclosures in the main kennel building where dogs
are housed.
Buildup of grime and debris on surfaces makes it difficult to adequately clean and sanitize the affected surfaces. Strong
odors may also be an indication of inadequate cleaning and sanitation.
Primary enclosures and enclosure furnishings used for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of
the methods prescribed in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt,
debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.


Non-compliance under 3.11 (b)(2) was previously identified on previous inspections and reports dated 16 JUNE 2021, 25
MARCH 2021 and 04 DECEMBER 2019.
3.11(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
During inspection, a broken gate was observed to be partially laying on the ground on the east side of the back yard
where dogs are allowed to exercise. Three dogs were present in the back yard at the time of inspection. The gate
appears to be part of a temporary pen set up in the back yard.
The broken gate is a potential foot or leg hazard to dogs in the back yard.
Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in
good repair to protect the health and well-being of animals.
