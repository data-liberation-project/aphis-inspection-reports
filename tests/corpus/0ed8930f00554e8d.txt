SANITATION.
There is a metal trough container in the breeder room housing 5 adult and 2 juvenile guinea pigs. The floor is
covered with a moist feces/bedding mixture and has an ammonia odor detectable with the head lowered to the
upper reaches of the enclosure. For their comfort and health, and as part of a good disease control program,
guinea pig enclosures must be cleaned frequently enough to avoid ammonia build up at the level of the animals,
and dry, clean areas within the enclosure must be provided.
The guinea pigs must be transferred to a clean enclosure, and/or their enclosure must be cleaned and sanitized and
fresh clean bedding provided. Correct by 19 August 2014.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are 3 small wood and wire rabbit hutches in a row outside in the zoo. In the shelter box of the center hutch,
the flooring has come loose from the support frame in one of the corners leaving a gap of 2 - 3 inches. As it is, it
would be possible for the animal to injure itself, or for a small predator such as a snake to enter the enclosure. As
the gap widens, the animal might escape, or larger predators could enter.
The shelter box must be repaired, removed, or replaced to avoid injury to the animal. Correct by 20 August 2014
An exit interview was conducted with the owner.
