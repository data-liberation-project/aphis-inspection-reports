Facilities, outdoor.
There are two enclosures housing two fennec foxes and two prairie dogs that are not contained within a 6ft perimeter
fence. A perimeter fence must be strong and tall enough to prevent entry of unauthorized people and animals, and to act
as a secondary containment system in the event that an animal escapes from its primary enclosure. Correct by
maintaining a perimeter fence around the two enclosures that is at least 6 feet tall and 3 feet away from the primary
enclosures, or by obtaining a variance from USDA. A perimeter fence must also be maintained around any existing or
new exotic animal enclosures in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations.
Correct prior to the next relicense inspection.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class C license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by November 19th, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the
license fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License
Inspection.



Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
