2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Agricultural Guide Chapter 9 page 103.
Thirty-eight of a flock of fifty-three turkey poults approximately 2 weeks of age died between September 1 and
September 2, 2017. This incident had not been reported to the IACUC as of the date of this inspection. The IACUC
last met on September 14, 2017.
On the morning of September 1, 2017, approximately 22 turkey poults in one housing room were found dead by the
caretaker. According to the caretaker, several other poults appeared to be severely depressed at that time. Over
the next 24 to 48 hours, several other poults died. The daily observation (NCAH Animal Care and Use Log Sheets)
sheet posted on the animal housing room door stated that a total of 38 died during this incident.
The daily observation sheet for this group of birds begin August 17, 2017 with no room temperatures recorded until
September 1st when it was noted the room was 64°F in the morning when the caretakers arrived to find the dead
birds. The caretaker stated that this room is normally maintained at a temperature of approximately 72°F. These
birds are maintained in this room with two heat lamps. Additionally, the facility was not monitoring the temperatures
in the areas under the heat lamps.
The HVAC system was examined and adjusted the same day. Since September 2nd, the NCAH Animal Care and
Use Log Sheets record the High/Low room temperatures for the surviving birds between 68-73°F. For poults, the
housing temperature surrounding the brooding areas that allow birds to move toward or away from a separate heat
source (such as heat lamps) should be maintained at 68 to 77°F (Ag Guide pg 116).
A gross necropsy performed by a staff veterinarian on one bird revealed no significant findings. Four birds were
sent for pathology/necropsy. This pathology report states: “…Laboratory Diagnosis: Inanition…” (exhaustion
caused by a lack of nourishment) “and dehydration. High magnesium/manganese…” and “…Gross pathology: 4/4
dry, dark, shanks (dehydration – picture). 4/4 empty crops. 4/4 atrophied intestines with enlarged gall bladder…” A
feed sample was also submitted with results pending.
Thermoregulatory mechanisms are poorly developed in poults (Ag guide pg 116) making adequate ambienttemperatures important for their health and comfort. Also, the necropsy report suggests lack of nutrition (inanition).
The physical environment afforded by a poultry research or teaching facility should not put birds at undue risk of
injury or expose them to conditions that would be likely to cause unnecessary distress or disease (Ag guide pg 103)
Correct by: From this date forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
