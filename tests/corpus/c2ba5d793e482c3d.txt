Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of the inspection, the licensee could not present the current inventory of animals on hand, nor any records of
acquisition and disposition to justify the apparent changes noted from the last inspection inventory to the current counts at
the time of inspection. The prior inspection inventory (verified on 02/16/2022) listed two raccoons, two guinea pigs, and
zero rabbits; the current counts reveal three raccoons, seven guinea pigs and one rabbit. Records containing the
required information for animals disposed of or acquired for use in regulated activities, including those offspring born on
premises, are necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their humane care and use. The licensee shall make, keep
and maintain records of acquisition and disposition of all animals that fully and correctly disclose the required information.

Facilities, general.
In an enclosure containing one adult male bobcat named, "Maui," there is a metal shelter structure on the ground that has
holes with sharp edges where the metal has rusted through, extending upward ~1-2.5” from where the sides meet the
ground. The shelter also has areas where flashing does not lay flat, creating sharp edges in some places. In the same
enclosure there is also a wooden hideaway shelter box constructed of unsealed plywood that is gray and splintered, with


the floor of the structure appearing soiled/wet and beginning to sag. Shelters with sharp edges or that are not structurally
sound can cause injury to animals.
The licensee must ensure that indoor and outdoor facilities are structurally sound and are maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.

Sanitation.
There is discarded twine on the ground inside a pen accessible to two adult camels, one adult llama, one zedonk, one
zebra and one adult alpaca. This material poses a risk of illness due to ingestion or injury due to entrapment.
In the commissary area, there is an accumulation of dried organic matter on the food preparation island. There is a
brownish film on the front of the cabinets and inside the handles of the drawers and cabinets that is sticky and hardened
in some places. Failure to clean food preparatory areas encourages microbial growth and attracts insects and vermin,
which can contaminate fresh food and cause illness to the animals.
Premises shall be kept clean, free of trash accumulation, and in good repair in order to protect animals from injury and
illness and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in the regulations.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
