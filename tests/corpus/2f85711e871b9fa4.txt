exhibitor and the attending veterinarian establishing standards of care for the animals. Failure to have a complete
PVC could jeopardize the health and well-being of the animals. The facility should establish and maintain a PVC to
include all the regulated animals at the facility.

***The primary enclosure housing 1 raccoon had a climbing platform/apparatus which had frayed edges with long
strands of the carpet fibers accessible. The frayed strands pose a risk to this animal for ingestion and intestinal
obstruction. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

WATERING.
***The primary enclosure housing 1 beaver uses a dive pool for the available potable water source. At the time of
the inspection, the water was very turbid and full of debris and would not be considered safe for drinking. The
licensee stated the beaver had no other source of drinkable water but the facility would add another source of water
to the enclosure.
If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health
and comfort of the animal. Frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of the
animal. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
