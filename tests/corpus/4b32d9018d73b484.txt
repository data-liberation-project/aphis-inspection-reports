ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection, one of the 4 rabbits ("Minerva") was observed to have a black/grey colored debris in the left
ear canal during a routine check of the animals in this enclosure (this rabbit did not exhibit any signs of head
shaking, head tilting, scratching, or hematomas). This inspector was concerned that this rabbit had ear mites in this
ear. The facility wanted to confirmed (or refute) the inspector's tentative diagnoses and their attending veterinarian
obtained an ear swab sample which confirmed the presence of ear mites.
This rabbit previously had ear mites on 5/19/15. The veterinarian instructed that this rabbit be treated for one day,
rechecked in 2 weeks, and then monthly thereafter. The medical records indicated that the rabbit was initially
treated, but never reexamined as per the veterinarian's instructions.
The amount of the debris observed in the ear canal would indicate that this infection has been present for several
weeks, and the attending veterinarian agreed with this assessment.
The rabbit was treated for this case of ear mites during the inspection, and is due for a re-exam in 2 weeks as per
the veterinarian's instruction. All animals shall be observed daily in sufficient detail to assess their health and well
being, taking into account previous history of disease &/or other conditions that may be prevalent to a particular
species, to minimize the discomfort of affected animals as well as the possibly of disease transmission to other
susceptible animals. A mechanism for direct & frequent caretaker communication is required so that timely
information about animal health & well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian to reduce the risk of further
spread of the disease to the affected animal as well as other susceptible animals
