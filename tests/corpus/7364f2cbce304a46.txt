3.6(a)(2)(ix)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On today's inspection, there are 7 adult dogs being housed in a primary enclosure located in the barn. The walls of
the enclosure are constructed of wood and stone type materials. In addition, the flooring is constructed of dirt and
savings. These areas are not constructed of materials that allow for proper cleaning or sanitation. The Licensee
must ensure that all primary enclosures, including the enclosure in the barn, are constructed of materials that
enable all surfaces in contact with the dogs to be readily cleaned and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of
this subpart.

3.11
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
On today's inspection, over 50% of the food receptacles have a build up of dirt, debris, food wast or excreta.
The only food receptacle currently being used in the enclosure inside the barn was over half way filled with dirt and
debris. In addition, 5 food receptacles in the kennel and/or whelping area had a brown to black built up on/under
the lip of the receptacle where the dogs access their food. Improper cleaning exposes the dogs to unnecessary
disease hazards. The Licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are cleaned and sanitized at least once every
2 weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
