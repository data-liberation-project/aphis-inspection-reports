3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the Jacobs sheep enclosure, a section of wire fence was detached from the adjacent support post leaving a
small gap with multiple exposed sharp points. This is a potential source of injury to the enclosed animals. Fencing
and other structures must be maintained in good repair to ensure the animals are safely contained within their
enclosure.

3.131(a)
SANITATION.
- In the coatimundi enclosure, the cage had been spray cleaned. The straw bedding in the shelter had apparently
not been removed, and was thoroughly wet. Bedding in the shelter will prevent the shelter itself from being
adequately cleaned. Wet bedding may prevent the enclosed animal from even using the shelter, and could
potentially cause skin irritation and discomfort if used by the animal. Shelter bedding should be completely emptied
prior to enclosure cleaning. Once the shelter itself is dry, fresh bedding can be added as necessary.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
- In the walk through park, there was a large wasp nest at the top of the porcupine enclosure. Numerous wasps
were present on the nest, and flying around the area. Insects are a potential source of injury or irritation to enclosed
animals. The nest must be removed, and an effective pest control program implemented.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
