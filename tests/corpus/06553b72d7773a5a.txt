ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care does not include bobcats. Bobcats are now present at the facility. It is
essential that these animals be included in the program of veterinary care. Veterinary recommendations for care of
these animals should be included in the program. APHIS inspectors then use this information while inspecting the
animals in order to determine if veterinary recommendations are being followed by the facility. This program is a
valuable tool in order to ensure the continuing health and comfort of these animals. Bobcats need to be included on
the program of veterinary care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The brown goat noted on the inspection of 8-13-14 still has a long toe on the outside of its right rear foot. A white
goat was also observed with long toes on both of its rear feet. These goats need to have these toes trimmed. Long
overgrown hoofs can cause conformation issues and joint problems. Trim these goats' hoofs.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Two foxes were acquired since the time of the last inspection with no acquisition information recorded for them.
Information must be recorded for all animal aquisition and dispositions by the facility. This information is essential in
order for APHIS inspectors to monitor animal death losses by the facility and also determine that all animals are
obtained from legitimate sources. Record all animal acquisitions and dispositions.

2.131(c)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.The barrier door to the service area for the enclosures housing the tigers Xena, Sher Kahn, Kahn and Sundar was
not locked. The president of the facility was offsite when the inspectors first arrived at the facility. Volunteer
employees had access to the large cat area. The barrier gate to the enclosure housing the crab eating macaque
was not locked. Volunteer workers are considered to be members of the public. Barriers must be in place and
locked when volunteers are working in this area unless the facility president is in direct supervision of the
volunteers. Volunteers cannot have access to these dangerous animals when the president is not present. Contact
with these dangerous animals could be potentially fatal to a volunteer worker. It could lead to lethal consequences
for the animals as well, if local health officials would require rabies testing. This test requires removal of the brain.
Secure and lock all barrier gates and doors.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The two domestic cats are housed in an enclosure that contains one litter box. This litter box had excessive feces
in it. Numerous flies were noted in and around this enclosure. Primary enclosures are to be cleaned of fecal
material daily. Excessive feces in the litter box can lead to odor problems. It can also be a potential source of
disease and pest control issues. Excessively dirty litter boxes can also be a source of discomfort to the cats as they
will hesitate to use the boxes when they are overly soiled. The cats in this enclosure were defecating outside the
box which could result in soiling of the cats and ingestion of feces as they groom themselves. This can lead to
parasite and other potential infections. Clean litter boxes daily.
3.83 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacle in the Japanese macaque enclosure has a layer of algae slime lining its interior. Water
receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to keep them free from contamination. Unclean
water receptacles can affect water palatability and lead to decreased water consumption. This can have an adverse
effect on the health of the animal in this enclosure. Contaminated water can also lead to other potential health
issues for this macaque such as bacterial or parasitic infection. Clean this water receptacle as often as needed to
keep the water in the receptacle clean and sanitary.
3.84(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The enclosure housing two lemurs contained an excessive amount of fecal material. Excessive fecal material can
lead to disease, pest and odor control issues. The lemurs can become contaminated by lying in the fecal material
and subsequently ingesting it while grooming. This could lead to potential bacterial or parasitic infections for these
animals. Clean this enclosure on a more frequent basis. This enclosure needs to be cleaned.3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The produce cooler contains spoiled tomatoes that were becoming soft. Molding cucumbers, green beans and
broccoli were in the produce cooler. Black rotting lettuce and deteriorating apples were in the produce cooler. The
refrigerator in the warm room contained deteriorating apples, lettuce, cauliflower and green peppers. Spoiled
produce must be removed promptly to prevent contamination of food intended to be fed to the animals. Sort and
remove spoiled produce promptly. This cooler and the refrigerator need to be cleaned and have spoiled and
deteriorating items removed in order to prevent contamination of food items that will be fed to the animals.
The meat cooler had a dead raccoon stored in it. The cooler had a horrible ammonia like odor mixed with the odor
of rotten and decaying meat. This odor makes it very hard to determine if the meat items stored in this cooler are fit
for animal consumption. Clean the cooler, identify the source of the odor and eliminate it. Do not store items not
intended to be animal feed in the meat cooler.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food receptacle boxes for the enclosure housing two American black bears and the enclosure housing two
Asian black bears contained a large amount of rotting food debris. Any food fed in this box is going to be
contaminated by the rotting material present in the box. These feeders need to be cleaned and made sanitary to
ensure that the food fed to the bears is wholesome and free from bacterial or pest infestation which could result in
health issues for the bears.
3.130 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacle for the enclosure containing the tigers known as Lenny and Squiggy was empty at 12:15 PM.
At the direction of the inspectors these tigers were offered water. When water was introduced to the receptacle,
both tigers immediately approached and began drinking. One tiger drank continuously for about 40 seconds and
the other tiger drank continuously for about 60 seconds. This is too long for these tigers to drink. They are not
being offered water frequently enough. Lack of water consumption can lead to serious renal problems for these
tigers. The water receptacle for the grizzly bear contained about one inch of slimy algae filled water. The water
receptacle for the white tiger contained green water. The water receptacle in the enclosure containing one coyote
contained green water. The water receptacle for the enclosure housing three foxes had a layer of dirt in in it. These
receptacles are not being kept clean and sanitary. Dirty water receptacles can affect water palatability. It can also
lead to contamination of the water by pathogenic organisms. Water palatability is very important as poor water
palatability can lead to decreased consumption. Decreased water consumption can lead to renal function problems.
The majority of the large cats at this facility are advanced in age, making them especially susceptible to kidney
problems. Clean these water receptacles. Clean them as often as need to keep the water clean.3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The shelter boxes for the tigers known as Lenny and Squiggy and the tiger Pandora contained excessive bones and
rotting food waste. The enclosure for the tiger known as JJ contained excessive fecal material. The American
black bear den box contained rotting food waste. The Asian black bear den box contained excessive food waste.
The enclosure housing the white tiger contained excessive bones and fecal material. The shelter in the enclosure
housing one goat contained a large amount of fecal material. These enclosures need to be cleaned on a more
frequent basis. The rotting material present in these animals'(cid:25) enclosures and shelter boxes can contaminate these
animals as they lay in their enclosures. The animals can ingest this material when they groom themselves. Not
removing old food waste promptly can lead to contamination of new food. Ingesting this rotten material can lead to
potential health problems. Clean these enclosures more frequently to prevent a buildup of food and fecal waste to
minimize odors and prevent potential health problems.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The alleyway leading to the butcher area as well as the area directly outside the building housing the butcher area
and the alleyway and building next to the butcher area are filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash,
buckets, tires and fencing. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests and numerous
rodent holes were located throughout the facility. All this material must be removed to help control pests.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There were rodent holes located inside the shelter box for the cougar enclosure. Rodent holes were located going
under the shelter box for the cougar enclosure. Multiple rodent holes were noted in the service alleyway for the
tiger enclosures located on leopard row as well as in the tiger enclosures. Rodent feces was also noted in this
alleyway. A rodent hole was noted going under the den area for the tiger JJ's enclosure. Rodent holes were noted
in the service area for the tigers JJ and Pandora. A rodent hole was noted going under the shelter box of the Asian
black bear enclosure. There was rodent feces on the door to the Asian black bear shelter. Rodents can be carriers
of disease which may be harmful to the animals housed in these areas. A more effective means of pest control
must be established for the facility.3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. The president of the facility stated to
APHIS inspectors that there was no formalized scheduling of workers at the facility. A lack of properly trained
employees can result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Animal numbers
must be reduced or more properly trained workers need to be added. Workers need to be trained in the basic
needs of the animals at the facility. Topics should include at a minimum: the importance of adequate water, the
need for adequate bedding during times of extreme weather, the importance of cleaning and good housekeeping
procedures, proper diet for different species of animals and observation of animals for abnormal conditions and
behaviors. This training should be done in conjunction with the attending veterinarian or his designee. A list of
topics covered and attendees must be documented for review by APHIS. A facility schedule needs to be developed
that allows for adequate employee coverage in order to address all animal husbandry needs. Also the facility
president is the only one authorized to work with the dangerous animals at the facility. All animal work must be
done with the dangerous animals under his direct supervision. This limits the amount of time that is available to
service the dangerous animal enclosures as the facility president is often offsite. This leads to poor sanitation in the
dangerous animal enclosures. The facility president needs to find a way to be onsite more or hire trained staff to
help run the facility.
The inspection was conducted with the facility president on 9-9-14. An exit interview was conducted at that time
and all non-compliant items were explained to the facility president. A formal exit interview was conducted with the
facility president on 9-11-14.
