2.126(c)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
In accordance with 2.126(c) a written itinerary is required to be submitted to the Regional Director no fewer than 2
days in advance of any travel and shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of
any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. As defined in the
regulation, the itinerary shall include the following:
(i) The name of the person who intends to exhibit the animal and transport the animal for exhibition purposes,
including any business name and current Act license or registration number and, in the event that any animal is
leased, borrowed, loaned, or under some similar arrangement, the name of the person who owns such animal;
(ii) The name, identification number or identifying characteristics, species (common or scientific name), sex and age
of each animal; and
(iii) The names, dates, and locations (with addresses) where the animals will travel, be housed, and be exhibited,
including all anticipated dates and locations (with addresses) for any stops and layovers that allow or require
removal of the animals from the transport enclosures. Unanticipated delays of such length shall be reported to the
AC Regional Director the next APHIS business day. APHIS Regional offices are available each weekday, except on
Federal holidays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
As a Class C exhibitor without a primary site, submitting an itinerary for the traveling animals is crucial to ensuring
that the animals are maintained in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. An internet search documented
evidence of Rockets K9 Comets performing at the Santa Cruz County Fair on September 19th, 2015 and press
coverage by KXNews in Minot, North Dakota of Rockets K9 Comets performing at the North Dakota State Fair in
late July, 2015. The KXNews coverage included video of Ashley Hoskins, one of the licensees. There have been
no itineraries submitted to the Regional Director or AC West this year.
Itineraries must be submitted to the Regional Director with the required information no fewer than 2 days in advance
of any travel. Exhibitors who repeatedly provide less than 48 hours(cid:25) notice will be subjected to increased scrutiny
under the Act.
To be Corrected from this day forward.
