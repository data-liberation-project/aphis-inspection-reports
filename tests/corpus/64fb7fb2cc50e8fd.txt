Watering.
Three porcupines are in an outdoor enclosure. Water was not accessible at the start of the inspection. Water was then
provided and all three porcupines went to the bucket readily. Each one drank water for more than one minute.

Water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal and to prevent excessive thirst
and dehydration. Correct by providing access to drinkable water more often. Corrected during the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
