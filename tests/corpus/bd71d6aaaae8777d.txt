3.130 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
There was an aquarium containing five gerbils in the animal room of the facility. They were all acting nervous,
running about the aquarium appearing anxious. I then noticed that they did not have any water in their water bottle.
I asked that they be given water. All five ran immediately to the water bottle and began shoving and fighting each
other to get a turn at the water bottle. As each one drink its fill another one would shove him out of the way and
began drinking at a rapid pace. This drinking frenzy went on for several minutes until all five gerbils drank their fill
and nearly emptied the drinking bottle of water. Such frantic behavior indicates the animals were extremely thirsty
and were not being provided water often enough to keep them hydrated. Water is essential to life and must be
provided to all animals in sufficient quantities and frequency to maintain health. A regular program of checking and
supplying water to all the animals at the facility must be in place and maintained.
Correct by: Water was supplied to gerbils during inspection.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The floor and areas under the enclosures had an accumulation of wood shavings used for bedding and dry feed.
The areas under and around the enclosures need to be swept and cleaned of all refuse materials to maintain a
clean environment for the animals and to prevent the possible growth of mold, mildew, and fungus. A regular
program of sweeping and cleaning the floor and under and around the enclosures needs to be in place and
maintained.
