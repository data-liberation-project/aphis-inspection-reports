ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
** I arrived at the facility at 1:30 pm and called the owner. The owner didn't answer so I left a message. While I
waited I noticed the owner walking up about ten minutes later. She stated she was unavailable to conduct an
inspection at that time so I told her it would be an attempted inspection. I left the facility at 2:00 pm. A responsible
adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30 pm on 09/24/2015. A
responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
