Handling of animals.
At the time of the inspection there were 10 people in the kangaroo encounter area with 3 kangaroos and only one
attendant. The one attendant in this area was not able to simultaneously monitor multiple encounters with different
kangaroos. Children were observed feeding /petting one animal while the attendant was busy with another animal.
Facility employees stated that the protocol is to allow no more than 4-6 people with one attendant present during
kangaroo interactions. The animals and/or the public can be injured if adequate supervision is not supplied during these
types of encounters. During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal
and to the public. An adequate number of attendants must be present to properly supervise public encounters. A facility
representative stated they will increase the number of attendants in the encounter area going forward, whenever there are
larger groups of people.

Handling of animals.


At time of the inspection, one male 12 yr. old Lemur was observed shivering for minutes, multiple times by the inspector.
The lemur was recently converted from an indoor to outdoor enclosure. Shivering is an indication that the animal is cold.
The Lemur is housed in an outdoor enclosure with no source of heat. The ambient temperature outside of the enclosure
at the time of this inspection was ~33 degrees Fahrenheit. A temperature gun reflected a reading of 52.9 degrees
Fahrenheit on the ground inside the enclosure. Improper housing, especially considering climatic conditions, can
negatively impact the well-being and health of the animal, and not only cause distress, but potentially lead to death. When
climatic conditions present a threat to an animal’s health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate
the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature and time that is
detrimental to the animal’s health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal’s age, species, breed,
overall health status, and acclimation.

The facility elected to move the lemur indoors temporarily until they determine a long-term solution.

Outdoor housing facilities.
At the time of the inspection, a 12 yr. old male lemur and 2 yr. old female Lemur were housed in individual outdoor
enclosures. Both lemurs were recently converted from an indoor to outdoor enclosure. There is no heated shelter
available to the animals and the ambient temperature was 33 degrees. A temperature gun indicated the temperature was
52.9 degrees on the ground of one enclosure. The attending veterinarian confirmed she had not determined that these
animals were acclimated to low temperatures and had not approved their exclusive housing outdoors. Only non-human
primates that are acclimated, as determined by the attending veterinarian, to the prevailing temperature and humidity at


the outdoor housing facility during the time of year they are at the facility, and that can tolerate the range of temperatures
and climatic condition known to occur at the facility at that time of year without stress or discomfort, may be kept in
outdoor facilities.

Facilities, outdoor.
The shelter housing one adult, female capybara did not adequately protect and prevent discomfort to the animal as it
allowed heat to escape and an air draft into it, through the many gaps between the single layer of wooden floor planks.
There also was no bedding on the floor of the shelter, where employees stated that hay should have been added. Lack of
appropriate shelter for the local climatic conditions can negatively impact the well-being of the animal and/or cause
distress, and possibly death. Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species
concerned shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such
animals. Individual animals shall be acclimated before they are exposed to the extremes of the individual climate.
Bedding hay was added at time of the inspection.
Corrected at time of the inspection.

Feeding.
Since arriving at the facility, the young male giraffe was fed 3 – 5 pounds of produce (potatoes, carrots, cucumbers, kale,
and apples), rye crackers along with free choice alfalfa hay and approximately 4 pounds of herbivore pellets. Romaine
lettuce was fed by the staff and by members of the public throughout the day. Records indicate he did not consume all the
pellets offered each day and that no additional browse had been provided once he ate what was growing in his enclosure.


Approximately one month after arriving at the facility, he developed a life- threatening neurological condition which
veterinary records indicate was diet related. A diet consisting of large amounts of produce with little browse and roughage
is not an adequate diet for a giraffe and may result in health problems and death. Proper and adequate nutrition are
essential to maintaining the health and well being of the animal. The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from
contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The diet shall be
prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal.

Employees.
As cited in feeding, the employees were not knowledgeable about adequate nutrition for the animal who became ill. Not
only was the animal not fed a proper diet for the species, but also measures were not taken when the employees saw he
was not consuming adequate amounts of various types of feed to avoid any nutrition-related health problems. As a result,
the animal nearly expired one month after his arrival. Adequately trained employees are vital to the overall health and
well-being of the animals, as these animals can suffer deleterious effects, and possibly death, if acceptable levels of
husbandry are not maintained. Enough adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally
acceptable level of husbandry practices, and such practices shall be under a supervisor who has a background in animal
care.
