*** I arrived at the facility at 4:00 pm.I drove to an area with service and called the owner several times and left a
message. I got in touch with the owner and was told that they were unavailable to participate in an inspection at that
time. I told them that this would be an attempted inspection. I left the premises at 4:30 pm.
