SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** Currently the three southern flying squirrels are housed in a 3 -tier ferret type enclosure. This enclosure does not
allow the animals to engage in species appropriate behavior of flying/gliding. Flying for these animals is considered
a normal postural movement and they need to be provided with an enclosure that allows them this freedom of
movement for their health and well being.

SANITATION.
*** The flying squirrels were moved into a 3-tier enclosure and placed in a storage room adjacent to a classroom.
The storage room has excess materials including boxes, a table, animal mounts etc. This room does not promote or
facilitate good husbandry or housekeeping practices for these animals. The animals need to be moved to another
area for their health and well being.
