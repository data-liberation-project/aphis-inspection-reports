HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 25 October 2016, female orangutan,"Tao" escaped from the outdoor portion of the enclosure through a defect in
the enclosure's stainless steel woven wire mesh. She returned to the enclosure on her own about 10 minutes later
and was secured without further incident. The escape put this orangutan at risk for injury or death if the recapture
had not been safe. The escape also put patrons of the zoo at risk for injury by the orangutan. Housing facilities for
nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species of
nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from
injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. To be corrected from this point
forward.
This was a focused inspection of the lion and orangutan facilities.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
