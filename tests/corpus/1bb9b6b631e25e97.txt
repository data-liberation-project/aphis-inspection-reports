ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A two week old female pygmy goat was observed breathing at a rapid rate. Although no other issues were noted,
the young goat's elevated respiratory rate could indicate the presence of a serious medical condition.
The licensee must have the animal examined by a veterinarian by October 10, 2017. All veterinary
recommendations and treatment records must be made available for review by APHIS personnel upon request.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
