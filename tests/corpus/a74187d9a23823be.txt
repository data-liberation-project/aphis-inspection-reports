2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
"Hache-Hi", a 16 year old male wolf was observed to have a stiff gait in his front legs and had front toenail and dew
claw overgrowth. Personnel say that it is difficult to trim his nails and report that his stiff gait is due to some arthritis
issues. Since overgrown toe nails can begin to affect an animals' gait and comfort, it is important the facility works
with the attending veterinarian to manage Hache-Hi's nails in a manner that is beneficial to his health and
well-being. The attending veterinarian must be consulted to develop a treatment plan for Hache-Hi. The treatment
plan must be documented and available for future inspections.
The facility has consulted the attending veterinarian on the wolves' diet and the recommendation was to include a
multivitamin supplement due to feeding an all-meat diet. The facility has been giving some joint health supplements
(LifeVantage and Springtime "Advanced Hip and Joint"), however these do not provide all the vitamins and
minerals needed by canine species being fed an all meat diet. An all meat diet without proper supplementation can
lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies in wolves and lead to further health problems. The facility must work with
the attending veterinarian to ensure that the diet for the wolves is properly supplemented.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
