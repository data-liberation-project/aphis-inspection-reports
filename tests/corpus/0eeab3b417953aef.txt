ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***During the inspection, it was noted from facility records that the licensee is not following the treatment plan from
her attending veterinarian regarding the female camel that was cited on inspection report dated Nov-10-2015. The
plan directs the licensee to separate the camel from the rest of the animals to ensure she receives her portion of
feed. On inspection, the female camel was commingled with the other 3 animals. The licensee's decision not to
follow the AV's plan as prescribed reduces the veterinarian's ability to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary
care. The licensee shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.
To be corrected by 1/14/16.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A female, adult brown and white (cid:28)gobex(cid:29) (Ibex x domestic goat cross) walked with an abnormal gate. It did not
walk with a smooth motion, but instead dropped its right front shoulder each time it stepped with that leg. The
hooves on both front legs were excessively long, to the point that they were curling causing the toes to rotate up
and out and the heel to drop. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which
could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility(cid:25)s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee
must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
*** The right eye of adult male coati mundi appeared abnormal. Approximately half of the iris, in the right eye, has a
milky-white, thickened opaque area. When asked, the licensee stated this animal has not been recently evaluated
by a veterinarian and the condition may have progressed. The licensee could not supply the APHIS personnel of
any evaluation done by the veterinarian regarding this animals. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems
including infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing.
Furthermore, not having clear vision can cause discomfort affecting the health and well-being of the animal and has
the potential for injury.
***The camel calf has an abnormal swelling on its left hind hock. The licensee stated the swelling appeared inOctober 2015 and was initially evaluated by the attending veterinarian. The AV prescribed an initial treatment of
antibiotics but those were discontinued as the swelling did not resolve following treatment. Since stopping antibiotic
treatment in October/November 2015, the veterinarian has not re-evaluated the swelling nor has any other
treatment been prescribed. The veterinarian did recommend diagnostic radiographs of the joint, but these have not
been performed. During the inspection, the calf was initially reluctant to stand. Once standing, it was reluctant to
bear weight and walked lame on the left hindlimb. Abnormal swelling and lameness can be indicators of disease
and often pain. They can result from numerous causes including both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to
contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis, treatment and re-evaluation can result in delays of
appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.
***The male ferret has generalized alopecia. When asked, the licensee stated she has been treating the ferret for
mange with advantage II (small cats). The licensee stated the attending veterinarian has not been contacted
regarding the condition of this animal. Additionally, the use of advantage II has not been approved for use by the AV
for the ferret. Alopecia is often an indicator of disease. It can result from numerous causes including both infectious
and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment can result in
delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.
***A newborn (24 hrs. old) male lamb appeared weak and was wheezing during the inspection. The licensee stated
the lamb was removed from its enclosure yesterday as it was weak and could not stand. The licensee has been
bottle-feeding the lamb since yesterday but no other treatment has been done. The licensee stated the AV has not
been contacted but had planned to call the AV today if the lamb did not get better. There are no directions in the
program of veterinary care regarding facility self-treatment for newborn lambs. Failure to contact the attending
veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment of weak and sick animals can result in delays of appropriate care
and prolong suffering of the animal.
The licensee must have these animals (coati, camel calf, ferret, lamb) examined by a veterinarian, to obtain
accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation
must be provided to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all
diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed
along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when
the medication is administered to the animals.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***The licensee stated to inspectors that a male Fennec Fox had been recently euthanized by Arizona Game and
Fish after biting the finger of a child visiting the facility. Review of acquisition/disposition records confirmed that a
male Fennec Fox was euthanized on Dec.13, 2015. At the time of the incident, this Fennec Fox was housed withinthe same cage as a female which is currently located within the gift shop area. Due to a lack of public barriers, the
child was able to stick his fingers into the fox enclosure. There are still no barriers provided which would prevent this
incident from recurring in the future. Failure to provide sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and
the viewing public may pose a risk of harm to the animal and to the public. A sufficient barrier system must be in
place to assure the safety of all animals and the public.
To be corrected by 1/27/16.
2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***There are not an adequate number of attendants present at all times when the public is allowed contact with the
animals. The public is allowed to walk through the facility, unescorted, on designated paths. The public is allowed to
contact and feed the animals. At the time of inspection, only two employees were present to watch the public
(approximately 11 people) throughout the entire facility. Additionally, one employee was escorting the APHIS
personnel on inspection and the other was cleaning enclosures. An adequate number of attendants is needed to
ensure the health and safety of the animals and to decrease the likelihood of activities (rough handling, improper
feeding, etc.) that are harmful to the animals.
To be corrected by 1/27/16.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following enclosures or structures within enclosures are in need of repair or replacement:
-Enclosure housing 7 gobex had enclosure fencing that was turned up and in with sharp points
-Enclosure housing 4 camels has a shade structure that is bent and twisted and is structurally unsound.
-Enclosure housing 3 female coatis has screws protruding from a wood resting surface. Additionally, the den boxes
and resting surface wood is heavily worn and soiled.
-Enclosure housing 1 ram and 1 female goat has broken fence wood (holes) with sharp wood edges.
-Enclosure housing 8 sheep has fencing with holes that are large enough for baby lambs to get out. APHIS
personnel witnessed one lamb get out of the enclosure during inspection.
-Enclosure housing 1 kinkajou has resting surfaces and wooden ladders that are heavily soiled.
-Enclosure housing covered species has a shade structure that is bent and twisted and is structurally unsound.
-Enclosure housing 13 goats has a metal structure that is excessively rusted at the bottom with sharp edges.
-Enclosure housing 1 fennec fox has a blanket with frayed edges. This poses a risk of injury through ingestion.
-Enclosure housing 8 sheep had a food trough with a rusted bottom that was missing in several sections with sharp
edges.
Facility enclosures and structures within enclosures that are not maintained pose a risk of injury to the animals and
can decrease the structural stability of the affected structures. The affected enclosure and structures must be
repaired or replaced. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protectthe animals from injury and to contain the animals securely.
3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The enclosure housing 13 goats did not have adequate shade to protect all of the animals from direct sunlight.
The area of shade provided to all animals was a 6 feet by 6 feet area. This area is not large enough to allow all of
the animals within the enclosure to be protected from direct sunlight. Inadequate protection from direct sunlight may
lead to overheating or discomfort from squinting.
To be corrected by 1/27/16.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
***Several enclosures (7 gobex, 4 camels, 10 sheep, 8 goats) had dirty water receptacles. There was a buildup of
green debris on the interior surface of the receptacles along with gravel, dirt and other debris on the bottom of the
receptacle. Additionally, several of the water receptacles were excessively rusted to the point they leak excessively
and cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. Water receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary
condition in order to ensure that the animals are provided with clean, potable water, to minimize disease hazards
and to ensure that they maintain adequate hydration. Water receptacles should be cleaned at a frequency that is
adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
***The licensee is not regularly involved in the day to day care of the animals and facilities, and she could not
provide basic information about the identity or condition of the animals when asked. The licensee stated that she
has 2 employees that are involved in the daily husbandry and facility maintenance. At the time of inspection, only 1
employee was on-site to complete daily husbandry for all the animals. The facility currently has approximately 140
animals of several different species. These species have complex medical, behavioral, nutritional, and other
husbandry needs. Conditions at the facility currently do not meet the professional level of husbandry practices
described in the regulations and standards. For example, during the inspection, 4 animals were identified with
veterinary care problems that weren(cid:25)t receiving appropriate care. At least 12 enclosures were in varying degrees of
disrepair or contained structures in disrepair(cid:20)this has been an ongoing problem that has been cited since October
2010.

Facilities are required to utilize a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professional
husbandry standards described in the regulations and standards to ensure that the animals are kept in appropriatelymaintained, sanitary facilities and receive appropriate monitoring, veterinary care, feeding, watering, and care.

The licensee must evaluate the current work load and staffing level and ensure that a sufficient number of
adequately trained employees are utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices
described in the regulations and standards.
