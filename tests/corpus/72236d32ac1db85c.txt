FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-In a walk-in freezer, multiple bags of food stored for a variety of covered species had a large accumulation of ice
covering them with several also being moist/wet to the touch. Facility manager stated that he recently discovered
that this walk-in freezer has not been functioning properly and that a repair person had been contacted for service.
-A plastic container used to store dry food for coyotes and foxes had a large opening in the container lid leaving it
unprotected from vermin.
Supplies of food must be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding,
or contamination by vermin to ensure the health and well-being of all animals. A system of food storage which
adequately protects the supplies of food for all animals must be in place.
