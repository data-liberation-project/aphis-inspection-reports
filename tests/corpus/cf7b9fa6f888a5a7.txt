2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An employee of the licensee was off site with a group of goats, sheep and one camel operating a small petting farm.
He was reportedly inside the area with the farm animals and while exiting left a metal panel partially open and 2
adult goats escaped. One of the goats was immediately caught and the other goat ran into a wooded area. The
public was chasing this goat and it was finally
caught after 45 minutes near a parking lot. Petting farm animals shall be handled as carefully as possible in a
manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. The licensee
shall make the needed adjustments to the portable farm fence to keep the animals secure at all times.
Correct from this day forward
(A focused inspection of the farm animals and exit interview was conducted at the licensees farm).
(A phone call to the attending veterinarian was conducted and no injuries reported).
