HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Location 10-8: The metal ductwork mounted on the ceiling that measured approximately 18"(cid:25) wide by 10" high
had 2 rectangular vents approximately 6 x 12 inches in size. A normal vent in this facility is comprised of a wire
mesh sheet and an inner louvered vent cover. One of the vents was missing a louvered vent cover and as a result
the inside of the ductwork could be seen. Escapes of non-human primates from their primary enclosures have
occurred at this facility as documented elsewhere in this inspection report. In the absence of a vent cover, the wire
mesh sheet would not be of sufficient strength to prevent an NHP that had escaped from its primary enclosure from
gaining access to the ductwork.
Per this Section of the Regulations, housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so
that they are kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals securely.
Facility corrected this item during the inspection by replacing the louvered vent cover and checking all other vents in
this facility.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***On 3/2/15 personnel discovered one Rhesus macaque outside its primary enclosure and loose in the room. The
NHP returned to its enclosure on its own. The animal was evaluated by veterinary staff and found to have
sustained injuries to the toe and tongue. The injuries were treated and the animal made a full recovery. The only
other NHP that was housed in the same room was also evaluated by veterinary staff and found to have a minor
superficial injury to the tongue that did not require any further treatment. Upon being notified of the escape, the
institution immediately looked into the incident. It was determined that a secondary method to secure the door,
such as a lock, had not been used and the NHP had managed to manipulate and unlatch the closing mechanism on
the door allowing it to escape.
***On 2/7/15 personnel discovered two of the four socially housed Cynomolgus macaques outside their primary
enclosure and loose in the room. The animals were returned to their primary enclosure and evaluated by veterinarystaff. One NHP was uninjured. The other NHP sustained injuries to the lip and finger that were treated, and the
animal made a full recovery. Upon being notified of the escape, the institution immediately looked into the incident.
It was determined that the locks on the enclosure had not been properly latched, and the NHPs had managed to
manipulate and open the locks allowing the animals to escape.
Per this Section of the Regulations, primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain
the
non-human primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.
The research facility promptly acted to address both of these incidents by conducting an investigation, reporting the
incident to OLAW and USDA, and immediately implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future
incidents.
This item has been corrected.
NOTE - This was a focused inspection of the animals, animal facilities, and selected IACUC records and
documents. Inspection conducted 6/1/15 through 6/3/15 with the exit interview held 6/3/15 on-site with facility
personnel.
