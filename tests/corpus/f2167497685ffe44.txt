3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The written program of veterinary care is incomplete and is not signed by the attending veterinarian. There is no plan for
scheduled sampling of dogs for the specific blood parasites and intestinal parasites as required in the regulations,
including the number of animals to be sampled. There is also no treatment plan for any dogs that test positive for these
parasites.
Parasites are a common cause of disease in dogs and, if undetected and not properly treated, can lead to serious illness
and even death. The facility must follow a complete and appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs. The program of
veterinary care must be completed and include plans for sampling and treatment for the blood and intestinal parasites
listed in the regulations; it must also be approved in writing by the attending veterinarian. The missing information must be
added to the program of veterinary care and it must be reviewed and signed by the attending veterinarian to ensure the
animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.
