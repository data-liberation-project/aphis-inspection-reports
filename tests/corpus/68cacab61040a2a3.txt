2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is not maintaining records of the current number of hamsters on hand at the facility.
Failure to maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the number of animals born, held, owned, acquired or
disposed of can make it difficult to identify trends in animal losses which could indicate disease conditions in the
hamsters.
The licensee must maintain records which disclose the number of animals born, held, owned, acquired, or disposed of.

3.25(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
During the inspection, a Syrian hamster was found dead in the wall vent of the third hamster room. The hamster had
escaped its enclosure, crawled into the vent, and was struck by the fan as evidenced by severe injuries to the front of the
animal's body.
Failure to provide structurally sound and well maintained enclosures can allow for the escape or entrapment of the
animals and lead to possible injury.
Housing facilities for hamsters must be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals


from injury, contain the animals, and restrict the entrance of other animals.

3.31(b)

Sanitation.
There is a build-up of dust, dirt, and cobwebs in several areas of the building. Within the food storage area, there is a
buildup of dust and cobwebs on the walls and the ceiling. The four animal rooms also have an accumulation of dust on
the walls, racks, window sills, vents, and filters.
Failure to clean animal facilities regularly can adversely affect the health of the hamsters and can potentially attract pests.
The facility must maintain the premise by keeping it clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
