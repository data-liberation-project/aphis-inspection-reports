2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A female Maltese (#40) had build up on most of her teeth. There was a heavy build-up of yellowish brown to dark
brown to grey material on the teeth. This abnormal build-up of material covered the majority of the teeth and
extended into the gum line. Most of the gums were reddened and inflamed. There was a creamy, whitish material
along the gum line. The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth
structures. This can be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall
health of the animal. The licensee must have this animal's mouth and teeth examined in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate dental treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the
animals in the facility. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Erika Leisner VMO, and Chad Proctor ACI.
