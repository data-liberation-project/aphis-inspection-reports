ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are 2 female Burmese Mountain dogs (#0338, #1551) that have very red, swollen ears with a buildup of a
thick brown material lining the inside of the ears. The right ear of #0338 is affected, and both ears on #1551 are
affected to the point where both ears are swollen almost closed with small open sores due to the moisture and
irritation.
The licensee has medicine for the condition as prescribed by his attending veterinarian, however the treatments
have been intermittent and not consistent enough to rid the infection.
The lack of follow through on medications and giving medicines for the proper amount of time can cause a health
issue to continue or become worse if left untreated, or when treated intermittently. This can cause the animal to be
in unnecessary pain or discomfort, or cause a treatable condition to become chronic.
The licensee must provide treatments as soon as possible and for the proper amount of time until the issue is
corrected, and keep contact with the attending veterinarian if the treatments are not working so that the issue can
be resolved as soon as possible.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are no identification cards on any of the whelped puppies enclosures that properly identify the Puppy ID# or
USDA #. While there are puppy records being kept, there is no identification on the primary enclosures of the
whelped puppies(6 Burmese, 4 Akita, 4 Cavalier) ,
Complete and accurate identification is important of all regulated animals at the facility for proper management and
traceability of the animals.
The licensee must provide ID for puppies that are 16 weeks of age or older or when they are whelped, they need tohave the proper identification according to sec 2.50 and have tags, plastic collars or a cage card (for up to 16 weeks
of age)with the puppy ID# , USDA# with the letters USDA on the card.

FEEDING.
There are several feeding receptacles' that have moldy food in the bottoms of them, in the corners of the feeders
where the dogs are able to ingest the food. The food is covered with a white fuzzy mold in the bottoms/corners of
the several feeders. The feeders get wet during the daily cleaning and the food appears to be getting wet and
molding over time. The feeders are not cleaned out often enough to prevent the dogs from ingesting moldy food.
Food that is left wet for a period of time can become moldy, and if ingested could cause a possible health issue.
The licensee must ensure that all food is palatable and not contaminated and of good quality for the regulated
animals. The feeders with food should be kept dry and any wet food if not ingested should be removed to prevent
molding.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are several enclosures that have a buildup of dirt and grime, brown in color around the door inserts and back
walls. While the enclosures are washed out daily, the walls and inserts of several enclosures need to be scrubbed
to remove the dirt and grime buildup. There are 2 bottom kennels that have dirt/debris and cobwebs between the
ceiling and wall that appears to be coming from the floor of the dogs housed above them. There are several food
receptacles' that have a buildup of brown grime in the bowl section of the feeders and a buildup of hair and dirt on
the tops of them.
The buildup of dirt and grime on the walls and feeders can be a source of possible health issues that can come in
contact with the regulated animals.
While the licensee is cleaning daily and sanitizes at least 1 every 2 weeks, there are several areas in the kennel that
appear to need to be cleaned and sanitized more often due to the facility issues and the cleanliness of the breed of
animal housed in the kennel. The facility must be sanitized at least once per 2 weeks or more often as necessary to
provide clean conditions for the regulated animals. The buildup of brown grime, dirt and cobwebs does not allow for
proper sanitization or cleaning. To be corrected by: July 12, 2015
