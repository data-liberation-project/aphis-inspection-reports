Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
The licensee purchased 20 tenrec on 1 December 2021 from an unlicensed source. Purchasing from unlicensed sources
who are required to be licensed does not allow for inspections at those sources to ensure compliance with the Animal
Welfare Act regulations. Discontinue obtaining animals from any person who is required to be licensed but does not hold
a current valid license. Correct by 30 December 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Manager.
