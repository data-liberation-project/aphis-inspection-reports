2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
Approximately 3 weeks ago, the licensee instructed an employee to take 50 guinea pigs and get rid of them in whatever
method he chose. The employee released the guinea pigs into the woods nearby. The guinea pigs were later found on
the road by a motorist. The live guinea pigs were recovered by the humane society. It is unknown if all of the live animals
were recovered. The dead guinea pigs were recovered and disposed of by the licensee. Outdoor temperatures in the
area 3 weeks ago (end of February) were between 20 and 30 degrees F.
Releasing guinea pigs into the outdoors in low temperatures can result in cold stress and physical harm by predators or
other means, including death.
Handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, excessive cooling,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
