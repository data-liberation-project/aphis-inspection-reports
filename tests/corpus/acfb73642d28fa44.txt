FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The enclosure housing the Jacobs sheep has multiple areas which are unsafe. The enclosure fence has a large
hole near the gate, apparently caused by the animals stretching the wires. This is an entrapment risk, and must be
corrected. The shelter has several gaps, which also contain sharp points or loops of wire. These areas are a
potential source of entrapment or injury to the contained animals. All sharp points and loose wires must be
eliminated, and all gaps repaired to minimize the risk of injury to the animals.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The feed shed was dirty with an accumulation of spilled feed and other debris between the pallets and the walls.
This area needs to be swept and cleaned on a more frequent basis.
- There is a bale of hay being stored on concrete blocks in the maintenance shed. The shed is not an appropriate
area for food storage, since it is filled with machinery, chemicals, and various other materials. In addition, the bale
of hay has a large spoiled, discolored area in one corner. Spoiled hay is not an appropriate animal feed.
The facility must ensure that feed is properly stored in order to protect it from contamination. Food storage areas
must be kept in good condition, and cleaned as frequently as necessary to ensure good quality feed is given to the
animals.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- The outdoor enclosure housing a young red kangaroo has a floor that slopes down in the middle, with a drain
located at the bottom of the slope. This drain had no cover, leaving an open hole in the middle of the floor. This is
a potential source of injury to the enclosed animal. The facility must place an appropriate drain cover in this
location.Correct by: 30 July 2015

FEEDING.
- There was no hay present in the Jacob's sheep enclosure. Employees were unclear about when the animals were
last given hay, and how much hay they are actually receiving. In the past, the facility was directed to ensure that all
grazing animals had access to clean hay at all times. The Jacob's sheep have heavy wool coats, making it difficult
to assess body condition without actually capturing the animals. In order to help ensure they are getting enough
feed, these animals must be provided access to free choice hay at all times. The facility must consult their
attending veterinarian to ensure that the correct type of hay is being given to the animals. There is a written feeding
plan provided by the facility attending veterinarian. If the facility chooses to deviate from this written plan, it must be
approved in writing by the attending veterinarian.
3.130
WATERING.
- The water receptacle for the Jacobs sheep was extremely dirty. The water was so cloudy inspectors were not able
to see the bottom or sides of the receptacle. Animals must have access to clean potable water at all times, but
particularly during the hot summer months. Dirty water receptacles increase the contamination of the animals, and
may lead to illness or other negative health effects. The facility must clean the water receptacles as often as
needed to keep them clean and protect the health of the enclosed animals.
