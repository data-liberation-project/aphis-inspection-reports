CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
On August 6th, 2019, 4 dogs were imported from Ukraine via Frankfurt on Lufthansa Flight 422 on air waybill
#020-92371484. The two primary enclosures and the animals were observed and inspected as soon as they arrived
at the cargo handling facility after having been unloaded from the transporting aircraft. The enclosures did not have
certification from the consignor that the animals were offered food and water within 4 hours of delivery to the carrier.
Failure to provide this information could put the animals at risk. Carriers must not accept a dog or cat for transport in
commerce unless the consignor provides this certification, which must include specific feeding and watering
instructions for a 24 hour period. This certification must be securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure
in a manner that makes it easily noticed and read to enable the carrier and intermediate handlers to provide
adequate care and husbandry to the animals while in transit.
This inspection was conducted at the Lufthansa cargo facility in Boston. A representative from CBP and airline
representatives were present for this inspection. A final exit interview was conducted with an airline representative
by phone on 8/7/19.
