2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The barrier fence separating the public from the hyena enclosure does not adequately prevent the public from
stretching over to reach the fence of their enclosure. This could allow direct contact between the public and the
hyenas. The fence distance measures between 32 and 34 inches away from the enclosure and is approximately 3
feet high. After notification of this concern, licensee contacted fencing contractor to install a compliant barrier fence
with work set to begin on Saturday, 10-1-16. Barrier fences between the animal and the general viewing public
must assure the safety of the animals and the public. Correct by 10-8-16.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several enclosures need minor repairs. In the African Crested Porcupine enclosure, there was a broken fencing
wire protruding into the enclosure at the animal level. In the enclosure housing the young eland, camel and llama,
two screws were protruding into the enclosure on the left side wall. After notification of these two concerns, the
licensee repaired the enclosures.
In the enclosure housing 3 pot belly pigs and 2 sheep, a triangular area on the bottom of the left wall has wood that
is deteriorating and is beginning to separate at pig level.
In the raccoon enclosure, the back wall of the wooden shelter box is pulling away from the body of the shelter and
foam insulation is exposed.
In the enclosure housing 3 mature tigers, the chain link enclosing a dead tree is pulling apart and detaching from the
tree, exposing sharp wire ends at tiger level.
Broken wire, protruding screws, damaged enclosure wood, and damaged chain link may cause injury to the
animals. The shelter box with exposed insulation is not structurally sound and may present an injury risk to the
raccoon. The facilities shall be structurally sound and be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury. Correct by 10-8-2016.3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
On 9-26-16, the right large walk-in freezer registered an internal temperature of 54.5 degrees F and stored meat
was noted to be thawing. The freezer was determined to be malfunctioning and not receiving power. After
notification of this concern, licensee contacted refrigeration specialist and freezer was repaired by 10 am 9-27-16.
All product in the freezer was discarded and the freezer was thoroughly cleaned.
The left freezer has been repaired and was noted to be functioning normally at this time. All food in both freezers
has been labeled and a rotation schedule is in place.
The feed storage area continues to need attention. There are multiple bags of feed that have been torn open
and/or chewed open and may therefore be contaminated by pests. Feed is spilled on the floor in many areas in the
barn and has lingered long enough to become moldy, which presents a health risk to the animals and may attract
pests. The licensee has engaged a contractor to enclose an area and pour a cement floor. The rebar and framing
have been installed. However, the present method of storing feed has not yet improved. Proper storage of
feedstuffs is essential to a successful pest control program and ensuring the wholesomeness and palatability of the
food.
The three animals cited under 2.40 (b) (2) for veterinary care concerns during the previous inspection have been
seen by the Attending Veterinarian and have received or are receiving appropriate veterinary care. No expired
medications were found during this inspection. The llamas and sheep were sheared within 1 week after previous
inspection. This inspection was conducted on 9-26-16 and 9-27-16. The exit interview was conducted with licensee
on 9-27-16.
