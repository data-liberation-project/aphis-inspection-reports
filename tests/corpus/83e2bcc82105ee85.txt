3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are rusted metal surfaces along the base of both indoor exhibit enclosures housing chimpanzees and
orangutans. In at least one place in the chimpanzee enclosure the rusted surface appears to have resulted in a
jagged metal edge. Rusted surfaces interfere with the ability to adequately clean and sanitize surfaces. The
licensee must maintain all surfaces that come into contact with nonhuman primates so that they are free of
excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the
surface. To be corrected by 13 September 2014.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
