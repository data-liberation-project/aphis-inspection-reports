REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
On December 19, 2016, the facility was visited by this inspector and unlicensed regulated activity was
confirmed/identified by operating a petting farm. After discussing the need of an USDA license, and compliance
with the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), the facility's Office Manager stated a complete application for an USDA license
would be mailed within days; application package and licensing information were provided at the time.
On February 15, 2017, the facility was re-visited by this inspector and unlicensed activity was still been conducted
by operating a petting farm. During an escorted tour of the animal areas, 17 pygmy/Nigerian dwarf goats and three
(3) rabbits were observed/counted.
Any person operating or intending to operate as a dealer, and/or exhibitor, except persons who are exempted from
the licensing requirements under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, must have a valid USDA license as required by
the AWA. The owner/manager of the facility must apply for a license by submitting the required
information/documentation to the USDA-APHIS-AC Regional Director in Raleigh, North Carolina. In the license
application form, the establishment must provide the information requested, including a valid mailing address
through which the owner/manager could be reached at all times, and a valid premises address where animals,
animal facilities, equipment, and records may be inspected for compliance. A packet containing license application
materials and information was provided during the inspector's first visit on December 19, 2016.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT OBTAINING A VALID USDA LICENSE.
