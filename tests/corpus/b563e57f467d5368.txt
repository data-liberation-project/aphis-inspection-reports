PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
The livestock trailer that is used to transport the camel is in disrepair. The metal roof has no fewer than five
holes/areas of sharp, jagged metal that are protruding into the trailer. At least three of these holes are greater than
two inches in diameter. Animal hair was observed on one of the jagged edges. The sharp, jagged metal edges are
directly accessible to the camel while it is housed or transported in the trailer. These areas could injure the animal.
Repair or replace the trailer.
