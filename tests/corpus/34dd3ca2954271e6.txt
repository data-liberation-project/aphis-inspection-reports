HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
Health Certificates
The licensee is using heath certificates designed and for use on animals sold and transported in the State of
Wisconsin only. However, APHIS Form 7006's show multiple sales in which the animals are being transported
across the state lines. Health certificates must be correctly filled out, and followed as an assurance that the
animal(s) are healthy and that travel is acceptable. All federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and guidelines
involving the transportation of animals must be strictly followed.
