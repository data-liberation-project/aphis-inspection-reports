FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On April 16, 2014 3 Wolves escaped from the installation. This was accomplished by digging underneath and by
pushing the gate of their enclosure. The animals also gained access to the exterior of the property. 2 of the animals
were recaptured within 24 following hours.
Also On December 2013 the Jacob sheep named Cup Cake, was injured getting out of his new enclosure.
The failure to contain the animals can evolve into a dangerous situation, putting at risk of injury or death the animals
and the public.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
These enclosures and the gates must be repaired; also special measures must be taken in order to prevent digging,
injuries of the animals and to make the enclosures escape proof.
The owner must repair all affected areas and develop and maintain a program of repair and maintenance of the
facility.
The third animal continues outside of the facility. The animal has been monitored and fed in order to keep it in the
area and there have been several attempts to recapture without any result. The animal received at least 2 shots
with darts without positive results because he ran away after being shot and it was not possible to find it. This
animal must be captured and returned to its family group as soon as possible to avoid possible injuries, traumas or
death.

3.127(d)FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
On April 16, 2014 3 Wolves escaped from their primary enclosure, the animals also gained access to the exterior of
the property. This was accomplished by digging underneath and by pushing the gate of their enclosure. This
incident clearly demonstrates the need for a perimeter fence around these enclosures.
This facility currently has no functional perimeter fence around of most of the wolves enclosures; the animals are
housed in outdoor enclosures that require a perimeter fence. This fence is required to act not only as a secondary
containment for the animals should they escape from their primary enclosures but is also required to keep unwanted
animals and unauthorized persons out.
The failure to stop the escapes puts the animals and people at risk of serious injury or even death, also failure to
prevent wild animals from entering the facility can lead to the exposure to disease or parasites; this can adversely
affect the health and well-being of the regulated animals.
The licensee must construct a perimeter fence of the appropriate material at least 8 feet tall for the potentially
dangerous animals for example lions, cougars, and wolves, and at least 6 feet tall for all others animals for example
bobcat, deer ,coyotes, and boars.
