ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were three animals with signs of health problems that need veterinary attention:
-Both eyes of female grey chinchilla with eartag ‘GROS 23’ were found to be crusted shut, to be swollen, and were
found to have a pale discharge in them.
-The right eye of female chinchilla with eartag ‘DJM 118’ was found to be crusted shut and swollen; when it was
handled by the licensee a pale discharge was seen coming out of the eye.
-A ‘white Jensen’ female with eartag ‘PMR 580’ was found to not use her front legs and had an unkempt and dirty
hair coat underneath her. She was noted to be very thin and her bones could be felt when touched by the licensee
and veterinary medical officer. The licensee reported that he noticed her off feed about a week and a half ago and
had moved her to the current solid bottom enclosure to provide feed and additional monitoring. The attending
veterinarian has not been contacted to see if she needs additional treatment to better her condition.
****Delayed treatment for medical problems in animals may cause their condition to worsen and may cause
un-relieved pain. These animals must be reported to and treated as directed by the attending veterinarian.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
While searching and trying to confirm if affected animals noted on the June 22, 2016 inspection have received
veterinary treatment; two chinchillas had not been identified by the facility as needing treatment and inspectors
brought these two chinchillas’ condition to the attention of the licensee:
-Female chinchilla with eartag ‘DJM 118’ was found to have problems with her right eye.
-Female grey chinchilla with eartag ‘GROS 23’ was found to have problems with both of her eyes.
The facility must develop and maintain a method of routine daily observations to ensure any animal with a healthproblem is treated promptly and appropriately.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste disposal.
The facility has corrected the buildup of excreta in the south gutter of the facility which was cited in the June 22,
2016 inspection; however there was a large buildup of excreta, waste, used bedding, and water building up under
the animals located over the north gutter of the facility. The licensee stated that it hadn’t been cleaned out in 6-7
days and had planned to do it today. The buildup of material created a strong ammonia smell and foul odor within
the facility and a large number of small black flies were present in the north two rows of the facility. This buildup of
material and foul odors can cause sickness in animals may be a reason why so many flies are in the building. The
facility must eliminate the excessive buildup of excreta, waste, used bedding, and excess soiled water from the
facility as often as necessary to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards.
Exit interview was conducted with licensee by VMO Welch and ACI Wilken.
NOTE: This was a focused inspection of the Direct noncompliance items cited in the June 22, 2016 inspection
report; three of the seven chinchillas cited as a Direct non-compliance under 2.40 (b)(2) on that report were
positively identified and were receiving veterinary treatment; the remaining four could not be positively identified in
the facility.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 22, 2016.
