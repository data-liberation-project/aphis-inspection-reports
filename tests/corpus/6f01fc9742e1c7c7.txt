SANITATION.
Weeds and tall grass are growing along the edge of the hippo enclosure and near the enclosure gate .The grass is
growing over the electric fence wire by the gate. A snapping sound could be heard near the enclosure.. This sound
indicates that there is a short somewhere along the electric fence . Tall grass and weeds covering the electric fence
wire can cause a short in the electric fence resulting in a weak or absent current. The electric fence may no longer
serve as an effective secondary containment method when the current is weak/absent. Grass and weeds must be
kept away from the electric fence in the hippo pen to prevent the animal from gaining access to the fence which
could result in injury or escape.
