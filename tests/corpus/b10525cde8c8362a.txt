HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces (3) Cleaning.
***In the outdoor facility, there were wooden steps built in front of each housing shelter in each enclosure. The
space in between these steps and the shelters had old shavings, hair and leaves. Accumulations of waste products
attract pests, insects and vermin which increase the risk of disease to the animals. The licensee must remove the
waste material from these areas and assure that all areas of the facility are cleaned as required.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Sec. 3.4 Outdoor housing facilities.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
***In the outdoor facility on the east side of the property, there was no separate shade other than the housing
shelter for four adult dogs. A female Dachshund identified as Anna #707627615 was lying in her water bowl. There
were also three Cocker Spaniels identified as Jack #965111016107, a male white and tan in color, Lollie
#95600008888335, a female black and tan and heavy bred and Missy # 075275115, a female golden in color that
were housed in this area. All four of these dogs were panting heavily and had lolling tongues. Readings from a
Kestrel 3000 at 1042 at the height of the dogs were: Ambient temperature: 94.4 F, Heat Index: 127.0 F and
Humidity: 83.6%. Kestrel readings on the housing shelters for these enclosures were: Ambient temperature: 95.8 F
and Humidity: 80.0%. Shade provides comfort for the animal during periods of direct sunlight and provides shelter
from inclement weather. The licensee must provide shade for these animals within one hour and assure that all
animals are provided with shade at all times as required.
Corrected during inspection by moving these dogs to temporary housing with shade.3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sec. 3.11 Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
(c) Housekeeping for premises.
***In the outdoor facility, the grass, trees and weeds were growing in close contact with the enclosure and housing
shelters. Tall weeds and grass create a harboring place for pests and parasites and increases the risks for contact
between pests, parasites and the dogs. The licensee must clear the grass and weeds so that they do not enter the
primary enclosure and assure that such items are controlled as required.
