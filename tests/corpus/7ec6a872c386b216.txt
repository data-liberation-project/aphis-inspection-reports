2.40(a)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Veterinary records indicate the facility has chronic upper respiratory problems, gastrointestinal problems, and poor growth
in kittens. Two of the veterinarians the licensee works with feel the diet the licensee is feeding contributes to these
chronic illnesses. Both veterinarians have advised the licensee to discontinue the homemade/raw diet and feed a good
brand commercial cat food. The licensee has ignored both veterinarians and continues to feed the homemade/raw diet.
The licensee needs to ensure the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to provide adequate veterinary care
and advise on other aspects of animal care. Choosing to ignore guidance from two veterinarians pertaining to the cats’
diets is not providing adequate veterinary care and could have caused cats unnecessary suffering from illnesses that
would have resolved if the cats had adequate nutrition.
The licensee needs to consult with one or both veterinarians and provide an adequate diet based on their
recommendations.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.


Each dealer and exhibitor shall use Record of Acquisition and Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS Form 7005) and Record of
Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS Form 7006) to make, keep, and maintain the information required by paragraph
(a)(1) of this section.
The licensee did not have APHIS Form 7005 available for review at the time of this inspection and was unable to tell
APHIS inspectors exactly how many cats she had. On physical count, inspectors identified 53 cats. At the time of the
licensee’s re-license in February 2022, the inventory was 43 cats. The licensee provided USDA inspectors with
disposition records for 16 animals and a list of births that totaled 32 kittens. The licensee should have had 59 cats on the
property. Disposition records for 6 cats were missing.
Accurate records of acquisition and disposition are required so that USDA officials can track animal movement. Accurate
records of animals on hand, acquisition, and disposition need to be available at the time of inspections.

Contingency planning.
At the time of inspection, the licensee did not have a developed and documented contingency plan. Lack of a contingency
plan could be detrimental to the animal’s health and well-being. An adequate contingency plan must be developed and
documented to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and care in the event of an
emergency or disaster (one that could be reasonably anticipated/expected to be harmful to the health and well-being of
the animals).

Housing facilities, general.
Animal enclosures must protect the animals from injury. The licensee currently has several cages with heating pads that
have electric cords exposed to the cats. The cats could easily chew on these cords and be electrocuted or swallow a
piece of the cord or pad.
The pads need to be removed or the cords and pads need to be covered in a manner that prevents the pads and cords
from being chewed on.

Housing facilities, general.
There was an inordinate amount of trash, debris, and clutter accumulated throughout most of the animal holding areas,
including areas where food and cat litter were being stored. Within said areas, there was also equipment/furniture with
excessive dirt buildup that was kept in an untidy manner. Insanitary conditions such as these increase the chance of
health issues and can adversely affect the well-being of the animals. Housing facilities and areas used for storing animal
food or bedding must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste material, junk, weeds, and other discarded materials.
Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment, furniture, and stored
material.

3.1(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.


The bottom portion of many of the metal cages that are approximately 12”x 48” were rusted. All facilities must be
constructed of materials that allow them to be cleaned and sanitized. Rust cannot be cleaned and sanitized.
This facility has had health issues with animals in the past, so it is especially important that the cages be completely
sanitized. Cages that are not sanitized adequately can contribute to disease in future animals held in those cages. The
rust on the cages needs to be removed or the wire needs to be replaced.

Housing facilities, general.
At the time of inspection, some of the cat food and litter were being stored on the floor throughout the premises. The
buckets containing litter did not have a tightly fitting lid. Storing food and litter in such a manner can lead to spoilage,
contamination, and allows vermin direct access. Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects
the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away
from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. All open supplies of food and bedding must be kept
in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.

Indoor housing facilities.
The odor of ammonia, in the building housing approximately 20 cats to the left of the back door, was overwhelming to the
point that the inspectors’ nose and eyes were burning and irritated. According to the licensee, they are in the process of
putting in an additional exhaust fan.


Prolonged exposure to ammonia can be irritating to the cats’ nose, eyes, and throat, and can lead to breathing problems.
Indoor housing facilities must be sufficiently always ventilated when dogs or cats are present to provide for their health
and well-being and to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia levels, and moisture condensation. The licensee must assure that
the facility has adequate ventilation and take measures to reduce the buildup of ammonia levels.

Primary enclosures.
Cats being maintained in five out of the six areas on the premises did not have elevated resting surfaces. Lack of such
surfaces can negatively impact the well-being of the animals as they provide the opportunity for the species to exhibit
some of their natural behaviors and decrease stress. Each primary enclosure housing cats must contain elevated resting
surface or surfaces that are impervious to moisture, easily cleaned, sanitized, or replaced when soiled or worn, and large
enough to hold all the occupants of the primary enclosure at the same time comfortably.

Watering
Multiple enclosures contained water bowls with feces in them, where the cats did not have any additional potable water
sources provided. There is a recurring health concern in the cat colony due to coccidia, which is a parasite that is
transferred through feces. Water contaminated with feces can facilitate the spread and/or recurrence of disease, is
insanitary, and therefore can adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals. If potable water is not continuously
available to the cats, it must be offered to the cats as often as necessary to ensure their health and well-being.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Many of the metal cages - that were approximately 12” x 48” – in addition to the other primary enclosures had a large
amount of grime, organic matter (hair and cat litter), and mineral deposits built up along the edges/perimeter of the
enclosure, and cage bars. The licensee stated she does not deep clean and sanitize the enclosures as frequently as she
should. Inadequate cleaning and sanitization can foster poor health conditions that negatively impact the well-being of the
animals contained therein. Hard surfaces of primary enclosures must be sanitized, and all soiled surfaces must be
washed with appropriate products (i.e., disinfectants and detergents) with a thorough cleaning of the surfaces to remove
organic material, so as to remove all organic material and mineral buildup, and to provide sanitization.

Employees
Currently there are only two people, neither of whom are full-time, that are available to care for (clean, feed, sanitize,
observe, etc.) the cats, which total 53. The enclosures are spot cleaned daily, but a deep cleaning is not performed due to
lack of sufficient availability of both individuals. The animals also do not have continuous access to potable water as there
is no one available to change out the water bowls with feces. Inadequate husbandry standards, such as these, promote
conditions such as ill-thrift, infectious diseases, acute and chronic illnesses, among other things. Each person subject to
the Animal Welfare regulations maintaining dogs and cats must have enough employees to carry out the level of
husbandry practices and care required in this subpart.
