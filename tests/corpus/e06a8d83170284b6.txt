2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult, male Japanese macaque had areas of hair loss on both forearms. The skin of these areas does not
appear to be red. The macaque was observed to pluck at the hair/skin in this area of his arms during the majority of
time he was observed during the inspection. The keeper in charge reports that they noticed the problem a couple of
days ago but a veterinarian has not been contacted regarding this problem. Self-trauma of the skin by any animal
can indicate parasites, skin infection, and a variety of other medical problems. In many animals, including
nonhuman primates, self-trauma of the skin can also result from psychological stress. The animal listed above must
be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the
condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. Correct by close of business 11
December 2015.
3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal cover over the heater on the outside wall of the macaque enclosure was rusted. Rusted surfaces cannot
be readily cleaned and sanitized and may no longer be structurally sound. All surfaces must be free of excessive
rust. Correct by 7 Jan. 2016.
3.81(c)(2)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The adult, male Japanese macaque that was observed showing signs consistent with psychological stress (plucking
his hair/skin and had areas of hair loss on both forearms) has not had his environmental enhancement plan altered
or given special attention beyond his usual daily enrichment in response to this problem. Nonhuman primates have
complex social and intellectual needs that must be addressed when in captivity. Failure to do so can result in a
variety of behavior problems including, but not limited to, hair/skin plucking. The licensee must provide certain
nonhuman primates special attention regarding enhancement of their environment based on the needs of the
individual species and in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian. Nonhuman primates that
show signs of being in psychological distress through behavior or appearance must have these specialconsiderations addressed. Correct by close of business 11 December 2015.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are three places on the outside east wall of the bear enclosure where the concrete blocks were starting to
deteriorate. In these areas the blocks were starting to slough off layers of the concrete. Surfaces that are not
maintained may cause injury to the animals. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and kept in good repair.
Correct by 7 Jan. 2016.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was standing water and mud in one corner of the pig enclosure as well as in a corner under the shelter for the
long-horn cattle. This water was brownish in color, and in the case of the water in the pig enclosure, there was
green algae growing along one side. Standing water and mud can cause odors and may lead to an increase in
disease transmission. A suitable method must be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. Correct by 14
December 2015.
3.130
WATERING.
There are leaves and dirt in the water receptacle for the goats. There was also green algae on the sides of this
water receptacle. Dirty water receptacles may contaminate the water and may lead to an increase in disease
transmission. All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary. Correct by 8 December 2015.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with facilities representatives, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO
and Kendall Lundy, ACI.
