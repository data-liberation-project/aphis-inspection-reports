RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection report records of births and deaths were not available for review for the guinea pigs.
Records must be kept and maintained on guinea pig births, deaths, purchases, owned, held, transported,
euthanized, sold or otherwise disposed of by dealer. License must ensure that records are kept and maintained on
guinea pig births and deaths to document changes in ownership, keep track of animals, and to help assess the
animal care program. Correct by September 14, 2019.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The following enclosures are in need of repair:
1) Enclosure # 17 housing 11 adult guinea pigs and their offspring has rusty and broken wire on the front side with
holes and sharp wire.
2) Enclosure # 18 housing 12 adult guinea pigs and their offspring has rusty and broken wire on the front side.
3) Enclosure # 19 housing 11 adult guinea pigs and their offspring has rusty and broken wire on the left side wall
with holes and sharp wire ends.
All enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury. The
above enclosures must be repaired or replaced to prevent the guinea pigs from getting injured from the rusty,
broken, and sharp wire, holes in wire sides, or from falling 2 to 5 feet on to the floor. Licensee must develop a
maintenance program to repair or replace enclosures that are not structurally sound to prevent animals from injury
from the rusty, broken and sharp wire or from falling out of enclosures.
