ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a tube of Animax (Nystain-neomycin sulfate-thiostreptor triamcinolone acetonide) ointment with an
expiration date of 11/2013. There was a bottle of Ultra Care Flea and Tick Spray with an expiration date of 09/2013.
There was a bottle with a clear thick liquid with no labeled stating what it was, purpose, dosage, or an expiration
date. These medications were found intermingled with other medications in the storage container located in the
isolation room and are therefore considered ready for use. Expired medications can experience spoilage or have
reduced efficacy. This could lead to prolonged illness or suffering for the animals needing the drug. Ensure that all
medications used in the facility are not expired and labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary
practices.
