2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 8 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. In Building 1 there were 5 adult guinea pigs (one
black and white, two brown and white, and two tan and white) with swellings under the chin. In Building 2 there
were 4 adult guinea pigs (one black and white, one brown and black, one tri-color, and one brown and white) with
swellings under the chin. The swellings ranged in size from .5 to 1 inch in size and were firm movable masses. The
facility had treated the lumps with antibiotics as described in the Program of Veterinary Care but they had not
resolved and they were currently not administering any treatments to these animals. There were other treatments
described in the Program of Veterinary Care including lancing, draining, and flushing the lumps which the facility
had not done with these animals. The attending veterinarian was contacted and stated that if the antibiotics did not
resolve the condition she would recommend lancing the lumps as described or if the facility was not comfortable
doing this then they should be contacting her.
Additionally, there was a dead adult gray and white guinea pig in pen 22 in Building 1. The facility had observed the
animal appeared lethargic that morning but had not contacted the attending veterinarian and had not administered
any treatments. The attending veterinarian was contacted and was not comfortable with the facility not contacting
her when they observe animals that appear lethargic.
Swellings in the neck can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, and can affect the overall health and
well-being of the animal. Delays in providing appropriate veterinary care for these conditions can result in
worsening of the condition and potentially spread to other unaffected animals if infectious in nature. Failure to treat
animals that are lethargic can lead to worsening of the condition including death.
The facility must initiate treatment for the animals with the swellings under the chin as described in the program of
veterinary care or contact their attending veterinarian in order to determine an appropriate treatment plan. In
addition, if the facility observes lethargic animals, they should be communicating with the attending veterinarian to
determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
