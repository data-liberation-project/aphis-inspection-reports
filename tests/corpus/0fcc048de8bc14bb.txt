2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following animals are in need of hoof trimming:
1 STEER - Both rear hooves of the steer are overgrown.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: MAY 6, 2016
1 GOAT - Both of the brown goat's front hooves are so overgrown that they have started to curve underneath of
themselves. Additionally, the APHIS Official observed the goat moving in a kneeling position in it's efforts to move
about.
Overgrown hooves can adversely affect the gait of these animals as well as cause pain that prevents them from
using their full weight to stand and/or walk normally.
CORRECTED AT TIME OF INSPECTION : 4-22-16
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of
appropriate methods to prevent and control the overgrowth of animal hooves.

Structural Strength.
The following items are in need of removal, replacement or repair:STEER ENCLOSURE
1. The split rail fence, in front of the steer enclosure, is leaning and not adequately secured.
2. A wooden fence post, within the split rail fence, is rotted and not secured into the ground.
The unsecured fencing, as well as the fence post, must be replaced and appropriately secured for the steer housed
therein.
3. The enclosure fence is composed of wooden stockade panels and wire panels on the inside of the fence. The
wire panels only cover the upper 2/3rds of the fence. Several areas of this stockade enclosure fence have broken
and/or missing slats. There are at least three areas where there are 2 foot by 2 foot gaps underneath the wire
panels that cover the interior portion of the stockade fence. These gaps are large enough to allow access of
unwanted animals. Additionally, the wooden support posts are rotted. Broken and missing slats, as well as rotted
posts, leave this primary enclosure fence in serious disrepair.
The broken and damaged panels of stockade, as well as the rotted support posts, must be replaced to ensure
structural strength and to eliminate the open gaps under the wire panels.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: MAY 12, 2016
4. The entire wooden floor of the shelter building is covered in large, steer sized hoof holes. Additionally, rotted
sheets of plywood, that were used to cover these holes, are loose and not secured. The loose, rotted sheets of
plywood, as well as the numerous holes, present a danger to the steer that uses this building as a shelter.
5. Broken pieces of wood, from the damaged floor, are present on the ground in front of the building entrance.
The entire floor MUST be replaced to maintain structural strength and to protect the steer from injury. Broken pieces
of wood MUST be removed from the enclosure.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: MAY 19, 2016ALPACA/DONKEY/MINI HORSE ENCLOSURE
1. Three vertical support posts, for the shelter building, are severely rotted at their bases. Continued deterioration
will result in a collapse of the roof structure.
2. Six (6) metal stakes, which had previously been cut off at their bases, surround the base of a tree within this
enclosure. These metal stakes have jagged and sharp edges that are now exposed and pose a danger to the
alpacas, burros and mini horse housed within this enclosure.
The vertical support posts must be replaced to maintain structural strength and the jagged metal stakes must be
removed to prevent animal injuries.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Drainage.
STEER ENCLOSURE
The entire enclosure is full of soft, muddy soil. Additionally, a large pool of water is present in front of a side gate
near the alpaca enclosure. Continually standing in pooling water and muddy areas will create hoof problems.
A suitable method to rapidly eliminate excess water must be established to prevent such wet accumulations and
hoof issues.

FEEDING. The container as well as the mineral block, provided for the steer, are covered in feces. The steer feces has now
contaminated the mineral block and has also left the container unsanitary.
The feed container must be cleaned, sanitized and placed in the enclosure in such a way that minimizes
contamination for the health of the steer.

Cleaning.
STEER
The damaged wooden floor, inside of the steer's shelter building, is covered with feces. This large accumulation is
at least three months old. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the steer contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and odors.

SANITATION.
Pest control.
Numerous mouse droppings were present along the walls and adjacent to feed bags in the feed storage room.
Mouse poison packs are present in this room as a form of pest control. However, due to the amount of droppings
present, the poison packs do not appear to be effective. The spilled feed and mouse droppings must be removed
and the contaminated areas sanitized. A safe and effective method to control pest must be established and
maintained.TO BE CORRECTED BY: APRIL 28, 2016
