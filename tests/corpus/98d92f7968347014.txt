PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* An enclosure contained two (10 week old) puppies, This enclosure had approximately 3 inches of head space
above the puppies head when in a normal standing position. The enclosure did not provide the required 6 inches of
additional head space. This reduced head space limits the puppies ability to stretch, stand, jump and play.
Licensee must ensure that all enclosures housing dogs/puppies have the required 6 inches of additional head space
above the tallest dog in the enclosure. (Corrected at time of inspection.)
* To be corrected by: 2/10/17
