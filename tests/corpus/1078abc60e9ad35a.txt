2.131(a)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Currently the licensee is in possession of an 8 week old female tiger (Lilly) that he has had since it was under 2
weeks old. The licensee has never owned a big cat or received any training on how to raise or train a growing big
cat into an adult. When the owner initially took possession of the cub, the diet was completely inappropriate (lacking
the necessary protein and minerals/vitamins and given in too much quantity) until it was discussed with the AC Big
Cat Specialist.
The owner is now conducting public handling exhibitions where the public is allowed to pick up and carry the cub
and take photos. During this inspection, an exhibition of the cub was observed and it was clear that the tiger did not
want to be picked up, however the public was allowed to continue while the tiger grunted, growled and swatted at
the faces of the people holding it. At that time, the inspector told the licensee that the cub’s behavior showed that it
had had enough handling and it needed to be off exhibit. The licensee continued to stand by and watch as his
handler did not correct or stop the interaction.
During two of the public interactions with the cub, inappropriate handling by public members was observed. One
woman picked up the cub and put her fingers in its mouth for her photo, then tried to lower the cub and ended up
dropping her on her head just before she got to the ground (approximately 6 inches high). The second woman then
picked the cub up and experienced the same swats to the face/neck and fidgeting as the first woman, and after her
photo she tried to lower the 18 lb cub, while the tiger twisted and was lowered with its back parallel to the ground
supporting its body weight by only its spine.
During these two encounters the one employee had let the cub off its leash and had her back turned accepting
money, while a public member took the tiger cub several feet away and picked the cub up by grasping it under it’s
forelegs and around its ribcage so that the cub’s body hung down along the front of the public members’ bodies for
the photo. The cub was grunting and uncomfortable and wanting down, however neither the employee nor licensee
stopped either situation. When the public members left, the employee walked away from the cub to assist the
licensee with a large snake and the unleashed cub was left to wander around unattended. The cub took interest in,
and wanted to go towards the area with a 13 plus ft python. The inspector had to stop the cub and get the attention
of the employee to retrieve the cub and take it somewhere else. When the keeper picked up the tiger, she wasscratched under her chin leaving a small cut.
The lack of proper training and experience while raising and handling a tiger can pose a serious threat of harm to
the animal, employees, and the public, as it grows and becomes stronger and possibly more aggressive. Per the
licensee, there has only been one knowledgeable, experienced person who has come to the property on two
occasions to provide training for handling the tiger. There is not someone available full time on site, and the licensee
does not currently have any plans to get further training at another facility.
During the inspection, the handling issues were discussed with the licensee, so the next public interaction that was
observed went much better however, a baby stroller with a child in it was allowed so close to the cub that it could
have jumped into the stroller. The keeper did have the leash on the cub’s harness this entire time, but the cub pulled
to the end of it, and constantly chewed and pawed and bit at the ankles of the public. It was explained that they
need to keep young babies and strollers away, stop the people from crowding around the animal, and to stop the
interactions when people are getting scratched or bit, even though the animal is acting playful. There had been one
4 yr old girl that said 'ouch' when the tiger bit her ankle while playing, although the skin was not broken.
After the second showing was observed, discussion ensued about proper handling and the need to keep the public
and the cub safe. The licensee is correcting the issues as he is told about them, however the inability to immediately
recognize these problems himself, either before they occur or after there is cause for concern, demonstrates the
lack of training and experience with raising and handling a large, dangerous animal. Gaining experience and
learning while already having a cub on site, and only while an experienced person is infrequently on site, does not
meet the regulatory requirement of demonstrating adequate experience and knowledge of maintaining a tiger.
The licensee must demonstrate adequate knowledge and experience of the animals in which they maintain.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures and shelves/boxes for the two Albifron Lemurs and two Vervet monkeys are constructed of
materials that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized and are not being replaced when worn or soiled. The wooden
shelves and platforms in both have a gummy appearing brown grime on the surfaces that is stuck to them due to
continued hand and foot traffic through dirt, food and debris at the bottom of the enclosures. The wooden walls in
the Albifron enclosure have muddy foot prints along all of the surfaces due to their constant climbing along them
after walking in the dirt area of the enclosure and there being mud in the area.
All surfaces that come in contact with non-human primates must be constructed in a manner and made of materialsthat allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. Wood or cement
that is not sealed cannot be appropriately sanitized in order to prevent possible health and disease issues due to
buildup of dirt and grime.
The licensee must ensure surfaces and furniture for the primates are constructed of materials that can be readily
cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced when worn or soiled.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The 2 two primate enclosures containing 2 Albifron lemurs and 2 Vervet monkeys have a buildup of dirt and debris.
There are dirty footprints on the windows and walls of the Albifron lemurs pen, and old blood, urine and brown
dirt/debris on the walls of the vervet pen. The wooden shelves and platforms in both have a gummy appearing
brown grime on the surfaces that is stuck to them due to continued hand and foot traffic through dirt, food and
debris at the bottom of the enclosures.
They are not being sanitized at least once every 2 two weeks. The licensee stated that the enclosures are picked up
daily or every other day, however the walls, windows, wood shelves and boxes are not being cleaned often enough
to prevent the buildup of dirt and debris.
The lack of sanitization in the primate enclosures can be a possible source of health issues and disease
transmission.
The licensee must provide daily spot pick up and sanitization of all surfaces the primates come in contact with at
least once every 2 weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt and debris.

FACILITIES, GENERAL. There is a Fennec Fox that is in an enclosure that does not have a functioning lock system. The door is extremely
easy to open, and is currently being kept closed with a stick under the door. However, during this inspection the
stick was not there and the door was opened without any effort.
There are 2 porcupines that are in a new enclosure that has an approximate 2ft x 2ft piece of metal sheeting used to
block the door opening. This is being used temporarily until a proper door is made, however the sheeting is very
flexible and if the porcupines put their faces between the wall and edge of the metal they could push it out of the
way and escape the enclosure very easily.
There are 2 fox enclosures (with 2-silver foxes in one, 2-marbled in the other) that have the diamond mesh flooring
exposed due to the mulch being dug out underneath it from inside the pen. Where the mulch has been dug out
under the fence floor, a deep hole is present which could be a source of injury if the animals’ feet fall through the
holes in the fence, or provide an area of escape due to the fencing being pulled away in the corners as was found in
the silver fox pen.
Enclosures that are not properly constructed for the animals they are to contain and enclosures that are not properly
maintained in good repair can cause animal escapes or even injuries to the animals.
The licensee needs to ensure that the enclosures are constructed of such material and of such strength as
appropriate for the animals involved and that the enclosures are maintained in good repair.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an accumulation of debris consisting of feathers, bones, and feces in the two fox enclosures (containing 4
fox, 3 kits), the one Geoffrey's cat enclosure, the one Serval enclosure, and the one Lynx enclosure. The Serval
enclosure also has dirt (dirt/blood/feathers/feces) on the side walls and igloo, with dirty towels in the enclosure.
Currently the enclosures are cleaned thoroughly once every 3 to 4 weeks. The Serval area is spot cleaned more
often, however the cleaning of the covered area at the front of the enclosure containing the igloo is not being
cleaned frequently enough.
There is a large accumulation of various carcasses, bones, skulls and rib cages that line both sides of a path
approximately 20ft long that leads to the lynx enclosure. The licensee has put the decaying bones and carcasses
along the path so that the bones can be part of the exhibit, however the decay and breakdown of tissues leaching
into the soils within 30ft of the enclosures can pose a possible health risk to the lynx, as well as serving as anattractant for pests and vermin.
The debris needs to be cleaned out more often so the animals can move around the enclosure without coming into
constant contact with the debris, and so the debris does not attract pests/vermin. The decaying bones need to be
removed and put in an area that is of sufficient distance from enclosures in order to not draw stray animals into
direct contact with the regulated animals in the surrounding enclosures, and to prevent the decaying material from
being tracked into the enclosures.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A perimeter fence variance was issued in July 2017, giving the licensee more time to complete the fence. Since
then, the licensee has only completed the fence around half of the property with three entry gates still missing. This
variance was only provided to cover only the species that were on site at the time. However, since the last
inspection in 2018, enclosures for two- Albifron lemurs, a Geoffrey cat and two- badgers have been added to the
outdoor area with no perimeter fence surrounding these new enclosures.
When there is no perimeter fence, animals that escape their primary enclosures can easily escape from the entire
facility. Lack of a perimeter fence also allows for much easier contact between unwanted animals/people and the
animals housed in their primary enclosures. This possible contact can cause increased stress, disease
transmission, or possible injury to the regulated animals as well as injury to the unwanted animals/people.
All outdoor housing facilities must be surrounded by a perimeter fence of sufficient height (either six or eight feet) to
keep animals and unauthorized people out or the licensee must apply for another variance.
