2.126(a)(2)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The licensee was unable to find any records that are required to be kept by the Animal Welfare Act including the Program
of Veterinary Care, sales records, and a record of animals on hand.

Not being able to review all required records doesn't allow for APHIS officials to ensure the Program of Veterinary is being
followed by the licensee and it also doesn't allow for proper tracking of the animals by APHIS officials.

The licensee must either locate all records required to be kept by the Animal Welfare Act or needs to get new records
created so they can be reviewed by APHIS officials at the next inspection.

Correct by 5/20/22.

Facilities, general.
Fencing in an enclosure containing 5 elk, 1 sika deer, and 1 bison was in disrepair. Parts of the fencing was bent inwards
and had sharp points sticking into the enclosure. In addition an old car was parked within the enclosure.


An enclosure containing 1 Llama and 4 goats had fencing that was in disrepair. A wooden section of the fence was
knocked down and leaning up against a tree.

An enclosure containing 3 llamas and 12 goats had fencing that was in disrepair. A metal post that runs across the top of
it was bent downwards into the enclosure at one spot. In addition there were sections of the fencing that were broken and
had sharp points sticking into the enclosure.

An enclosure containing three cows had scrap metal laying around. In addition there was also what appeared to be farm
equipment within the enclosure.

Nine goats roam freely around the property. They have a primary enclosure but it is only used when the property is open
to the public. Otherwise the goats are allowed to roam freely at night and when the owner leaves the property.

Fencing that is in disrepair, metal parts laying around within an enclosure, farm equipment and cars within an enclosure
could all cause injury to the animals being kept within the enclosure. Regulated animals allowed to roam freely doesn't
ensure they can be contained to the property. In addition they can get into things and potentially injure themselves.

Enclosures with fencing in disrepair must be either repaired, replaced, or fixed so the animals are not able to come into
contact with the fencing that is in disrepair. The cars, farm equipment, and scrap metal that is laying around within the
enclosure needs to be either removed from the enclosure or the regulated animals within those enclosures should be
moved to another enclosure that is in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. All animals must be kept in their primary
enclosures unless they are being directly supervised by the licensee.

Watering.
An enclosure containing 5 elk, 1 sika deer, and 1 bison had a watering receptacle that had algae growth covering
approximately half of the water surface. The licensee stated it was last cleaned out about a month ago. Unsanitary water
with excessive algae growth can cause illnesses to the animals that drink out of it. All watering receptacles must be kept
clean and sanitary. Correct by 5/5/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
