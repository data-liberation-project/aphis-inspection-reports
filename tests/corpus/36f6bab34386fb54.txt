3.56(b)(3)

Sanitation.
The primary enclosure housing six rabbits has not been sanitized. Though the other rabbit exhibit had been disinfected,
this housing area was solely pressure washed without use of a detergent or disinfectant. As a result, remnants of caked
debris remained in the trough under one rabbit hutch and the corner of another housing structure.
Failure to appropriately sanitize rabbit enclosure surfaces permits continued growth of bacteria and other pathogens that
can compromise the rabbits’ health. Primary enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized by washing them with hot water
(180F) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution
followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam or flame.
