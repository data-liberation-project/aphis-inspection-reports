2.31(c)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The facility’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) is not conducting Semi Annual Program Reviews in
the manner required. The facility provided a document from September 15, 2020, where the Attending Veterinarian
provided some brief notes of observations from a facility inspection and program review, however in April the Attending
Veterinarian was not invited to participate. The facility stated that they were unwilling to pay her to participate in the facility
inspection twice a year. In a conversation with the Attending Veterinarian on 7/23/2021 the lead inspector learned that the
Attending Veterinarian had not been given the opportunity to participate, even virtually or remotely by phone, in the April
Semi Annual Review, and was unaware of any findings at that time. And rather than a report to the Institutional Official
regarding the Semi Annual Review findings there was only a brief notation that a facility inspection and program review
had been completed.

The facility must ensure that all IACUC members are invited to participate in the Semi Annual Reviews, and that all who
wish to participate are allowed to do so. The facility must ensure that the IACUC reviews the physical facility as well as
the overall program of animal use, and any deficiencies noted, whether minor or significant, should be reported to the
Institutional Official along with a schedule for corrections. This report should be signed by a majority of the IACUC


members, and made available for inspection.

To be corrected from this time forward.

This inspection was conducted with the facility representative, and a follow-up exit interview was conducted with her by
phone on 7/26/2021.
