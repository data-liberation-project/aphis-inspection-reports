2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the first building there is a female Shih Tzu, microchip #018614611, that has a cloudy, blue left eye and a cloudy,
blue right eye that is enlarged. The licensee stated that the dog had previously been evaluated by licensed
veterinarian for the right eye. This could be a sign of injury or worsening medical condition.
In the small dog whelping building there is a female Shih Tzu, no microchip found, lying in her enclosure with four
two week old puppies. This dog is very thin with a pronounced backbone and hip bones and is extremely lethargic
and depressed. This dog never moved during the time that the inspectors observed her. When the licensee
opened the door of her enclosure she had no response and did not even lift her head. Poor body condition and
lethargic attitude could be a sign of other health problems within this dog.
In the third building there is a male Shih Tzu, microchip #102563605, with cloudy, blue eyes. Both eyes have a
discharge and there is a hard, crusty, brownish yellow material around the entire left eye and the inside of the right
eye. The bottom of the left eye has some exposed red skin. This dog didn'(cid:25)t seem to be able to see the other dog
in his enclosure and showed more signs of relying on his sense of hearing to determine when the other dog had
come through the access door. Based on this behavior, both inspectors thought the dog was blind. Poor eye health
could be a sign of injury or illness.
Also in the third building is a male Japanese Chin, microchip #02151594, which was cited on the previous
inspection report dated May 7, 2014. The licensee stated that the dog had been taken to a licensed veterinarian
and had its teeth cleaned, but at the time of inspection the dog had a buildup of a brown substance over the entire
molars and nearly the entire canine teeth. The gums were also red and slightly inflamed. Poor dental health can
lead to pain and discomfort to the dog.
In the fourth building there is a male Chihuahua, no microchip found, with overgrown toenails on all four feet. This
excessive toenail growth is causing the toes to turn in an outward direction. The toenail on the inside toe of the left
hind foot has grown under the foot and into the webbing between the pads. Overgrown toenails can cause pain and
discomfort to the dog as well as alter the dog'(cid:25)s normal gait. The above listed dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by end of business on March 30, 2015 for an
accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented and available to
inspector upon request.
In the same building there is a female Chihuahua, no microchip found, with overgrown toenails on all four feet. This
excessive toenail growth is causing the toes to turn in an outward direction. Overgrown toenails can cause pain
and discomfort to the dog as well as alter the dog'(cid:25)s normal gait. Licensee must trim all the toenails on this dog by
end of business on March 30, 2015 and develop a plan to maintain the toenails of all dogs.
A complete inspection was conducted on March 27, 2015. This is a focused inspection report limited to the direct
non-compliant items identified.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
