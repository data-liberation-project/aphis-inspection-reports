2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility notified the inspector by phone of an incident involving a male pig in the petting zoo. The incident report
at the zoo stated the pig made contact with a member of the public resulting in laceration of the man's lower leg.
The injury required care at a medical facility.
The male pig involved in the incident has been permanently removed from the petting zoo and future plans include
keeping only female pigs in the petting zoo.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public.
CORRECT FROM THIS DAY FORWARD.
