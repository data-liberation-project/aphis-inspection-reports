TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Time and Method of Identification for a Class "C" Exhibitor
1. The means of identification used by the Licensee for newly acquired cats is an official USDA sequentially
numbered tag plus a clear photograph. There were at least 3 Cats on the premises that were acquired since the
last inspection but they had not been identified with an official USDA tag and a clear photograph of each cat had not
been taken.
Per this Section of the Regulations, when an exhibitor uses official tags and photographs to identify cats in their
possession, all newly acquired cats should be identified by an official tag and a clear photograph should be taken at
the time the cats are acquired. This is important to document the identity of each animal and for tracking animal
transactions.
The Licensee needs to ensure that all Cats currently on the premises, as well as any new Cats that are acquired in
the future, are identified with both an official USDA tag and a clear photograph.
Correct from this date forward.
