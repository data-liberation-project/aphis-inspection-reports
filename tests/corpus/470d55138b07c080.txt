Sheltered housing facilities.
A sheltered enclosure containing 3 Ringtail Lemurs is not surrounded by a perimeter fence.

By not having a perimeter fence, there is nothing that prevents unwanted humans and wild animals from approaching the
enclosure and having contact with the nonhuman primates.

The primary enclosure must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is 6 feet tall and 3 feet in distance from the primary
enclosure.

Correct by 8/25/21.

Facilities, general.
Five grey wolves escaped from their enclosure on 5/27/21 by digging underneath the fencing of their primary enclosure.
They then were able to dig underneath the perimeter fence to escape the facility. One male wolf (#587, DOB 2020) was
recovered uninjured. One male wolf (#508, DOB 2014) was recovered but sustained an injury to its right front foot and is
currently being treated by the Attending Veterinarian. One male wolf (#499, DOB 2010) has not been found. The wolf is

presumed dead and may have been possibly shot by a local resident, although this has not been confirmed and the body
has not been recovered. One male wolf (#501, DOB 2010) was hit by a car and had to be euthanized due to its injuries.
A female wolf (#533, DOB 2016) was hit by a car and died immediately.

An enclosure that is unable to contain the animals may result in the animals escaping from the enclosure, potentially
resulting in the animals getting injured, killed, or not being found as what happened in this case.

The enclosure must be repaired to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Until repaired, the
enclosure should not be used to house any regulated animals.

Correction: The primary enclosure was repaired prior to inspection.

A perimeter fence that becomes compromised and fails to contain the regulated animals may result in the animals

escaping from the facility should they escape their enclosures, potentially resulting in the animals getting injured, killed, or
not being found as what happened in this case. In addition, wild animals can penetrate a compromised perimeter fence
potentially spreading disease to the regulated animals.

The perimeter fence must be repaired so that it can contain the animals should they escape from their primary
enclosures.

Correction: The perimeter fence was repaired prior to inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Facility Representative.
