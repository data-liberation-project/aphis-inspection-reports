FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure containing two cougars had a wooden shelter with a screw sticking out from the roof of the shelter.
Screws sticking out from the shelter doesn't adequately protect the animals within the enclosure. The licensee must
ensure all sharp points are removed from the enclosure.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence surrounding the enclosures at the facility located on Sunrise Rd. located in Stacy, MN had an
opening gate that is 6 feet tall. At the back end of the property, part of the perimeter fence is not secured by posts
causing that part of the fence to be unsturdy. The fence can easily be moved at the top and can extend a few feet
inward or outward depending on which way it is moved. The enclosures within the perimeter fence contain wolves,
cougars, and bears. Not having an 8 foot tall gate and having part of the fence line not secured by posts doesn't
ensure that the animals contained within the perimeter fence can't escape if they somehow got out of their primary
enclosures. The gate must be corrected so that it reaches a height of 8 feet. In addition the fence line near the
back end of the property must be secured so the top part of the fence is not able to shift inward or outward the way
it can now.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Two enclosures had trees that were falling over and were leaning from the inside of the enclosure to the outside of
the enclosure. Both trees were leaning onto other trees on the outside of the enclosures. If these leaning trees fall
further, they will land on the fence of the primary enclosures that could give the animals inside of these enclosures
the opportunity to escape. One of the leaning trees would also land on the fence line of another primary enclosure
that is next to the primary enclosure that the tree stands within. In addition there are two trees that have fallen over
and are leaning on top of the fence line of a wolf enclosure. The weight of one of the trees has caused the top of
the fence line to bend inwards. While the fence line is not damaged to the point where it would allow for the escape
of the animals inside, any further damage to the fence line may allow for the animals inside to escape. The grounds
within the enclosures must be kept in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to keep the animalscontained.
This was a focused inspection following up on the noncompliances cited on the inspection from 5/10/16. With the
exception of what was cited on this report, all other noncompliances cited from the previous inspection had been
corrected as of the time of this inspection.
