WATERING.
The water bottles of two enclosures, housing 1 rabbit each, are in need of cleaning. Both bottles had a thick layer of
slimy green/brown fuzzy material coating the interior walls as well as the area surrounding the opening. Unclean
and unsanitary drinking water can cause illness and discomfort to these rabbits. All watering receptacles shall be
sanitized when dirty, provided, however, that such receptacles shall be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Areas of disrepair were identified throughout the facility:
-(cid:9)The wire making up the black pig’s primary enclosure was not fixed to the ground and had come up on one side
leaving behind a gap large enough for the pig to go through. Such an enclosure is not structurally sound and does
not securely contain the pig.
-(cid:9)A broken wooden feeder was found in the goat enclosure leaving behind 3 large boards with at least 3 exposed
sharp nails. In the enclosure housing 2 pigs, the ramp to the shelter structure fell off exposing sharp nails and
protruding screws underneath. Sharp materials such as these within an enclosure can cause injury to the animals.
The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are maintained in good repair and are structurally sound to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals securely. To be corrected by 03/26/2020
