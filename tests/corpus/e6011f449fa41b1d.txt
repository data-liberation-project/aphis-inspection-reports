ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female juvenile hedgehog housed in the north side of the showcase enclosure with 4 other weanling hedgehogs
was noted to be lethargic, seen to sneeze multiple times, and appeared to have an elevated breathing rate at rest
as compared to the other animals. The animal was noted to lay on her sternum or partially curled on her side while
the other juvenile hedgehogs were roaming throughout the enclosure and nudging her. The employee was directed
by the AC VMO to remove this hedgehog for closer examination. Her breathing had a clicking noise and she
appeared weak while being handled. A larger female in this enclosure was also noted to sneeze multiple times,
have a clear nasal discharge, and would lick her nose repeatedly after sneezing as well as when she was running in
the exercise wheel in the enclosure.
Lethargy, reluctance to move, nasal discharge, sneezing, and abnormal breathing rate and sounds may indicate a
severe illness and should be identified quickly so that the animal can be separated from others in case of infectious
illness and so the animal can be evaluated by the attending veterinarian as soon as the problem is noted.
**These hedgehogs need to be evaluated by a veterinarian by 9/23/2015 to determine a diagnosis, initiate a
treatment
for the diagnosed condition, and to develop a plan for follow-up to ensure the animal responds to the treatment as
expected. Records containing information on the suspected diagnosis, treatment needed, and follow-up plan need
to
be made available to APHIS inspectors by 9/25/2015.2.75(b)(1)

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were numerous roaches seen in and around a plastic food container in the back room that held cat food used
for feeding hedgehogs. The lid for the container was not secured and there was a hole, approximately 1 inch in
diameter, near the top of the container. There was a spider web with a dead roach hanging over the shelf above
this and other food containers on this shelf. There were other food items and chinchilla dust stored on a lower shelf
with a fly trap lying on top.
Live and dead insects can contaminate the food which may deteriorate the food and may spread
infectious organisms to the animals to whom the food is provided. Storing food and grooming items with or near
pest control products does not protect such supplies from contamination.
Supplies of food, bedding, and grooming supplies shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies
against deterioration,molding, or contamination by vermin.
To be corrected by 9/25/2015.

SANITATION.
The facility is not effectively controlling insect pests:
**Food, bedding, and grooming supplies on storage shelves in the back room had numerous roaches in and around
these items. Spider webs, one with a dead roach above food containers, were also noted in this area.
**Excessive flies were present in the storefront, within the enclosures housing hedgehogs, and in the back storage
room where food and supplies are kept. The licensee has fly strips hanging in these areas, as well as a single fly
trap near the cash register, but all of the fly strips were fully coated with dead flies and an unused fly trap was found
stored with food and grooming materials in the back room.
Insect pests are a source of bacteria, viruses, parasites, and other possible infectious organisms. Flies
can also spread disease from one enclosure to another by landing on excreta, or other possibly infectious material,
and then landing on the food and water receptacles or directly on the animals in the enclosures.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained.
An effective method to control these pests must be implemented and maintained by 9/30/2015.Inspection was conducted on 9/23/2015 with the Manager, Veterinary student extern, and AC VMO, Tracy
Thompson, DVM. Exit interview was conducted with the licensee at Site 001 on 9/23/2015.
