FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wire mesh fencing making up the enclosure for the goats, llama and pig is in disrepair. The mesh fencing has
sharp ends of wires exposed. There is an area of the previous chicken wire mesh behind the water receptacles in
the corner that has a hole pushed through with sharp wires protruding. There are remnants of the old chicken wire
fencing attached to a support post with sharp wires. There are several broken and exposed long sharp ends of wire
protruding into the enclosure from the new fencing. There is a section of the new fencing that appears to have
already been damaged by the animals that is bowed out, with some broken wires. The materials used for the
enclosures must be of the appropriate material and strong enough for the types of animals housed there. The
damaged fence poses an injury hazard. To ensure the health, safety and well-being of the animals the damaged
fence must be replaced and or repaired.
Exit interview conducted with the owner.
This was a focused inspection to look at the enclosures addressed in the inspection report dated 17 March 2015.
