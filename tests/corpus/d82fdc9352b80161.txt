FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the time of inspection 13 of the goats were in a primary enclosure which also contained equipment, boards,
scraps, old fencing, fuel tanks and various other materials. Many of the boards had protruding nails. There were
many hazardous and potentially toxic items in this enclosure. A section of this primary enclosure fencing was also
pushed down. Goats could escape this enclosure. The goats were about 50 yards away from a busy major
roadway. This enclosure must be repaired and have all items hazardous to the animals in it removed in order to
prevent possible injury or death to these goats.
