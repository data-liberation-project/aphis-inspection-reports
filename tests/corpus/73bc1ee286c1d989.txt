2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
At the time of inspection, there were members of the public hand feeding and petting several fallow deer and goats
through the fence of the pen the animals were being contained in, as well as inside of the rabbit pen (that contained 8
rabbits), without a readily identifiable employee or attendant present in either area. During periods of public handling and
contact, lack of a responsible and knowledgeable attendant can negatively impact the health and well-being of members
of the public, as well as the animals. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must
be always present during periods of public contact.

Primary enclosures.
Upon reviewing animal inventory numbers, it was revealed that 4 of the rabbits were killed by a predator on, or about,
September 13, 2022. Facility representatives arrived and found the rabbits dead in pen #1 upon morning inspections.
Primary enclosures that are not constructed and maintained in a manner to protect the animals - contained therein - from
predators, can negatively impact the overall well-being of said animals, including death. Primary enclosures shall be


structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury, to contain them, and to keep predators
out.
