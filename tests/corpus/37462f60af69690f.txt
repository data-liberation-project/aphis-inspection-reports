WATERING.
The water bottles in the facility had a green appearance consistent with algae accumulation. This was most
noticeable in the bottles adjacent to windows which would also be consistent with algae as the cause. Algae and
bacteria can lead to decreased water consumption and to disease in the animals. Correct by assuring all watering
receptacles are sanitized when dirty and at least once every 2 weeks regardless of appearance. To be corrected by

SANITATION.
Cobwebs and dust were present throughout the facility and there was a notable accumulation of fly feces on the
outer surfaces of the enclosures. Feed and bedding was present on the floor and had accumulated where building
materials and feed storage items were present. These accumulations can increase the likelihood of disease in the
animals. Correct by assuring premises (buildings and grounds) are kept clean and in good repair to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices and remain free of accumulations of waste. To be corrected by: 7 March 2016
