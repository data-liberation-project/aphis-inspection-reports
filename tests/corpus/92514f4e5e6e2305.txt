Facilities, general.
The sides and entrance of the painted wooden shelter box occupied by one woodchuck has areas that are chewed
creating a rough wood surface. Chewing on wood is a natural behavior of woodchucks but chewing a painted surface may
result in injury to the animal. The shelter must be repaired and maintained to prevent injuries to the animal.
