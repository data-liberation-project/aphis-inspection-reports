ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee has exhibited animals and stayed overnight in Charlotte, NC in December 2019. The licensee did not
submit an itinerary to the regional office for any of these exhibits.
Any person who is subject to the Animal Welfare regulations and who intends to exhibit any animal at any location
other than the person's approved site (including, but not limited to, circuses, traveling educational exhibits, animal
acts, and petting zoos), except for travel that does not extend overnight, shall submit a written itinerary to the AC
Regional Director.
A written itinerary shall be sent to and received by the AC Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of travel and
shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition
at any location other than the person's approved site. This is to be completed so that an inspection can be
completed on the facility in travel status and so that the inspector does not attempt an inspection of the home facility
when the licensee is no there.
To be corrected from this day forward.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosure containing two zebras is not encompassed by a perimeter fence. The primary enclosure is comprised
of chain link fencing, standing approximately 20 feet from a neighboring road, allowing direct access to the animals
by other unwanted animals and/or persons. The licensee was unable to locate the perimeter fence variance letter
for the zebra enclosure during the inspection.
Having a perimeter fence in place protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. Additionally, it serves as
a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. In its absence, there is greater risk of contact andunwanted exposure, with potential for injury and disease transmission to the unauthorized public or the regulated
animals themselves.
The perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical
contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Fences less
than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure, or less than 6 feet high, must be approved in writing by the
Administrator.
To be corrected by February 24, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
