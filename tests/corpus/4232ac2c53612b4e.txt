Facilities, outdoor.
Four zebra were unable to enter the shelter structure in their pasture. During the inspection, the licensee was housing
peacocks under the shelter, closing the gate so the zebra could not come in contact with the birds. Additionally, the gate
at the back of the pasture was closed, preventing access to another shelter in the adjacent pasture.

Inadequate protection from sunlight and inclement weather can lead to overheating, discomfort, or increased exposure in
extreme temperatures and elements. All animals must be provided with shelter to prevent discomfort, protection from
direct sunlight, and exposure to extreme climates.
