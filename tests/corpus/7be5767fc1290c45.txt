CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
Twenty four adult rabbits are housed together with multiple bird species in an outdoor primary enclosure. Rabbits
are a prey species and can become easily stressed when housed with other species. Some birds can be territorial
and may peck/injury the rabbits. The bird feces may also contaminate the food for the rabbit and the surfaces of the
enclosure. Fecal material may contain bacteria and parasites and cause the rabbit to become ill. On inspection, the
rabbits did not appear stressed by the presence of the birds and no harmful interactions between the two species
were seen. Rabbits must not be housed in the same primary enclosure with another species unless required for
scientific reasons.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The feeder in the field containing the Alpacas and Dromedary Camel was damaged along the bottom. This damage
has created sharp edges on multiple sides of the feeder along the ground. These damaged areas could cause a
significant cut or other injury to the animals. The facility must be constructed of such material to protect the animals
from injury.
