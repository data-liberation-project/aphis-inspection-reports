ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
"Tang" drink powder was being added to the drinking water at an unknown concentration. The amount of Tang
added to the water is estimated by the licensee based on color. The program of veterinary care did not provide
guidance on this method of supplementing vitamin C. The licensee stated that he previously had guinea pigs with
hair loss, consistent with vitamin C deficiency, and had spoke to the attending veterinarian in reference to the use
of Tang. The attending has not provided guidance for the use of this supplement. Despite the use of this
supplement there has been re-occurrences of vitamin C deficiency. The inspector attempted to make contact with
the attending veterinarian to determine the guidance, if any, was given, and if they were comfortable with the
supplement being given. The attending veterinarian was not available or in the office until July 23, 2017.
Improper supplementing of vitamin C can lead to the development of disease. Not following the directions of the
attending veterinarian does not ensure adequate veterinary care. The licensee shall assure that the attending
veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the
adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.

The means of euthanasia in the program of veterinary care was for it to be performed by a veterinarian with an
injection of euthanasia solution. The licensee stated that he performs euthanasia himself by other means. The
method does not meet the requirements of euthanasia defined in the regulations as being a humane destruction
accomplished by a method that produces rapid unconsciousness and subsequent death without evidence of pain or
distress. The inspector attempted to make contact with the attending veterinarian to determine the guidance, if any,
was given, and if they were comfortable with the method being used. The attending veterinarian was not available
or in the office until July 23, 2017.
Improper methods of euthanasia can cause pain and distress to the animal. Not following the directions of the
attending veterinarian does not ensure adequate veterinary care. The licensee shall assure that the attending
veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the
adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. To be corrected by: This day forward.

WATERING.
There was dark brown residue around the inside of the waste water piping surrounding the nipples of the water
bottles.
The lack of proper cleaning and disinfecting of water bottles and waste water collection tubes/pipe could lead to the
harboring of disease. The licensee shall clean and sanitize water bottles and waste water collection tubes/pipe
when dirty, provided, however, that such receptacles shall be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.

3.31(a)(2) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Many enclosures containing adult and juvenile guinea pigs had excessive feces and/or wet bedding. The licensee
stated that they are cleaning enclosures and replacing bedding on a weekly basis.
Wet bedding and excessive feces can increase disease hazards to the animals. Correct this by ensuring primary
enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an excessive accumulation of excreta and provide
dry bedding to the animals. Additionally, all enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
