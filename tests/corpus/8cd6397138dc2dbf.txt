Facilities, general.
The decking surrounding the Holding and Quarantine pools for one adult male sea lion (“LB”) and one adult female sea
lion (“Deliliah”) when they are off exhibit has multiple areas where the concrete coating is missing and the underlying
concrete is eroded or broken, leaving a rough surface over which the sea lions must haul themselves to and from the
pools.
Unsealed and/or broken concrete can cause injury to the sea lions and is difficult to clean because it is porous. The
licensee must ensure that the sea lion enclosure floors are kept in good repair to help prevent animal injury and facilitate
proper sanitation.

Water quality.
Water quality monitoring records show that coliform counts for the main exhibit and holding pools, occupied by one adult
male sea lion and one adult female sea lion, exceeded the maximum threshold for coliforms for many times over the last
year due to failure of water life support equipment and components, necessitating the move of the two sea lions to
adjacent holding areas with pools that do not meet minimum space requirements for the larger, male sea lion. The


attending veterinarian needed to authorize these temporary holding measures to keep the animals out of the poor quality
water for 1 or more days at a time for multiple instances of inappropriate water quality during the past year.
Poor water quality poses a threat to animal well-being and health, contributing to discomfort as well as eye, skin and
respiratory illnesses. The facility must ensure the availability and effectiveness of equipment and protocols for
maintenance of water quality within marine mammal enclosures. Sustained levels of high coliform counts and/or
inappropriate levels of pH and chemical additives must be prevented to protect the health and well-being of the animals
and eliminate the need to frequently relocate them to alternate areas that do not meet space requirements.

Water quality.
Coliform testing for the water inside the sea lion exhibit, holding and quarantine pools was not performed at least once
weekly. Water quality monitoring records show that coliform testing did not occur between 12/18/2022 and 12/27/2022.
Failure to monitor coliforms, pH and other chemical additives as required can delay mitigation to prevent animal
discomfort or illness resulting from poor water quality. The licensee must ensure that coliform testing is performed at least
once weekly and that pH testing is performed at least once daily for all pools where marine mammals have access.

Facilities, general.
During March 2022, zoo staff became aware that the entire colony of 14 adult black-tailed prairie dogs was missing. The
animals were last seen on September 26, 2021, prior to going underground for the colder season. When the animals did
not reappear in March as expected, zoo staff began to actively search for them, using camera equipment to explore the
tunnels and burrows and, finally, excavating the underground passages. No tunnels were noted to breach the exhibit
perimeter, and no opening could be found in the exhibit walls that would have facilitated the animals’ escape. None of the


animals or their carcasses were found, but a feral cat had been seen around the area and the exhibit is mostly uncovered,
making predation a possibility. The facility discontinued use of the enclosure for any animals and has not procured
additional prairie dogs for the collection.

On 10/22/2021, zoo keepers noted that an ~7-year-old female slender-tailed meerkat, named “Pink” (202226) was
missing from the meerkat enclosure. A search of the enclosure did not reveal a potential means of escape for the animal,
and the remaining three meerkats in the enclosure were all accounted for. The remaining meerkats were moved out of
the enclosure for excavation efforts and the El Paso Animal Control Department was notified in case the animal had
escaped. Despite these efforts, the animal was never recovered and predation by a raptor or other animal was a
remaining possibility.

The floors, a gate and some of the metal posts within the barn used for housing one adult male and one adult female
Malayan tapirs are in disrepair; the barn floors have eroded concrete, and some of the metal posts and one gate are
rusted, with sharp points in some areas with which the animals can come into contact.

Failure to provide enclosures that keep zoo animals contained and safe, and which are built to prevent entry of other
animals from coming over or under walls or fences of the primary enclosure can lead to animal injury, escapes and
predation events. Sharp points and other damaged surfaces pose a risk of injury to the animals and prevent proper
cleaning and sanitization.
The licensee must ensure that housing facilities are constructed in a manner and of such material and strength as
appropriate for the animals involved; they must be sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury


and to contain the animals. Enclosures should not only prevent zoo animal escapes, but also effectively prevent predator
access.

Facilities, outdoor.
The sliding track gate which serves as a section of perimeter fencing outside of the commissary, has a gap of ~6 inches
beneath it when it is closed. This gate and the attached section of fencing must serve as the perimeter fence for this part
of the zoo because the city water district’s fencing and gates that surround the nearby concrete canal are in disrepair and
also have gaps of several inches beneath and between the chainlink.
Perimeter fences must be placed and constructed so as to be able to serve as secondary containment for all of the
animals inside the zoo, as well as prevent outside animals and people from entering over, under or through the perimeter
fencing. The licensee must ensure that fencing which must function as a perimeter fence not only meets minimum height
requirements, but is maintained in good repair with no gaps or holes present that could allow the entry of unauthorized
persons or outside animals.
