2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility's Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was found to be outdated at the time of inspection. Also, the last
PVC formal agreement between the licensee and the Attending Veterinarian (AV) was not properly executed as
required by federal law. Additionally, several subsections of the PVC need to be specific and detailed. The AV
should review, edit and provided detailed information in the following areas: all species to be covered, parasite
control products, euthanasia methods (i.e. products, dosages and routes of administration), and after-hours
emergency care (i.e. name of veterinarian, veterinary hospital/clinic/service, addresses and telephone numbers).
To ensure the best welfare and adequate veterinary care of regulated animals bot the licensee and AV must
execute an updated PVC as soon as possible.
