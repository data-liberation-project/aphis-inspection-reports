Abundant rodent feces were found in the food storage area, including inside a cabinet designed to store food for the
animals on exhibit.
The presence of pests can create an unhealthy environment for the animals. A safe and effective program for the
control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests should be established and maintained in order to
protect food from contamination, and animals from exposure to pests. Pest control helps to safeguard the well-being
of the animals.
