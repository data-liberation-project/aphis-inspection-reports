2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care does not include rabbits. Rabbits are now present at the facility. It is
essential that these animals be included in the program of veterinary care. Veterinary recommendations for the
care of these animals should be included in the program. APHIS inspectors then use this information while
inspecting the animals in order to determine if veterinary recommendations are being followed by the facility. This
program is a valuable tool in order to ensure the continuing health and comfort of these animals. Rabbits need to
be included on the program of veterinary care.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the time of the last inspection the facility has acquired and disposed of several animals including: rabbits,
muntjacs, sika deer, elk, fallow deer, red deer and bison. It is required that the facility record these animal
acquisitions and dispositions. This information is needed to help the inspector to monitor animal health at the
facility. It is also needed to ensure that animals are obtained from legal sources. Record all animal acquisitions and
dispositions.
