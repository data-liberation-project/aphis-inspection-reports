FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some areas in enclosures were in need of repair. There was a hole with loose wires in between two pens for the
fallow deer, a point of a panel sticking into the elk enclosure, the back wall of the shed was loose where a calf is
housed, and there was some loose wire in the goat pen and in the pigs' area. Loose wire, panels and sharp points
could cause injury to animals. Ensure that enclosures and fixtures such as shelters inside of enclosures are
maintained structurally sound and free of sharp points for the safety of the animals.
