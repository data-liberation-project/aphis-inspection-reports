WATERING.
The water receptacle for the red-handed tamarins has a pvc pipe that leads to the water source which has a blue
sealant at the joints. This sealant was applied sloppily and drips were seen on the cage and along the pipe itself.
The animals have access to the this dripped sealant and could possibly ingest the chemical. The animal caretaker
stated that the pipe could be redone properly.

In the enclosure for the giant anteaters there is a hole dug in the south east corner by the keeper access area. This
hole is deep enough that it has passed the concrete pouring along the fence line and sharp uneven concrete isexposed. This area needs to be refilled and kept maintained to prevent possible injury to the animals.
