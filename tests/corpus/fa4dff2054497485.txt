1. The IACUC has not updated their reports to the Institutional Official (IO) at least once every six months as

Animal Care and Animal Facility Inspection.
Although the IACUC has completed the semi-annual reviews of the Program for Animal Care and Animal Facility
Inspection in August 2013 and March 2014, as of the 5/15/14 inspection, the 10/23/13 semi-annual report to the IO
still had not been updated by the IACUC. 7 months have elapsed since the IACUC prepared and updated their
semi-annual report to the IO.

animals and the inspection of the animal facilities should be updated at least once every 6 months upon completion
of the required semi-annual evaluations and the report should be submitted to the Institutional Official of the

Compliance with the requirements outlined in this Section is important to ensure the Institutional Official is aware of
and updated regarding the status of the animal use program and the condition of the animal facilities to ensure that
the facility is adhering to the standards and regulations specified under the Act.
