INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
**Protocol L11209003Q gives an inadequate rationale for the numbers of animals to be used. The principal
investigator indicates there will be 70 animals utilized as urine donors to include "10-20 intact adult males, 10-30
intact adult females, 10-15 neutered adult males, 10-15 spayed adult females". The principal investigator also
indicates there will be 70 animals utilized as subjects to include 30 adult males and 40 adult females. The protocol
indicates a total of 80 animals will be utilized in experiment 1 (70 donors and 70 subjects,with animals used as both
donors and subjects when possible). It is unclear whether the total number of animals being utilized including
donors and subjects will be a total of 80 animals or 70 + 70 for a total of 140 animals. It is the responsibility of the
research facility to ensure that activities involving animals includes a clear and concise rationale for the species and
numbers of animals to be utilized in order to promote the health and well-being of the animals as set forth in this
section.
