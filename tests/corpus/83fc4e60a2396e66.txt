2.40(b)(3) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The tan and brown rabbit housed with two other rabbits in a rabbit hutch has an eye issue in its left eye. The tissue
around the left eye is very swollen, and there is a small amount of yellow/green discharge. The rabbit also scratches the
left side of its face. The head zookeeper had noticed this eye problem the day before inspection and stated that the rabbit
had a fight with one of the other rabbits, but had not notified the licensee, or made contact with the attending veterinarian.

Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include: Daily observation of all
animals to assess their health and well-being; If daily observations are conducted by someone other that the attending
veterinarian that a method of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

All problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being must be conveyed to the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and
treatment to prevent unnecessary pain and suffering.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
