2.131(c)(3) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A young lamb, weighing about 10 pounds, died shortly after an accident during the September 3, 2016 exhibition.
The lamb was part of a herd of sheep that move across the stage during each performance. During this show, the
lamb suddenly stopped running on stage and a boy actor running behind the lamb tried to stop to avoid the lamb,
but tripped and fell on the lamb. The lamb was walking normally afterwards, but was found dead a short time later.
Young animals can be unpredictable, are more fragile, and cannot withstand stress as well as adult animals. The
licensee must ensure that animals used for exhibition are old enough and strong enough to perform without
detriment to their health and well-being.
