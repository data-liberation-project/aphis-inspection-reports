ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care did not provide all of the vaccinations given to the puppies, what medications to use
for external or intestinal parasites, the frequency that the attending veterinarian is going to do regularly scheduled
visits, or the date of the last visit to the facility. The licensee stated that the vet visited last fall. The last
documentation for veterinary care that was presented at the inspection was September 6, 2014.
An incomplete program of veterinary care and lack of regularly scheduled visits does not allow for adequate
veterinary care. The licensee must have formal arrangements with a veterinarian to include a complete program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits.
