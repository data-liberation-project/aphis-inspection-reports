3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the barn housing the adult dogs, the far end enclosure has a large shelter constructed of wood. The sharp ends
of at least two screws are protruding through the wood around the access door and are located at the level of the
dogs. There is also a heat bulb in the upper corner of the shelter that is protected by a sheet of woven wire. The
bottom of this wire sheet has broken resulting in sharp points that are located at the level of the dogs. There are
two adult Australian Shepherds housed in this enclosure. The sharp ends of the screws could cause injury to the
dogs as they enter and exit the shelter through the access door and the sharp points on the broken wire sheet could
cause injury to the dogs as they move around the shelter.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges that could injure the animals. The
licensee must remove, replace, or alter the screws in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the dogs. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures housing animals are free of sharp points and jagged edges at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the barn housing the adult dogs, the far end enclosure has a large shelter constructed of wood. The wood
framing the shelter's access door has been excessively chewed by the dogs. The chewing has caused the wood to
become splintered and shredded and these damaged areas can no longer be adequately cleaned or sanitized.
There are two adult Australian Shepherds housed in this enclosure.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surfaces that cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must repair, replace or alter the
damaged wood in a manner that allows for adequate cleaning and sanitization. The licensee must ensure that all
surfaces of enclosures housing animals are maintained and kept in good repair at all times. Correction date: February 10, 2016
