INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility's program for humane care and use of animals was reviewed only once last year. It was reviewed by
the IACUC in April of 2013. It was not reviewed again until February of 2014. The facility was experiencing staffing
issues which have since been resolved. A program review conducted at least once every six months ensures
aspects for optimal animal welfare are reviewed, discussed, and implemented. If a program review is not
conducted, animal welfare may decline. The IACUC shall review, at least once every six months, the facility's
program for humane care and use of animals.
