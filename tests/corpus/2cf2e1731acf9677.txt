Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The warm room staff did not conduct an adequate daily observation of 13 spiny mice that were accepted for consignment
the morning of December 3rd, 2022. During their afternoon inspection on December 3rd, USDA inspectors identified one
spiny mouse with a dried open injury over its right neck. The injury seemed to penetrate the thickness of the skin. The
warm room staff did not identify this injury and did not report it to the attending veterinarian. Deep wounds are painful and
may easily become infected. Effective daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being must be
conducted, including a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. After USDA Inspectors
mentioned the animal to the AV, the AV identified the wound as an old injury and did not recommend any further
treatment.
2.132(d)

Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
A records review of the August 2022 auction revealed JD consigned animals without a valid USDA license. Consignor
B898 sold one female raccoon and one male Muntjac without a valid USDA license. No one time exemption was noted on


file. No dealer or exhibitor shall knowingly obtain any dog, cat, or other animal from any person who is required to be
licensed but who does not hold a current, valid, and unsuspended license. Correct prior to the next auction.
3.87(a)(3)

Primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates.
The transport enclosures for 7 common marmosets and 1 red handed tamarin did not securely contain them within their
enclosures. Three of the enclosures were handcrafted transport cages with metal wire spaced 0.5 inches wide. Three
enclosures were bird cages with black metal wire spaced 0.5 inches wide. The openings between the wires of the
transport cages were large enough to allow the nonhuman primates' forearms to reach out and grasp the USDA
inspector's shoelace and pen. Openings large enough for the non-human primates to extend parts of its body through can
lead to injury to the non-human primates or to other animals/people nearby. The nonhuman primate shall at all times be
securely contained within the enclosure such that it cannot put any part of its body outside the enclosure.
Correct prior to the February 2023 auction.
3.87(a)(10)

Primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates.
Three primary transport enclosures housing 3 common marmosets did not have solid, leak proof bottoms. The transport
cages were constructed of metal wires all around, and absorbent puppy pads had been placed on the bottom of the cages
along with blankets. Primary transport enclosures should be leak-proof to prevent urine and feces from seeping outside of
the enclosure and to prevent the animals from being excessively soiled. Transport enclosures that prevent the leakage of
bodily fluids must be used for all future animal transport to keep the animals as clean and dry as possible while in transit.
Correct prior to the February 2023 auction.

Facilities, general.


The metal support system for the barn's roof has several areas in need of repair. There are areas of the metal beams that
have severe rust damage and are missing sections of the beam. These defects may impact strength of the supports. The
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.

The records review for the September 2022 auction was conducted on November 30th. The facility inspection and exit
interview took place December 2nd-3rd. They were conducted with the auction manager, Attending Veterinarian and
facility staff.
