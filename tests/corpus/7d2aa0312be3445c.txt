HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are 18 of the 24 kennel doors that have an excessive amount of rust on the both sides of the wire doors. The
dogs come in direct contact with the rust on the doorways, that do appear to leave some orange color on the dogs
legs when they continually brush up against the doorway.
Rusty surfaces are not able to be cleaned or sanitized, as rust can hold dirt, grime and bacteria in the pits of the
rusty surfaces.
All rusty surfaces, including kennel doors need to be repaired or replaced with material that can be readily cleaned
and sanitized according to AWA regulations and standards. The licensee must come up with a plan to repair and
replace rusty surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are 13 fencing panels located between the individual kennels that have broken and missing plastic coating
around the wire surfacing on the entire panel(over 90% coverage). While the metal beneath is not rusty, the broken
plastic pieces that coat the majority of the panel, that comes in direct contact with the animals provides a surface
that is not able to be cleaned and sanitized.
Broken plastic edges and surfaces can harbor dirt, grime and bacteria that can not be cleaned and sanitized
properly. All materials in contact with the regulated animals must be repaired or replaces when it becomes worn or
soiled, and the chewed wire panels with broken, chewed plastic pieces needs to be addressed.
The licensee must repair or replace any surfaces that can not be cleaned or sanitized according to AWA regulations
and standards which have become worn, damaged or soiled.To be corrected by: May 30, 2015

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were multiple food receptacles(7 of 10) that had dark brown/black grime on the inside of the feeders of the
dogs in the kennel, with a thick layer of dust and hair on the tops of the feeders. The food and dogs are in direct
contact with the soiled areas. Six of the outdoor flaps and walls of several of the primary enclosures had patches
of dark brown grime accumulation on the walls and surfaces around the door flaps. There has not been proper
cleaning or sanitization of the primary enclosures, food or water receptacles in the kennel.
The accumulation of grime, dirt, debris and exceta can lead to health, pest, odor and disease issues if left
unsanitized on a regular basis.
The licensee must incorporate a proper sanitization schedule of the primary enclosures, food and water receptacles
at least once every 2 weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris and grime.
