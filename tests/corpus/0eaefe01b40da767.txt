ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
* The licensee refused to complete the inspection process. The inspection process had started with the first shelter
facility. Wen the second inspector went to get an additional inspection tool from the vehicle, the licensee stated,
Hurry up! I am expecting a salesperson to show up in 15 minutes. Prior to the start of the inspection, it was not
indicated that a salesperson was expected. The salesperson arrived shortly after the inspection process began and
the licensee left inspectors in a gated corral area between the kennel facilities and house, as he went to attend to
the salesperson. He did not mention if he would be right back or not and indications were unclear as he and the
salesperson entered the house. Inspectors waited 15 minutes (3:58p-4:14pm) in the corral area and then knocked
on the door (to notify the licensee that we needed to continue the inspection due to daylight constraints). The
licensee finally answered the door after the fourth separate knocking attempt. Inspectors informed the licensee of
the need to finish the inspection due to daylight constraints (adequate lighting for inspection is required) and if
unable that would be considered a refusal for inspection. The licensee stated: "(cid:28)I understand, but I got to get my
insurance done!" A time frame was asked for,"how much longer that might take?" He replied "(cid:28)about a half hour or
so."(cid:29) Inspectors indicated that with the dwindling daylight, there was only about a half an hour to 45 minutes left of
daylight which indicated the immediate need and concern to finish the inspection. The inspector asked, (cid:28)"So I need
to know if we can'(cid:25)t do the inspection right now, then is that a refusal for inspection?" He replied, "(cid:28)Yea, just go!"
Licensee must notify the inspector of any previous/immediate commitments that may disrupt/ interfere with the
inspection process prior to the start of the inspection. This notification would allow the inspector the digression to
proceed or return at a different day/ time to allow for a thorough inspection without pending constraints.

3.3(a) DIRECT
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
* A shelter facility containing at least four short- haired dogs did not have adequate additional heat or beddingprovided. Two of the dogs had solid rubber floor matts. The remaining animals primary enclosure portion was not
viewed (due to unforeseen circumstances). Licensee did not have any other additional heat source or bedding
provided for the dogs. Licensee indicated that bedding was on site, but stated none of the dogs had bedding (they
were eating it) other than solid rubber floor matts. The ambient temperature was 44* F at 3:30pm and the surface
temperatures ranged from 31*-35* F in various parts of the building (inside walls, floor, outside walls). The ambient
temperature must not fall below 45* F for more than 4 consecutive hours when dogs are present. Additional heating
and/or clean, dry bedding material is required when the ambient temperature is 45* F or below to minimize
discomfort, stress, allow for burrowing/nesting and to provide insulation against the extreme cold weather.
* To be corrected by: 12/2/14 - Immediately (instructed at time of verbal exit interview)
Inspection and verbal exit interview (12/2/14) conducted with facility representative.
