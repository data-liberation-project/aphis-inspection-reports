3.125(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
REPEAT
Several enclosures were noted as having jagged, rusty points sticking out towards the chinchillas caused by
damage in the front metal wire walls of the enclosures. Direct injury and infection can occur by exposing animals to
sharp or rusted objects. Repair any surfaces containing sharp or rusty objects.
DIRECT/REPEAT
Enclosures housing 243 adult Chinchillas contained a tray on the floor in the past which the animals had direct
contact with. These trays have since been removed, exposing 1 inch by 1 inch metal wire flooring underneath.
Other enclosures in the back room have always had 1 inch 1 inch flooring. The flooring does not protect the
animals from injury, as the gaps between the wire are much larger than the feet of the chinchillas. Materials that
come in contact with the animals must protect the animals from injury. Ensure that the enclosures are structurally
sound and maintained appropriately.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
Water Receptacles
There continues to be sections of the outside of the watering line that has an excessive buildup of hair, cobwebs,
and excreta built up on them. The 5 glass water bottles listed in the previous inspection have been corrected,
however, 3 glass bottles towards the end of the facility now have the same greenish haze. Unclean water
receptacles can contaminate the water supply which can affect the animals in a negative way. All wateringreceptacles must be cleaned or replaced in order to assure a clean supply of water to the animals.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures
There continues to be an excessive accumulation of excreta in at least 3 of the primary enclosures currently
occupied with animals. There is an accumulation of dust, animal hair, wood shavings and areas of excreta buildup
throughout the facility. The facility failed to maintain the primary caging of these animals in a sanitary condition.
Unsanitary conditions can lead to biological disease hazards and can affect the comfort of the animals as well as
their health and well-being. Eliminate the buildup of waste material in and around primary enclosures and maintain
facility in a clean and sanitary condition.
This was a Focused inspection to readdress noncompliances listed in the previous inspection
Medical care noncompliances listed in the previous inspection have been addressed and corrected.
