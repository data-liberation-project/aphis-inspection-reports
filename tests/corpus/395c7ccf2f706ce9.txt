3.1(a) Critical

Housing facilities, general.
***An adult male dog (“Titan”, Microchip #900235000134920) escaped from his enclosure and despite ongoing efforts he
has not yet been recovered. The dog was housed in a large outdoor chain link enclosure and escaped on 05/06/22.
***A kitten (“Macy”, ID# HOP-A-228) was killed by a stray dog. The licensee stated that the stray dog entered the property
and created a hole in the wall of the outdoor area of an enclosure housing a litter of kittens, and the next morning one of
the kittens was found deceased outside the enclosure. The licensee stated that the kitten must have escaped from its
enclosure through the hole created by a stray dog, after which the dog killed it.
***Two adult dogs are currently living on the property but are not kept in enclosures, and there is no fencing to prevent the
dogs from leaving the property. The licensee indicated that this is a temporary arrangement while an enclosure is finished
for these dogs. Both dogs have GPS tracking collars and stay on the property, but there is nothing preventing theft of the
dogs or contact with wildlife or stray animals.
Animals who escape from the enclosures may become stressed, lost, injured, or killed.
Correct by 5/10/22 by housing dogs and cats in enclosures that are structurally sound and in good repair, which protect
the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.
3.4(b)



Outdoor housing facilities.
An outdoor enclosure housing 4 juvenile approximately 5-month-old large breed puppies contains only one shelter
structure which is not large enough to accommodate all of the animals at one time. The shelter structure is a large hard
plastic dog house approximately 2 feet wide by 3 feet long. Animals without adequate access to shelter may suffer from
exposure to the elements or stress. Correct by 5/10/22 by ensuring that outdoor enclosures contain enough shelter
structures to permit all animals to sit, stand, and lay in the shelter(s) comfortably at one time. Corrected at the time of
inspection.
3.6(b)(2)

Primary enclosures.
4 adult cats and 2 kittens were housed in the same room. The kittens were not related to the adult cats in the room.
Kittens may be injured or stressed by the presence of adult cats that are not their mother or foster mother. Correct by
5/13/22 by housing kittens separate from adult cats, unless the kittens are the offspring (or foster offspring) of the female
adult cat.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
