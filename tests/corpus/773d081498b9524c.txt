SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Currently the cement floors inside the primary enclosures of the dogs inside on the North and South walls of the
kennel, and in the outside cement runs on the South side, are not sealed and are not impervious to moisture.
It is important for the cement surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals to be sealed in order to be
able to clean and sanitize properly as unsealed surfaces can absorb and hold bacteria that can cause possible
health issues.
The licensee needs to seal all cement surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals.
