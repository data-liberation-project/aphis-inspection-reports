SANITATION.
***In the enclosure housing 6 sheep and 14 goats, there was an excessive accumulation of feces present on the
ground. Due to the accumulation, the animals could not lay in their enclosure without becoming contaminated by the
waste material. The licensee stated that the enclosure is cleaned once every 2 weeks. Animal enclosures must be
cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards, to reduce disease transmission,
and to prevent the animals from becoming contaminated or soiled. The licensee must clean these enclosures and
ensure that all enclosures housing animals are cleaned as often as necessary to promote appropriate husbandry
standards.To be corrected by 2/28/14
