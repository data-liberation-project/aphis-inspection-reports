ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The zebra, zebu, goats, sheep donkeys and some of the horses are all in need of hoof care. The hooves/claws are
overgrown and too long. The attending veterinarian will need to be consulted as the zebra will not be able to have
it's hooves trimmed without sedation according to the licensee.
The llama and the sheep have heavy coats at time of this inspection. It is currently 91 degrees Fahrenheit with 53
percent humidity. The animals are in need of sheering to help keep them comfortable.

FEEDING.
The two marmosets had two bowls in their enclosure which contained only Cheerios cereal. The diet for nonhuman
primates must be appropriate for the species, size, age, and condition of the animal, and for the conditions in which
the nonhuman primate is maintained, according to generally accepted professional and husbandry practices and
nutritional standards. Feeding of sugary cereal is an inappropriate diet.
There is commercial nonhuman primate food available at the facility and this was corrected at time of the inspection.
The exit briefing was conducted with the Owner.
