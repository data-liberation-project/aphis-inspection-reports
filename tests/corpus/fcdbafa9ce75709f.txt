MISCELLANEOUS.
Access and inspection of records and property.
1. The inspector arrived at 11:15 AM on 4/2/14 to conduct an inspection but the designated contact person for the
registrant was not on the premises. It was learned that the designated contact person was out of state and was
unavailable.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other facility representative available
who could locate and provide access to the IACUC documents and other records required to be kept by the AWA
and the Regulations.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility and animals.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of this recently registered research facility. Report delivered by
e-mail 4/2/14.
