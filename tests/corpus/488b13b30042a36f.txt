essential for proper identification and in order to facilitate the tracking of animals. Each exhibitor shall make, keep,
and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the required information concerning each dog or cat
purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or
which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. Records must be current
and maintained.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At the time of inspection the following dogs: Otis(Golden Retriever), Bo(Border Collie), Rock(German Shepherd
Dog), Barney(Labrador Retriever), and Zeke(Belgian Malinois) were individually housed in enclosures within a
motorhome which did not allow them to have at least 6 inches above their heads while in a normal standing
position. This additional space is required to provide the dogs room for normal postural movements within their
enclosures. The licensee stated that all dogs are being temporarily housed in the motorhome enclosures for the
next few days until maintenance on the kennel building is completed.
The licensee must ensure that all dogs are provided an enclosure that gives them at least 6 inches of space above
the tops of their heads while in a normal standing position.
