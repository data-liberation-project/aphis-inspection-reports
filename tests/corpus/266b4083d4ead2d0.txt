FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Currently there is a clouded leopard that is in the back room of a trailor, which also contains approximatley 3-4
domestic cats in enclosures. The smell of ammonia is extrememly strong inside of the trailor, primarily gathering in
the back room with the leopard. While there is an air conditioner on, the windows and doors are closed, with the
presence of full litter pans, and wet papers from approximatley 1-2 days from the leopard. This is adding to the
confined area, which increases the strong smell of ammonia fumes.
The lack of ventilation to remove urine and ammonia odors can be a source of discomfort and possible health
issues for the regualted animals.
There must be enough ventilation to provide clean air to the rooms where the regulated animals are housed. All
dirty litter pans and papers should be cleaned often enough to prevent the buildup of odors and ammonia in the air.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The clouded leopard has been put back into a smaller enclosure (approx 4ft x 2.5ft x 2.5ft) for the past 2.5 months,
kept in the back room of a trailer on top of an old bed. The leopard is unable to stand and stretch completely in this
enclosure or complete normal postural movements, due to the restricted spacing. This animal continually paces in a
tight circle and did not stop moving, during the inspection. The leopard is let out of the enclosure once per day in the
presence of the licensee, however an adult leopard required more room for longer periods of time. There is
supposed to be new accommodation being made within the next few months according to the owner, however this
small space is still keeping the animal from being able to partake in normal postural movements for the majority of
the day.
The lack of proper space for a regulated animal can be a source of physical and behavioral stress.The licensee must provide more space for the leopard to be able to maintain normal postural movements and/or
increase the time she can be free from the enclosure to properly stretch and move around, until the new enclosure
is completed by December 20, 2017.
