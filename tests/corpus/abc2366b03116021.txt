2.75(b) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of the inspection, neither the licensee nor the facility representatives could present the current inventory of
animals on hand, nor any records of acquisition.
Records containing the required information for animals disposed of or acquired for use in regulated activities, including
those offspring born on premises, are necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their humane care and use. The
licensee shall make, keep and maintain records of acquisition and disposition of all animals that fully and correctly
disclose the required information.
3.26(b)

Facilities, indoor.
At the time of the inspection, the ambient temperature in the room housing four adult guinea pigs was 89.1 degrees
Fahrenheit, and the air felt stifling. A facility representative mentioned that the door to the connecting room is often kept
closed to prevent loss of cool air from that other room, and this causes the temperature to rise in the room housing the
guinea pigs. The connecting door was opened and the room temperature dropped below 85F during the inspection.
Animals that are hot may experience discomfort, lethargy, or stress. Guinea pigs are prone to experience heat stress
quickly when temperatures are too high, and those that are very older or very young, or that could have undetected


medical problems may be especially vulnerable. The licensee must provide additional / alternate cooling mechanisms or
make adjustments (such as leaving doors open) that adequately provide for animal comfort and well-being and ensure
ambient temperatures inside guinea pig housing areas do not exceed 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
