Housing facilities, general.
* An estimated ten holes were observed with sharp, jagged edges. The holes range from two to four inches in width to
four to six inches in length. Ten dogs are in contact with the affected area which is located on the outdoor metal wall
board. Sharp points with jagged edges increase the risk of possible laceration or puncture wounds occurring on the
dogs. All surfaces of housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges that could injure the animals. The
licensee must ensure all surfaces are free of any jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animals. Correct by
3/23/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
