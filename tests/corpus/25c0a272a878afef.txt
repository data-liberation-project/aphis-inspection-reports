Item Veterinary Care 2.40 b 5
In the sea lion holding area there was a 6 month old expired bottle of an antibiotic eye drop solution that was still
being using to treat one of the sea lions. An expired prescription drug may not be as effective for the proper use and
treatment of this animal and delay healing.
The expired bottle was removed at the time of inspection. The facility needs to review the procedure for monitoring
the expiration of drugs being use.
Correct from this date 6/8/2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Assistant Curator.
