FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In an off-exhibit housing area: The front section of chain-link fencing of a primary enclosure housing 2 adult
cheetahs, with no apparent mobility problems, measures 5'4" with an additional 2' 8" kick-in. The overall height of
this fence measures 7'4". Non-rigid fencing-like-material has been added to each of the two front corners of this
enclosure to widen the kick-in. In an adjacent enclsoure, there is a tree that overhangs and touches its fence. This
enclosure also houses cheetahs.
It does not appear the height of the enclosure or the material used to widen the corner kick-ins is appropriate for the
animals involved. In addition, the presence of overhanging trees may provide a means for animals to escape.
Enclosures housing potentially dangerous animals must be constructed of such material and of such strength as
appropriate for the animals involved. Trees growing near enclosure edges should be cut back or removed to
minimize the risk of an animal escaping. A system should be in place to ensure housing facilities are structurally
sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
