The IACUC has not reviewed three active protocols in place since February 2017 and one active protocol in place
since September 2017. The IACUC must review active protocols at least once annually. An annual review of
protocols helps to ensure the health and well-being of the animals being utilized by the facility. The IACUC must
conduct continuing reviews of covered activities at appropriate intervals as determined by the IACUC, but not less
than annually.
