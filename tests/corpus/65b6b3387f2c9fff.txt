CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
* There was one raised, primate enclosure which contained several enrichment items, such as large, plastic, toy
cars/swings and small, empty, plastic jars. All those enrichment items were covered in a dark, grimy substance,
suggesting they were contaminated with waste material. The licensee was in the process of building a new
enclosure for the primates and planned to obtain new enrichment items once the project was complete.
** Hard surfaces and enrichment items which come in contact with the primates but are not properly cleaned and
sanitized pose a health risk to the animals.
*** The licensee must ensure that perches, bars, and other enrichment items in primate enclosures are kept clean
and replaced when worn. CORRECT BY: 5 March 2014

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(a) Shelter from sunlight.
* There was an African crested porcupine housed in an outdoor enclosure which provided no overhead shade.
There was a shade tarp and vegetation near one side of the enclosure which provided some shade when the sun's
rays were at a lower angle. However, there was nothing above the enclosure to protect the animal from the rays of
the sun when it was directly overhead. Although the inspection was conducted in February, the temperature
reached into the 80's on the day of the inspection.
** Adequate shade is necessary to help prevent animals from becoming overheated.
*** The licensee must ensure sufficient shade is provided to all animals kept outdoors to protect them from direct
sunlight. CORRECT BY: 9 February 2014.The inspection was conducted with a facility representative. A thorough exit interview was conducted with the
licensee over the phone on 6 February 2014. The licensee was informed of both correction dates at that time.
