2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 3 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. There were 3 guinea pigs with masses under the chin. A
tri-color adult guinea pig in Pen 16, a gray and white adult guinea pig in Pen 27, and a tri-color adult guinea pig in Pen 44
had firm movable masses approximately 1 inch in size under the chin. The animals were in good body condition and did
not appear lethargic. The licensee had not observed the health conditions in the guinea pigs, had not contacted the
attending veterinarian, and was not administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the
condition and provided treatment options.
Masses under the chin can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being of
the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and
treatment for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional
animals if the condition is contagious.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or communicate with the attending
veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
