3.4(b) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There were 4 enclosures in the outdoor facility that had no shelters for the enclosed dogs. One enclosure contained
puppies (6 puppies approximately 6 months old) and the other 3 enclosures held 5 adult dogs. Shelters are
necessary to protect the animals from the elements. While the row of enclosures are in a shed structure with a roof
and a solid wall at the rear of the enclosures, there must be a shelter that has a roof, four sides, and a floor. The
owner must provide and maintain one or more shelters in each outdoor enclosure that are large enough to contain
all the animals at one time and allow them to sit, stand, lie, and turn about freely.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
