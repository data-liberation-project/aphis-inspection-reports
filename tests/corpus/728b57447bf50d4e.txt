2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A female fawn French Bulldog (#067*097*782) had overgrown toenails. Some of the nails on both rear paws,
especially on the outside digits, had grown so long that they had curled around and were touching or approaching
the pads of the feet. Overgrown nails can cause changes in gait and stance and increase the risk of discomfort.
The licensee must develop and establish an effective nail trimming schedule as part of the overall program of
veterinary care for the animals in the facility. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary
care at all times. The licensee trimmed this dog's toenails at the time of inspection.
*Note - the female Maltese (#098*333*071) included under 2.40 (b)(2) on the report for the April 21, 2015 inspection
was no longer at the facility.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Erika Leisner (VMO) and Bill Heine (ACI).
