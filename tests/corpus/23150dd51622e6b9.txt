ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A female Bassett Hound named Brandy, microchip number 107615586, was observed in thin body condition.
The ribs, hip bones and top of spine were easily visible. Palpation revealed very little body fat coverage over these
areas. During this observation it was noted that along the upper molar teeth brownish accumulations were present
that were obscuring the shape of the teeth along with a receded gum line. This dog demonstrated a normal activity
level but her body condition was significantly less than desired. At the time of the inspection no measures had been
to taken to address the situation. This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment
plans for the poor body condition as well as the dental issues to ensure the health and longevity of this female.
Documentation should be maintained for review of diagnosis and treatments. To be corrected by: 01/10/20
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the designated person.
