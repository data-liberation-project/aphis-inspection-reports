VETERINARY CARE.
The 3 sea lions have not been seen by the attending veterinarian since their main exam in Florida last February
because they have not had any medical issues needing veterinary exam. These marine mammals must be visually
examined by the attending veterinarian at least semiannually, so an additional exam should have been done by
August. At this time they are scheduled to be taken for the main annual exam within a month. In the future, all
marine mammals need to be seen semi-annually.
To be corrected by 1-30-15.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
