ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
(b)(2)
***In the outdoor facility, there was a female Bernese Mountain Dog identified as Verera, #225 that had a raw area
on her left side. This area had hairloss, flesh exposure and a yellowish substance. The facility representative stated
that this area was observed this morning and treated with Ivomec for "hot spot." There were no directions found in
the Program of Veterinary Care for conditions of "hot spots." Health concerns, wounds and other medical issues
that are treated without proper diagnosis can worsen the condition for the animal. The licensee must have this
animal evaluated for appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan by June 3, 2014 and assure that all regulated
animals are given adequate veterinary care at all times.
This inspection began at 0903.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.
End of report.
