Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:15 a.m.--11:45
a.m. on 02 JUN 21.

Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the door. I also called the contact number and left a message. I then waited in
my vehicle for 30 minutes and departed.
