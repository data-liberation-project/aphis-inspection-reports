RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
***While reviewing records of sales and transports, there were some APHIS Form 7020s or other paperwork that
contained information that was missing from the log book however, there were transactions in the log book dated
5/14/16 and 8/1/16 that had no matching information. The log book was missing the following information: complete
addresses, USDA license numbers, identification, animal description and the sales number.
An APHIS Form 7020 received from other inspectors dated 4/7/16 showed that the licensee received a Bonnet
Macaque. The licensee stated that this non-human primate was delivered to South Carolina, yet the licensee had no
disposition paperwork.
A transaction in the log book dated 9/19/16 states that the destination was an auction. In the “notes” column, it
states “all sold.” Records from the auction revealed that two of the non-human primates did not sell and these two
non-human primates were at the licensee’s facility, during inspection on 9/22/16 awaiting transport back to the
seller. Appropriate documentation for acquired and sold animals is essential for proper identification, tracing forward
and trace back of the animal. The licensee must correctly document all broker records and assure that all records
are kept as required.
To be corrected from this day, September 26, 2016 forward.
The exit interview was conducted with the facility representative during the facility inspection on 9/22/16.
End of report.
