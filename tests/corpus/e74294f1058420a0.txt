2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a female shihtzu # LTSI-2 that has a large buildup of green/yellow mucus in her right eye. The eye is
surrounded with a thick crusty rim that scratches across the eye when she blinks. The eye can not be seen clearly
though the buildup of infection/mucus material. There is no record of the treatments being given, or the medication
and dosage prescribed. Due to the buildup on the eye it does not appear the treatments are being given daily, or
possibly there needs to be further evaluation as to the treatment to be given.
Daily observation and follow through with treatments suggested by the attending veterinarian are imperative to
provide proper health care and monitoring of the animals. Incomplete treatments or the absence of proper treatment
of any injury or illness can cause a treatable, temporary condition to become chronic and increase unnecessary
pain and discomfort to the animals.
The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment once an issue is observed.
The owner must keep records of dosages and dates of treatments given for any illness/injuries. The treatments
must be given as directed by the attending veterinarian until the issue resolves to the acceptable level according to
the attending veterinarian.
