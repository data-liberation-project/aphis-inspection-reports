ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection, two animals had hair loss on their sides. The first was a black female pig named Joe. The pig
had hair loss on her left side. The pig was in a pen that is next to another pen that houses a calf that is currently
being treated for ringworm. The licensee stated that she believed the hair loss on the pig was from rubbing up
against things in the enclosure, however no veterinary care had been sought for the pig.
The second animal with hair loss on its side was a black rabbit. The rabbit had hair loss on both sides. The
licensee had observed the hair loss on the rabbit, but had not sought veterinary care for it.
Hair loss can indicate underlying health issues and can also potentially be caused from a variety of conditions that
are contagious to other animals.
The Attending Veterinarian must examine both animals. Correct by 3-10-16.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
End of report.
