2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility did not have records of animal deaths that have occurred since the last inspection. The attending
veterinarian was at the facility in January 2015 but did not have this information to assess and use to make the best
recommendations for the health of the animals in the facility. Records shall include any offspring born of any animal
and the disposition of that offspring, including death and euthanasia. This assures that the attending veterinarian
has information that will allow the best recommendations for health and wellbeing of the animals. Correct from this
point forward.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility owner.
