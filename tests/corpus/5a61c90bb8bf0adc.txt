FACILITIES, GENERAL.

from under the fence. The cow elk was located approximately 48 hours later and humanely euthanized. Outdoor
housing facilities that are not structurally sound cannot protect and contain the animals. The licensee must ensure
that the enclosure fencing is structurally sound and maintained in good repair to ensure that the elk cannot escape
their enclosure. Correct by: The licensee has repaired the enclosure fencing.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Animal Caretaker and City Clerk/Treasurer.
