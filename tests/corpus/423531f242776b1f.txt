ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The African elephant named Megu was observed to have certain gait deficiencies and joint crepitus was heard while
walking the elephant.
When the licensee was asked about the gait issues he had not been aware of such condition because the elephant
did not seem to be in pain so the condition was not reported to the attending veterinarian (AV) prior to the
inspection.
The attending veterinarian (AV) was contacted and he then visited during the inspection, agreed with my findings
and concluded that further evaluation of the elephant needed to be conducted.
The AV stated the elephant should not participate in any performance until further evaluation and his permission for
release after appropriate treatment if he determined that the elephant was fit for future show performances.
To be corrected ASAP.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative and the AV.
