*An adult English Bulldog named "JD" ID # 00070976CF had an open lesion on her forehead with yellow discharge.
The licensee had not observed the condition and the dog was not receiving treatment. Skin conditions with colored
discharge can be the indication of an infection and may be painful to the animal. The licensee shall have the dog
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian to obtain a written diagnosis and treatment plan. Follow up care should be
provided as prescribed and recorded in the animal's health records. TO BE CORRECTED BY:3/16/2016
**There were 5 un-weaned Pug puppies that were born on 2/11/2016. The cage card on the outside of the
enclosure listed that the dam had given birth to 7 puppies and 3 of the puppies were noted to be deceased. While
the licensee had not recorded the dates the puppies had died she stated that they were at least two weeks of age
when they died. She described the puppies as being smaller in size than the rest of the litter but was unsure for the
reason for death as, they were never evaluated by a veterinarian or provided additional care. One of the 5
remaining puppies was 1/2 the size of its litter mates and appeared lethargic and weak. It's litter mates chewed on
its ears and repeatedly climbed over its body rolling the smaller puppy around while it remained motionless. When
the inspector asked the licensee why there were 7 puppies listed on the cage card, 3 of which were marked as
deceased and there were 5 puppies remaining, the licensee and staff explained that they "expected the small puppy
to die soon". The licensee and staff were not providing any individualized or veterinary care to the puppy. The
licensee shall provide adequate and timely veterinary care to all animals at the facility. The licensee was verbally
instructed to contact a licensed veterinarian and provide emergency veterinary care to the puppy immediately. TO
BE CORRECTED BY: 3/14/2016
Note: The licensee left during the inspection to take the puppy to the veterinarian and the inspector confirmed care
was received.

appetite. The veterinarian documented the animal as having a body condition score of a 3/9 and confirmed the dog
was positive for whipworms. The licensee was instructed to provide Fenbendazole, clean, and feed a high protein
diet. The licensee stated she provided Fenbendazole for 6 days, as well as feeding the dog raw hamburger on the
6th day. On the 7th day the dog was found dead with blood draining from its rectum. Upon further inspection it wasdiscovered that the licensee has been mixing her own Fenbendazole wormer by using a large tube of Safegaurd

for adding water to the worming mixture and the attending veterinarian had not authorized its use. Mixing or diluting
medications can alter their desired effect and potency. The licensee shall provide prescribed care as directed by the
attending veterinarian by using appropriate medications in their desired formulation. TO BE CORRECTED
