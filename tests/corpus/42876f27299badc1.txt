2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility is recording the number of adults and weanlings but there is no record of the number of newborns.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses
by deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure
their humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose
the number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including the number of newborns.
