2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Vitamin C has not been given to the Guinea pigs as directed by the attending veterinarian. Without supplemental
vitamin C, guinea pigs may not have an optimally functioning immune system, which makes them susceptible to
disease hazards such as respiratory infections and ringworm. Licensee must assure the attending veterinarian has
appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care. This can be accomplished by following
veterinary guidance exactly.
