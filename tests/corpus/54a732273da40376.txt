ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:30 pm on
16-JUL-19.Arrived at the facility , there was a vehicle in the driveway so I went to the door and rang the bell. There
was no answer. I knocked on the door and the dogs began barking but no one came to the door. I returned to my
car and called the number provided. I left a message to please return my call.
I attempted to make contact by phone again on 7/17/19 at 8:30 am but reached the voicemail. I again left a
message to call me.
