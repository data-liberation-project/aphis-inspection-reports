ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:25 am on
09-MAR-20.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 10:25 a.m. and knocked on the door, there was no answer. I then called the
owner and left a voicemail message. While I was waiting at the facility another individual arrived and told me that
the person I was looking for was no longer at this address. I left the facility and waited at a public location for the
remainder of the 30 minutes. Later in the day I was contacted by the owner; she told me that they had closed down
the business, moved, and were no longer conducting regulated activity. I provided her with the contact information
for the Fort Collins office so she could move forward with cancelling her registration.
