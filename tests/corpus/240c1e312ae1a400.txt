2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:00pm on
28-Mar-19.
The gate is still shut with a padlock on it. I was not able to access the front door to ring the bell. I attempted to call
but the contact number we have on file is not in service. I honked the horn several times but did not get any
response.
