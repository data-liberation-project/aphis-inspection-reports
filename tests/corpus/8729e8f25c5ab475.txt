ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female camel was observed by inspectors to have a large amount of fluid soaked hair on both rear legs.
The fluid was of sufficient amount that it coated and discolored the hair of the hind legs from the back of the upper
thighs down to towards the feet. A thin trail of the fluid was noted on the front of the right leg below the knee and
was red in color. The camel appeared to have a normal gait and was not in obvious distress however a red fluid
present on the hind limbs of a camel is not a normal condition.
All daily observations of problems in animal health need to be communicated to the veterinarian so that an
appropriate diagnosis can be made and a treatment plan instituted as needed to ensure the health of the animals
and the safety of the public that has contact with the animals.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During a recent visit to the zoo by an APHIS official, the African elephant was observed without her handler
immediately available when the public was present in the zoo. The elephant was contained in her enclosure on the
back side of the elephant barn. The keeper was reported to have been in the barn however there are no windows
or other openings within the wall of the barn to visualize the elephant when she is positioned on the south facing
wall of the barn. The barrier between the elephant and the public consists of either single strand electric wire
fencing or areas of livestock panel/gates that are not structurally strong enough to contain the adult elephant should
she choose to get out of her area and into the public areas. The facility must ensure that the handler is with the
elephant at all times when the facility is open or choose to construct a primary enclosure that will adequately contain
the elephant.
The public is permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of animals. This
includes camels, sheep, goats, muntjac deer, fallow deer, bongo, llama, giraffe, sitatunga, oryx, zebra, and kudu.
These animals are housed in the walk through area of the zoo which is open to the public. Additionally, two
temporary pens were set up on two grassy sections of the zoo grounds to allow public interaction with a young
camel and young goats. There are no barriers or signs present to discourage public contact and the guests areencouraged to feed food sold at the entry gate and coin feeders are located throughout the facility. Also, inspectors
noted members of the public picking grass from the facility grounds and feeding it to the fallow deer. There are no
attendants present during public contact and guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals.
Primary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch
the animals. Unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals. Licensees must
ensure that during periods of public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between
the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing
barriers to prevent public contact with these animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are
present at each of these locations to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The roof of the building housing the ringtail lemurs, black and white ruffed lemurs and red ruffed lemurs is in need of
repair. The eave portion of the roof to the right of the entrance door is deteriorating. The roof tiles are crumbling on
the edges and the visible wood underneath appears rotted. On the inside of the building in the corresponding part of
the building the ceiling is wet showing that water is leaking through the damaged roof area. In addition, an
approximately two foot section of the roofline appears to be sagging compared the rest of the roofline with a dented
area visible in the slant of the roof just below that section of the roofline. Tree branches are visible resting on the
roof. The owner stated that the roof was not yet repaired as one of the lemurs was pregnant. A roof in need of repair
can lead to leakage into the building and may not remain structurally sound. The lemur housing facility is still in
need of repair in order to maintain the animals in a safe and secure manner.
3.80(b)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two gibbons are being housed in primary enclosures in the mouse house building that are 6 feet in height.
These primates are brachiating species in Group 6 and require enclosures that are 84" (7 feet) in height to allow for
normal movement. These animals require additional height to meet their minimal space requirements. Lack of
adequate height does not allow these brachiating species to engage in normal species-type behavior including
swinging and may lead to physical and behavioral problems. The licensee stated that these animals are new
acquisitions and they plan to move them to another enclosure. Correct this by providing these animals an enclosure
meeting their height requirements.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There remain several areas of primary enclosure fencing for the goat, pig, muntjac, fallow deer, bongo, sitatunga,
oryx, and blesbok where trees and vines have grown through the fence and areas that are impossible to inspect
because they have been overgrown by brush. The only difference noted on this inspection is that a tree had fallen
on the back fence of the muntjac enclosure. The vegetation and downed tree branch were removed from the
affected area in order to replace damaged fencing. The overgrown areas of fencing are not functional in the current
condition. The licensee must ensure that no trees or brush are affecting the structural strength or the ability to
inspect the fencing. Failure to maintain a functional primary enclosure fence does not ensure that all animals can be
properly contained and protected from injury. Correct this by conducting a thorough self-inspection of all enclosure
fencing and clearing all vegetation needed to ensure that all areas of fencing are functional, inspectable and in
compliance with written requirements.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility currently does not have a secondary or perimeter fence for some portions of the zoo. Several primary
enclosures, including those housing the goats/sheep/zebu petting zoo, pigs, muntjac, fallow deer, bongo, giraffe,
and sitatunga, back up to a county road with the primary enclosure fence and some vegetation the only barriers
between the public on the road and the animal enclosure. In one section there is an area where the public can climb
up a short rise and get directly up to the giraffe enclosure fencing. In addition, there is another area of the zoo
where the camel and kudu enclosures abut the neighbor’s property. The neighbor's backyard can be seen through
the fence and on the previous inspection the neighbor's dog was seen running along the fence adjacent to the
camels. The lack of perimeter fencing can allow for contact between the public and unwanted animals with the
exhibited animals which could be dangerous for both the animals and the public. The perimeter fence should also
act as a secondary containment system in case of damage to the primary enclosure fencing. The facility shall
address the lack of secondary perimeter fencing by adding additional fencing or by other corrective measures as
required by the regulation.

SANITATION. ** Several rodent holes were found behind the porcupine enclosure near the cougars. A live rat was observed
inside the muntjac enclosure and also in the feed pan for the muntjac. Other rodent holes were found by the tufted
capuchin enclosure near the front of the facility and next to the Mandrill exhibit. There were also rodent paths worn
in the grass area near the Mandrill. The presence of these mammalian pests is a potential disease hazard to the
animals as these rodents can be carriers of disease and parasites. Safe and effective programs of control for these
pests must be established and maintained to minimize the risks to the animals. Correct by evaluating the current
pest control program and ensuring that effective methods are maintained.
