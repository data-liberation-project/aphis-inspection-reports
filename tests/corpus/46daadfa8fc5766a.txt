veterinarian recommends bringing the animals in or taking it to the nearest veterinarian. The note indicates the
facility representative had concerns about transport stress and declined the recommendation. The disposition of the
animal is unknown. The recommendations of the attending veterinarian must be followed to protect the animal an
ensure animals are not subjected to more than minimal pain or distress. The attending veterinarian must have the
authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care. The recommendations of the attending veterinarian
must be followed for the overall health and well-being of the animal. Correct immediately.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***On May 9, 2014 and May 14, 2014, the Bactrian camel (cid:28)Achilles(cid:29) was sitting in the barn. Upon being forced to
stand, I noticed the animal made a noise as if it was in pain, appeared to be stiff in the hind limbs, and was favoring
the back left leg. The camel was also thin with spindly legs and hair loss over most of its body.
The history of this animal shows a problem that may not have completely resolved. There had been no
documented communication with the attending veterinarian regarding the condition of the animal since April 15,
2014. (NOTE: The attending veterinarian was present during his routine monthly visit to examine the animal on
May 14, 2014.) Documentation indicates there has been no action taken to contact the attending veterinarian
concerning the current condition of the camel..
Animals must be observed daily for abnormalities, and signs of illness, and trauma to ensure that they are in good
health and receive prompt veterinary care when needed. Frequent communication with the attending veterinarian
facilitates the diagnosis of such conditions and ensures animals receive the proper treatment in a timely fashion.
The Bactrian camel (cid:28)Achilles (cid:28)and all other animals must be observed daily and a method of direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian must be implemented. Correct immediately.
2.40(b)(4)ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care lists gunshot as one of the acceptable methods of euthanasia.
There is no written SOP indicating the person(s) who will be performing the euthanasia, their qualification(s),
training, certifications; weapon(s) used, bullet caliber(s), area where it will be performed and other pertinent
information to ensure that the animals are euthanized quickly and painlessly.
Gun shot, although an acceptable form of euthanasia, should be used when no other means of euthanasia is
available and by personnel skilled in the use of firearms. A skilled person must be identified and the credentials for
the use of humane gunshot documented. Additionally, standard operating procedures for the use of gunshot for
euthanasia must be established and approved by the attending veterinarian. Correction: The PVC was appropriately
updated to reflect the euthanasia procedures for site 2.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
CRITICAL NCI
***On January 28, 2014, the male African porcupine was removed from his indoor enclosure and placed outside in a
bedded 3-sided shelter for greater than 4 hours. The animal was found recumbent in the afternoon and brought
inside for treatment of exposure to cold temperatures. The animal was unresponsive to treatment and died later
than evening. The temperatures on that day were a low of 8 degrees and a high of 18 degrees. Animals may never
be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity, and time that is detrimental to their health or well-being,
taking into consideration such factors as age, species, and acclimation status to the current climate. The male
African crested porcupine, a warm-climate species, was exposed to excessively cold temperatures for a prolonged
period of time which was detrimental to its health. Procedures must be implemented to ensure animals are handled
appropriately at all times and that no more animals are exposed to climatic conditions that are detrimental to their
health. Correct immediately.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
The facility representative refused to sign the inspection report because a disagreement with some of the NCIs.
