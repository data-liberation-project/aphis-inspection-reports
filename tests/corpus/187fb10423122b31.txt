FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the small enclosure in the front of the barnyard area, the shed door had broken, rotted wood and exposed nails.
These exposed nails could cause injury to animals. The facility must ensure that its buildings are maintained in good
repair and free of sharp points to protect the animals from injury.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Throughout the premise, there were several areas with drainage issues that need to be addressed.
***In the livestock barnyard, which houses the Scottish highland cattle, alpacas, and emus there were areas of
excessive pooling of water and mud. Specifically, in the high traffic areas, such as in between the cattle shelter and
fence, the area under the gate that transitions between the cattle and alpaca sections, and from the main barn
extending into front of the smaller section of barnyard.
***In the enclosure that houses the two sheep, there were areas of pooling of water and mud by the front gate.
***In the enclosure that houses the three goat kids, there were areas of pooling of water and mud by the front gate.
***In the “nursery” enclosure that houses the mini zebu, goat, sheep and pig, there were areas of excessive mud by
the front gate.
***In the old emu enclosure, there was a large pool of water by the automatic waterer.
Excessive standing water and mud could harbor pest and/or cause disease conditions, such as foot rot. A suitable
method to rapidly eliminate excess water must STILL be provided to ensure that all animals are not subject towalking through and standing in mud and water. An appropriate component that can withstand the wear, tear and
weight of large animals, such as exotic cattle should be utilized in the method of rapidly eliminating excess water.

SANITATION.
There were at least three dead locust trees on the premise. During the inspection, several large pieces of tree bark,
from one of those trees, broke off and landed into the kid goat enclosure. The pieces ranged in size from
approximately two to five feet in length. It created a loud noise that startled the animals in the immediate area.
Those pieces of bark could have caused injury. The facility must ensure that building and grounds are kept in good
repair in to protect the animals from injury.
