PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the Eco-center building the enclosure housing 2 Cotton-top tamarin has a concrete tree-like structure that the
paint is peeling off. The areas where the paint is peeling does not allow for those surfaces to be properly cleaned
and sanitized. Ensure that all surfaces that come in contact with the nonhuman primates can be readily cleaned
and sanitized or replaced when worn or soiled.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The chain link fence along the back side of the enclosure housing 5 Bison and 2 Elk has several panels where the
bottom of the fence is bent upward with gaps. The bent up ends of the fence has sharp edges protruding towards
the animals that could cause injuries.
The chain link fence behind the shift cage for Bison, Elk and Takin has several areas where the fence is bent
upward with sharp edges protruding towards the animals that could cause injuries.
The enclosure housing 2 bison calves located behind the Veterinary Clinic has two broken boards. One board is
deteriorating leaving shredded edges and the other board has a large hole with shredded edges. The boards are
not in good repair and eventually the animals may break through them and could potentially become injured.
There is chewed and ripped wood on the back of the shelter inside the enclosure housing 1 Dromedary and 1
Bactrian camel. There is an area where the camels have chewed completely through to the inner wall leaving two
holes with an exposed metal bracket. These areas are not in good repair and the chewed, ripped wood could
potentially cause a health issue to these animals.
Indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect and contain
the animals.To be corrected by: Camel Shelter - November 1, 2017 Fence and boards - October 15, 2017

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence along the left side of the main entrance to the facility has branches hanging over the top laying
on top of the barb wire and the bottom of the tree is pushing up against the perimeter fence. The branches hanging
on top of the fence has knocked down one of the barbed wire and the holder for the wire. This area cannot
effectively restrict animals or people from entering the facility or regulated animals from potentially escaping
allowing the health and well-being of the facility's animals to be at risk. The perimeter fence must be constructed
and maintained so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from
entering and functions as a secondary containment system.

SANITATION.
In the enclosure housing 1 adult Lynx along the fence and inside hanging on the logs is an excess amount of
cobwebs. The excess amount of cobwebs could be an indication that pests are being harbored in that area which
can affect the health of the animal and does not facilitate good husbandry practices. Keep all premises clean and in
good repair to protect the health of the animals.
