3.101(a)(1) Repeat

Facilities, general.
During an inspection of the Golden Dome facilities, USDA inspectors identified several areas in need of repair. A wooden
board located adjacent to the ceiling of an enclosure housing two harbor seas showed signs of rot due to water exposure.
An entryway between the outdoor pool and indoor holding area for sea lions and harbor seals had a section of exposed
concrete. The floor of that entry way also had patches where the paint had been removed and exposed the concrete
below. Furthermore, a different enclosure housing two harbor seals had areas of flaking paint under the concrete skywalk.
Paint sloughing off the wall and flaking paint can cause a health risk to the animals if ingested. Defects on the coating
surface may cause injury to the animals through skin abrasions, lacerations, or other means. Rotting wood or other
structural defects within animal enclosures may put animals at risk. Indoor and outdoor housing facilities for marine
mammals must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to contain
the animals within the facility, and to restrict the entrance of unwanted animals.

Water quality.
A review of water quality records during the period of July 2021 to January 2022 identified three dates where the chlorine
readings were measured above 1.0 PPM. On August 8th, 2021 Pompano 1 pool had a total chlorine reading of 1.17 PPM.


On November 18th, 2021, Golden Dome Show pool had a free chlorine reading of 1.0 PPM and a total chlorine reaching
of 1.50 PPM. On November 25th, 2021 Golden Dome Feeder pool had a free chlorine reading of 1.3 PPM and a total
chlorine reading of 1.45 PPM. Elevated levels of chlorine are harmful to marine mammals and may cause irritation to
eyes, skin and the respiratory system. The primary enclosure shall not contain water which would be detrimental to the
health of the marine mammal contained therein.

Sanitation
During an inspection of the Golden Dome facilities and pools, USDA inspectors identified an accumulation of green
iguana feces at the base of a metal pole between two pools housing sea lions. The size and dark color of the feces
accumulations was indicative that it had not been removed at least daily as required per this regulation. A clump of iguana
feces was seen floating in the pool of an enclosure containing two sea lions. Approximately 11 iguanas were seen in the
vicinity of the feeder pools and the show pool. Reptile feces is known to transmit infectious bacterial diseases such as
salmonellosis and can be hazardous to the health of the marine mammals contained therein. Particulate animal and food
waste, trash, or debris that enters the primary enclosure pools of water must be removed at least daily, or as often as
necessary, to maintain the required water quality and to minimize health and disease hazards to the marine mammals.
