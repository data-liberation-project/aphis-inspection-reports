FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The front walls and some side walls of the enclosures in this facility remain 6 inches in height. Although no
guinea pigs were found loose on the floor of the facility, in the top enclosures guinea pigs were observed freely
climbing over the side walls and out of enclosures into the adjacent enclosures. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosures are structurally sound, maintained in good repair, protect the animals from injury, and contain the
animals. Additional height is required for all of the fronts and sides of the enclosures.
3.26(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
An ammonia odor was present in the facility at the start of this inspection. The licensee immediately opened
windows of the facility and the odor dissipated over the next few minutes. Ammonia odors are a result of
inadequate ventilation, inadequate cleaning and sanitization, or a combination of both. Left unchanged, these odors
can lead to health problems in the guinea pigs, particularly respiratory problems. The licensee must ensure
adequate ventilation is provided at all times to ensure the health and well being of the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
