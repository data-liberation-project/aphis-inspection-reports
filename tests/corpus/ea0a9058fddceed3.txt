Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The last time the bison were examined by the attending veterinarian was November 30, 2020. At that time, the bison
were taken to the attending veterinarian's facility for examination. The veterinarian has not been out for a regularly
scheduled visit to the site since some time before Nov 30, 2020.

Regularly scheduled visits by the attending veterinarian to the exhibitor's premises are a requirement of the written
program of veterinary care to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other
aspects of animal care and use.

Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and
regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor.
