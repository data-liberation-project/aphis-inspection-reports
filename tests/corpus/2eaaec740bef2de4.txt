ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(3) Veterinary care: The following were observed during the inspection: one enclosure in the 5th row
with excessively wet bedding with two dead adult decomposing Robo hamsters with white mold observed in the
area by the decomposing bodies and a strong odor of decomposition, one enclosure in the 4th row with excessively
wet bedding with two adult Robo hamsters and at least four dead baby hamsters, and one enclosure in the 4th row
with excessively wet bedding with two adult Robo hamsters with extremely wet hair over most of their bodies and
the back half of their bodies and their legs were soaking wet. (See section 3.31(a)(2)). Daily observations are
either not being performed or are not being performed adequately as evidenced by the dead hamsters and wet
enclosures found on this inspection. Correct by ensuring all animals are observed daily to access their health and
well-being so that problems with animal health can be addressed by the attending veterinarian in a timely manner
and animals can be moved to enclosures with dry, clean bedding. Correct from this day forward.
3.31(a)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(a)(2) Cleaning and sanitization of primary enclosures: There were three enclosures that housed Robo
hamsters with excessively wet bedding: one in the 5th row with two dead decomposing adults, one in the 4th row
with an adult male and female with at least 4 dead babies, and one in the 4th row with an adult male and female
with extremely wet hair over most of their bodies and the back half of their bodies and their legs were soaking wet.
Once the APHIS official identified the affected enclosures, the facility escort moved the live hamsters to clean, dry
enclosures. Animals housed on wet bedding may become soiled, chilled, ill and may die. The licensee must
ensure that the animals in wet enclosures are moved to clean, dry enclosures to ensure the health and comfort of
the animals. Correct by promptly moving hamsters from enclosures with wet bedding to clean, dry enclosures.
Remains uncorrected.
3.31(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.Section 3.31(b) Housekeeping: Clean enclosures are being stores next to dirty items that need to be washed along
the wall with the sink. Between stacks of clean enclosures was a dirty black plastic tub stored on top of two stacks
of metal enclosure lids stored in a plastic container with water in the bottom. The dirty plastic tub was leaning
against a stack of clean enclosures. Clean and dirty items must be stored separately to prevent contamination and
to ensure that only clean, sanitized enclosures/water bottles are used for the hamsters. Correct by storing
clean/sanitized items in a clean area that is separate from where dirty (to be washed) items are placed. Remains
uncorrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with the co-owner.
