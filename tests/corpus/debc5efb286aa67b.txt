2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**The program of veterinary care had not been completed properly. The facility houses hooved stock and lynx cats,
however, the section that specifically addresses the care of domestic dogs and cats had been filled out by the
attending veterinarian. Section III which addresses the care of wild and/or exotic animals did not list the current
inventory of animals housed at the facility. The method of euthansia listed in Section III only indicates "IV
injectable" but doesn't give the name or dosage of drug to be used. The program of veterinary care needs to be
completed correctly and with more detail in order to ensure the animals housed at the facility receive proper care
according to established veterinary medical standards.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with the facility representative.
