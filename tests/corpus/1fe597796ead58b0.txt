SANITATION.
At the time of inspection, the two rabbits were housed in an enclosure that was covered in cobwebs on all four walls
and ceiling of the primary shelter. The cobweb accumulation is a potential for disease hazard and creates a
favorable environment for insects and other pests. The primary enclosure must be cleaned and the licensee must
maintain a cleaning program that will prevent an accumulation of cobwebs from being excessive.
