Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Yorkshire terrier (#3721) has numerous clumps of dark colored feces attached to the hair on the backside of both
hindlegs. Failure to keep the hair coat free of feces and debris could increase the risk of disease and could have a
negative impact on the health of the animal.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must remove the feces from the dog's hair coat and ensure that the hair coat of every dog is free of debris and feces at all
times.

Yorkshire terrier, "Mario", received treatment from the attending veterinarian on 04-August-2022. The licensee continued
to treat the dog with penicillin, but the penicillin had expired in March 2021. Expired medical products may fail to
effectively treat a medical condition and the health of the animal may suffer.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure that any medical products used for the dogs have not expired in order to support the health and well-being of
the animals.


At least four containers have no labels identifying what products are contained inside. The licensee stated that each of
the unlabeled containers held a product that is given to the dogs including Ivermectin and an Albon mixture. Failure to
label containers interferes with the ability of APHIS officials to determine what products are being given to the dogs as
well as when the product would expire.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure all containers are clearly marked with the name of the product contained within as well as the product's
expiration date in order to support the health and well-being of the animals.

One unlabeled bottle of Ivermectin contained a deceased house fly floating in the product. Contaminated medical
products could interfere with the ability of the product to work properly which could result in a negative impact on the
health of the dog.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure that all medical products remain free of contamination at all times in order to support the health and well-
being of the animals.
3.1(a) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
One enclosure, containing one adult dog, has a gap between the wall and the side panel that is large enough for the dog's
leg to fit through. Gaps large enough to allow legs to pass through could cause injury to the animal.


Housing facilities for dogs must protect them from injury. The licensee must alter the gap in a manner that eliminates the
risk of injury to the dog. The licensee must ensure that the enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.
3.1(c)(2) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The surfaces of at least two whelping boxes have been excessively chewed and worn by the dogs. Dark brown material
has penetrated the surfaces of the damaged areas of the whelping boxes. Worn and damaged surfaces cannot be
adequately cleaned and sanitized and could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

Three enclosures, containing a total of one adult and eight puppies, have carpet squares in the whelping boxes. The
edges of the carpet squares have been excessively torn and shredded into long strings. The damaged and shredded
carpet cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized which could increase the risk of disease and the animals could also
become entangled in the damaged carpets resulting in injury.

All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must alter the damaged carpet squares and whelping
boxes in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitizing of the surface and eliminates any risk of injury. The
licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are kept in good repair and can be readily cleaned and
sanitized at all times.
3.6(a)(2)(x)

Primary enclosures.
The dog enclosures are constructed with wire flooring. In one enclosure, housing at least three puppies and one adult
dog, the inspector observed the foot and leg of a puppy passing through the openings in the flooring. Openings in floors

that are large enough to allow a foot and leg to pass through could cause injury or entrapment of the animal.

Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury,
and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any openings. The licensee must
alter the floor in a manner that does not allow the feet and legs of the puppies to pass through the openings. The licensee
must ensure the enclosure flooring is safe for the animals at all times.

3.11(b)(2) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
One enclosure, containing two adult dogs, has a large amount of feces stuck to the upper area of a wire side panel. The
feces are dried and are coated with a white mold-like substance. The dogs can come into direct contact with the feces. A
buildup of feces could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks
and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
The licensee must remove the dried feces from the side panel of the enclosure and ensure that all surfaces are
maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in order to support the health of the dogs.
3.13(a)(2)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee failed to have the dogs physically examined by the attending veterinarian within 12 months of the previous
exam. The previous physical exam occurred on 07-June-2021 and the next physical exam did not occur until 26-July-

2022. The licensee's Program of Veterinary Care states that the exam will occur once every 12 months. Failure to have
the attending veterinarian examine each dog at least once every 12 months could cause health issues to go undiagnosed
and untreated allowing the conditions to worsen and the health of the animal could suffer.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate Program of Veterinary Care that includes the physical examination by the
attending veterinarian will occur no less than once every 12 months. The licensee must ensure that each dog receives a
physical examination by the attending veterinarian no less then every 12 months in order to support the health of the
animal.

3.13(b)(1)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee had the dogs examined by the attending veterinarian on 26-July-2022, but did not record the official
identification for each dog examined on the medical record. Documenting the official identification is necessary for APHIS
officials to determine what medical records belong to which dog, as well as, which procedures and treatments a specific
dog has received.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records that include the identity of the animal, including identifying marks, tattoos, or
tags and the animal's breed, sex and age. The licensee must ensure that all medical records are fully complete with all
the required information including the dog's official identification.

To be corrected by: From this day forward

3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee has not been documenting the vaccination of the litters of puppies. At the time of the inspection 13 puppies,
including weaned puppies, are present at the facility, but no vaccination records exist.

Yorkshire terrier, "Mario", was under a treatment plan from the attending veterinarian which required the dog to be given
penicillin, but there are no medical records indicating the penicillin was given.

Complete medical records are necessary for APHIS officials to determine the animals are receiving adequate veterinary
care.

Each dealer must keep copies of medical records that include the names of all vaccines and treatments administered and
the dates of administration. The licensee must keep copies of medical records fully documenting the vaccinations and
medical treatments administered to each adult dog and puppy.
