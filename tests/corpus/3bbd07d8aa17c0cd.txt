ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Two spaniels identified as "Rover" #A01643729 and "Misty" #04902031457 had ears that were dirty with an odor
and need to be cleaned. Ears that are dirty can lead to ear infections or yeast infections and need to be cleaned on
a regular basis to prevent this from occurring.
*** In addition both these dogs "Rover" #A01643729 and "Misty" #04902031457 have heavily matted ears that
need to be groomed. Heavily matted ears are painful because the fur pulls and separates from the skin which can
also cause skin irritations. These ears need to be groomed on a regular basis to prevent this and for the health of
the dogs.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** The outside runs are divided by wire mesh sides where the dogs have view of each other. Two female Sheba's
housed next to each other are very aggressive towards each other and are fighting and running at each other along
the mesh. The licensee states that have done this for a while. These dogs should not be housed directly next to
each other because this constant fighting can cause additional stress on the dogs.

*** Most of the feeders had a layer of grime and debris underneath the lip of the feeder. These feeders need to be
cleaned more frequently to reduce this grime and for the health of the dogs.
