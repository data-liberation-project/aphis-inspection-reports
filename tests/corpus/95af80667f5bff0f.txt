2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee does not have an inventory of the animals on site. Not having a current inventory doesn't allow for the
licensee to determine if and when animals may have escaped or been stolen. It also doesn't allow APHIS officials to
accurately verify the movement of animals through the facility. A current inventory of all regulated animals must be
created and maintained going forward. Correct by 7/26/16.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence line surrounding the enclosures of ten of the goats had fencing that was mangled in areas with sharp
points sticking inwards towards the goats. In addition, screw heads were sticking out on a ramp that the goats walk
across. Sharp points and screw heads can cause injury to the goats if they rub up against or chew on the fencing or
if they step on the screw heads. The mangled fencing and screw heads sticking out must be repaired to protect the
animals from injury. Correct by 7/26/16.

WATERING.
Watering receptacles for nine of the goats was yellow or yellow/greenish in color. The licensee informed me he has
not changed out the water in 2-3 days. Unsanitary water can lead to the spread of disease. The watering
receptacles need to be changed out on a more regular basis prior to the water changing to a yellow or a
yellow/greenish color. Correct immediately.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
