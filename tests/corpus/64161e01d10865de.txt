***The litter pan for one of the kinkajous had a buildup of food, excreta, urine, and debris. Excreta and food waste
should be removed from the primary enclosure as often as necessary to prevent contamination, minimize disease,
and reduce odors. The litter pan must be removed and cleaned. Additonally, a cleaning schedule must be
established to ensure that excreta and debris does not build-up for the overall health and well-being of the animals.
