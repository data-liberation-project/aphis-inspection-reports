ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was an adult, approximately 8 years old, female white Maltese (#083) with a dental condition. A very heavy
build-up of bumpy, rough-looking, yellow to dark brown to black material was present on the majority of the teeth.
This abnormal build-up of material covered the surfaces of most of the upper cheek teeth on both sides of the dog's
mouth and extended into the gumline. Some of the upper gums appeared reddened and the gums had receded
along many of the teeth. Also, some tooth roots were visible. A greyish white material was present at the upper
gumline of a couple of cheek teeth on the right side of the dog's mouth. The abnormal build-up of material on the
teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This can be painful, may decrease the dog's ability
to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal. The licensee must have this animal's teeth
examined in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate dental treatment plan is
developed and followed. The licensee must develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the
overall program of veterinary care for the animals in the facility. To be corrected by: January 20, 2015.
***In the ready to use medication storage area, there was a bottle of Pyrantel that had a labeled expiration date of
07/14. According to the licensee, the medication had recently been used in the animals. Medications that are
expired and are given to the animals may not produce the desired result. The licensee must remove all expired
medications from the ready to use portion of the facility and ensure that expired medications are not used past their
labeled expiration date. As a part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must make certain that all
medications are within the expiration date.
The licensee must ensure that all animals recieve adequate veterinary care at all times.
To be corrected by: this point forward.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees.
