3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
During inspection, 2 housing accommodations were identified containing possibly injurious items:
•Two adult dogs, a Boston Terrier named Benny and a Golden Retriever named William, were allowed unattended free
roam of a bedroom and the kitchen area where many electronics were plugged into the wall with exposed electrical cords
within reach of the animals. Electrical cords pose a significant health risk to dogs that may chew or pull on them.
•A pink hard shell plastic dog bed in an adult Boston Terrier’s (Enzo) enclosure was in need of repair. The top rolled edge
of the bed was missing completely on one side, an area that was approximately 1 foot in length. The exposed edge
underneath was chewed in some areas, with additional pieces missing, leaving behind some jagged edges and sharp
points. A large crack was also seen in that area spanning the entire height of the bed. The current condition of the bed
poses a risk of injury to the dog.
The licensee must provide housing facilities that are kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury. Corrected at
time of inspection.
3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.


Two cans of spray paint were sitting on the ground under a desk in a room accessible to 2 adult dogs (Benny and
William). Such substances can be toxic or harmful if animals are exposed to them. Without enclosed storage, there is
insufficient means to prevent a chemical spill from coming into contact with the animals. Substances that are toxic to
dogs must not be stored in food storage and preparation areas but may be stored in cabinets in the animal areas.
Corrected at time of inspection.
3.4(b)(3)

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two dogs, a white and tan Great Pyrenees mix named Tabitha and a white Great Pyrenees named Athos, in outdoor
housing facilities had shelters with no wind or rain break at the entrance. The lack of adequate wind and rain breaks on
these shelters could expose dogs to the elements and temperature extremes which could negatively impact their health
and cause discomfort. Dogs housed outdoors must be provided a shelter with a wind and rain break at the entrance.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 2/13/2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
