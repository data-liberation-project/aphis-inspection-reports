2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A litter of at least seven rabbit kits was found dead in the outdoor rabbit enclosure which housed twelve adult
rabbits. The dead baby rabbits were found in an animal carrier which had been placed in the enclosure as an
additional shelter space. The dead rabbits were found scattered throughout the floor of the carrier which contained
old, wet, and dirty hay. There was dark wet material and fecal build up under the hay surface so this container did
not appear to have been cleaned for several days. The kits appeared to be at least several days old based on their
size and that fur was beginning to grow. The licensees indicated they were not aware that one of the rabbits had
given birth. Although they had cleaned and fed the animals in the main enclosure they had neglected to clean or
check the carrier which was facing toward the back of the pen. Adequate daily observation of the animals and the
enclosure was not performed so they did not find that a rabbit had given birth and that infant animals were present
which needed care. The lack of adequate daily observation of every animal and all parts of the enclosure can
result in pain, suffering, or death of animals when they are in need of care and have health or welfare concerns. A
suitable nest box containing clean nesting material must be provided in each primary enclosure housing a female
rabbit with a litter, the nest boxes and enclosure must be kept clean and dry, and daily observation of all the animals
must be conducted to assess their health and well-being and communicate health problems to their veterinarian.
The licensee indicated that they had been doing daily observations during pen cleaning and feeding. They stated
that they intend to change their processes and have a written protocol for checking animals and that they would
start doing a separate wellness check on every animal in the mornings as a separate activity from other
maintenance.
Correct from this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees.
