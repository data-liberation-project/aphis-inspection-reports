3.130 CRITICAL
WATERING.
***Potable water was not accessible in an enclosure containing two adult voles and a litter, resulting in the death of
the lactating, female vole.
Facility records indicate that on January 8, 2018, the vole cage was changed and the water bottles were flipped
around, with the sipper tubes not accessible to the voles. The staff member did not replace the bottles to their
normal position. During daily observations of the animals on January 9th and 10th, the facility staff did not identify
the mistake and did not correct these flipped water bottles. On the morning of January 11, facility staff discovered
the dead vole and the flipped water bottles. The voles in the enclosure did not have access to water for at least two
full days. APHIS inspector learned of the incident while going through facility documentation during an inspection.
Lack of access to potable water can cause an animal to experience dehydration and lead to other medical issues,
including death. The facility must ensure that if potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be
provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal.
To be corrected from this date forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
