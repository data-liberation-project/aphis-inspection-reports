ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility representative did not have access to the current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) and the current
records of animal acquisition/disposition at time of this inspection. The required records must be available for review
to allow APHIS Officials to determine if the records are accurate and complete, that the program of veterinary care
is being followed to ensure the health of the animals, and for the proper tracking of the animals. All required records
at the facility must be maintained so they are available for review at the time of inspection.
Correct for all future inspections.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
