ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The 12 year old female Sika Deer was observed to be limping and reluctant put much weight on the front right leg
when walking. She had a hunched posture and would adjust her weight off of the front right leg when not walking.
The licensee was unable to provide documentation that this deer had been evaluated by a veterinarian or that any
treatment plan was in place. Limping and a hunched posture can be signs of injury, pain, and or discomfort.
This deer must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained
and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment
and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
