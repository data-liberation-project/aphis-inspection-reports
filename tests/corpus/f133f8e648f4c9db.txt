2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility acquired a porcupine in October 2021 and the lead animal care director at the time made substantial changes
to the diet and nutrition without communicating this change to the attending veterinarian. The animal was moved from a
rodent based diet suitable to the species to a browser pellet that did not provide adequate nutritive value. Subsequently
the animal began to loose weight and dropped from 9.25kg to 6.1kg within 2 months time. Despite the weight loss noted
in the records, at no point did the facility communicate with the AV to inform the vet of the animal's weight loss. When the
animal was taken to the vet March 30, 2022, it subsequently died. Pathology reports stated the animal was emaciated.
Daily observation of all animals must be conducted to assess their health and well being, with mechanisms in place to
provide direct and frequent communication to the vet on problems of animal behavior, and health.

Correct by: This facility has taken appropriate steps to correct the situation, by hiring new staff, providing additional
training and increasing visits and communication with the attending veterinarian. All animal diets were reviewed and are in
the process of approval from AV.
2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.

The current barrier between the public and squirrel enclosure and between the public and rabbit enclosure is not sufficient
to keep members of the public from having contact with the animals' enclosures and potentially the animals themselves.
This needs to be addressed to assure the safety of the animals and the public.
