2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This was a focued inspection to address the direct veterinary care non-compliant items cited on the insection dated
26 March 2014.
The following dogs are still in need of immediate veterinary care:
* On March 26, 2014 inspectors documented that a male, adult, buff colored Shih Tzu with number 224 had
problems with his eyes and hair coat. On April 15, 2014 he still has a clear discharge around both eyes. The left eye
has an accumulation of white, thick discharge in and around the eye. It is difficult to evaluate the surfaces of the left
eye due to the accumulation of discharge. The licensee states that she is using antibiotic eye drops in the eyes
twice a day and wipes his face and eyes twice a day. The condition of this eye is still poor and could be painful. Eye
problems that are not improving even if treated must be communicated to the attending veterinarian so that the
problem may be re-assessed and treatment adjusted, if necessary. Eye problems can be caused by many
conditions such as trauma, infection, genetic problem as well as other medical problems and can be painful and
affect vision.
* On March 26, 2014 inspectors documented that a black and tan, adult, dachshund with number 011 had problems
with his teeth and jaw. On April 15, 2014 he still has recession of the gum line of the canine teeth. Few teeth
remain but those that do have an accumulation of brown material. This dog's lower jaw does not match up with the
upper jaw. The lower jaw appears to be shifted to the dog's left compared to the upper jaw and is readily mobile
compared to the upper jaw. On the lower left jaw, a piece of the jaw can be felt in the back third pointing outward in
an abnormal manner. Mouth and jaw problems can result from trauma, dental disease, or a variety of medical
problems and can be painful.
* On March 26, 2014 inspectors documented that a male, adult, piebald dachshund with no identification ("Herman")
had problems with his teeth and toe nails. On April 15, 2014 he still has a heavy accumulation of brown material
completely coating the cheek teeth and most of the canine teeth. The gums are red and recessed away from the
surface of the cheek teeth on the upper left and upper and lower right sides. There is thick white discharge at the
gum line of the upper left cheek teeth. There is creamy white discharge along the gum line of the right upper cheek
teeth and there is also foreign, fibrous like material trapped in the brown material on the cheek teeth of the rightside.
* On March 26, 2014 inspectors documented that a female, adult, black and white Havanese with number 016 103
303 had problems with her teeth and hair coat. On April 15, 2014 she still has a thick coating of brown material that
completely coats and obscures the upper cheek teeth on both sides and on most of the upper canine teeth. There is
a creamy white discharge and the gums are receded away from the upper cheek teeth and canine teeth. The gums
are also recessed away from all of the upper incisors. There is foreign material (possible hair or plant material)
trapped in the material and discharge about the left upper molars. The gum line is also recessed from the surface of
the top incisor teeth.
* On March 26, 2014 inspectors documented that a female, adult, black and white Shih Tzu with no identification
("Rosie") had problems with her teeth and hair coat. On April 15, 2014 she still has an accumulation of brown
material on the left upper cheek teeth and canine tooth. On the previous inspection there were very loose left upper
cheek teeth and a creamy discharge at the gum line of the left upper canine tooth and cheek teeth. When
attempting to touch and view the dog's mouth, she withdrew her head quickly. The dog was very resistant to
handling her mouth at this inspection which may indicate pain or discomfort. Photographs were therefore difficult to
obtain. There was a thickening of the lower left jaw and some abnormal grinding and grittiness was felt in the bone
of the lower jaw. Thickening of the bone and the roughness that was felt along with teeth problems and the
resistance to handling cause concern for a painful condition.
* On March 26, 2014 inspectors documented that a female, adult, white poodle with number 219 had problems with
her teeth and hair coat. On April 15, 2014 she still has a very heavy accumulation of brown material on her canine
teeth and the remaining cheek teeth. The left upper and lower canine teeth and a cheek tooth are loose. The left
upper canine tooth was loose enough that an approximately 2mm gap could be seen between the gum line and the
tooth. There was also white discharge/debris in this gap. There is a swelling over the right upper canine tooth and a
right upper cheek tooth is loose.
* On March 26, 2014 inspectors documented that a male, adult, brown Chihuahua with number 145 had problems
with his eyes and teeth. On April 15, 2014 he still has an accumulation of brown material on the upper back cheek
teeth on both sides of the mouth. The left upper canine and right and left upper cheek teeth are loose. There is a
white discharge along the gum line of the upper left cheek teeth. The eyes appeared to be normal.
*** Dental disease and jaw problems can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures, be
painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health and welfare of the animal.
*** The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian by 1:30 pm on 17 April 2014 in order
to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.
The licensee must document the outcome and make it available to the inspector upon request.***

that the attending veterinarian approved the use of ivermectin topically for treatment which she did. The dog was
still observed to be scratching the area. Skin problems can be caused by a variety of problems such as parasites,
change in hormones, and infection and can be itchy or painful. The eye problem has been addressed.
***Eye problems can be caused by many conditions such as trauma, infection, genetic problem as well as other
medical problems and can be painful and affect vision.
*** Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the
ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal.
*** Soiled, matted hair can cause skin infections and become painful. In addition, matted coats do not provide
complete protection against the elements. The licensee must clean these animals' hair coats and remove the
matted hair. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of
hair coat maintenance to ensure that animals are cleaned when their hair coats become soiled and that matted hair
is removed on a regular basis. ***Long toe nails can change the conformation of the feet and legs and cause discomfort when walking. As a part of
the facility;s program of veterinary care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of toenail trimming and
maintenance to ensure that all of the animals have toenails of appropriate length.
*** The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
document the outcome and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must establish and
maintain a program of veterinary care to prevent, assess, diagnose and treat medical problems in a timely manner.
