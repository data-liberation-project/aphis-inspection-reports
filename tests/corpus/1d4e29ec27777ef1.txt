ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the period September 2016 to June 1, 2017, the aquarium utilized a part-time attending veterinarian.
During this period, the facility did not have a written Program of Veterinary Care. A written program of veterinary
care is necessary to convey the attending veterinarian's expectations for routine preventative medical care,
authorized treatments for specific conditions, and euthanasia for animals maintained by the facility. The facility
must ensure that a program of veterinary care is in place for each regulated species.
In addition, semiannual visual exams were not conducted on all of the marine mammals as required. During a
review of clinical records for this time period, it was also noted that regularly scheduled visits by the attending
veterinarian were not documented for all mammals to include harbor seals, fur seals, sea otters and river otters.
Several of these animals have chronic medical issues to include painful eye conditions, an asthmatic condition, and
a seizure disorder.
For example, "Q", an 18 year old male harbor seal has recurrent eye issues, especially of the cornea. He had been
on SSD cream 1% (50% solution) which was discontinued on 10/4/16, as the eyes had appeared to heal. On
4/30/17, the right eye had central cloudiness which progressed to squinting on 5/14/17. On 6/9/17, a greenish tint
was observed on the cornea of the left eye, and more cloudiness than usual was evident. No veterinary evaluation
occurred between 4/30/17 - 6/10/17. He received a visual check on 6/11/17, and again on 6/25/17. Treatment was
then begun on 7/25/17. Eye conditions are painful, and cause discomfort and difficulty with vision.
"Leu", a 6 year old male fur seal was previously diagnosed with a seizure disorder. On 10/5/16, the attending
veterinarian evaluated blood results and the phenobarbital level. These were to be rechecked every 6 months;
however, this was not done. On 1/23/17, the animal was unsteady on his flippers when he attempted to get on the
deck, and appeared unsteady when asked to present his front flipper. On 1/30/17, he was observed slightly
dragging his front flippers. Veterinary evaluations were not conducted.
"Lootas", a 20 year old sea otter had a mild gray coloration in the anterior chamber of the left eye. A visual exam
was conducted by the veterinarian on 9/28/16 with a differential diagnosis of "transient anterior uveitis vs other". Anote in the records stated that another veterinarian familiar with the case would be contacted for more information.
There are no notes in the medical record to show that the other veterinarian was contacted. On 10/8/16, a note
stated "continues to have bluish gray tint." No other notes were entered in the record through 7/17/17 to indicate if
the eye condition resolved or if it continued to have unusual coloration.
APHIS officials use medical records to ensure that animals have received appropriate medical care and subsequent
monitoring of any conditions. It is the responsibility of the facility to ensure that adequate medical records are kept
for all mammals housed there.
The facility hired a full-time veterinarian as of June 1, 2017.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representatives.
