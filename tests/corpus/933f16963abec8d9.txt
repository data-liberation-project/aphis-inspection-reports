INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The unaffiliated member has resigned since the last IACUC meeting. As a result, the required IACUC membership
is not complete. The unaffiliated member is intended to provide representation for the general community interests
in the proper care and treatment and use of animals, and is thus, essential to the committee. A system should be in
place to ensure IACUC membership is complete, and in the event a required member resigns, a replacement is
appointed in a timely manner.
The facility needs to seek and acquire the public member to fill the vacant position as soon as possible.

SANITATION.
The barn area has avian pests. There is a moderate to heavy amount of bird droppings on the cement floor,
conference table and chairs, and on metal garbage can lids These cans contain a variety of animal feeds and may
become contaminated. In addition, hay stored in this area is not covered and is open to contamination.
Although there were no birds present during the inspection, it is evident birds are perching on the overhead beamsby the location of the droppings.
The presence of pests can increase disease hazards in animal areas. A safe and effective program for the control of
pests must be established and maintained to minimize the risk of disease to the animals and contamination of food
supplies.
