2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white, male Maltese approximately 10 years old and identified by microchip (#029-099-848) is exhibiting abnormal
behavior. The dog is observed in a sitting position and constantly licking its teeth and gums. After about a minute,
the inspector requested the licensee to remove the dog for a closer examination. Most of the dog's teeth are
missing, but among the remaining, there are two loose cheek teeth that are partially covered with a dark brown
tarter. The dog also has an excessive build-up of dry, black-colored, crusty matter around both eyes. The crusty
material is matted in the fur with small areas tightly adhered to the skin. The skin in these affected areas appear raw
and moist. This can cause discomfort for the dog and potentially lead to skin problems. The licensee stated that she
was aware of the condition but said pulling the mats off would redden the skin and make it worse. After the dog was
returned to the enclosure, it continued the abnormal behavior of constantly licking its teeth and gums. A veterinarian
has not evaluated the dog's condition. The dog's abnormal appearance and behavior can be an indication of mouth
pain caused by loose teeth and/or dental disease.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. Additionally, the licensee needs to consult the attending veterinarian to develop and follow a dental
and hair coat maintenance plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Within the 'puppy building' in room #3, there is an enclosure labeled #4 that has areas of rusted wire surfaces. The
plastic coating on the wire flooring is flaking and peeling off. As a result, some of the bare wire areas are rusted and
pitted. The enclosure is being used by an adult Shih-Tzu and four puppies.
Rusty surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a
regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when
worn or soiled. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are maintained in good repair at all
times.Exit briefing conducted with the licensee.
