FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.125 (a) Structural Strength
Inside the animal room there are five plastic stands holding the enclosures. The top enclosures on each stand are
not adequateley secured at the top. The enclosures could potentially be knocked off causing injuries to the seven
hedgehogs that are housed in these enclosures. There is one stand that has wheels in the back left corner when
entering the animal room. This stand is leaning to the left, swaying from side to side, and is not structurally sound
and could potentially cause injuries to the two hedghogs if the stand falls.
Maintain all indoor facilities so that they are structurally sound and in good repair so protects the animals from
injury.
