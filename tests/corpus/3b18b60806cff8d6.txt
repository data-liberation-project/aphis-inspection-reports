ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:09 pm to
2:39 pm on 19-Dec-17.
No one appeared to be present at the facility. I left a message on two different phone numbers but did not receive a
call back.
