FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The window blind located directly behind the capybara is in need of repair. The capybara has the ability to make
contact with the blind that covers the bottom of the window and has left it in mangled condition. The capybara can
injure itself on the sharp edges or ingest small pieces by chewing on it. The licensee must replace the window blind
behind the capybara to protect the health of the animal.

3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The enclosure that is currently housing an adult capybara does not have adequate ventilation. The capybara is
housed in a press board type enclosure with a lack of ventilation. Lack of proper ventilation will cause veterinary
health problems that will get serious as temperatures get hotter in the summer months. The licensee must increase
ventilation by using fans and providing more air flow to the enclosure.
