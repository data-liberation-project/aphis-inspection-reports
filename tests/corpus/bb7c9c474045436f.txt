2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The following animals are in need of veterinary care:
1) The male alpaca housed separately from the females, and three of the four female alpacas housed together have
hair loss over the bridge of their nose. The black male alpaca, the two black female alpacas, and the cinnamon
female alpaca with a black face all have little or no hair growth on the skin over the top of their nose. The white
female alpaca did not have hair loss on the bridge of her nose. The APHIS official was informed during the
inspection that the facility personnel were aware of the hair loss, but there was no documentation of this condition in
the records for the animals or of the attending veterinarian being consulted. Hair loss can have many causes such
as parasites, infectious, nutritional, and may be a sign of a more serious health concern. The alpacas must be
evaluated by the attending veterinarian to provide appropriate veterinary care.
2) The female mottled colored red fox housed with a female red colored red fox has a large area of hair loss in the
middle of her back. The under coat is still present but the top coat is gone. The APHIS official was informed during
the inspection by the facility escort that it was too early for the fox to be shedding out her winter coat. There was no
documentation of the hair loss in the records for the animal and the attending veterinarian was not consulted. The
hair loss has many health care causes (see alpacas above) or may be a result of incompatibility with her enclosure
companion. The fox must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to provide appropriate veterinary care.
3) At least four of the eight prairie dogs had patches of hair loss on their heads and/or bodies. No skin wounds or
bleeding were seen in the areas of hair loss. There was no documentation of the hair loss in the records for the
animals and the attending veterinarian was not consulted. The hair loss has many health care causes (see alpacas
above) or may be a result of incompatibility with enclosure companions. The prairie dogs must be evaluated by the
attending veterinarian to provide appropriate veterinary care.
Correct by having the above animals evaluated by the attending veterinarian and separate any incompatible
animals. The licensee must document and maintain records of the examination, treatment and outcome for future
inspection by APHIS officials. Correct by March 21, 2016. An exit briefing was conducted with the facility vice president.
