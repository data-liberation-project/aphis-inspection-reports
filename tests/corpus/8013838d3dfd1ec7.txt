ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One, white female mini pot bellied pig was observed to have an intermittent severe protrusion of the lower jaw and
foam accumulated on the side of her mouth. This deformity could be due to a congenital disorder or injury. The
manager stated that this issue was observed a few weeks ago and notified the veterinarian. However, there was no
diagnosis and treatment plan documented on file. This pig needs to seen by a licensed veterinarian to determine
the diagnosis and implement an effective treatment plan for the facility to follow.

SANITATION.
HOUSEKEEPING -
The following items are still in need of repair, replacement or removal-
*There is a detached metal strip on the inside of the coatimundi enclosure. This piece of metal could harm the
coatimundis housed therein.
*The linoleum floor, in the room holding rabbits, guinea pigs, sugar gliders and a kinkajou, is still torn in several
locations.
*The ceiling in this same room is detaching from the framework and sagging over enclosures.
*The tiled floor, in the male pot bellied pig enclosure, is missing several tiles thus exposing the concrete sub-floor.
Fecal material and other debris can accumulate in these damaged areas. The damaged linoleum and missing tilesmust be removed, repaired or replaced to keep the floors in good repair in order to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices.
*Additionally, the pot bellied pig's enclosure wall has been damaged with a knife. These holes leave the wall in
disrepair.
*The accumulations of empty enclosures, tanks, boxes, household items, spilled bedding and other miscellaneous
materials, that were stored haphazardly throughout the rear rooms of the facility, have been partially removed. The
items that remain are better organized but remain stored in such a manner that creates areas that may harbor
pests. These areas must be still be cleared and appropriately organized in order to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the facility manager.
