HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On 11 May 2016, two approximately one-year-old juvenile sea lions had a falling accident. The facility reports that a
barrier/safety panel was not erected according to protocol in time to prevent the animals from climbing on the exhibit
island while the water level was low. The animals fell from the island into water at a level too low to protect the
animals from injury. The female died on 22 May 2016 and the male died on 13 May 2016, both of apparent
complications from the fall. Failure to follow established protocols can result in injury to animals. The facility must
ensure that handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does
not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. To
be corrected 10 August 2016.

VETERINARY CARE.
One male, approximately one year of age died on 13 May 2016 while in captivity at the facility. While the veterinary
staff at the facility during the inspection was able to verbally relate general details of the necropsy, no
documentation of a necropsy report was available to inspectors. Required documentation facilitates the inspection
process and documents medical care in the facility. The facility must ensure that a complete necropsy, including
histopathology samples, microbiological cultures, and other testing as appropriate, be conducted by or under the
supervision of the attending veterinarian on all marine mammals that die in captivity. A preliminary necropsy report
must be prepared by the veterinarian listing all pathologic lesions observed in a timely manner. The final necropsy
report must include all gross and histopathological findings, the results of all laboratory tests performed, and a
pathological diagnosis. Preliminary report must be complete by 23 August 2016.
This was a focused inspection to evaluate the big cat and marine mammal programs at this facility. The inspection
and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives, Mary Bartels, ACI, Laurie Gage, Big Cat and Marine
Mammal specialist, and Margaret A Shaver, VMO in attendance.Additional Inspectors
