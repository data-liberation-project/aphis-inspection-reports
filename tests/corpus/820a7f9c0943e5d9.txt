3.11
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A few of the enclosures have a mild to moderate accumulation of organic debris on or around the dog doors. In
these enclosures, a layer of dark material is adhered to the wall and/or dog doors. This film may contain disease
hazards which could pose a health risk for the dogs. Primary enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to
prevent accumulation of organic material and to reduce disease hazards. Once cleaned, a routine to prevent
recurrence shall be developed and implemented.
