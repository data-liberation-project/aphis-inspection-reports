FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Interior surfaces. The new guinea pig building housing 565 adults and 80 new guinea pig breeders has bare wood
on the floor, three window frames, and wood covering the fan area. Interior building surfaces must be constructed
and maintained so that building surfaces are impervious to moisture so that they can be readily cleaned and
sanitized. The bare wood on the floor, three window frames, and fan area must be sealed or covered with an
impervious surface so that these surfaces can be repeatedly cleaned and sanitized, will not retain odors, and which
fluids will not absorb into the surface material. Correct by May 31, 2018.
