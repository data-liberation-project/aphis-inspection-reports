FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**In the fall of 2014 one Geoffroy's cat escaped from its enclosure and the premise. This happened after daily
cleaning by an experienced handler when the licesnee was not at the facility. Upon the licesnee's return he found
the guillotine door to the enclosure to be partially open and off of its track. Great efforts were made by the licensee
to locate and return the animal. The cat was found deceased three days after escape. The USDA was notified of
both the escape and death of this animal when it occurred. This is an isolated event and has not occurred since.
Housing facilities, including doors and locking mechanisms, must be structurally sound and maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The enclosure does not currently house any animals. This item has been corrected.
**Several of the wooden boards in the bobcat enclosure are moderately splintered from the cat sharpening his
claws against the board. The animal's diet is also fed on these boards.
Splinters from the wood could potentially injure the animal if he were to step or rest on the surface. Splintered wood
is also not easily sanitizable. As the diet is fed on this surface, pathogens from feed could potentially also transfer to
the wood and cause illness in the animal.
Surfaces of the enclosure must be replaced or maintained in good repair to protect the animal from illness and
injury.
