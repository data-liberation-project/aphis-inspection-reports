3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The Big Cat enclosure housing two white tigers named Prince and Thor had an area at the bottom of the metal
fence where the wires had become disengaged and the opening created allowed for the big cats to be able to pass
a paw through the caging.
The sharp points created could have injured the tigers and if they had continued working the fence to enlarge the
opening they could have potentially injured themselves or escaped.

- There was a wooden shelter in the indoor beaver enclosure with a roof severely chewed and damaged by the
animals. This is a potential source of injury to the animals. This structure must be repaired, removed or replaced.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals.
