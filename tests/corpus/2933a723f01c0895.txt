2.50(a)(2)

Time and method of identification.
Seven litters of unweaned puppies have no identification. Pups are usually given a microchip at weaning age, but these
litters have not been microchipped and there is no other form of identification for them. Identification is important to know
the dogs with certainty, especially when medicating or transporting the dogs. Live puppies or kittens, less than 16 weeks
of age, shall be identified.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be compliant within 2 more inspections or by October 29, 2021 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact the inspector to schedule your next Prelicense inspection.

Conducting regulated activities without a valid USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
