2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Bichon Frise (Ramona, microchip # 012557379, DOB 22-24-10) had excessive buildup of brown tarter on
rear molars. Her gums were red and inflamed with gums receding from teeth and a milky white discharge present
along the gum line. Two teeth (one on each side of the mouth) were easily moved back and forth when gently
pressed by the inspector’s finger.
Dental problems can cause pain and distress, can lead to inadequate nutrition and potential further medical
conditions.
The dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian to diagnose the problem and develop an effective treatment
plan which must be followed by the licensee. Correction date: March 14, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
