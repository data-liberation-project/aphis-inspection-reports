**A review of animal records from Protocol 2011-1348 indicated that animal #476048 received a subcutaneous
injection of manganese chloride that resulted in a skin wound measuring approximately 7x6 cm in the lumbar area.
This route of injection was not listed in the approved protocol. The PI modified the route of injection without
approval from the IACUC. It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that modifications and/or
proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of the animals is reviewed and approved by the IACUC in
order to prevent unnecessary pain and suffering. Corrective measures have been instituted by the research facility
involving retraining of the lab staff including the prinicipal investigator, consultations with the veterinary staff and
increased post approval monitoring.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
**A review of animal records from Protocol 2011-2348 revealed that post-procedural care described in the protocol
is not being followed. On September 15, 2012 animal #598310 was anesthesized to undergo a procedure.
According to the approved protocol post-procedural monitoring is to take place every 15 minutes until the animal is
sternal and ambulatory. The notation in the animal's medical record indicated "After the procedure the rabbit was
taken to.....for recovery and placed under a heat lamp. During recovery the animal expired. " There were no
anesthesia/surgery monitoring records for this animal. Veterinary staff was not notified regarding the recovery and
subsequent death of the animal. Documentation in the records incorrectly indicated the animal had been
euthanized. It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that appropriate pre and post-procedural care is
provided to the animals in order to minimize unnecessary pain and suffering. Corrective measures have been
instituted by the facility involving retraining for the animal care staff, increased communications with the veterinary
staff, increased post approval monitoring and additions of anesthetic monitoring equipment.
