PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Ten puppies in multiple enclosures had feet passing through the floors of the enclosures.
Flooring that allows feet to pass through it could cause the puppies to be injured or get stuck preventing nursing.
The enclosures must have floors constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet from injury, and that, if mess
or slatted construction, do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any openings in the floor.
