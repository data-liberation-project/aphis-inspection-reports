CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the cargo office for Qantas, two dogs had just arrived from Sydney, Australia on waybill numbers 081-53706203
and 081-82064780. Neither animal enclosure had a signed consignor's certification regarding when the dogs were
last offered food and water, and what the feeding and watering instructions were for the trip. This certification should
be clearly visible on top of each animal enclosure.
Carriers must ensure that a certification is signed by the consignor that includes written instructions for feeding and
watering, and that this information is clearly visible on the primary enclosure so that the animal can be properly
cared for during transit.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with representatives for the airline at the cargo office.
