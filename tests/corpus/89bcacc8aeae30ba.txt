INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC approved protocol #005 does not list blood collection, but review of the procedure records showed
blood is being collected regularly from animals on this study. The IACUC should review and approve proposed
changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities. Significant changes to the protocol cannot be
carried out unless approved by the IACUC. The IACUC is responsible for reviewing all components of proposed
animal use, and ensuring that the animals are treated in the most humane manner possible, that protects their
well-being. Unapproved changes to protocols, such as blood collection, could be detrimental to the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In two rooms housing pigs (Rooms 136 & 138), there were several areas where paint chipped off the wall of the
primary enclosures, exposing concrete. The walls of the primary enclosure were no longer maintained in good
repair. The exposed concrete is difficult to effectively clean and is located at the same level as both excretion and
the snout of the covered species, and makes cleaning and sanitizing more difficult. Failure to maintain animal
housing facilities in good repair may adversely affect their health and wellbeing.
