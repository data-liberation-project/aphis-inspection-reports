ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
One of the teaching horses, Sweetie Pye, was noted by an animal care (PACS) employee to be exhibiting signs of
"colic" at approximately 4:30 PM on 11/11/2014. This PACS employee followed the established protocol and
contacted the Veterinary Technician (supervisor) who supervises the animals cared for by the PACS staff. The
supervisor directed the employee to give oral pain medication to the horse. At approximately 5:30 PM, the
supervisor called another Veterinary Technician Instructor (VTI) to go to the facility and assist the PACS employee.
The supervisor also called the large animal Veterinarian on call for emergency care around this same time. The
Veterinarian advised the supervisor to contact a large animal veterinary clinic locally as he was caring for client
animals and would not be able to respond until at least 9:00 PM. The VTI did arrive to assist the employee at
approximately 6:20 PM and called the supervisor to ask if they should call the local large animal veterinary clinic as
Sweetie Pye was not improving. The supervisor did not contact the local large animal veterinary clinic. The
supervisor, who had arrived at the facility around 8:15 PM, contacted the large animal Veterinarian at 9:00 PM to let
him know the horse had died.
The supervisor did not follow the facility's program for emergency veterinary care even after being advised by the on
call veteirnarian to contact the local large animal veterinary clinic. This horse did not receive appropriate and timely
care to address an emergency veterinary condition which caused unrelieved pain and distress resulting in death.
The facility's program for providing adequate veterinary care for the animals must include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency care.
To be corrected immediately.
