HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
This is a focused inspection to explain and document an accident involving one employee on June 16 th 2016
resulting in a serious tiger bite to the right forearm which required a hospital stay, surgery, and post-operative
physical therapy.
On the morning of June 16th 2016 the park maintenance man was assigned the job of adding a structural metal bar
across the inside top of the guillotine door to the outside exercise pen and den area that contained a 5 year old
adult tiger named "(cid:28)Scooby"(cid:29). The main door to the enclosure where the work was to take place was unlocked by
the park manager to allow the maintenance man access to the work area.
At the time of this incident the gate did not have a latch attached to it and was secured by a chain looped around
the gate and padlocked to the adjacent fence. The maintenance man left the job site without finishing the job and
without telling the park manager he had left the job site. The park manager stated the maintenance man was
always very good at locking gates in areas he was working in. This day it appears the gate was not locked when he
left.
Later that day around 2 P.M. it began to rain and the park manager asked an employee to let (cid:28)"Scooby"(cid:29) the male
tiger into the den area to get out of the rain.
The park manager assumed the den gate was locked. The employee entered the den area and without checking
the lock, pulled the cable control and allowed (cid:28)"Scooby"(cid:29) into the den area. At that moment the employee and
(cid:28)"Scooby"(cid:29) realized the gate was not secured by the chain and padlock. "(cid:28)Scooby"(cid:29) grabbed the employees arm as
she was desperately trying to close and secure the gate. As a result she was badly bitten and hospitalized.
This series of events points to a three phase brake down in animal security at the park.
1. The gate was not locked and secured when the maintenance man left the job site.
2. The park manager assumed the gate to the den area was locked.
3. The employee was negligent in not verifying the gate was locked before allowing (cid:28)"Scooby"(cid:29) into the den.The park could not produce written verification documenting adequate training and the following of park protocol by
all personnel involved. All employees must receive adequate training to ensure the security and safety of animals,
themselves, and park visitors.

A written log of employee training documenting the type of training given, duration of training, the frequency of
refresher training drills, and signed off by a park supervisor should be in place, as well as a written protocol
outlining work procedures and security measures to ensure all animal enclosures are secure and safe for
employees at the park.
This type of accident is preventable and the park must take steps to implement new protocols and training to ensure
this type of accident never occurs again.
