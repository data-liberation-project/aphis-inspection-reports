Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC is responsible for reviewing the facility’s programs for humane care and use of animals at least once every six
months. This is to ensure protocol changes, adverse events, personnel changes, maintenance issues, etc, are addressed
in a timely manner. The facility has not had an IACUC meeting since June 2021.

The facility needs to ensure at least one IACUC meeting occurs within every six-month period.
