2.31(c)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The current animal facility does not have enough space to adequately handle and store animal cages and water
bottles. Dirty animal cages and water bottles are currently stored in a hallway while waiting to be put through
washers that do not have adequate capacity to clean all of the equipment in a timely manner. Once the equipment
has been cleaned it must be stored in other hallways because there is not adequate space to store it in a
designated area. Hallways are not appropriate areas to store animal equipment. Traffic past dirty cages in one
hallway can contaminate clean cages in other hallways. This facility is always exceptionally clean. The effort on the
part of the employees to maintain this level of cleanliness in this situation must be commended. The IACUC is
responsible for inspecting animal facilities at least once every six months and identifying issues that need to be
addressed. The IACUC needs to address and remedy the storage situation in this facility.
