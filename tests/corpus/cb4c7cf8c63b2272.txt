CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* There is an accumulation of old and fresh dog food, hair, and dust under the enclosures in the wash downs. A pan
with old, molding and decomposing feces and scraper is also located under the enclosures. Cobwebs were starting
to accumulate around windows and on the walls. Significant fresh and old mouse droppings were located along the
solid top of the enclosures with some of the droppings caught on the walls in cobwebs. These types of
accumulations promote disease and attract pests. Licensee must thoroughly clean and adhere to regular
housekeeping practices to minimize accumulations that will attract pests and reduce disease hazards for the overall
health of the dogs.
