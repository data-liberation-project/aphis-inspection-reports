2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
On September 16, 2016, several unsuccessful attempts (telephone calls, email messages, and text messages) to
contact the owner of the establishment were made by this inspector. After a detailed review of the establishment's
website and Facebook pages, it was determined that the establishment has been engaged in unlicensed activity of
USDA regulated animals by selling pets sight unseen.
Any person operating or intending to operate as a dealer, except persons who are exempted from the licensing
requirements under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, must have a valid license. The owner of the establishment
must apply for a license by submitting the required information/documentation to the USDA-APHIS-AC Regional
Director in Raleigh, North Carolina. In the license application form, the establishment must provide the information
requested, including a valid mailing address through which the owner could be reached at all times, and a valid
premises address where animals, animal facilities, equipment, and records may be inspected for compliance.
Packets of the license application materials were mailed to the establishment by both, the USDA-APHIS-AC
Regional Office and this inspector.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT OBTAINING A VALID USDA LICENSE.
No exit interview was conducted.
