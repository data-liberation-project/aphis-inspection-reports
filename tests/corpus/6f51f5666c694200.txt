2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male dog (#122) was occasionally licking its left rear foot. On closer observation, the inner pad on the left rear
foot had a reddened, swollen pea size nodule on the side of the pad. The licensee was not aware of this dogs
condition until it was pointed out. This dog's condition could be due to injury, infection and/or another veterinary
medical condition which could be painful. The licensee must consult a licensed veterinarian about this dog, in order
to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The
licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
The veterinary care for female Maltese (#40) from the 2/9/2016 inspection has been addressed.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Bill Heine ACI and Chad Proctor ACI.
