ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS AC on an inspection of the animals, facilities, and
records at 10 AM on 9/21/2015. The licensee was on site but was just preparing to leave for a traveling exhibition in
Lewiston, Idaho and was not able to make the time for an inspection prior to leaving the premises. The licensee
has not submitted any itineraries to the APHIS AC office for previous traveling exhibitions in August and early
September nor for this upcoming travel to Idaho.
A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
To be corrected on all subsequent inspections.
2.126(c)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee was found on the premises of the home site preparing to leave for approximately 7 days for a traveling
animal exhibition in Lewiston, Idaho. The APHIS AC VMO had contacted the Animal Welfare Operations office on
Friday, 9/18/2015 to determine if any itineraries had been submitted in recent months for this licensee but none had
been received as of that date. According to the licensee, there had been at least one previous traveling animal
exhibition in Utah lasting for several days that occurred within the last month. She stated that she had forgotten to
send in itineraries for that exhibition as well as this upcoming exhibition in Idaho. This AC VMO has explained this
requirement to the license on at least 3 different occasions since the regulatory requirement was made for itinerary
submissions for regulated traveling exhibition.
Itineraries for licensed exhibitors that travel overnight with their regulated animals need to be submitted to Animal
Care at least 48 hours prior to travel and must include all of the required information in order to facilitate inspections
of these exhibitions during travel and to minimize the risk of not having a responsible adult available at the home
site for inspection by APHIS.
Any person who is subject to the Animal Welfare regulations and who intends to exhibit any animal at any locationother than the person's approved site (including, but not limited to, circuses, traveling educational exhibits, animal
acts, and petting zoos), except for travel that does not extend overnight, shall submit a written itinerary to the AC
Regional Director. The itinerary shall be received by the AC Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of
any travel and shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended
for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. If the exhibitor accepts an engagement for which
travel will begin with less than 48 hours notice, the exhibitor shall immediately contact the AC Regional Director in
writing with the required information. APHIS expects such situations to occur infrequently, and exhibitors who
repeatedly provide less than 48 hours notice will, after notice by APHIS, be subject to increased scrutiny under the
Act.
To be corrected by 9/21/2015.
Exit interview conducted with the licensee and AC VMO, Tracy Thompson, DVM by telephone.
