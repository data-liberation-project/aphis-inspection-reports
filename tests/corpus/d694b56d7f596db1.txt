FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from sunlight.
The amount of shade provided by the existing shelter was not large enough to accommodate all 15 reindeer at one
time. As a result all reindeer do not have shelter from sunlight simultaneously.

Failure to provide adequate protection from direct sunlight, may not allow the animals to maintain body temperature,
which could lead to overheating or more serious health concerns. Provide enough shaded areas to accommodate
all animals housed in the enclosure. Licensee provided a plan for permanent additional shade, however, temporary
shade solution must be provided until permanent plan is implemented. Correct by 06/11/14.
Inspection and exit interview were done with the Zoo Director.
