CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
***Within the outdoor portion of the sheltered building housing dogs, some of the enclosures contained greater than
a day's worth of fecal material. In at least one of the enclosures, it appeared that the amount of fecal material
present made it difficult for the animals to avoid walking in it. Within at least two of the enclosures, fecal material
had accumulated along the back walls of the enclosures near the access doors. Some of the fecal material
appeared dried and lodged between the wire portion of the enclosure and the solid back wall. Excreta must be
removed from primary enclosures daily in order to protect the health and well-being of the animals. The licensee
must remove the accumulated fecal material from these enclosures and ensure that all excreta is removed daily
from primary enclosures to prevent soiling of the dogs contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease
hazards, insects, pests and odors.
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(c) Housekeeping for premises.
***There were tall weeds and grass within a large portion of the outdoor enclosure housing two adult Boston
Terriers. Some of the weeds reached at least 2 feet in height. Tall weeds and grass can harbor ticks, rodents and
other pests and vermin which can increase the risk of disease in the animals. The licensee must keep the weeds
and grasses controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control and to protect the health and
well-being of the animals at all times.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
