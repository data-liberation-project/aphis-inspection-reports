2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The heartworm protocol was not being followed according to the program of veterinary care that requires the regulated
animals to be treated monthly. The licensee was inconsistant in the application of providing the heartworm prevention,
sometimes with a few months between treatments.

The lack of proper heartworm prevention given according to the veterinarians instructions could allow the regulated
animals to become suseptable to heartworms.

The licensee must follow the program of veterinary care in all aspects when providing heartworm prevention that is to be
given monthy according to their program of vet care. All other directions on the program of vet care that require montlhy
checks for dental, ears, nails, eyes and skin must be observed.
