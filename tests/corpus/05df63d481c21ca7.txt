ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:50 am on
07-Mar-17.
** I arrived at the facility at 11:50 am and no one was at the animal facility. I waited and noticed two trucks pull up to
the residence so I called at 12:25 pm, left a message and pulled up to the residence. No one answered the call so I
left a message and rang the doorbell. No one answered the door so I waited until 1:00 pm and then left the
premises.
