2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee stated that he treated six dogs for fleas with the prescription medication Bravecto. While Bravecto is
an appropriate treatment for the condition, the treatment was not prescribed by the facility's Attending Veterinarian
(AV) and was provided to the licensee by someone other than the AV without the knowledge of the AV. Using
prescription medication without an actual prescription and consultation from the AV puts the dogs at risk for serious
adverse effects and does not ensure that appropriate and adequate veterinary care has been provided. Correct by
ensuring that prescription medications are administered only under the guidance and with the knowledge of the AV.
Correct immediately and from this day forward.
2.50(b)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Five dogs are not identified by official USDA identification. The licensee uses tags for identification, however one
female Yorkie and one female Maltese have lost their tags and the tags have not been replaced. One male Golden
Retriever and one male Morkie have not been assigned official USDA tags and one female Toy Poodle, who is a
recent acquisition to the kennel, has not been assigned an official USDA tag. Lack of official identification does not
allow for the proper identification and tracking of the dogs. Identify all adult dogs with official USDA identification.
Correct by: July 22, 2016.
3.3(e)(1)(3)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The wooden shelter box for the large breed dogs has surfaces that have not been made impervious to moisture.
Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture can absorb water, urine and odors and cannot be properly sanitized.
Correct by ensuring all surfaces in contact with the dogs are made impervious to moisture. Correct by July 22,
2016. Inspection conducted with the licensee and facility representative. Exit briefing conducted with the facility
representative.
