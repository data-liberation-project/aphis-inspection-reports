2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Two significant deviations from protocol 2024-2 occurred without prior IACUC review and approval:
- Per the protocol, the attending veterinarian will be notified of any unexpected morbidity or mortality. Some animals in this
study did develop unexpected clinical signs and many died yet the attending veterinarian was not notified.
- Per the protocol, for one part of the study, groups of 20 animals would be used however one group contained 22 animals
exceeding the approved number by 2.
Making changes to a protocol without seeking IACUC review and approval does not allow the IACUC adequate oversight
to ensure the well-being and humane treatment of all research animals. The IACUC must review and either approve,
require modifications in, or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in
ongoing activities. Corrected at the time of inspection.
2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
The researchers of study protocol 2024-2 failed to communicate unexpected morbidity and mortality findings to the
attending veterinarian. On September 13, 2021, alerted by an animal caretaker, the attending veterinarian examined the
study animals and found out of 89 chicken, 8 dead as well as 20 showing signs of respiratory distress. Further


investigation revealed that mortality and animal health problems were observed during the 2 previous days, starting on
September 11th, but were not conveyed to the attending veterinarian. The failure to timely communicate animal health
issues to the attending veterinarian delayed treatment thus causing undue pain and distress to those animals. An effective
method of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian must be established for timely diagnosis and
adequate medical attention. Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
