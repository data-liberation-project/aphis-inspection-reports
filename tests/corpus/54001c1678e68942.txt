FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several areas in both fox enclosures where these animals have dug exposing the wire mesh. This has
now created holes underneath which now pose a risk of injury or entrapment. One of the foxes "Cheza" has had a
previous injury to one of the legs resulting in temporarily injury/lameness which required veterinary attention. The
cause of this lameness was not definitively determined, but these holes could have contributed the cause of this
injury.
The holes shall be filled in, and the wire mesh shall be covered, to prevent injury and maintain these enclosures in
good condition.

SANITATION.
The indoor kinkajou, bobcat, & skunk rooms are dirty and have a high concentration of ammonia. The ammonia
was in sufficient concentrations to cause an irritation of this inspector's nasal passages and difficulty in breathing.
Additionally, the kinkajou was observed to have slight, clear, nasal discharges from both nostrils and was observed
intermittently licking his nose to remove these discharges.The skunk room (bathroom) had large accumulations of old feces and food pellets on the floor &/or in the bathtub.
This room also had a bottle of cleaner on the floor. The skunks are allowed free access in this bathroom.
High concentrations of ammonia are irritating to nasal, ocular, & respiratory passages. This can cause distress,
difficulty in breathing, and does not minimize respiratory illnesses.
All animal enclosures shall be maintained in a clean fashion to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
