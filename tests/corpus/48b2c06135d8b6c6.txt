ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A male camel named "Billy" was lying on the ground and unable to return to a standing position. Billy is very thin
and the owner stated the camel is currently under treatment for worms. The owner also stated that the camel is
anemic. The camel was manually assisted by the caretakers to a standing position. The camel may be too weak or
other veterinary care issues may be present preventing the camel from standing without assistance. The attending
veterinarian has not seen these animals recently and this animal needs to be examined immediately to determine a
diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan. The written program of veterinary care needs to address issues of the
older camels. The owner informed the inspector that the camel was deceased during a conversation to discuss
issues concerning the camel's veterinary care.
