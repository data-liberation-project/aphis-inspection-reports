2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One multi colored adult female Persian ( tag number 093 ) has an open wound on the left side of its neck. The
wound approximately a quarter inch in diameter was open, circular in shape, inflamed, reddened, moist looking and
hairless. The licensee stated the wound was first observed on 2/24/18. The licensee stated that Vetericyn wound
treatment spray was being used to treat the wound. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not
been consulted. An open wound can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection which
affects the health and well-being of the cat. Daily observation of the animals may be accomplished by someone
other than the attending veterinarian provided that a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required
so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the
attending veterinarian. Failure to communicate illness, whether it appears mild or serious, to the attending
veterinarian, could result in improper care of the animals. For example, this could lead to failure to seek professional
veterinary care in a timely manner or provision of care that may not be appropriate for the animal's condition. The
licensee must observe all animals daily to access their health and well-being. The licensee must ensure that all
animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated in a timely manner by a veterinarian
as part of the facility’s programs of adequate veterinary care and that the facility uses appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases, and injuries at all times. The outcome of this consultation including
the diagnosis, treatment plan and how the condition will be resolved must be documented and provided to the
inspector upon request. If the healing process is delayed it can cause unnecessary pain, discomfort, or suffering,
which can create a negative impact on the animal’s health and well-being. The licensee must ensure all animals
receive adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct by 3/6/18.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* Official USDA forms (7005's) animal on hand sheets had 49 cats recorded but there were 38 adult cats counted
by the inspector. When the records and cats currently at the facility do not match it makes the records incomplete.
Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure each animal’s identity can be known with certainty, track the
movement of animals and to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate
records of all cats at all times at their facility. The licensee must make, keep, and maintain records or forms whichfully and correctly disclose the full and correct information required concerning each dog or cat purchased or
otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is
transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. Correct by 3/27/18.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* An accumulation of cat hair was collecting on an estimated 30 to 50 percent of four different resting surfaces.
Twenty five cats are in contact with the resting surfaces which are located in indoor housing. The accumulation of
hair create an unsanitary living condition that could impact the health and well-being of the cats. When any surface
is showing an accumulation of hair, then it is an indication that those surfaces are not being cleaned on a routine
basis. The licensee must ensure that premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and
surrounding grounds must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to facilitate the
husbandry practices required in this sub part and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents, other
pests and vermin. Correct by 3/13/18.
* Facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 2/27/18 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of inspection report was sent by electronic mail.
