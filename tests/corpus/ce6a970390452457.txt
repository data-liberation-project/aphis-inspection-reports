The licensee stated that he is still performing surgical procedures (anal sacculectomy) on skunks. The licensee states the
AV has discussed the procedure and observed him, but this has not been documented. The facility’s current written
protocol is still missing the following pieces of information: - How specifically to perform the anal sac removal (step by
step, including equipment to be used), post-procedural care instructions and pain control measures. Performing surgical
procedures without proper oversight or guidance from a licensed veterinarian can cause unnecessary harm, pain or injury
to the animal and can be detrimental to the animal’s health and wellbeing. The licensee must ensure the veterinarian
oversees all aspects of veterinary care, and this specific procedure must be detailed and documented in the written
program of vet care.

*** At the time of the inspection, a male skunk was jumping around the enclosure, did a summersault and was racing back
and forth on the side of the enclosure. At one point he stopped and licked his testes which were red and swollen to the
size of a golf ball. His condition and behavior had not been observed by the licensee until the inspectors pointed it out to
him. This animal’s behavior is an indicator of pain and should be communicated to the veterinarian and the animal seen
and evaluated by the vet for treatment options and to manage his pain levels.

*** Several of the arctic foxes on the wire mesh have very long nails that need to be trimmed. Long nails on a canine
species can begin to splay outward which can lead to foot and gait abnormalities. Since the fox has no way to naturally
wear the nails down through digging, the nails will need to be trimmed on a routine basis for the health of comfort of the
animal.

*** Multiple species noted in this report (raccoon, fox, coati mundi and skunk) were engaging in abnormal behavior
patterns including ( pacing back and forth, head tossing, running up the sides of the wire and flipping over in the
enclosure, and trying to climb up the mesh and freeze) during the inspection. Abnormal behavior patterns to this extent
can be an indication of pain, psychological stress or poor welfare. These abnormal behaviors should be communicated to
the AV to determine if they are due to physical injury or illness. The AV may be able to provide guidance in how to
mitigate these abnormal behavior patterns to ensure the overall welfare of the animals.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is still not tracking offspring born at the facility until they leave the facility through sales receipts. This does not
account for all the animals born at the facility as the licensee stated that an animal (skunk, raccoon, or fox) may have a
litter of 4 or more but only have 2-3 remaining when he pulls them. These offspring deaths are not recorded either to
account for any deaths of maternal roughness or neglect. Record keeping requirements require the facility to maintain

records of total offspring born of any animal while in his possession or under his control. These records must be
maintained in an accurate and timely manner for recordkeeping purposes.

Facilities, general.
*** Multiple fox enclosures need repair. Several sections of the wire mesh flooring are broken creating large gaps in the
floor with sharp edges. These gaps are large enough for a foot to pass through which can cause injury to the fox. These
sections of mesh must be maintained in good repair for the safety of the foxes.

*** A skunk enclosure has wire mesh that is broken in the den area, creating a gap large enough with sharp edges that a
foot could get caught and potentially injured. These sections of wire mesh must be kept in good repair for the safety of the
skunks.

*** Inside the sika deer enclosure, there is a section of fencing that is falling and bent due to the deer jumping over the
fence. This is a potential hazard to the deer and should be removed or maintained in good repair for their safety. In
addition, several sections of fencing around the deer pen have large gaps (6-7 inches) at the base of the fence and
ground that does not provide protection from animals entering the pen. These sections of fence must also be maintained
in good repair for the safety of the deer.

*** Multiple enclosures for the foxes and groundhogs have a small section of wire mesh that has been cut near the food
bowl. The wire was not cut down to the line and several have areas where wire is protruding, and multiple animals were
putting their noses through this hole which could cause injury. These areas of cut wire must be addressed and the sharp
protrusions cut down for the safety of the

animals.

*** An enclosure that is rusted throughout its entirety is being used to house two groundhogs. There are areas where the
rust has affected the structural integrity of the door creating sharp edges. This enclosure needs to be replaced or
maintained in good repair for the safety and containment of the animals.
3.127(b) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
Many of the arctic fox wire mesh enclosures only have a covering directly over the top of the enclosure. This covering
does not constitute a shelter and does not provide protection from inclement weather that may come through the
enclosures sideways. Animals must be provided a shelter to prevent any discomfort the animals may experience.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
*** This facility still does not have a perimeter fence despite the fact the variance was revoked by the APHIS
administration. A perimeter fence of at least 6 feet is required and must be constructed so that it protects the animals in
the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from having contact with the animals and to function as a
secondary containment system for the animals.
3.128 Direct

Space requirements.
*** At the time of the inspection two fox kits were housed in an enclosure that is designed for a chinchilla. The kit cannot
stand fully on all four, as his head is slightly down and his ears are touching the top of the enclosure. This enclosure does
not provide enough space for the animal to stand up, turn and move with any freedom of movement appropriate for the
species. Additionally, being housed in this size of enclosure does not allow the animal to grow normally as the animal will

have to compensate his body posture for the small space.

*** Four raccoon kits that are being bottle fed in the office area, are housed in a small crate that does not provide
adequate space and freedom of movement. Several of the kits were highly active climbing and hanging on the top of the
crate and biting the bars of the door. Lack of space at a developmental age can contribute to abnormal behavior patterns
such as repetitive head movements and excessive biting of bars that can wear and break teeth. These animals need to be
housed in an enclosure that provides space to allow for postural adjustment and freedom of movement.

*** Multiple adult raccoons in wire enclosures were engaging in behavior patterns of pacing and circling in a repetitive
pattern that is abnormal for the species. These are wire mesh enclosures up off the ground with a dome shape wire cover
and a wood nest box. Despite being a nocturnal species, most of the raccoons were awake and several engaged in these
abnormal behaviors. One raccoon had hair loss on his tail which can be an indicator of stress. In addition, the licensee
states that any additional stress (like an additional person in the area) can cause the raccoons to kill their offspring. Killing
of offspring is also a strong indicator of space issues when the animal does not feel safe or have ability to avoid stress in
this environment.

*** A red fox was engaging in repetitive pacing behavior against the far wire mesh of his enclosure. This is also a wire
mesh enclosure up off the ground with a dome shape wire cover and a wood nest box. This is a wire mesh enclosure that
does not have any complexity to allow for the fox to have normal postural adjustments and social adjustments such as
digging or climbing and does not provide adequate freedom of movement for the species.


*** The arctic foxes are housed in wire mesh enclosures up off the ground with 2-3 animals in an enclosure. There are no
hide boxes or shelter for inclement weather in these enclosures. Several of these animals were pushing themselves up
the sides of the wire mesh enclosures and climbing over each other to get away from the inspector or freezing in place.
These enclosures do not provide enough space to allow for any postural or social adjustments for the foxes to have a
place to hide or remove themselves from a stressful situation.

*** A coati mundi was racing about his enclosure in a repetitive manner in a frantic motion while his cage mate stood in
the entrance to the den box seemingly blocking his entrance to the den area. There is nothing of complexity in the
enclosure that would provide for a second den areas for both animals and this abnormal behavior pattern can be
indicative of stress due to lack of space in this enclosure.

Feeding.
*** Several of the food receptacles for the foxes had old moldy food in the base of the food container. These containers
are not being cleaned with any frequency, and food is just added to the container daily even if old moldy food is present.
These feeders need to be kept clean to minimize contamination to the food supply when fresh food is placed in the
feeder.

*** The metal feeder for three groundhogs was rusted at the lip of the feeder and the metal was broken with sharp edges
around the feeder area. Rust affects the structural integrity of the metal and does not allow the feeder to be adequately
cleaned. This feeder needs to be replaced for the safety of the animals while they feed.
3.130 Repeat


Watering.
The metal water receptacles for the ferrets, skunk and mink in the large barn area contained a layer of algae and grime
that needs to be cleaned. Dirty water receptacles can contaminate water causing illness in the animals. Additionally,
several of the animals had offspring and clean water that is not contaminated is important for milk production. Water
receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary to provide water that is free from contamination.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
*** There is an accumulation of feces under the fox, raccoon, and coati mundi enclosures at the facility. Some of the feces
has mold growth and the accumulation is contributing to the ammonia and fecal odor around the area. The licensee states
the feces is cleaned weekly but based on the accumulation noted under the enclosures and odor, this is not frequent
enough. Feces must be removed as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors around the animal
area.

*** A spotted skunk enclosure had old moldy feces in the corner of the nest box that was not being removed. These next
boxes are covered with hair and cobwebs indicating they are not being checked with enough frequency to ensure the
animals in the boxes do not become soiled by their own waste. Feces must be removed from primary enclosures as often
as necessary to prevent this situation from occurring.

3.131(c)

Sanitation.
*** Housekeeping at the facility needs to be addressed. There are excess piles of old enclosures around the area,
including a large area in the mink, ferret, skunk barn area. There is a pile of trash and debris including 40 plus cat food
cans left in between animal enclosures. Accumulations of trash and debris can become breeding and living grounds for

pests and trash should be cleared as necessary to reduce these living areas. Premises must be kept clean to facilitate
good husbandry and housekeeping practices.

*** In addition, several areas of the premises and enclosures (skunk, mink, ferrets) have excess hair, cobwebs and debris
throughout the wire mesh and boxes. This excess hair, and cobwebs trap urine and debris leading to strong ammonia
odors throughout the property.

Employees.
Based on the non-compliant items listed in this report, the licensee and two part time employees are not enough
employees to maintain an acceptable level of husbandry and care for the animals at the facility. Cleaning, feeding and
watering for the 600 plus regulated animals at the facility in addition to performing daily observations for health concerns
is not being done adequately to ensure animal health and welfare. Lack of employees is leading to adverse welfare
impacts for these animals. The facility must ensure that staffing is adequate to provide care for the animals.
