2.1(a) REPEAT
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
During the visit at the premises with two Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission investigators the facility owner
indicated that he has continued to sell wild, exotic and domestic animals since the last visit of the previous USDA
Animal care inspector in July of 2015. He stated he sold a macaque to someone in Texas. He also breeds exotics
and sells them as well as buys and sells regulated animals at auctions not just in Florida but in other states as well.
He and another individual at the facility stated they breed and sell hairless cats, nonhuman primates, zebras, and
other animals. The owner indicated that they intended to become USDA license down the road but were really not
ready for that now. There was extensive discussion including regulated activity without a USDA license, specific
regulated activities and covered species, types of licenses, the licensing process, standards, exemptions, health
certificates, housing animals at other facilities, covered species, covered activities and other items related to the
licensing processes, inspections, and regulations. A copy of the AWA regulations (“Blue Book”) and an application
packet was provided and the contents discussed and explained. It was clearly communicated that conducting
regulated activity without a valid USDA License is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act and that no regulated activity
must occur without obtaining a valid USDA License.
3.75(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing four nonhuman primates, that the owner identified as Patas monkeys, had a loose wire
cable attached to the door to the lockout area. This wire formed a loop that could pose an entanglement risk for the
monkeys. The dirt floor of that cage also had a large area of wire panel that was exposed which could pose an
injury risk to the animals.
An enclosure with lemurs had severely chipping and flaking paint on the wires and metal posts. The door latch on
this enclosure was not secured well and had no supplemental lock, clasp or other mechanism to prevent the
monkeys from lifting the latch.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species, they must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, and contain theanimals securely.
3.75(c)(1)(ii) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure with four ring-tailed lemurs had numerous sharp wire ends pointing into the pen that pose a risk of
injury to the animals. The primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points
or edges that could injure the nonhuman primate.
3.78(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Several of the nonhuman primate enclosures do not have adequate protection from the elements. The Patas
monkey and one of the brown lemur enclosures did not have any wind breaks and the shelter containers (plastic
barrels open on one side) had no wind break for the opening. There were heating lamps attached to the outsides of
the enclosures where the primates could reach through and touch the bulbs or grab the electric cord and potentially
injure themselves. These heating lamps were also at a distance from the plastic nest barrels, and several enclosure
had no wind breaks, so the small heating lamps would not be able to keep the ambient temperature from falling
below 45 degrees Fahrenheit.
Outdoor housing facilities for nonhuman primates must provide protection from the sun, rain, snow, wind, and cold
and from any weather conditions that may occur. The shelter must safely provide heat to the nonhuman primates to
prevent the ambient (surrounding) temperature form falling below 45 degrees Fahrenheit.
3.78(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There was not sufficient shelter space in the enclosure housing four Patas monkeys. The plastic barrel provided as
shelter did not have space for four. There was a large plastic tube that created a tunnel on the floor of the enclosure
but if it rained this structure would likely have water enter it making it unusable as shelter. The shelter must be
sufficiently large to comfortably provide protection for each nonhuman primate housed in the enclosure.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Three zebras were housed in a pasture which did not have a perimeter fence. The primary enclosure appeared to
be eight foot high fencing on three sides and the fourth was a lower fence bordering a paddock. The paddock also
housed a young zebra and Nilgai antelope, and at least one side of that enclosure did not have a perimeter fence.
The eight foot fence also went around the front of the property. Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by aperimeter fence at least eight feet high for potentially dangerous animals or at least six feet high for other animals
and must be at least three feet from the primary enclosure. Fencing that does not meet these requirements must be
approved in writing by the Administrator.
The owner allowed a partial inspection of the facility. Noncompliant items were identified and discussed during the
tour of the facility.
The inspection was conducted with the VMO, two Florida Fish and Wildlife Investigators, the facility owner and
another resident at the facility.
