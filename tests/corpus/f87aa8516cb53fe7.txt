ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinarian Care for this facility was last updated in 2005. Since that time they have switched
Attending Veterinarians. Although the new Attending Veterinarian comes out to the facility for routine visits, a new
Program of Veterinarian Care has not been established for the facility. A program of Veterinarian Care is required to
ensure that adequate measures are in place to ensure all health issues are addressed in an appropriate and timely
manor. Licensee must ensure that they have a written Program of Veterinarian care for the facility that has been
signed off and approved by the current Attending Veterinarian.
