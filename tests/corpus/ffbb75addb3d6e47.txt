3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The southwestern enclosure for the building, housing one adult dog, had plastic grated flooring. The flooring was
not secured and was extremely sagging downward along the back wall. The flooring was sagging more when the
large breed dog walk across it. This flooring could break allowing for the dog to get injured from falling through,
getting stuck in the gaps created from not being secured or trying to escape.
For the prevention of injury to the animals or animals escaping, all housing facilities must be kept in good repair.

3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The top of a table used for animal husbandry practices had an accumulation of hair and empty syringe covers.
The medication storage area used for animal husbandry practices had medication bottles stored with an
accumulation of wood chips and bedding, cob webs in the back corner, empty plastic container to store medication,
syringe covers and grey dust on the medication bottles and plastic storage containers. This can attract and provided
living and breeding areas for insects, pests and vermin. The medication can be contaminated from the dust on the
bottles and improper storage. This is not proper husbandry practices.
For the prevention of insects, pest, vermin and contaminated mediation, all animal areas must be free of
accumulations of trash, hair, dust and other discarded matter. This will protect the health and well-being of seven
adult dogs and 16 puppies.

3.1(c)(3)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Three enclosures and an empty enclosure, next to an enclosure housing dogs, had an accumulation of fecal waste
on the plastic flooring. In areas, the fecal waste was smashed into the square holes and onto the plastic flooring.
The dogs had direct contact with the waste. This indicates that daily spot-cleaning daily is not taking place. Thus,
this can increase the disease hazards for the seven adult dogs and one puppy. These enclosures were located in
the Kennel Building.
For the prevention of disease hazards and an accumulation of waste, all enclosures must be spot-cleaned daily and
sanitized when necessary.
