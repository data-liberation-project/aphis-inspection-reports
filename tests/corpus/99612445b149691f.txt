3.9 DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
***In the outdoor shelter there were four enclosures containing nine dogs. The self feeders in these enclosures had
black bugs intermingled with the food. Bugs and other pests create contamination to the food. Contaminated food
increases the risk of illness to the animals by ingesting the contamination. The licensee must remove the
contaminated food and assure that wholesome, uncontaminated and palatable food is being provided as required.
This inspection began at 1607.
This was a focus inspection on the feed.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative and Beverly Hicks, ACI.
