2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are three medications in the treatment area of the kennel building with no expiration dates. The Pyrantel,
Noromectin, and Panacur have no expiration dates listed on the bottles. Medications with no expiration dates can
expire without the licensee's knowledge. If the medications do expire and are used, they can experience spoilage or
have reduced efficacy. This could lead to prolonged illness or suffering for the animals needing the drug. The
licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired and labeled properly in accordance
with standard veterinary practices, to include expiration dates. To be corrected by 24 September 2015.
3.10
WATERING.
There are four metal water receptacles that have a rusted surface in contact with the water. The rusted surface
inhibits the ability to adequately clean and sanitize the receptacle, which can play a role in disease transmission.
The rust may also interfere with the dogs' desire to drink. The licensee must ensure that water receptacles be
maintained in a condition that allows them to be kept clean and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this
subpart, and before being used to water a different dog or cat or social grouping of dogs or cats. To be corrected by
24 September 2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Kendall Lundy, ACI and Margaret A Shaver,
VMO in attendance.
