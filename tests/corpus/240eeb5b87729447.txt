made of material generally considered acceptable to pet owners as a means of identifying their pet dogs, or shall be
identified by a distinctive and legible tattoo marking acceptable to and approved by the Administrator. The licensee must

Housing facilities, general.
In one enclosure, containing one adult dog and one puppy, there is a large amount of clutter stored on top of the
enclosure. The clutter consists of a clock, stacks of paperwork, plastic containers, and bottles of veterinary care products.
Another enclosure, containing two adult dogs, has a large plastic container placed on top of the enclosure. Clutter stored
on top of the enclosures could impact the movement of air, as well as become too heavy and cause the top of the
enclosure to collapse potentially injuring an animal.

Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter. The licensee must remove the clutter from
the tops of the enclosures and ensure that all housing areas remain free from clutter at all times.

3.6(c)(1)(i)

Primary enclosures.
One enclosure, containing one adult dog ("Bridgette", #86) and one puppy, does not provide the minimum amount of floor
space. The adult dog measured 15 inches in length requiring a minimum floor space of 3.06 square feet. The puppy
measured 12 inches in length requiring a minimum floor space of 2.25 square feet. Together, the puppy and adult require
a minimum floor space of 5.31 square feet and the enclosure they are housed in has a floor space of 3.95 square feet.

One enclosure, containing one adult dog ("Tucker") and one puppy, does not provide the minimum amount of floor space.
The adult dog measured 15 inches in length requiring a minimum floor space of 3.06 square feet. The puppy measured
14 inches in length requiring a minimum floor space of 2.78 square feet. Together, the puppy and adult require a
minimum floor space of 5.84 square feet and the enclosure they are housed in has a floor space of 4.43 square feet.

Failure to provide the minimum amount of space in which to house the dogs could have a negative impact on their health
and well-being.

Each dog housed in a primary enclosure (including weaned puppies) must be provided a minimum amount of floor space
as required by the Animal Welfare Act. The licensee must house the above mentioned dogs in an enclosure that provides
the minimum amount of floor space. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are provided with the minimum amount of
floor space at all times.

Exercise for dogs.

The licensee's exercise plan has not been reviewed or approved by the attending veterinarian. The exercise plan also
does not address the specific needs of dogs housed individually or in groups.

A complete exercise plan that has been approved by the attending veterinarian is important to ensure the dogs are
receiving adequate space and exercise to support their health and well-being.

The licensee must have an appropriate plan, approved by the attending veterinarian, that provides all dogs with the
opportunity to exercise.

Watering
Three enclosures, housing 5 dogs, have empty water receptacles. The program of veterinary care provided by the
attending veterinarian in November 2020, advises the licensee of the new watering rule and the requirement for a
continuously available potable water.

Continuous access to potable water is important for the health and well-being of the dogs and it is a specific requirement
of the Animal Welfare Act.

Potable water must be continuously available to all dogs. The licensee must ensure that all dogs have access to potable
water at all times.
