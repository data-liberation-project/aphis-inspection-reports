FACILITIES, INDOOR.
***There was a strong urine odor in the house where 3 skunks,2 fox, 2 raccoon, 1 prairie dog, 1 opossum, 2
groundhogs and one kinkajou are housed. Laminate floor appeared to have urine seeping into seams between
pieces as the seams were discolored and raised. One couch was urine stained and torn and contributed to the
odor. Ventilation needs to be improved and couch and any other urine-contaminated materials need to be removed
to reduce odor.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
