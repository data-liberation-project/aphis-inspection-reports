ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the drug lockbox there were two bottles of expired medication that were scheduled to be used and there were
other expired drugs that were being used for treatment that were found in the pharmacy. Expired drugs may not be
as effective for the proper use and treatment of this animal and delay healing. The expired drugs need to be
removed. The facility needs to review the procedure for monitoring the expiration of drugs.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the cat cottage that housed 21 cats, the scratching posts were frayed in many areas. Fixtures in the enclosures
should be removed or replaced when worn in order to protect animals from injury. The potential exists for cats to
ingest the frayed pieces of rope which could cause potential health issues. A system of timely identification, facility
repair, and maintenance must be in place.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At the time of inspection, one cat was being housed in a primary enclosure that measured at 16.5 inches in height.
Cats being housed in enclosures that are less than 24 inches of height could lead to possible safety issues for the
cat. All cats (including weaned kittens) must be housed in an enclosure that measures at least 24 inches in height.
Adequate cage height will allow the cats freedom of movement to make normal postural adjustments affecting the
health and well-being of the cats.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Multiple cat cages did not have an elevated resting surface. The use of elevated resting surfaces satisfies a
behavioral preference for many cats. The licensee must ensure that each primary enclosure housing cats contains a
resting surface or surfaces that, in the aggregate, are large enough to hold all the occupants of the primary
enclosure at the same time comfortably. The resting surfaces must be elevated, impervious to moisture, and be
able to be easily cleaned and sanitized, or easily replaced when soiled or worn.
