MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on05-Apr-18 at 11:30.
The IACUC Chair stated that he did not have adequate time to be available for questions during the inspection or
to discuss the inspection findings during an exit briefing. The IACUC administrator was out for the day and could
not fill in for him. Lack of availability for inspection hinders the regulatory process. All facilities must ensure a
representative is available during normal business hours to accompany inspection. Please notify your inspector of
scheduling changes and availability. Correct from this time forward.
