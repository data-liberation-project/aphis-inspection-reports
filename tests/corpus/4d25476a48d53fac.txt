ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The juvenile male lion was injured in his hindquarters region from the adult female during his introduction into the
enclosure. The juvenile lion was separated from the female but was not assessed by the vet to determine the extent
of his injury. The facility did contact the vet and it was determined that a course of antibiotics were appropriate.
There is not enough lighting to determine if the injury is healing well or facilitate additional inspection.
***The adult female bear was reluctant to walk on her front left leg, while gathering food she crawled using her
elbow. The facility indicated that the animal was approximately 15 years in age and has seemed arthritic for a while.
They were unable to give an approximation on the length of time that she has had difficulty walking. She was
observed walking on all four legs and appeared to be slow at first and then eventually showed very little sign of
discomfort. The facility did not contact the veterinarian to determine the cause or to develop a treatment plan.
*** The adult male capybara was seen to be limping on his left hind leg. The musculature of the leg showed a
moderate amount of atrophy associated with the limited use. The facility did not contact the veterinarian to
determine the cause or to develop a treatment plan.
Lameness and disuse of legs as shown are indicators of painful conditions. Signs of pain, discomfort, and ill-health
need to be addressed by the licensee as soon as they are identified to prevent unnecessary suffering. Correct by
having these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian for appropriate diagnosis and treatment no later than 5
PM on 21 July 2015. The Licensee shall follow all recommendations of the veterinarian and shall maintain records
of the diagnosis and treatment for evaluation by APHIS Officials upon request. Additionally, the Licensee shall
ensure that all animals are provided with appropriate veterinary care including the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries from this point forward.
3.126(c) DIRECT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The juvenile lion is currently housed in holding and has been there since the end of May 2015. The holding areadoes not have enough light to provide the animal with a diurnal light cycle nor can the licensee see the animal well
enough for routine inspection and cleaning. At the time of the inspection the inspectors were not able to visualize
the animal except for his eyes. This needs to be addressed immediately for the health of the animal and to provide
light for cleaning, routine husbandry practices, and facilitate inspection.

3.131(a) DIRECT
SANITATION.
At the time of the inspection the juvenile lion enclosure was extremely soiled and the animal was in unsanitary
conditions. The animal was placed in the holding enclosure on May 22, 2015 and since that date the facility has
been unable to enter the enclosure to remove food and fecal waste. This has created conditions in which there was
rotting meat/carcasses in the enclosure with the animal. During the inspection, the area was dark due to inadequate
light in the enclosure which did not allow for proper husbandry and care practices for this animal. This needs to be
addressed and the holding enclosure cleaned to promote health conditions for the animals.

EMPLOYEES.
The facility currently has two employees who are responsible for the daily husbandry care of all the exotic and
domestic animals at the park. There are over 200 animals at this facility. This is not a sufficient number of
employees to maintain the professional acceptable level of care at a facility this size. When one employee is off the
other employee is responsible for the overall care of the animals, as well as maintenance of enclosures and
facilities. The number of citations on this report clearly support this issue. This needs to be addressed and additional
staff hired to properly care for the animals.

SEPARATION.
A juvenile male lion was acquired by the facility in May, 2015. The lions were introduced and lived together for two
weeks when the female inured the juvenile male. Since then (late May) the male has been housed in holding and
the female housed outdoors. This exhibit does not support housing two animals who cannot be compatibility
housed. With only one holding area the male cannot be shifted to adequately clean the area and the female cannot
be shifted to clean the outdoor area. As a result of inadequate facilities to separate these animals, neither animal is
receiving appropriate cleaning and sanitation nor neither enclosure has been adequately cleaned since May. Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatibility housed for their health but also to facilitate
basic husbandry practices required in this subpart. The current housing arrangement is not adequate and interferes
with the health and may cause discomfort to one or both of these animals. This needs to be addressed for the
heath of the animals.

*** A complete routine inspection was conducted on July 20, 2015. This report is limited to the direct
noncompliant items identified on that inspection. A second inspection report containing indirect noncompliant items
will follow. Both the inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager on July 20, 2015
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative, the ACI Andrea D'Ambrosio and VMO Dr. Michael
