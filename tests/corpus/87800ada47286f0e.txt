3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wood in the back sheltered building for the Macaque has not been sealed. This enclosure cannot be adequately
cleaned and sanitized on a routine basis. These areas of wood need to be sealed to facilitate husbandry cleaning
for the species.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the bear's enclosure, a metal post was noted to be bent and protruding into the animal area, posing an injury risk
to the bear.
The bear's enclosure has a gap along the base of the back side of the primary enclosure fencing approximately 6
inches tall by 18 inches wide. The gap in fencing may allow contained animals to escape and/or allow entry of
unwanted animals, thereby posing a risk to the animals.
Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Although progress has been made in organizing the freezer storing meat for the big cats and exotics at the facility, it
needs to be addressed further. There are boxes and bags of unidentified meat in the freezer. There are no dates
on most of the meat and no rotation schedule in use to assure food is used in a timely manner. The method of food
being stored in this freezer has improved but is not yet considered professionally acceptable to assure the food is
protected from deterioration and contamination.
3.127(c) REPEATFACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosures housing the white tiger, and the bear contained mud and standing water. Standing water and mud
that does not dissipate rapidly can lead to hoof and foot problems and other health concerns for the animals that
cannot get or stay dry. Additionally, being wet for extended periods of time may be distressing to the animals and
impact their well being. The facility needs to take immediate action to facilitate drainage in these enclosures for the
health of the animals.
Perimeter fence variance remains under review.
A substantial portion of the animal population has recently been relocated to other licensed facilities.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
