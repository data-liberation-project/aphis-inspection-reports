ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A fisher was found dead in its enclosure on 5/2/16. Prior to that its decline was observed by caretakers, but the
attending veterinarian was not informed or consulted. The daily observation log includes the following observations
(in quotation marks [sic]) of the fisher in the days preceding its death:
4/25/16 - "fisher bald patches larger than I last observed, bald patch on belly as well now"
4/26/16 (cid:19) "fisher appeared to be heaving/retching after exiting box but observed eating right after that. bald patches
increasing in size."
4/28/16 (cid:19) "fisher appears to be thinner and labored breathing wt - 3.67 kg" (Note - was over 5 kg earlier in the year)
(4/29/16 - Fisher not mentioned in daily observations) (cid:19)
4/30/16 (cid:19) "fisher still breathing heavily. Didn'(cid:25)t eat all of canine diet."
5/1/16 (cid:19) "fisher ate none of yesterday'(cid:25)s food, appears extremely weak and wobbly when walking. FM & KC notified"
(Note - not veterinarians, and they did not notify veterinarian)
5/2/16 (cid:19) "fisher found deceased in box. RB notified" (Note - RB is the Attending Veterinarian)
The Attending Veterinarian was not notified regarding the condition of the fisher over these dates, until after its
death.
Daily observation of animals by assigned personnel must include prompt communication with the attending
veterinarian, or his or her alternate if not available, in the event that any health problems are noted. Failure to
consult with a veterinarian could result in suffering and / or a poor medical outcome for the animals.
To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
