ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection a female Yorkshire terrier "Lady Yorkie" Microchip # 021-070-825 was found to be lethargic
with bite injuries on her head and face. She had neck stiffness and a dirty, oily hair coat of the head area. Her Left
eye swollen and tearful and the animal was observed to be in pain trying not to move. This animal was under stress
and it was shaking. The owner told the inspector that the animal had a fight with a French bulldog Sunday evening.
He stated that he separated the animals and transferred the Yorkie to a different enclosure and nothing more was
done that day. The next day, which was Monday the 19th, the licensee called the veterinarian but he was not in the
clinic. The licensee gave an injection of 3/4 cc of the Combi-pen-48 for cattle (penicillin G benzathine and penicillin
G procaine Injectable suspension 300,000 units per ml) and applied a local solution in the wounds. (M & J’s Healing
Wonder) The licensee repeated this injection on Tuesday morning, the 20th. At 1:00 pm Tuesday the licensee still
not have contacted the veterinarian. The PVC includes an emergency care veterinarian clinic, which can be contact
24/7 but this clinic was not contacted by the licensee. There was no record of any previous advice from any
veterinarian and no written guidance present in the program of veterinary care for this type of injury. In addition to
this, the medicines that the licensee is using to treat this animal are not included in the PVC. This type of injuries
can result in serious infections. Also in these cases injuries to the bones and internal injuries cannot be seen with
the naked eye and may need to be evaluated using other methods. Without proper treatment, these cases may
progress negatively resulting in unnecessary discomfort and suffering. In some cases the life of the animal can be
in jeopardy. Immediate contact with the veterinarian is necessary to properly diagnose and treat injuries in a timely
manner to prevent unnecessary pain and suffering.
