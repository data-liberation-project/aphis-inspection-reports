This was a focused inspection on the NCI cited on January 31, 2018.
The veterinarian has been working with the licensee to adjust the diet and worming program for the reindeer. While
Clarice has not changed in body condition, Christmas and the two other reindeer have put on some weight and look
much better. The licensee is continuing to work with the attending veterinarian to properly treat the regulated
animals.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee and with Pat Keith, CS present during the
inspection.
