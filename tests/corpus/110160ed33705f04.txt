2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is a large space between the barrier fence entrance door and the rest of the fence. Even though the door
was locked with a padlock, the latch combined with the gap, had sufficient play allowing this entrance door to easily
open. This then would permit direct public access to the serval enclosure.
The barrier fence shall be maintained to prevent public contact with the animals to assure the safety of both the
animals and the public.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

their food, dirty the enclosure with their droppings, and can harass the wolf hybrid.

SANITATION.
The deer exhibit is covered with plastic mesh pieces which are intended to prevent the vultures from entering.
During the inspection there were many vultures that were observed inside (and around) the exhibit.
Upon further inspection, it was noticed that there were holes within this material either due to the birds picking at it,deterioration from exposure to sunlight/UV, or that the mesh became detached from its adjacent piece. This now
has created gaps where the vultures can easily gain access into the exhibit and is no longer effective in keeping
these birds out.
These vultures are predatory birds which pose a risk of disease to the deer. They also can & do compete for their
food, dirty their enclosure with their droppings, and can harass the deer.
This plastic mesh shall either be repaired or replaced with another material that can better withstand the elements
(as well as the birds) as discussed during the inspection.
