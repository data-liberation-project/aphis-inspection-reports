2.31(c)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semi-annual inspection report, dated 3/10/16, sent to the Institutional Official (IO) does not identify three
deficiencies as either significant or minor. The semi-annual report to the IO list a total of five deficiencies found by
the IACUC. Two of the deficiencies are listed as minor, but the remaining deficiencies have no designation of being
either significant or minor. Additionally, two of the deficiencies have no plans for correction and one deficiency has
no schedule with date for correcting. The report to the Institutional Official functions as an overall evaluation of the
registrant's facilities and programs. It is the IO's responsibility to make sure all problems are addressed in a timely
manner. Failing to adequately provide all the required information to the IO can ultimately lead to problems affecting
animal welfare going uncorrected. This semi-annual evaluation must be complete and for any identified deficiencies
must include a description of the nature and extent of the deficiency, the significance of the deficiency (significant or
minor), and a specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting the deficiency.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director of Laboratory Animal Resources.
