Adequate bedding
****
In one of the igloo style shelters there is not enough bedding provided. There is some bedding provided but bare
floor was visible. When questioned as to when the last time he had provided bedding for this shelter the licensee
replied "last weekend". The temperature for the area, according to www.noaa.gov, was measured at 32 degree F
for the high and 21 degrees F for the low. When temperatures fall below 35 degrees F additional bedding must be
provided for the dogs so that they can burrow down into the material to stay warm. The licensee must provide
additional bedding to this outdoor shelter and ensure that when the temperatures fall below 50 degrees F bedding
must be provided to all outdoor enclosures and when the temperature falls below 35 degrees F additional bedding
must be provided so that the dogs can stay warm.

Food and water receptacles
****
Inside two enclosures, affecting 4 dogs, the self feeders had a thick layer of straw bedding packed into the food
trough area completely covering the feed. This amount of straw bedding made it difficult for the dogs to retrieve the
food from the receptacles which could lead to potential health related issues. Inside two enclosures, affecting 3
dogs, the water receptacles had a thick layer, approximately 1 inch, of sawdust and/or hair on the bottom of the
water receptacle under the waters level. This could lead to potential health related issues. The licensee must clean
these food and water receptacles and ensure that all food and water receptacles are kept clean to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
