ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One red and white adult female longhorn had extremely overgrown hooves on all four feet. The hooves on both
front feet have crossed over each other and are curling upward. When this animal walks her gait is adversely
affected by these long front hooves. Overgrown hooves can cause changes in the angle of the toes, change the
gait, cause discomfort when walking, and can lead to chronic problems in the feet and legs such as arthritis. The
hooves must be trimmed and a plan needs to be developed with the input of the attending veterinarian (AV), to
address the need for hoof trimming for all animals that may need more frequent trimming to prevent the
development of chronic foot and leg problems. To be corrected by: October 3, 2016.

SANITATION.
At the time of this inspection, there were excessive numbers of flies around the head and shoulders of the black and
white adult Brahman. This animal was observed shaking its head and swatting at the files with its tail. Although fly
bait traps were in use, additional/alternate methods of safe and effective pest control must be established and
maintained to control the fly population. To be corrected by: September 16, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
