2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility maintains regular communication with the attending veterinarian but the veterinarian has not been conducting
regular visits to the facility. The last visit was in 2019 (3 years ago) and the facility reported the attending veterinarian was
reluctant to visit because of COVID concerns. All of the animals appeared healthy on today's inspection.
Failure to have regular visits by the veterinarian can result in negative health impacts on the animals.
Facilities must have arrangements with attending veterinarians that include regularly scheduled visits to the premises.
