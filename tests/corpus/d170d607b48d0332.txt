3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Five unweaned puppies housed in of the upper whelping enclosure on the eastern side of the kennel were observed
to have their feet and legs passing through the openings in the wire mesh floor. Flooring that allows feet or legs to
pass through can result in injury or entrapment of a limb. The floor must be constructed in a manner that protects
the feet and legs from injury and if of mesh or slatted construction, does not allow the animal's feet to pass through
any openings in the floor.
