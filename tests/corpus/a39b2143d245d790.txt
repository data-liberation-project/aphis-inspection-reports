2.31(c) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The most recent IACUC reviews of the facility's program for humane care and use of animals and the animal
facilities occurred on July 14, 2017. Due to scheduling conflicts, the IACUC has been unable to meet since that
date. The committee is scheduled to meet later this month to perform these reviews.
Inspection of the animal facilities by the IACUC and review of the program for the humane care and use of animals
by the IACUC are required at least every six months to ensure that any activities involving animals at this facility are
being conducted in a manner to reduce pain and/or distress and they meet the current standards for the species
involved.
The IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research
facility's animal facilities, including animal study areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A- Animal Welfare, as a
basis for evaluation. The IACUC must also review the research facility's program for humane care and use of
animals, at least once every six months, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Institutional Official.
