CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*The weeds and grass adjacent to and along the outdoor portion of the sheltered housing enclosures at both
buildings need to be mowed/trimmed as they are thick and up to 12 inches tall in places. One capuchin enclosure
also has weeds inside the outdoor portion of the housing which need to be trimmed back and or removed.
*The outdoor wall of the monkey building forming part of the sheltered enclosures needs to be washed. The lower
2-3 feet of the wall is covered with green algae like growth and in places brown dirt has accumulated on the wall.
All premises including buildings and surrounding grounds must be kept clean with weeds and grass controlled in
order to protect the nonhuman primates from injury, to facilitate husbandry/cleaning practices and to reduce
breeding and living areas for pests and vermin. Correct by June 4, 2016.
