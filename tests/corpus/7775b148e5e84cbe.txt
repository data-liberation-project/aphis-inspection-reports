FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are areas along the canal, both on the north & and side of the facility, that do not have a perimeter fence.
The water line is only approx. 1.5 feet below the sea wall at high tide in some areas and not at least 6 feet in others.
There are only rope barriers (or no barriers) along the sea wall in these areas. Even though these areas are not
directly adjacent to the animal pens the public can easily gain access into the facility, as well as the animals,
through these areas.
The facility does has alternative security measures but has not received written approval from the Administrator for
these alternative security measures.
Please request approval from the Regional Office for approval of your security measures in lieu of a perimeter fence
for these areas.
