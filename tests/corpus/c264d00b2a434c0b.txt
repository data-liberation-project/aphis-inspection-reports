3.26(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The temperature at the level of the lower 3 floors of pens in the guinea pig housing facility was 55.7 degrees F as
measured with a kestrel. The upper 2 levels of pens measured 60 degrees F. The facility had a thermometer but it
was set on a higher shelf so it was reading temperatures around 60 degrees as well and may need relocated to
accurately reflect temperatures at lower locations in the room.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may cause discomfort
and predispose them to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.
3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**The feeders in Pens 6 and 15 both had areas where the metal was worn down on the sides of the feeders and
had rusty, jagged edges. Since these worn sides were on the portion of the feeder that was on the inside of the
pen, the animals in these pens were directly exposed to these rusty, jagged edges when eating from the feeders.
The licensee had purchased new feeders but had not installed them yet.
**Four of the pens had separation of the bottom border of the wire mesh from the wooden frame of the guinea pig
enclosures. In Pen 3, this separation occurred on two sides of the enclosure with one of the gaps measuring 4in
between the wire and the frame. The gap on the other side of Pen 3 measured 1in as did the gaps between the
wire mesh and the frame in the other three pens this was observed in.
Enclosures and items within them, including feeders, must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. The
worn down feeders can cause injury to the guinea pigs or increase incidence of illness as these feeders cannot be
properly sanitized. The wire gaps in the enclosures can also cause injury by allowing the guinea pigs to escape or
fall from their enclosures. Correct by repairing/replacing the feeders and wire mesh attachments.
Remains uncorrected.
3.30 REPEATWATERING.
There were still 7 water bottles with an accumulation of green material coating the inside of the water bottle. In
addition, the PVC piping around the nipples was coated with a large amount of wet brown debris both under the
nipple and on the outside of the pipe which would be difficult for the animals to avoid stepping on or contacting
when they try to drink from the nipples.
Failure to clean and sanitize water containers can result in disease spread and reduced potability of the water which
can reduce water intake and negatively impact the health of the animals.
Water containers must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the
animals.
3.31(a)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
Approximately half of the guinea pig enclosures had accumulations of soiled wet bedding with excess fecal material
and the pens were in need of more frequent cleaning. Additionally, all of the guinea pig enclosures had spiderwebs
present on the inside of the enclosures, adhered to the ceiling of the enclosure as well as the wire mesh on the
sides of the enclosures. Debris and bedding were observed to be mixed in with these spiderwebs.
Enclosures need to be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal
material and sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks. Failure to do so can have a negative impact on
animal health through the increase in disease. Correct by cleaning all enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
accumulations of fecal material and spiderwebs and by sanitizing at least once every two weeks.
3.31(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.
In the building housing the guinea pigs, there were accumulations of wet brown/yellow debris observed on the floor
of the building especially under the sink and desk. There was also hay and bedding scattered all across the floor of
the building.
Buildings and grounds need to be kept clean and in good repair. Failure to do so can have a negative impact on the
health of the animals by causing respiratory distress and other illnesses.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
