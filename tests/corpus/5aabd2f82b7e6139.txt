2.33(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Goat #20, a female Saanen, was thin with swollen carpal joints on both forelegs, and appeared to have difficulty
walking. Low body weight and swollen joints can indicate a serious disease issue. Goat #3, a Boer mix, had
overgrown hooves and was lame, as the animal was observed not putting full weight on the right hindleg when
standing. These animals must be examined by a veterinarian by close of business on March 2, 2018. All veterinary
documentation must be made available to APHIS personnel upon request.
Several of the goats and two sheep have overgrown hooves that will require trimming. These animals include
sheep #48 and #12, and goats #33, #25, #26, and #34. Overgrown hooves can lead to lameness and make
movement difficult. It can also stress ligaments and joints from the abnormal movement.
