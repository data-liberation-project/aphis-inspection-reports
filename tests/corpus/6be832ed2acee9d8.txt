In the "small dog building" red male Dachshund "Sam", microchip # 497-115-1616, had a brownish gray buildup on
the left and right sides of the mouth along the upper cheek teeth. There is an area about 2 by 3 inches in size
above and to the back of his right eye of thinning and patchy hair with small black to brown colored scabs. The
licensee said that she did not know what it was from, but assumed he had an injury that has now healed. The
health of the teeth can impact chewing and digestion, and overall health of the animal.
In the area storing vaccinations and medicines ready to use there is a bottle of Pyrantel Pamoate Suspension with
an expiration date of May 2014 a bottle of Safe-guard dewormer with an expiration date of May 2014, and
approximately eight vials of Duramune Max 5 vaccinations with expirations dates of July 5, 2015. The licensee
stated she vaccinated the nine puppies at the beginning of August 2015 with the expired vaccinations. Expired
medications can have unknown results and effectiveness on the animals.
