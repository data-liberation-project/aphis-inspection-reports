ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A facility representative was not available on 2/27/2014 between 11:00 am through 11:30 am to do a facility
inspection.
The inspector knocked on the front door of the residence, honked the horn of the GOV and called the telephone
number provided by the licensee with no response. The inspector waited in the driveway over 30 minutes.
