ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The Program of Veterinary Care states that Clostridium 8 way and tetanus vaccinations will be given annually to
the two reindeer. It also states that Panacur is to be given twice a year to the two reindeer.
The facility was unable to provide any veterinary records or documentation indicating that this preventative
treatment protocol is being followed by the facility.
The facility must follow the treatment plans provided by the attending veterinarian on the Program of Veterinary
Care. Failure to do so reduces the veterinarian's ability to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care. The
licensee shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.

2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The two reindeer cows, Bossy and Jingles, have excessively overgrown hooves due to a lack of routine hoof
trimming. Several of the toes on both reindeers are crossing and some of the dewclaws are making contact with the
ground. Facility records indicate that the last time the reindeer received hoof trimming was in November 2016.
Excessive hoof growth can lead to gait abnormalities which can cause a change in the toe joints and may contribute
to osteoarthritis, especially in older animals such as these. The facility must adhere to the plan it created which
states that the reindeer’s hooves will be trimmed twice a year. As part of the facility’s program of preventative
veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof care in a timely manner.

WATERING.
***There was an excessive buildup of green debris covering all of the interior surfaces of the only water receptacle
in the enclosure that contains two reindeer. The water was green and there were hundreds of insect larvae movingabout in the water.
Animals must be provided with clean, potable water to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain
adequate hydration.
Water receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. They should be cleaned at a frequency
that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
