ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Shih Tzu #008 had a buildup almost covering the left eye. Most of the eye appeared dark black in color. A
BB size lesion was located centrally on the surface of the eye. There was a black material dried around the eye.
The inside corner of the eye had a penny size matted mix of black material and hair covering most of the eye. The
lesions on the dogs eye could indicate an injury, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may be painful.
The licensee must have this dog seen by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are
made and that appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed.

FEEDING.
At least 6 food receptacles and a bulk container contained insects in the feed. There were 1/2 inch long worm like
insects and 1/4 inch beetle like insects crawling on the food in the feeders and bulk container. Insects contaminating
the food can cause an illness or injury to the dogs. All animals must be fed a food that is insect free. The dog food
containers must be cleaned more often. The dog food must be uncontaminated, wholesome, and palatable.
