3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Primary enclosures must be cleaned daily and then sanitized at least once every two weeks and more often if
needed to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, and other disease hazards.
The shelter in the outdoor enclosure that houses one lab dog has dirt, grease/grim, and debris that is inside of this
shelter. Grease/grim is along the sides, floor, and the extra sleeping box, inside of the shelter. The owner must
sanitize this shelter and put in place/maintain, a good cleaning and sanitizing program that helps to maintain a
disease free kennel area for this dog. Correct by 07-08-2016.
This inspection was conducted with the owner and Karl Thornton, ACI.
