Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The record of acquisition and dogs on hand form (APHIS form 7005) is not complete. The "Acquired From" column on the
updated APHIS form 7005 is blank.
Also, the licensee still did not have any records for the puppies that had been born and raised in the kennel.
Accurate and complete records are essential in keeping track of adult dogs and puppies in the kennel as well as following
them as they enter and exit the kennel. The licensee must make, keep and maintain records which correctly tracks all
animals in the kennel.

written program of veterinary care plan and make it available during inspections. Correct by 16 June 2022.
