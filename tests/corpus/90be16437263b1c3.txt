2.131(d)(3)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An adult lion and a 7-week-old tiger cub were on public exhibit at the facility. However, the facility employee who
had previously been approved by USDA for the care and handling of exhibited big cats is no longer employed by the
facility. Another employee had been put in charge of exhibiting the big cats, but his credentials regarding skills and
knowledge of big cats had not been submitted to USDA for approval. Inadequate training can compromise the
health of the animals as well as public and employee safety. The exhibitor must ensure that employees in contact
with and caring for exhibited big cats have adequate training, skills, and knowledge. The exhibitor must submit
information regarding employee(s) training and experience for exhibiting big cats to the USDA Animal Care
Regional Office for approval. The exhibitor can not exhibit big cats to the public until the employee(s) skills, training,
and knowledge have been approved by the USDA.
TO BE CORRECTED PRIOR TO FURTHER EXHIBITION OF BIG CATS AT THE FACILITY.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative on March 14, 2014.
