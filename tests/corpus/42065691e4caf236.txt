3.75(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A black and white ruffed lemur enclosure had a metal bar that was rusted, flaky and had jagged edges which can
also compromise the structural integrity of the enclosure.
Another enclosure had 2 protruding screws toward the inside of the enclosure and could be a hazard for the
primate if he/she pushed the enclosure wire mesh against the screws.
In order to maintain the structural strength of the enclosure and to prevent injury to animals housing facilities must
be kept in good repair.
To be corrected by 6-4-2015.
