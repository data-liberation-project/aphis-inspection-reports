2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a female Boxer (ID #05- Jasmine, brown and white/approx. 1.5yrs) that had both the right and left ears with
swollen, red and inflamed lining of the inner ears. There was a brown greasy material around the outside of the ear canal
in both ears. There were round scabs approximately 1/4 inch in diameter on the inside tips of both ears. This dog had a
moderate amount of light yellow slightly formed to liquid diarrhea in the outside run.

There was a female Boxer (ID #103, Sadie Girl, Black and white/ approx. 4 yrs old) that had thickening and darkened gray
skin on the inside of both ear flaps. There was a thin coating of crusty-flaky white debris overlaying the darkened skin.
There was a scab approx. 1/4 inch in diameter on the inside left ear near the tip. There were areas of hair loss and
thickened skin on both the right and left inner and outer ear flaps.

There was a female King Charles Cavalier Spaniel (ID #200, blenheim/liver/white) that had a buildup of moist, brown
material in both inner ear canals and there was redness/inflammation to the skin surrounding the entrance to the inner ear
canal. There was a superficial scab on the margin of both inner ears.


The licensee was not aware of the ear problems in any of the regulated animals. The veterinarian had not been contacted
for proper diagnosis or treatment of the ear conditions prior to the inspection.

Built up brown material in ears, hairloss, redness/inflammation, thickening, darkened skin, and scabbing can be possible
signs that there is a problem with the ears and the dogs are scratching and/or shaking their heads due to possible
discomfort, itching and irritation. The lack of timely veterinary care can cause a treatable condition to become chronic and
more severe.

-According to the monthly heartworm treatment documentation, all the dogs in the facility did not receive their monthly
heartworm treatment in June, August and September of 2022 which is not following their program of vet care.

The lack of monthly heartworm treatments could make the dogs susceptible to contracting heartworm, and the program of
vet care advises that heartworm treatments are given monthly.

The licensee must contact a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of any health issue on the regulated animals,
according to the AWA regulations and standards. The program of vet care or any treatment described by the attending
veterinarian must be followed according to their directions.

To be corrected by: The attending veterinarian was contacted during the inspection and treatment was prescribed.
3.13(a)(2)

Veterinary care for dogs.

The yearly head to toe complete physical veterinary examinations for all dogs in the facility were overdue by 4 months
(date of last physical was 6/2021).
The lack of yearly examinations by a veterinairian could prevent early identification of illnesses or other health related
problems.

A licensee must have a complete physical examination from head to tail of each dog by the attending veterinarian not less
than once every 12 months.

To be corrected by: The licensee contacted the attending veterinarian during the inspection and the exams are scheduled
for 11/6/2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
