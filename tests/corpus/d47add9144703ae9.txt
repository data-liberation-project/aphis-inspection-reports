2.38(f) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
Under protocol #18065, 8 hamsters were used in an imaging study, during which they are anesthetized and placed
on a heating pad. On three separate occasions, multiple hamsters have been burned, which resulted in tissue
damage, ranging from hairloss and redness to sloughing of an entire ear. On 4/27/18, it was noted that 2 of 3
hamsters that had been anesthetized on 4/24/18 had evidence of trauma to their ears. On 4/30/18, it was noted that
2 of 2 hamsters that had been anesthetized on 4/29/18 had evidence of trauma to their ears. Imaging was
discontinued until the cause, a shorted heating element, was isolated and corrected. However, on 6/16/18, it was
noted immediately after anesthesia that 1 hamster had a severely inflamed ear, and the next day, 4 of 5 hamsters
imaged on the same day showed evidence of tissue damage to their ears. Records indicate that corrective actions
include lowering the temperature of the heating pad for future studies and placing a barrier to protect the face and
ears from coming into close contact with the heating pad. In total, 6 hamsters suffered thermal injury to the face,
shoulder, and/or ears, of which, 2 were injured on 2 different occasions and 5 of the 6 hamsters sloughed at least
part of an ear. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that
does not cause trauma, thermal stress, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Correct from
this day forward.
3.28(a)(1) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On 6/22/18, hamster #86, from protocol #18065, was found non-weight bearing on her right hind leg. She was
anesthetized and examined and determined to have multiple fractures in her leg. She was euthanized at the
attending vet’s recommendation. Because there is no documented handling between the last health check and the
health check when the swollen leg was discovered, it was determined that she injured herself on the wire cage
structure. Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the hamsters from
injury. Correct from this day forward.
No regulated species were present at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC Administrator.
