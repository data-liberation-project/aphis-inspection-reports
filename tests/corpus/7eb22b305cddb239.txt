Feeding.
The shed holding the grain for the two elk was missing a cover on the roof. Rain from recent days had soaked some of
the grain causing wet and white moldy grain in an approximate area of one foot by one foot.
The food is not being stored in a way that keeps it wholesome, palatable, and free of contamination. The facility must
ensure the food is wholesome, palatable, and free of contamination at all times.
This was corrected at the time of inspection.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within two more inspection(s) or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and must wait 6
months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
