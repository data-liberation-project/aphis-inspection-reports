ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 0920 on

Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the door. I then called the contact number provided and left a message and
waited for thirty minutes.
End of report.
