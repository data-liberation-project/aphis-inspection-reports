Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Bichon “Mabel” (no official identification) was examined and found to have brown tartar buildup covering the entire
surface on the left upper and lower cheek teeth. The left lower rear cheek tooth was loose and moved easily when
touched by the inspector. The gums around the left upper and lower cheek teeth are receding and inflamed. There is
tooth root exposure of the left upper cheek teeth. There was light brown tartar buildup covering the entire surface on the
right upper and lower cheek teeth. The gums were reddened on at least one lower cheek tooth on the right side.

Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues. This dog must be
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and
treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that
all dogs receive adequate veterinary care.

The facility has several medications and various products that are expired. These products may or may not have been
used on the dogs past its expiration dates. Some of the products found was Carprofen (expired 18-December-21), Keto-

Chlor medicated shampoo (expired April-2014), LickGuard Ointment (expired 28-July-2019).

Expired medical products may lose their effectiveness and may not assist the animals in recovery from illness and injury
or could leave the animals without proper protection against parasites and other diseases.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and prevent diseases and injuries. The facility
must ensure that all medical products are current and have not expired in order to support the health and well-being of the
dogs.

2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
The facility uses microchips placed under the dog’s skin as the official form of identification. At least 27 dogs over 16
weeks of age are currently not microchipped, nor identified by any other means (official USDA tag number or tattoo).

Official identification is necessary for APHIS officials to positively identify animals for inspection or under treatment and to
properly trace their movements.

All live dogs shall be identified by an official tag affixed to a collar around the animal’s neck, by a legible tattoo marking
approved by the Administrator, or by a microchip placed under the dog’s skin. The licensee must apply one of the forms of
identification on each dog. The licensee must ensure that all dogs have an official form of identification at all times.

2.50(a)(2)

Time and method of identification.
The facility documents the acquisition information for puppies born at the facility on a calendar, which doesn’t contain an
official identification number assigned to each puppy. There are currently 16 puppies under the age of 16 weeks with no
official identification number.

The official USDA identification number is necessary for APHIS officials to identify animals and trace their movements.

Each dealer shall identify all puppies less than 16 weeks of age on the premises with an plastic type collar with the
required information legibly written, a collar and tag, a distinctive and legible tattoo, a microchip or a cage card.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility sold 59 puppies since March 2021, but there is no unique official identification number on APHIS form 7006 for
each dog.

The official USDA identification number is necessary for APHIS officials to identify animals and trace their movements.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records that fully disclose the official identification number of each animal.

The facility must ensure that the acquisition and disposition records for each puppy contains a unique identification
number.

The facility is keeping track of dogs housed on the property on a spreadsheet. 31 of the 32 dogs counted by the inspector
was listed on the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet is missing the address of the facility the dog originated from, acquisition
date, disposition date and the official identification for several dogs.

Record of acquisition information on the Record of Acquisition of Dogs (APHIS form 7005) is necessary for APHIS
officials to identify animals and to trace their movements.

The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose all information concerning
each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control,
or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The licensee must record
the acquisition information for all 32 adult dogs. The licensee must ensure all required information is properly and
accurately documented at all times on the Record of Acquisition of Dogs (APHIS form 7005).

Housing facilities, general.

4 enclosures housing a total of 5 adult dogs had metal framing around the dog doors that was found to be in disrepair.
The metal framing is rusted and several corners have been pulled off the wall partially creating sharp points within the
primary enclosure.

Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept in
good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury.

The facility must remove the sharp points from the enclosures in order to protect the dogs from injury. The licensee must
maintain all enclosures in good repair and ensure that the housing conditions are safe for the dogs at all times.

To be corrected by: 16-March-2022.

The rubber grated flooring of at least 4 enclosures, each housing one adult dog, was found to be sagging in the middle
creating an approximate 8 inch wide by 2 inch high gap between the floor and the wall separating dog enclosures. This
gap between the flooring and wall is large enough large enough for the dogs to stick their head or a limb under the wall
and into another dog’s enclosure.

Enclosures that do not contain the dog and all their limbs in the enclosure may cause injury to the dog’s feet or legs.
Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed so that they protect the dogs and cats from injury, contain the
animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering the enclosure. The facility must ensure that the enclosures are
constructed and maintained so that the enclosures can safely contain the dogs at all times.

Housing facilities, general.
The facility has an assortment of clutter taking up the majority of the grooming area within the adult dog building. The
clutter consisted of an accumulation of dog hair clippings, empty dog food bags, empty treat containers, blankets, towels
and miscellaneous grooming products.

Clutter stored in animal areas could accumulate dust and dirt and could attract vermin. Animal and food storage areas
inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter to ensure the animal’s overall health and well-being.

The facility must remove the clutter from the food storage area and must ensure that all housing areas remain free from
clutter at all times.

Exercise for dogs.
The facility could not produce an exercise plan that had been reviewed or approved by the attending veterinarian at the
time of inspection.

A complete exercise plan that has been approved by the attending veterinarian is important to ensure the dogs are
receiving adequate space and exercise to support their health and well-being.


The licensee must develop an appropriate plan that provides all dogs with the opportunity to exercise and have it
approved by the attending veterinarian.

3.9(b)

Feeding
At least 2 enclosures each housing 1 adult male dog had significant buildup of dark brown organic material in the tray of
their self feeders. When the inspector asked the facility about the cleaning and sanitizing schedule, they stated the
feeders are not easily removed from the enclosure so they are not cleaned or sanitized every 2 weeks.

Feeding receptacles that are not sanitized at least once every 2 weeks pose a risk of the dog contracting a disease and
threaten the health and well-being of the dogs.

Used food receptacles must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease hazards. The facility must sanitize all food and water
receptacles at least once every two weeks or more often if necessary.

To be corrected by: 18-March-2022.
3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

Two locations in the indoor portion of the adult dog building had evidence of an ineffective pest control program. Rodent
feces were present in the drainage trough in the adult dog room and a large accumulation of feces were on top of a
bucket in the dog grooming area. The facility has glue traps outside of the dog room and rodent poison outside of this
building.

Failure to control pests can cause contamination of food sources and increase the risk of disease hazards towards the
dogs.

An effective program for the control of insects, birds and mammals that are pests, must be established and maintained.
The licensee must establish a program for the control of rodents and ensure that the plan remains effective at all times.
