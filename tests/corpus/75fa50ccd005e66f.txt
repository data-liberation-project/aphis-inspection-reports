Diagnosing and Treatment
A chinchilla (ID# "S68") in the back room was found by inspectors to be holding its front leg up. The licensee
removed it from its enclosure so we could evaluate it and the licensee noticed the right front leg was trapped inside
of its collar. The licensee freed the leg from the collar which revealed an open wound that had some white and
yellow discharge and also crusty material around it in the fur. These are signs that the wound was not fresh and
that the leg had not been entrapped just recently. This animal also had red sores on the back of its hind legs.
These conditions had not been identified by the licensee. Failure to identify injuries can lead to pain, sickness, or
the death of animals. This chinhilla's injury and sores must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian and a
treatment plan must be available for inspectors if requested. Correct by

Observation
A chinchilla (ID# "S68") in the back room was found by inspectors to be holding its front leg up. After being asked
by the inspectors, the licensee took it out of its cage and realized its front right leg was entrapped in its collar. The
nature of the wound observed on the leg that was entrapped suggested that it had been entrapped longer than a
day. Lack of close daily observations of animals can lead to injuries and sicknesses that are not treated in a timely
manner. A routine of observing each animal on a daily basis must be developed and maintained so that problems
such as but no limited to injuries and sicknesses can be corrected promptly. Correct by

3.125(a) DIRECT REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
REPEAT
Several enclosures were noted as having jagged, rusty points sticking out towards the chinchillas caused by
damage in the front metal wire walls of the enclosures. One enclosure had significant damage in one of the walls
causing sharp wire ends to stick out in multiple directions and giving the animal within a possible means of escaping
its enclosure. Direct injury and infection can occur by exposing animals to sharp or rusted objects. The front metal
wire walls were repaired in the presence of the inspectors. The animal in the damaged enclosure was moved to
another enclosure during the inspection.
DIRECT/REPEAT
Enclosures housing 188 adult Chinchillas contained a tray on the floor in the past which the animals had direct
contact with. These trays have since been removed, exposing 1 inch by 1 inch metal wire flooring underneath.
Other enclosures in the back room have always had 1 inch 1 inch flooring. The flooring does not protect the
animals from injury, as the gaps between the wire are much larger than the feet of the chinchillas. Materials that
come in contact with the animals must protect the animals from injury. Ensure that the enclosures are structurally
sound and maintained appropriately.
3.126(c)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Lighting
There is a section in the back right hand side of the facility housing approximately 30 animals which does not have
adequate lighting and a flashlight had to be used to properly inspect some animals and enclosures. Without
adequate lighting, there is no way to conduct daily observations of the animals and enclosures. Adequate lighting
must be available in areas where animals are present. Repair or replace equipment so that animals are given
adequate access to lighting. Correct by

WATERING. Water Receptacles
There continues to be sections of the outside of the watering line that has an excessive buildup of hair, cobwebs,
and excreta built up on them. Eight glass bottles throughout the facility have a greenish haze on the inside of the
receptacle. Unclean water receptacles can contaminate the water supply which can make many animals sick. All
watering receptacles must be cleaned or replaced in order to assure a clean supply of water to the animals.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures
There continues to be an excessive accumulation of excreta underneath the watering ports in at least 7 of the
primary enclosures currently occupied with animals. There is an accumulation of dust, animal hair and matter on
the tops of many of the dust houses in the facility. There is also a large buildup of used shavings on the floor of the
left side of the facility where the enclosures were cleaned but the dirty bedding has not yet been moved out. The
facility failed to maintain the primary caging of these animals in a sanitary condition. Unsanitary conditions can lead
to biological disease hazards and can affect the comfort of the animals as well as their health and well-being.
Eliminate the buildup of waste material in and around primary enclosures and maintain facility in a clean and
sanitary condition.
Exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
