FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(d) perimeter fence. on or after may 17, 2000, all outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must
be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. fences
less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals, such as, but not limited to, large felines (e.g., lions, tigers,
leopards, cougars, etc.), bears, wolves, rhinoceros, and elephants, or less than 6 feet high for other animals must
be approved in writing by the administrator. the fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the
facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the
animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. it
must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals
inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. such fences less than 3 feet in distance
from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the administrator.
A perimeter fence of at least 8 feet tall and constructed of materials that would contain adult lions needs to be
extended form the present perimeter fence to encircle the outside lion exercise pens. A perimeter fence functions
as secondary containment and prevents animals or humans from approaching the main enclosure. This increases
safety for the animals contained within the fence and the viewing public.
