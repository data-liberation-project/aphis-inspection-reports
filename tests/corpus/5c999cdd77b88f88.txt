3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage and waste disposal.
The indoor housing facility has waste removal drains that run from the animal enclosures to outlets in the wall
and/or floor. In two corners of the housing facility there is feces, urine and/or staining on the walls adjacent to the
drains. There is a build-up of animal waste on the floor in each corner and/or surrounding the drains on the floor.
Drainage systems that don't function properly can contribute to disease hazards, odors and pests. All drains must
be properly constructed, installed, and maintained in order to minimize fecal and urine contamination, vermin and
pest infestation, insects, odors, and other disease hazards.
