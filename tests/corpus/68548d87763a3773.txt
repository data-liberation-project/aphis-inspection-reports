An adult male sable domestic ferret had reddish brown dry scabs and patchy hair loss over the right shoulder blade
and neck. The first area was approximately 0.5 inch by 0.5 inch in size and was located over the right shoulder
blade. The second area was approximately 0.5 inch by 0.5 inch and was located over the back of the neck. Facility
owner indicated that this animal had been acquired approximately 4-5 days earlier as part of a pair, and that both
ferrets were placed in the enclosure with another adult ferret. Facility owner indicated that no scabs or hair loss had
been noted on this animal.
Daily observation of all animals is important to ensure that conditions that can negatively affect health and
well-being are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or
behavior should be communicated to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be used to ensure
adequate care. Injuries or diseases that not treated properly may be painful and can lead to infection or other
veterinary care health problems. The facility must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries.
At the time of inspection, the animal was placed in a separate enclosure and the facility owner agreed to contact the
attending veterinarian promptly.

address at minimum social and environmental enrichment for the nonhuman primates, and must be approved by the
attending veterinarian. Correct by March 1, 2020.
