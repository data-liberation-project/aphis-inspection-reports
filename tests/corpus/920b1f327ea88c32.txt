3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On April 15, 2019, a two year old female black bear was shot dead by a local sheriff after it escaped from its
enclosure. A power outage occurred at the facility from April 14th from about 9:00 PM until about 6:00 AM on April
15th. Two of the five bears housed in the yearling bear enclosure were able to climb out of the enclosure by scaling
the 10’ foot primary fence and the 8’ perimeter fence. They were discovered missing at about 10:00 AM on the
morning of April 15th. One bear was tranquilized and returned to its enclosure without incident. The other bear was
shot by the local sheriff approximately ½ mile away. At the time of the power outage there was no emergency
power generator backup for the yearling enclosure. All enclosures now have emergency power generator back up.
Enclosures must be constructed and maintained to contain the animals and protect them from injury. Maintain all
enclosures to contain the bears.
