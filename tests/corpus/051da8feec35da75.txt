INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC functions.
At the time of USDA inspection, it was noted that there were four 3 yr old female macaques on the protocol that had
been singly housed at the facility for approximately 6 months while on a training phase of the study, not yet on the
testing phase of the study that, according to protocol, could preclude social housing. The IACUC must note such
departures from the AWA during the semi-annual inspection for the well-being of the animals and determine a plan
and schedule for correction.
Correct before the next semi-annual facility inspection.
The inspection was conducted on Dec 1 & 2, 2015 with an exit briefing on Dec 8 with a facility representative.
