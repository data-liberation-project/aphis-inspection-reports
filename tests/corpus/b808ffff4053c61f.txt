WATERING.
An enclosure containing two pigs and an enclosure containing eight pigs had water receptacles containing a layer of
green algae scum with algae floating in the water. The enclosure containing a mini-cow and a goat had a water
receptacle with a layer of algae scum lining its interior. The water receptacle for an enclosure containing three pigs
had a very small amount of water with mud in it. These water receptacles must be cleaned more frequently.
Unclean water could be contaminated with fecal material which could lead to internal parasite problems. It may also
not be as palatable which could cause the animals not to consume enough for optimal health.

SANITATION.
The shelter for the enclosure housing the mini-cow and the sheep and the shelter for the enclosure housing the
zebu each contained an excessive buildup of fecal material. When the animals lay down in these shelters their
coats can become contaminated with this fecal material. They can then ingest this material while grooming.
Ingestion of fecal material can lead to parasite and disease problems. These shelters must be cleaned on a more
frequent basis to prevent possible health issues for the animals using them.
