INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On the facility semiannual inspection report, there is a list of "areas of concern" from the IACUC. However, there is
no indication of the severity of these "concerns", nor is there a correction date or plan for any of these. These
semiannual reports must distinguish any deviations from the animal welfare act, must distinguish minor from
significant deficiencies, and must assign a reasonable correction date for any deficiencies.
Correct from this date forward.
