ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***One of the female sheep has an abnormal left eye. The eye is cloudy and has an overall pinkish tinge to it. There
is discharge coming out of the left eye. The sheep is able to open both eyes normally. The licensee stated that she
had not noticed this problem prior to the inspection and the animal had not been evaluated by a veterinarian for this
problem.
The licensee must consult a veterinarian about this sheep by November 9, 2016, to obtain accurate diagnoses and
appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided, in
writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic
tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, as well as any medications prescribed
along with the dosing instructions. The licensee must provide documentation of entries on a log and/or calendar
and/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the animals.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of the animal
at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and the
need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are observed daily and provided with
adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The
program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
***Three goats have overgrown hooves due to lack of routine hoof trimming.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries.
As part of the facility’s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive
appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.These three animals need to have their hooves trimmed by November 15, 2016.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with licensee and VMO Dominique Engel.
