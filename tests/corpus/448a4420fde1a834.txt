2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One capuchin monkey had several overgrown nails on both feet. The longest nails were approximately one to two
inches in length.
Excessively long nails may become caught in or damaged by enclosure surfaces such as flooring, welded wire
panels, or furniture-type fixtures resulting in broken nails and/or possible injuries to the feet. Such injuries may be
painful to the animal. The facility should ensure that staff members are monitoring animals so that routine nail care
may be provided when necessary.
This non-compliant item was corrected at the time of the inspection.
2.126(c)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Staff at the facility stated that the licensee had been exhibiting a chimpanzee at another location for the past four or
five days and was uncertain as to when the licensee and animal would return to the facility. No current itinerary has
been received by USDA-APHIS-Animal Care.
In the case of traveling exhibitors, itineraries must be submitted to USDA via fax, mail, or electronic mail at least two
days prior to any overnight travel. The itinerary should contain complete and accurate information concerning the
whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. The
submission of itineraries allows USDA to conduct inspections in order to assess the welfare of the animals both at
home and while traveling. Current itineraries should be submitted to USDA in a timely manner.
Correct from this time forward for any future overnight travel.
3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL. A perch in the chimpanzee enclosure was in significant disrepair. The perch consisted of a worn wooden board
bolted to a metal frame. The board had deep cracks and the long edges were wavy and irregular. Several bolts and
a piece of unidentified broken metal hardware protruded from the frame where it appeared that other boards had
been attached at some point. Two chimpanzees were using the perch during the inspection.
Deep cracks and grooves in wooden items cannot be readily cleaned and protruding metal items may injure the
animals. The surfaces of housing facilities--including perches, shelves, swings, boxes, houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures or objects within the facility--must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that
allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. Enclosures should be
routinely monitored for defects and repairs should be made in a timely manner.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The top of one of two large wooden boxes in the lion exercise area was in disrepair. A hole in the wood allowed light
to shine into the interior of the box. One male lion was in the enclosure at the time of the inspection and a staff
member stated that the other lions also used the enclosure. The staff member also stated that the lions would
normally jump onto the top of both boxes but did not jump onto the one with the hole because they knew it was not
safe to do so.
Animals may become injured jumping onto broken structures. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall
be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
