ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The available Program Of Veterinary Care was dated 9-25-14. This program has not been updated in over three
years. Additionally, there was no Signature sheet available to indicate the number of physical visits to the facility by
the attending veterinarian. A fully documented Program of Veterinary Care, addressing all of the required sections,
must be completed by the attending veterinarian and signed by both the veterinarian and owner.
Written programs of veterinary care are necessary to indicate the once yearly facility visits and care that is to be
provided to the wolf/hybrids maintained at this facility.

3.1(a) REPEATHOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ARE IN NEED OF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT:
1. The floor of the rear shelter building now has a full metal dig guard (fence panel) totally exposed on the interior
portion of the earthen floor. Legs, feet and toe pads could get caught between the openings causing injury. This
panel must be covered to protect the wolf/hybrid's feet and legs from injury.
2. Upon entrance into the main enclosure, there are exposed metal points of the dig guard present. The wolf/hybrid
shave access to these points and they could injure themselves on the sharp points. These exposed areas must be
covered to prevent injury.
3. One plank is missing on the raised platform in Winona and Mac's enclosure. The screws that held down the
plank are now exposed and could caused injury to the wolf/hybrids. The plank must be repaired to maintain
structural strength and to protect the wolf/hybrids from injury.
4. The top plank (2 x 4), on the rear gate of the exercise pen, is broken. Additionally, the metal fence panel is also
dented in this same area. These damaged areas of the gate must be repaired to main structural strength.
5. Broken, metal trim is present on all four corners of the green dog house. These damaged area could cause injury
to the wolf/hybrids. This trim must be replaced to maintain structural strength and to keep the dog house in good
repair.
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside of the refrigerator, two bags of cheese cubes are stored directly on top of an open bag of raw chicken. The
bag of raw chicken had bloody liquid in the bottom of the bag. The cheese cubes are used as treats and can be
contaminated by the raw chicken. All open supplies of food items must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly
fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.
2. Due to a malfunctioning door seal, a can of Thompson's Water Seal is maintained on top of the small chest
freezer in order to weigh down the lid. This freezer contains chicken parts for the feeding of the wolf/hybrids. This
chemical could potentially contaminate the food maintained inside. Chemicals shall not be stored or maintained
above food items.
