SANITATION.
The bottom support board on the feed and grain shed door was missing. This created approximately a 4 inch gap,
which could allow pests to enter the shed. This could potentially cause the food storage area and the food and hay
stored within to become contaminated. Facilities need to be kept in good repair in order to protect the health of the
animals.
********This door has since been repaired.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
