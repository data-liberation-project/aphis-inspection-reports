PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are four capuchins in two metal enclosures, two per enclosure. These metal enclosures measure 27 inches
by 27 inches by 30 inches high. These provide 5.06 square feet of floor space. Under the Animal Welfare Act
capuchins fall under Group 2 primates in the space requirements requiring 3 square feet each and 30 inches of
height. For two capuchins, 6 square feet of floor space is required. Therefore, these enclosures are 1 square foot
short of the minimum space requirements for when stopped at locations for exhibiting.
A minimum of three square feet of floor space per capuchin needs to be provided. The owner is in the process of
designing caging for a new transport vehicle. These space requirements were discussed for the new vehicle.
