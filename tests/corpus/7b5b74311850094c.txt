ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In January 2016, approximately 1 week after a study procedure was done on a chinchilla, the animal was noted to
be sick. The veterinary staff initiated treatment and directed the PI staff to continue treatments on the animal over
the weekend. The veterinary staff noted that the treatments had not occurred as directed. The PI staff has been
notified and corrective measures have been instituted to prevent recurrence of such an incident. This incident has
not recurred since January and was reported by the facility to USDA and OLAW.
This item has been addressed.
An exit briefing was conducted with facility representatives on May 26, 2016
