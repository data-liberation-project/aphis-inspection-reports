Watering.
- In the pasture containing 3 sheep, no water was present. The facility representative stated that they were moved to the
pasture at around 9 AM. When water was placed in the pasture at the request of the inspector at around 12:30 PM, 2 of
the 3 sheep drank continuously for approximately 30 seconds.
- In the outdoor pen containing the female pig named Martha, no water was present. The facility representative stated that
she had been moved to the pen at around 9 AM. When water was placed in the pen at the request of the inspector at
around 12:30 PM, she drank continuously for approximately 30 seconds.
- In the enclosure containing 4 pigs, the two outdoor water receptacles had a layer of brown sediment covering the
bottom.

to the animals. Water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal and all water
receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).


A female cow named Willow and all 3 sheep at the facility have overgrown claws on the front and hind feet.

veterinary care that includes appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries shall be
established and maintained.

Facilities, general.
In the enclosure housing 4 pigs, the doors to enter the barn are not large enough to allow the pigs to enter without
scraping their sides. On the outside of the doorway, the metal siding is peeling away and creating sharp edges. Ernie, a
male pig, has shallow scrapes on both shoulders and sides as well as on his left hip and rump. When asked about these
wounds, the facility representative said that they were from using the entrances to the barn and from rubbing on the
doorways.
Inadequately sized doorways and sharp edges are causing injury to the animals within this enclosure. All enclosures shall
be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
TO BE CORRECTED BY 19 MARCH 2021.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
In the section of the barn containing food for the animals, there are excessive amounts of rodent droppings covering the
floor around the food bins and on top of the storage containers. Multiple live mice were seen running across the floor. This
barn also houses 3 sheep, 6 pigs, and 1 goat. There is currently no pest control program in place at the facility.
Rodents can spread disease and contaminate food intended for animals. A safe and effective program of pest control


must be established and maintained to mitigate the effects of mammalian pests.
TO BE CORRECTED BY 26 MARCH 2021.
3.127(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
In the pasture containing 3 sheep, there is no shelter provided.
Shelter from the elements is necessary to provide protection and comfort for the animal. The facility shall provide natural
