A white, adult female Chihuahua ID # 0A01474835 had a haunched posture and walked with her back legs close
together in a tucked position. The kennel staff stated that the dog had looked that way for approximately two months
and that she had alerted the licensee to the unusual behavior but no action was taken. During further evaluation of
the animal it was evident that the rear section of her mammary area was enlarged. In addition the left rear section
had golf ball size mass. The kennel staff stated that the dog was not bred and had not had puppies recently.
Abnormal behavior, altered posture and swollen tissue indicate the animal may have a medical condition and/or is in
pain. The licensee shall ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care. The licensee shall obtain a written
diagnosis and treatment plan from a licensed veterinarian within 48 hours and provide care as prescribed.
** This NCI was identified during the inspection and the licensee was notified that the animal would need to be seen
by a vet within 48 hours.
There were two dogs at the facility with matted unkempt hair coats. The gray and white male ID # 0A01451969 had
long facial hair that covered his eyes. He had large mats covering his body with tight matting on his legs. The white
female poodle ID # 0A01473961 also had dangling mats from his face and body with tight matting on his rear legs.
Matted hair and unkempt hair coats can effect the dogs vision, cause discomfort and itching and may lead to
serious skin conditions, The licensee shall provide adequate veterinary care which includes routine grooming and
hair coat maintenance. A proactive approach should be taken so that mats do not form.

3.1 (e) Storage
There were roaches living inside the gray plastic tote used to store adult dog food. The licensee had a lid on the tote
however, roaches were able to fit through the space in between the lid and tote. Roaches can spread disease and
have contaminated the food intended for the adult dogs at the facility. The licensee shall ensure all open supplies of
food are kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage. TO BE

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
3.11(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
There was standing water in the animal area of the sheltered building housing adult dogs. The building is
constructed of a metal grated floor with coated wire over the top of it. This leaves approximately a 2 inch space that
is used to carry wash down water under each enclosure. The drain at the end of the facility is not functioning
properly and the last 5 enclosures of the facility had standing wash down water above the coated wire. This
exposes the animals to all of the material and contaminated cleaning water from the rest of the enclosures in the
facility. The contaminated water may spread bacteria and disease and does not provide a clean dry environment for
the animals to seek shelter from the outdoors. The licensee shall ensure standing water is removed from the
primary enclosures and that the animals are protected from being contaminated with water and other wastes during
cleaning. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 8/17/14
