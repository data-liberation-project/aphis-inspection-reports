ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:05-3:35pm
on 27-OCT-16.
I knocked on the door, rang the doorbell and left a message at the facility phone number. The licensee called me
back on October 28 to inform me that they were away at the time I was there.
