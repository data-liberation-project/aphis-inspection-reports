PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
***The primary enclosure used to transport 1 Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was not of adequate height for flight
633. The Animal Care Veterinary Medical Officer and Animal Care Inspector observed that the animal was
approximately 1 in. taller than the primary enclosure. It must be ensured that primary enclosures used for
transporting animals have enough space to ensure that animals can turn about normally while standing, to stand
and sit erect, and to lie in a natural position.

FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
***The primary enclosure used to transport 1 Cavalier King Charles Spaniel did not contain the required food and
water dishes. Food and water receptacles must be securely attached inside the primary enclosure and places so
that the receptacles can be filled from outside the enclosure without opening the door.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted in terminal 2 with the Veterinary Medical Officer, Animal Care
Inspector and shift supervisor.
