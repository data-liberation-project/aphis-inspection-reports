INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***Changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities are not always being reported to the IACUC
before the changes occur. According to medical records, on 5/14/15, a male Labrador retriever named "Argos"
underwent 3 separate urinary catheter placements by 3 separate students. The IACUC approved teaching protocol
for urinary catheter placement states the following: "Number of attempts allotted per animal: One attempt per animal
is allowed", "Number of students per animal: One student is permitted to attempt this procedure". According to the
approved protocol, only 1 student was allowed to make 1 attempt at the placement.
Unapproved significant changes to the protocol could result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animal's
welfare at risk. Any significant changes to the approved protocol must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC
prior to implementing the changes.
To be corrected by 7/24/15.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility's program director.
