FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are three detached boards/rails on the fence separating the two pastures. In addition, there is bent and
mangled wire on one section of the fence where a board is detached. Enclosures must be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to prevent escape. The detached boards and
mangled wire must be repaired, replaced, or removed to prevent injury to the animals. Correct by April 2, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
