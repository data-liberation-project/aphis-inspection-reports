ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following dogs were cited under 2.40 (b)(2) on the inspection report dated June 06, 2016 and were not
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian as required on the inspection report. The licensee did attempt to clean the
teeth of these dogs (#84 and #78) on his own.
One adult, female, Yorkshire terrier ("Little Daisy", Tag #32, DOB 2008) has hair-loss on both ears. Nearly all of the
hair is gone on both ears and both ears are moderately thickened and dark in color. There is dark scabs/crusting on
the inside and outside of both ears.
One adult, female, Yorkshire terrier ("Fluffy", Tag #84) has hair-loss on both ears and had severe dental tartar.
Nearly all of the hair was gone on both ears. Both ears were mildly thickened with dark scabs/crusting present on
the surface of the skin. The severe dental tartar covered nearly all of the remaining front and cheek teeth. In some
areas the gums were pulled back from the teeth and there was a creamy white discharge present along the
gumline. One of the upper left front teeth was severely loose and moved when the dog stuck her tongue against the
tooth. The licensee removed a significant amount of tartar from this dog's teeth himself.
One adult, female Yorkshire terrier (ID #78) has a buildup of a thick dark brown tartar encasing the entire surface of
the cheek teeth and the majority of the upper canine tooth on the left side of the mouth. A light brown tartar was
encasing the entire surface of the upper and lower cheek teeth and the majority of the upper canine tooth on the
right side of the mouth. The gums are moderately reddened and a creamy white substance is located along the
gum line of the upper left cheek teeth.
One adult, female, Maltese ("Dolly", Tag #82) had severe dental tartar. The severe dental tartar covered nearly all of
the remaining cheek teeth and part of each front tooth and canine. The gums were severely red and swollen and in
some areas the gums were pulled back from the teeth with a creamy white discharge present along the gumline.
The inspectors observed this dog excessively licking. The licensee removed a significant amount of tartar from this
dog's teeth himself.

licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be
documented and available to the inspectors upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate
veterinary care at all times.
