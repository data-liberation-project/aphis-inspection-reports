3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Section 3.53(a)(1) Primary enclosure: Two of the rabbits had broken wires at the bottom of their self-feeders in their
enclosures. The wire ends may cause injury to the mouth/face of the rabbits when they eat. Primary enclosures,
including food and water receptacles, must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
rabbits from injury. Once the APHIS official identified the damaged self-feeders, the owner removed the feeders
from the enclosures to replace them. Corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
