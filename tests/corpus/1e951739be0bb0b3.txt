HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The inspector observed a bag of dog food that was ripped open in the storage area. The feed spilled along the sides
and bottom of the pallet. A feral cat was visualized running along the back wall and behind the feed pallet. The
facility representative stated that cats had ripped open the bag of food.
Food that is not properly stored and protected from wild animals has an increased potential of becoming
contaminated. Contaminated food supplies can affect the health of the dogs.
The licensee must store the food supplies in a manner that protects them from wild animals, spoilage,
contamination and vermin infestation. In addition, all open bags of food must be kept in a leak-proof container with
tightly fitting lids.
