of dental issues.

2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The licensee identified a female Bichon # 108 on 5/25 as having a skin issue but has not contact the vet to
communicate and provide timely information. When the dog was looked at, it flinched when the area was touched
as if the contact was painful. The vet needs to be contacted and the dog assessed for proper diagnosis and
potential treatment options.
*** A 6 week old Boston puppy # 1930 was thin and was observed closer, would not open her right eye. When theeye was opened, a small amount of pus was observed. This animal's condition should be communicated to the vet
for diagnosis and treatment options.
*** During the inspection, a litter of puppies was observed with one appearing to be the runt and slightly away from
the other puppies. When the puppy was picked up, it was not breathing and was cold to the touch. The licensee
stated he had observed the dogs in the kennel that morning and two other individuals were working in the kennel
during the inspection process, but none had noticed the puppy was deceased. The manner of daily observation and
then communication to the veterinarian needs to be addressed to catch health issues earlier and for the health of
the animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** An open bag of bedding was being stored in an empty enclosure in the main kennel. Once bags of bedding are
opened, they must be stored in a leak proof container with a tightly fitting lid to protect the supplies from
contamination.

3.6(a)(2)(iii) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** The current outside runs are gravel floor with wire mesh along the sides. The wire mesh is not buried and the
dogs are able to dig underneath into adjacent enclosures. During the inspection, a male apricot poodle # 2771 was
digging and going underneath the wire between enclosures 2 and 3. This could be potentially hazardous to the dog.
These outdoor enclosures must be constructed to contain the dogs securely and keep other animals from entering
their enclosures. This needs to be addressed for the safety of the dogs.
3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
*** For several of the smaller breeds of dogs, the feeders are several feet off the ground making it necessary for the
dogs to continually jump up to access food or potentially jump into the feeder. These food receptacles must be
readily accessible for the various sizes of dogs for their comfort and well being. At the time of the inspection, a litter
of 6 week old puppies did not have access to puppy food, as the feeder was too high. One female puppy # 1930
was thin with ribs visible. These puppies should have access to a food bowl on the ground to assure accessibility for
all dogs in the enclosure.3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The enclosure housing nine Boston Terrier puppies had wet bedding all along the side walls of the enclosure.
Three puppies were huddled against a corner seeming cold, while sitting on wet bedding 2 inches deep. These
enclosures need to be spot cleaned daily and have additional dry bedding to prevent the animals from being soiled.

3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Currently the feeders are only being wiped down with a cloth and not being sanitized. The feeders have a layer
of grime and debris underneath the lip where the dogs eat from. These feeders need to be cleaned and sanitized at
least once every two weeks to reduce this accumulation and for the health of the dogs.
