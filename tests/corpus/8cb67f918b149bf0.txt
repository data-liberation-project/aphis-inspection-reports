3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In barrier #6 there were enclosures containing female dogs with nursing puppies which were observed without
proper support to prevent the puppies feet from falling through the mesh floors. The blankets which are normally
kept in the enclosures had been removed during cleaning, however there was no additional surface which was
provided which would prevent the puppies feet from falling through the open spaces of the grate. A surface needs to
be provided at all times in order to prevent the puppies feet from falling through the mesh floors thereby preventing
possible injury. The facility needs to correct this issue.
