3.6(a)(2)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One primary enclosure containing two adult dogs was found to have the metal threshold between the indoor and
outdoor portions of the enclosure in disrepair. This threshold had broken and bent in toward the enclosure and
contained multiple sharp points. These points had small tufts of hair attached indicating that the animals were
snagging the threshold as they went between the indoor and outdoor. This broken threshold may cause injury to
the dogs and the area is difficult to appropriately clean and sanitize with the bent and broken metal. Primary
enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the dogs from injury.
