3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The primary enclosure used as a day exhibit for the two black bears has walls which are constructed of solid
concrete and glass. Two sections of wall are constructed of chain link fencing for additional public viewing
opportunities. The facility does not have an 8 foot high perimeter fence surrounding this primary enclosure as
required for all dangerous animals.
A perimeter fence is necessary to provide a secondary containment system in case of escape and to prevent
unwanted persons and animals from having contact with the animals in the enclosure. For the safety and well-being
of both the public and the bears this perimeter fence must be in place or written approval must be obtained from the
Administrator.
