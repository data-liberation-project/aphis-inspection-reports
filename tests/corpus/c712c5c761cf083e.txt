2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(a)(1) Veterinary care: The two written Programs of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility lack specific
guidance for the care of animals. There is no specific guidance for the parasite control of various species, only a list
of drugs. Species specific dosing and route is not included for any species or drug in either PVC. There is no
specific clinic or veterinarian specified for emergency care. For capture and restraint method there is listed only
chemical restraint with no species specific drugs, dosing or route. Additionally there is no guidance for anesthesia
monitoring, recovery or other pre or post procedural care where specific guidance is required. The method of
euthanasia lists injectable euthanasia solution but does not provide any species specific drugs, dose or route for the
licensee to use. Specific guidance from the attending veterinarian is required for all drugs used by the licensee.
Treatment records provided by the facility document that animals have been treated without written attending
veterinarian guidance such as goats treated for lameness.

Additional specific guidance is required for the Programs of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate
guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does
not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by
developing and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for all species housed at the facility.

This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.

An exit briefing was conducted on September 30, 2015 with the facility vice president.
