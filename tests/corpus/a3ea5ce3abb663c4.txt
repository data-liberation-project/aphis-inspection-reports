CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At the time of inspection, rodent fecal material was noted on the concrete flooring inside the lemur building. One
small hole leading directly to the exterior of the building was noted at the junction of two interior walls and appears
to have been created by rodents. The lemur primary enclosure had pieces of wall insulation, banana peels, and
rodent feces on the concrete floor underneath the animal food bowl. There were no snap traps or sticky boards in
use at the time of the inspection. Rodent feces may contaminate food and contribute to the spread of disease. A
safe and effective program for the control of rodent pests must be established and maintained in order to promote
the health and well-being of the three lemurs housed in this enclosure. To be corrected by: January 27, 2017.

EMPLOYEES.
Facilities with nonhuman primates must have enough employees to carry out the level of husbandry and care as
described in the Animal Welfare regulations. At the time of inspection, there was an insufficient number of trained
zoo keepers with the knowledge, background, and experience in proper husbandry and care of nonhuman primates.
Insufficient staffing is a concern because it affects animal safety and well-being. A sufficient number of adequately
trained employees shall be utilized to maintain animal facilities in a timely fashion. To be corrected by: February

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an area approximately 15 feet in width, varying in height from 6 to 12 inches, on a wall inside the bear
outdoor exhibit area, where the top "stucco-like" coating is missing and the underlying concrete is exposed.
This area of exposed concrete is about 2 1/2 feet above floor level in the bear enclosure. Pieces of the thin
"stucco-like" surface coating may fall into the animal enclosure and could potentially be ingested by the bears.
The area of damaged wall inside this bear enclosure must be repaired in order to avoid accidental ingestion by
the two animals housed in this exhibit. This is a repeat non-compliant item from the July 21, 2016 inspection.
There are multiple layers of animal barrier fencing at the narrow end of the beaver outdoor exhibit water feature. There are gaps of approximately 4 inches between the various layers of animal barrier fencing where the beaver
may become accidentally trapped or injured. This section of barrier fencing must be repaired or replaced in order to
prevent possible animal injury. To be corrected by: January 27, 2017.
There is a vertical gap of approximately 8 inches in the wooden fencing next to the grey fox exhibit near the
sidewalk which leads to the public parking area. There is also a gate in this section of fencing that is very loose and
is no longer attached to the post. All fencing must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by
functioning as a secondary containment system for the animals and to prevent unauthorized persons from going
through it and having contact with the animals in the facility. This section of outdoor fencing must be repaired or
replaced in order to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by: February 17,
2017.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
