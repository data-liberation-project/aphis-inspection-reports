***A female chinchilla (#145) was observed to have an area of large swelling area under it's chin and also problems
with both of its eyes. Both eyes had hair loss around them, were crusty, and had pale discharge. The licensee
reported previous animals had this condition and had it diagnosed as a type of infection, however this animal was
pointed out to the licensee by inspectors and no treatment had been initiated. This animal must be observed by the
attending veterinarian and his/her treatment guidance must be followed.
INDIRECT NCI's:
***Female chinchilla #183 was noted to be not bearing weight on its right front leg. No outward cause for this was
seen, however the licensee must have this animal evaluated by the attending veterinarian to determine if this animal
is in pain and determine if it needs any treatment.
***Chinchilla #197 was noted to tilt its head to the right continually. This is a sign of abnormal health which can be
due to many different causes. To ensure this animal is not in pain and that its condition is not contagious to other
animals, the licensee must have the attending veterinarian evaluate it and follow the recommended treatment.
***Three chinchillas were noted to have eye problems:
-Male chinchilla #673 --its right eye was red around it and has some pale discharge.
-Chinchilla #242 --both eyes could not be visualized because they appeared 'sealed' shut.
-Chinchilla #533 --its right eye was crusty and had some pale discharge.
***Four Chinchillas (No ID's, located in back section - south) - had eye problems Either one or both of the eyes on
these chinchillas were crusty, partly sealed shut, and had eye discharge. Two of these chinchillas were reported by
the licensee to be have been identified in the previous inspection report for unresolved eye problems. The licensee
reports a new treatment was started in June 2015. Instructions for this treatment recommend up to 14 days
treatment. More than 14 days have passed since then and the attending veterinarian's recommendations have not
been sought on these unresolved eye problems. These chinchillas with unresolved eye problems must be
evaluated by the attending veterinarian and treatment administered per his/her recommendation.
Untreated health problems and lack of communication with the attending veterinarian about unresolved eye
problems could allow animals to be in pain and also puts other animals at risk of getting sick if the affected animals
are contagious.
The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian to have each of the affected animals evaluated and to have a
treatment plan documented and ensure that the plan is carried out. NOTE: Record of the attending veterinarian's
diagnosis and treatment records for each of these animals must be kept and available for inspectors on following
inspections.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Daily observations were last noted to be completed on October 26, 2015. During the inspection six chinchillas had
health problems that were not previously identified by the licensee:
-Chinchilla #183-Was not using its right front leg.
-Chinchilla #197-Had a head tilt to its right.
-Chinchilla #145-Had a large swelling under its chin and also had discharge coming from both eyes.
-Chinchilla #673-Its right eye is red, inflamed, and has discharge coming from it.
-Chinchilla #242-Both eyes were sealed shut.
-Chinchilla #533-Its right eye was crusty and had discharge coming from it.
Four chinchillas had eye problems that had previously been recognized and had treatment started, however the
animals' conditions suggest that daily observations were not completed for these animals:
-Chinchilla in back room-Both eyes were sealed shut
-Chinchilla in back room-Its right was eye sealed shut, swollen, and has eye discharge coming from it.
-Chinchilla in back room-Its right eye was sealed shut and swollen.
-Chinchilla in back room-Both eyes have discharge coming from it.
Lack of close daily observations of animals can lead to health issues that are not treated appropriately in a timely
manner. Establish and maintain a routine of observing each animal on a daily basis so that health issues can be
observed, communicated to the attending veterinarian, and corrected in a timely matter to ensure the health and
wellbeing of the animals.
3.125(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL. The facility still has 16 chinchillas housed on 1 inch by 1 inch metal wire flooring. The large holes do not provide an
acceptable flooring surface for the chinchillas since the holes are much larger than the feet of the chinchillas. This
wire spacing can increase the risk of injury to the chinchillas' legs and/or feet. More appropriate flooring surfaces
must be provided that do not have gaps large enough for the chinchilla's feet to pass through to protect them from
injury.
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste disposal
The facility's equipment to eliminate the excreta, waste, and used bedding was not working properly at the time of
inspection. There was a large buildup of excreta, waste, used bedding and water under the enclosures of animals
located throughout the facility. This buildup of material created a strong ammonia smell and foul order within the
facility. This buildup of material also creates a biological hazard that may promote disease and can attract vermin
and pests to the facility. Eliminate the excessive buildup of excreta, waste, used bedding and water from the facility
as often as necessary to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards.
Note: The licensee stated he has contacted the repairman to make repairs to the gutters at least three times in the
past month and a half.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Lighting
There is a section in the back right hand side of the facility housing approximately 30 animals which does not have
adequate lighting and a flashlight had to be used to properly inspect some animals and enclosures. Without
adequate lighting, there is no way to conduct daily observations of the animals and enclosures. Adequate lighting
must be available in areas where animals are present. Repair or replace equipment so that animals are given
adequate access to lighting.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water lines that provides water for the majority of the animals have sections where the tubing has a greenish
appearance. The outside of the watering line continues to have some areas where an excessive buildup of hair,
cobwebs, and excreta is present. Unclean water receptacles may contaminate the water supply resulting in illness
of many animals. Replace and/or clean and maintain the water line and spouts in a sanitary manner, performing as
often as necessary in order to assure a wholesome supply of water to the animals.3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Pest Control
The flies throughout the facility were excessive. The licensee has fly strips throughout the facility. However, this
method of pest control for the flies is currently ineffective. Flies can carry and spread disease and cause the
animals to become sick. The licensee needs to take action to control the number of flies throughout the facility.
Correct by 11/4/15.
