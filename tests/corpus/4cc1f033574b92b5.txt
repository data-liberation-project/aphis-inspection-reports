3.125(c)

Facilities, general.
The food storage area in the barn had an accumulation of dust and cobwebs. Additionally, the camel food was kept in an
open bag with flies landing in it, the mineral blocks for the camels had spider webs and spider egg sacks attached to
them, and the mineral supplement bag was open with spiders crawling on the contents.

Improperly stored feed can become infested with pests or vermin or become wet and spoiled leading to reduced


palatability and nutritional value.

All feed supplies must be stored in a manner to prevent contamination and spoilage.

3.131(c)

Sanitation.
There were fencing materials with gates, rolls of barbed wire, farm equipment, wooden pallets, metal scraps, batteries,
rebar, and roofing materials, and other assorted stored materials all within an enclosure that contained six camels. All of
these items were accessible to the camels within their enclosure. In the enclosure housing the wildebeest and two
elands, a fallen telephone pole with metal points was located in the middle of the pen.

Clutter provides a harboring place for rodents and pests which can increase the risk of disease to the animals. Cluttered
items also create sharp points and edges which increase the potential for injury to the animals.

The licensee must remove all clutter from the animal areas and assure that it is properly stored at all times to promote a
safe and healthy environment for the animals as required.
