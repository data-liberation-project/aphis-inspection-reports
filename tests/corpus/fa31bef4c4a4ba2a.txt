2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was no written Program of Veterinary Care available for review at the time of the inspection.
The written Program of Veterinary Care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the
attending veterinarian in regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. It outlines preventive veterinary care
practices, such as deworming and vaccinations.
The facility must ensure that the written program of veterinary care is available for review during all USDA
inspections.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Two alpacas and one goat have excessively overgrown hooves. The toes on both alpacas are curling in outward
directions due to lack of routine hoof trimming and the hind hooves on the goat are overgrown.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries.
As part of the facility’s program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive
appropriate hoof care in a timely manner.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***There were no animal acquisition records nor animal disposition records for review at the time of inspection. The
licensee was unable to provide an inventory list for the regulated animals at his facility.
Acquisition and disposition records are necessary to be able to accurately track animals being used in regulated
activities to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, and humane transportation. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or
otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession
or under his or control.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the primary enclosure containing one llama, one alpaca, and one wether, there were several metal wires
attached to the chain-link fencing that had sharp points. These points were pointing into the enclosure where the
animals could come into contact with them.
***In the primary enclosure containing 3 alpacas, 1 llama, 2 sheep, and 3 goats, there was a gap under a portion of
the fencing that separated that enclosure from the donkeys’ enclosure. The primary enclosure containing the
regulated animals is on higher ground than the ground of the donkeys’ enclosure, thus creating a drop off of several
feet between the two enclosures. The gap underneath the fence leads to this drop off. There is the potential for the
regulated animals to come into contact with this gap and become entrapped or injured.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury and to contain them.
A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
The sharp points and the gap in the fence were addressed at the time of inspection by a facility employee.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***There are one llama, one alpaca, and one wether that do not have access to adequate shelter that would provide
protection against inclement weather. There is a tarp structure that consists of a roof and two sides. This structure
provides them access to shade, but not shelter, from inclement weather.
Lack of shelter during inclement weather does not ensure that the animals can remain clean and dry and can also
cause discomfort for the animals. The licensee must provide all animals with shelter that protects them from
inclement weather.
Additional sides were added to the tarp structure at the time of inspection by a facility employee.3.130
WATERING.
***There was an excessive buildup of green debris covering all of the interior surfaces of the only water receptacle
in an enclosure that contained 3 alpacas, 1 llama, 2 sheep, and 3 goats. The water was a greenish-brown color.
Animals must be provided with clean, potable water to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain
adequate hydration.
Water receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. They should be cleaned at a frequency
that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
The water receptacle was cleaned and refilled with water at the time of inspection by a facility employee.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, ACI Cindy Rhodes, and VMO Dominique
Engel.
