FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A small section of coated metal wire of the wall in one enclosure housing a male fossa is broken and bent inward
into the enclosure. The resulting wire points are in the vicinity of an elevated resting surface in the enclosure.
Protruding wire can cause injury to the animal. The facility must ensure that indoor and outdoor housing facilities be
structurally sound and be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
This was corrected at the time of the inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives, Mary Bartels, ACI and Margaret A
Shaver, VMO in attendance.
