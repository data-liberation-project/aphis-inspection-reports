ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Required facility records including the program of veterinary care, animal inventory/acquisition records, and records
of animal dispositions were not available for review at the time of inspection. The unavailability of the required
records does not allow APHIS Officials to determine if the records are accurate and complete, that the program of
veterinary care is being followed to ensure the health of the animals, or for the proper tracking of the animals. All
required records at the facility must be maintained so they are available for review at the time of inspection.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures for the sheep and goats contained elements that are potentially hazardous to the animals:
- The sheep & goat enclosure had damaged wire with sharp points inside the enclosure, within reach of the animals.
- The sheep & goat enclosure contained plywood pieces with jagged holes, where the animals could injure
themselves. Several plywood panels showed deterioration of the wood, threatening the structural integrity of the
enclosure.
Failure to maintain enclosures in good repair could result in injury or escape. Sharp wire points and jagged holes in
plywood could cause injury and impact the welfare of the animals. Deteriorating surfaces present an ingestion risk,threaten structural strength, and impede cleaning. Enclosures should be maintained in good repair, so that they can
be kept clean and should be regularly repaired so as to maintain their structural integrity and prevent escape or
injury. A system of maintenance should be in place to protect the animals from injury and to ensure their health and
well-being.
