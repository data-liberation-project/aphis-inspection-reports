2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30 A.M. on
27-Apr-17.The inspector knocked on the front door of the facility. Contact was made with a relative of the Licensee.
The relative said that the Licensee would not be available for inspection. A business card was left at the location
with instructions to call the inspector to update hours of availability.
Lack of availability for inspection inhibits the regulatory process. The licensee must ensure a knowledgeable,
responsible adult is available during regular hours to accompany inspection.
