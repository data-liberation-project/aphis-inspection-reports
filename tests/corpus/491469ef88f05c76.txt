INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) did not ensure that a Study Director conducting a
surgical procedure on sheep was appropriately qualified and trained for that procedure.
In approved surgical protocol 17C291Q2 using sheep, the Study Director is described as having a B.S. (Bachelor of
Science) degree and as having "…gained significant expertise in the proposed model application in research."
According to the protocol, the study director will perform surgical procedures including thoracotomies and creation
of ischemic damage to the heart of a sheep. The resume of the Study Director described his relevant experience as
having been a surgical/laboratory assistant for a cardiothoracic surgeon: “Performed basic surgical techniques such
as: thoracotomy and chest closure…First assistant to cardiothoracic surgeon during large animal surgeries.
Responsible for: preparing and positioning of animal for surgery, visualization of the operating field, providing
hemostasis, performing closure of incisions and applying various wound dressings…" Specific primary surgical
experience by the study director is not documented in his resume or any facility training records. During the
inspection staff members stated that the facility had not contacted the Study Director’s previous employer to obtain
information concerning his qualifications and training. The first sheep used under this protocol died during an acute
surgical procedure while under anesthesia and prior to the planned euthanasia. The protocol was stopped after that
procedure and no more animals had been used under that protocol.
Personnel conducting procedures on animals should be appropriately qualified and trained in those procedures in
order to avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals. The IACUC must determine that personnel
conducting procedures on a species being maintained or studied are appropriately qualified and trained in those
procedures prior to approving animal activities.
Correct for all future protocols.
2.35(f)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.An anesthetic record for cat EIG6 being used in December of 2015 under protocol 15C25L1 was not available for
review at the time of the inspection. A staff member stated that the facility had inadvertently failed to scan the
document prior to relinquishing it to their client.
APHIS inspectors are unable to adequately monitor animal use and the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) function if required animal records are unavailable. A system should be in place to ensure that
all records and reports are maintained by the facility for at least three years.
Correct from this time forward.
3.56(c)
SANITATION.
Twenty eight empty soiled rabbit enclosures were observed in a room currently housing rabbits. According to facility
staff members, the rabbits were removed from their enclosures at least several days prior to the inspection. Date
tags placed on racks containing some of the empty enclosures stated that the trays beneath the enclosures had
been cleaned on 7/4/2017 and were due to be cleaned again by 7/18/2017. Some of the date tags had been left
blank. Two additional rabbit rooms also contained empty soiled enclosures; one room with two enclosures and a
second with six empty enclosures with a blank date tag. The soiled enclosures and trays contained what appeared
to be dried fecal material and crumbled food pellets, and were in the same rooms and directly adjacent to
enclosures currently housing rabbits.
Decomposing organic material may create noxious odors, harbor infectious organisms, and attract vermin, thus
adversely impacting the health and well-being of animals housed nearby. The facility should ensure that buildings
and grounds are kept clean in order to protect their animals.
Correct from this time forward.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one of the pig enclosures, there was a hole in the wall partially covered by shavings. The shavings were stuffed
into the hole in the wall, creating an area that is no longer structurally sound nor maintained in good repair.
Enclosures should be maintained in good repair, so that they can be kept clean.
In room B3, the pig enclosures had gaps between the tenderfoot type grate used for footing in the pig enclosures.
The gaps create a hazard where the pigs could get a hoof caught and cause an injury.A system of maintenance should be in place to ensure that animal enclosures are regularly repaired to maintain
their structural integrity and prevent escape or injury.
Correction date: 21 September, 2017
3.126(d)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In a different room with pig enclosures, the far end of the room had standing water in the enclosures and the
walkway between enclosures. The pigs in these enclosures were housed on a raised grate footing, but there were
gaps that caused the hooves of the pigs to be regularly exposed to the standing water. The water appeared to be a
mix of spilled drinking water and excreta. A suitable sanitary method shall be provided to eliminate rapidly, excess
water from indoor housing facilities. Drainage in the indoor housing enclosure must be adequate to facilitate good
husbandry and promote the welfare of the animals.
