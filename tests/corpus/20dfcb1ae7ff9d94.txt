ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:50 on
30-Jan-18.
I arrived at the site at approximately 11:45am. There was no answer to the door bell. I called the number on file at
11:50am and the owners answered. They were traveling with their dog and unable to meet me for an inspection. I
informed them that they would receive an attempted inspection and try again at a later date.
