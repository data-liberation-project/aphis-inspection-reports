2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
On April 28, 2016, at 10:32 am, a USDA-APHIS-Animal Care inspector and Supervisor visited the facility. The
facility was open to the public and exhibiting covered animal species although it does not have a valid USDA license
and did not complete the prelicensing process started on Oct 8, 2015.
We met a Facility Representative, who informed us that the establishment's owner was out of the state and
unavailable until May 5, 2016. We explained to the Facility Representative that the facility could not legally exhibit
covered species without a USDA license and asked for the owner to contact the inspectors as soon as possible.

Any person operating as an exhibitor, except persons who are exempted from the licensing requirements under
paragraph (a) (3) of this section, must have a valid license.
We left the facility(cid:25)'s premises at 11:05 am.
Also present during the visit was Dr. Greg Gaj, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist (SACS).
NO REGULATED ACITIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED AT THE PREMISES WITHOUT A VALID USDA LICENSE.
Additional Inspectors
