ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(3) Veterinary care: The following were observed during the inspection: one flooded enclosure with
two dead adult Djungarian hamsters and a strong odor of decomposition, one enclosure with two dead adult Robo
hamsters and a strong odor of decomposition, one enclosure with excessively wet bedding in half the enclosure with
one of the two Russian hamsters with a wet and ruffled hair coat, and one enclosure with excessively wet dirty
bedding in half of the enclosure with one adult Russian hamsters and its 7 offspring (See section 3.31(a)(2)). Daily
observations are either not being performed or are not being performed adequately as evidenced by the dead
hamsters and wet enclosures found on this inspection. All animals must be observed daily to access their health
and well-being so that problems with animal health can be addressed by the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner and animals can be moved to enclosures with dry, clean bedding. Correct from this day forward.
3.31(a)(2) DIRECT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(a)(2) Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures: There was one flooded enclosure with two dead
adult Djungarian hamsters. Two adult white Russian hamsters were in an enclosure with excessively wet bedding
in the half of the enclosure by the food. One of the white Russian hamsters had a wet and ruffled hair coat. One
adult light brown Russian hamster with a black stripe down its spine and its seven offspring had excessively wet and
dirty bedding in the half of the enclosure by the water. Once APHIS officials identified the affected enclosures,
facility employees moved the live hamsters to clean dry enclosures. Animals housed on wet bedding may become
soiled, chilled, ill and may die if flooding is not quickly corrected. The licensee must ensure that the animals in wet
and/or dirty enclosures are moved to clean dry enclosures to ensure the health and comfort of the animals. Correct
from this day forward.
3.31(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(c) Pest control: Rodent feces were observed on the pallet holding bags of poultry and livestock foodand on the floor. There was a hole chewed in one of the bags of food. No pest control was observed in the area.
Wild rodents may introduce disease and parasites into the animal colonies. An effective program for the control of
mammalian pests must be established and maintained. Remains uncorrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility manager; Mary Geib, VMO; and Robert Markmann, ACI.
