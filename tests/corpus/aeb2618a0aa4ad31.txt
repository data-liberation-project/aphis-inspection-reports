ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adequate pre-procedural and post-procedural care:
1) Records indicate that there has been at least one instance of confusion as to the correct identity of a guinea pig
undergoing a procedure.
To avoid this situation, and to decrease the risk of mortaltiy, a more accurate pre-procedural system of identification
must be established.

2) Related to the above, the correct medical data for individual guinea pigs must be incorporated into the records in
such a way as to be helpful in contributing to a successful procedural outcome This data would include weights,
hematocrit readings, and pre-procedural health assessments that would err on the side of caution in dictating
volumes of blood to be drawn.

3) The following pre-procedural items in SOP 503-0 must be corrected to reflect what is occurring in practice; that
is, guinea pigs are not being bled at 10 day intervals, nor are all guinea pigs subject to 10 - 12ml bleeds. The latter
should be a decision made on the basis of data mentioned in #2 above.
The information provided in the SOP is both inaccurate and misleading.

4) In order to effectively decrease mortality rates, the causes of mortality must be identified so that pre and
post-procedural corrections can be implemented. The monthly guinea pig medical log must be updated to
distinguish various causes of death.
