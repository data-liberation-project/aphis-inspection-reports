2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The horizontal pole, which serves as a barrier fence, is 12 inches away from the plexiglass enclosure fence for the
two red pandas. Both the primary enclosure and the barrier pole are approximately the same height of about 4 feet.
The APHIS official observed small children going under the barrier pole and standing on the wooden base of the
primary enclosure. Due to the height of the fences and the barrier's distance away from the primary enclosure, the
public has access to the animals within the enclosure.
Additionally, the section of the enclosure that is composed of a chain link fence, has a post and rope barrier with
bamboo in between. The thinnest portion of the bamboo is also approximately 12 inches away from the primary
enclosure.
The close proximity of the barriers puts the two red pandas at risk of harm from the viewing public.
To assure the safety of the animals and the public, the facility must provide a sufficient distance and/or barriers
between the animals and the viewing public.

3.101(a)(1)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ARE IN NEED OF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT:
* The concrete between the stones in the exterior building wall are chipping and falling out in several places.
Pieces of chipping concrete are a potential hazard to the sea lions should they be ingested.
* All of the horizontal rails, on the fence that serves as a barrier in the upper viewing area, are severely rusted.
Rust could flake off into the pool and become a hazard to the sea lions if ingested.* The "beach" area has several areas where the concrete floor is severely deteriorated and crumbles of concrete
are present. Pieces of chipping concrete are a potential hazard to the sea lions should they be ingested.
* A large chunk of the concrete floor, near the drain of the main pool adjacent to the lower viewing window, is
missing.
* The rubber seal on the outside of the viewing window, which is not accessed by the public, has water present
which indicates a leak.
Damaged concrete and a leaking window seal leaves the pool structurally unsound for the seallions housed therein.
Housing facilities for marine mammals must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair for the health and
well-being of the animals.
3.101(a)(3)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
THE FOLLOWING AREAS ARE IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR:
* The metal trim on the base of all four gates in the holding pool area are severely rusted. Rusted materials cannot
be sanitized. All rusted metal trim bases must be replaced to maintain them in good repair as part of a regular,
on-going maintenance program.
* There is peeling sealant in the floor of holding room #3 with exposed duct tape present below the sealant.
* Peeling paint on holding pool #1 near the top edge of the pool. Additionally, rust is appearing through the pool
wall.
* Peeling paint in the corner of the wall of holding room #4. Also, peeling paint and chipped concrete on the side
wall adjacent to the wall of holding room #2.
* Peeling paint on the floor of holding rooms #2 and #4.
* Chip in the concrete adjacent to the floor scale in holding room #1.
* Chipped concrete on the edge of main pool wall near the upper viewing area.
* Large chip of paint is missing from the the wall of the interior side of the main pool between the viewing windows.* Rusted drain covers are present on the "beach" side of the main pool. Rusted materials cannot be sanitized.
Peeling paint and unsanitizable rusted materials pose a potential hazard to the sea lions housed therein.
All surfaces in a primary enclosure must be constructed of durable, nontoxic materials that facilitate cleaning, and
disinfection as appropriate. All facilities must implement a written protocol on cleaning so surfaces do not constitute
a health hazard to animals.
3.107(b)
SANITATION.
All of the metal shelves that are present in the thawing cooler/walk-in fridge are rusted. Rusted equipment cannot
be sanitized. Equipment used for food preparation must be cleaned and sanitized after each use. Since the
shelving cannot be sanitized, the shelving must be replaced.
Equipment must be clean and sanitary for proper storage and thawing of food to protect marine mammal health.

3.107(c)
SANITATION.
A 4 inch by 18 inch stone block is detaching from the stone wall just outside of the man-door that leads out to the
main pool. This loose and detaching block could cause injury to the sea lions as well as the keepers. This block
must be secured to maintain the stone wall in good repair.

3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ARE IN NEED OF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT:
BISON:
* There is a section of detached wire mesh along the front portion of the enclosure, nearest the building. This wire
mesh must be secured to maintain structural strength and to prevent injury to the bison housed therein.TO BE CORRECTED BY: MARCH 23, 2015
* The concrete bases around the two Nelson waterers in the rear of the holding area are crumbling and in disrepair.
Although these waterers are currently inoperable, the damaged concrete must be repaired to maintain the structural
strength of the bases. Additionally, the large chunks of concrete on the ground around the bases of the waterers
must be removed to prevent injury to the bison's feet and/or legs.
RED PANDAS:
* The wooden support posts, for the plexiglass primary enclosure, have water damage at their tops. Damaged
wooden post must be replaced in order to maintain structural strength of the posts as well as the plexiglass walls of
the primary enlcosure.
* The wooden top rail is broken in one area with an exposed, protruding nail present. The damaged area, as well as
the exposed nail can cause harm to the viewing public due to the inadequate 12 inch separation of the barrier fence
and the primary fence.
PRAIRIE DOGS:
* There is one panel of glass on the rear of the enclosure that has two cracks at the base. The panel must be
replaced to maintain structure strength of the primary enclosure and to protect the prairie dogs housed therein.
The above items must be addressed to ensure that the animals and the public are protected from injury.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
SNOW LEAPARD/LEOPARD HOLDING:
* The gutter above the man-door in the rear of the building is clogged and water is leaking over the sides. Due to
this leak, the underlying soffits have absorbed water and are now deteriorating. Leaking water has the potential to
enter the building and cause damage to the indoor snow leopard holding area.
BISON:
* There are two planks of wood missing from the wall of the catwalk above the bison holding. The missing planks
must be replaced to maintain the structural strength of the wall. The missing planks of wood could have fallen below
into the holding area potentially causing harm to the bison.The damaged soffits and the catwalk wall must be repaired to in order to maintain them in good repair to facilitate
the prescribed husbandry practices.
ALL OF THE ABOVE ITEMS MUST BE CORRECTED BY: NOVEMBER 11, 2015 EXCEPT WHERE
OTHERWISE INDICATED.
