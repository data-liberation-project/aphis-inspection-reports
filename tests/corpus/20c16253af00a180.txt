3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Outdoor Housing Facilities.
The following structural issues identified in the pig's enclosure need to be addressed for the safety and health of the
animal.
**The ends of the zip ties used to secure the hardware cloth to the metal hog panel sides of the pen were still long
and had not been trimmed since the last inspection. Some of the long ends of the zip ties had teeth marks from
being chewed by the animal and at least 2 of the zip ties were shorter and had a jagged edge. The zip tie material
can act as a foreign body if ingested by the pig.
**The right and front sides of the pen each had an area at ground level where the hardware cloth had detached from
the hog panel, was curling up and outward into the pen, and the metal hardware cloth had sharp points that can
cause injury to the face, eyes, or snout of the animal.
Per this Section of the Regulations, outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury.
