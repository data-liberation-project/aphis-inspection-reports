2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Within the sheltered building, there was an expired bottle of "Noromectin" (ivermectin) stored in a cabinet with
other medications currently in use at the facility. The medication bottle had a labeled expiration date of 10/2015.
According to the licensee, the medication had been used recently in the dogs. The facility's Program of Veterinary
Care included written instructions to give ivermectin monthly for blood parasites. Expired medications that are given
to the animals may not produce the desired result. The licensee must remove all expired medications from the
ready to use portion of the facility and ensure that expired medications are not used past their labeled expiration
date. As a part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must make certain that all medications are
within the expiration date. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
