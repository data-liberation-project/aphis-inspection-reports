2.31(c)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semi-annual report to the Institutional Official dated June 9, 2016 is not complete. The checklist for the
program review shows one minor deficiency that is not described and there is no correction plan or date. The
semi-annual facility inspection checklist shows several minor deficiencies none of which are described or have a
correction plan/date.
The semi-annual report to the IO dated 12/13/16 does include a description, correction plan and correction date for
all minor deficiences. However, the facility inspection review evaluation has only been signed by four of eight
IACUC members.
The semi-annual evaluation report to the IO is an important document that updates the IO on the status of the
facility's animal care and use program and allows the IO to know when to intervene to ensure that the facility meets
the federal guidelines. The IACUC's semi-annual reports of evaluations of the program of animal care and use and
facility inspection must identify specifically any departures from the Animal Welfare Act Standards and Regulations,
must state reasons for each departure, must distinguish significant from minor deficiencies and must contain a
reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency. The evaluations must be
reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members.
2.31(d)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
*Review of protocols shows that two protocols (1608-CVM-13 and 1602-CVM-05) were approved by an electronic
polling method. Emails reviewed showed that IACUC members made motions to vote and voted via emails sent
back and forth between the IACUC chair and the IACUC members. Voting by such an electronic method does not
meet the requirements of either the Designated Member Review or the Full Committee Review process.
*Review of IACUC meeting minutes shows that protocol 1605-VMT-09 was "approved with revisions" at a full
committee meeting. Some of the members requested that the PI make revisions. The protocol was approved with
this condition.
To ensure a proper and robust review, the IACUC shall ensure that all protocols are approved only by after review
at a convened meeting of a quorum of the IACUC and with an approval vote of the majority present or by adesignated member designated by the chairman to review the protocol after all members have had a chance to call
the protocol to full committee review. If revisions are requested by the IACUC the protocol should be returned to the
PI for modifications and then sent back to the IACUC to secure approval. Correct from this day forward.
2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 150729-01-05-03D was approved on 7/29/15. Protocol 151207-01-05-03D was approved on 12/7/15.
Animals are currently being used on this protocol. There was no record of an annual review of these protocols
having been conducted. In order to ensure full oversight of all animal use activities being conducted at the facility,
the IACUC shall conduct continuing reviews of all animal use activities/protocols at least annually. Correct by
2/15/17.
2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During the inspection one thin white female mixed breed dog #1106 was identified. Her ribs and lumbar vertebrae
are easily seen with no to minimal fat cover. Her pelvic bones protrude and are obvious. She exhibits a marked
concave abdominal tuck and a marked hourglass shape to her waist. Records show that when she arrived on 1/4/17
from a shelter she weighed 17.4 kg and was given a 2/5 body condition score by the examining veterinarian.
Routine intake fecals and bloodwork were performed but there were no clinical notes regarding her thin body
condition or any plan for addressing it. The next weight recorded was on 1/24/17 at which time she weighed 17.6
kg. Review of her food logs shows that she is being fed 1 1/4 cup of Purina EN twice daily and that she is eating.
Review of Purina EN feeding recommendations show that the amount she is being fed is the recommended
maintenance amount for a dog her current weight. It does not appear from the records that she has been receiving
any supplemental calories while at the facility. Thin shelter/rescue dogs are common but their underweight body
condition should be noted and addressed to ensure that the dogs gain weight and health. Animal records should
reflect all medical conditions including body weight conditions/concerns to ensure that a proper diagnosis has been
made and any necessary treatment/husbandry changes instituted. Correct by 1/28/16.
3.15(a)
PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
Inspection of the van used by the Vet Tech program to transport dogs and cats shows the van has a leak around a
roof top vent in the cargo area. The empty crates stored underneath the vent during the inspection both have
accumulated water on top of them and the floor between the crates was also wet. Inspection of the inside of vent
showed a loose rubber gasket type material. The leaking vent is allowing water to enter which may causediscomfort to the animals transported in the van. Correct prior to use of the van.
This inspection was conducted with Attending Veterinarian. Exit conducted with Attending Veterinarian and IACUC
Chair.
