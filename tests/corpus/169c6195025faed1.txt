not USDA licensed. The licensee has not notified the Regional office of any additional sites within ten days of
housing animals at other sites. A licensee shall promptly notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of any
change in the name, address, management, or substantial control of ownership of the business or operation, or of
any additional sites, within 10 days of any change.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The plan of veterinary care for the non-human primates was still not complete. The space on the first page of the
plan indicating the frequency of regularly scheduled veterinary visits contained the digit “1” with no indication of
whether that was annually, monthly or weekly so the visit frequency was unclear. The plan did not specify dosages
and routes of administration for internal and external parasite control as well as for euthanasia. This applies to the
hoofstock plan of veterinary care as well. The plan did not indicate for which species of non-human primates the
preventatives or treatments were intended. This section was previously cited and discussed during the Jan. 19,
2017 inspection. The lack of details on preventatives and/or treatments could lead to inadequate veterinary care.
Additional guidance from the Inspection Guide has been provided to the licensee's representative. The plan of
veterinary care must be fully completed.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The vervet with an abnormal finger, cited on the Jan. 19, 2017 inspection, had initial assessment at the facility by
the veterinarian. In the March 2017 report by the veterinarian he recommended that the animal be brought in for a
more thorough examination and work up to better evaluate the condition and determine if the animal might benefit
from analgesics or other medications. The vervet has yet to be taken into the veterinarian for this follow up visit. At
the time of this inspection the vervet was observed holding its injured hand off the ground while moving across the
floor of the enclosure, as it did during the Jan. 19th inspection,. The licensee must ensure adequate veterinary careby providing the follow up diagnostics and care as instructed by the attending veterinarian. By the exit interview
documentation from the veterinarian indicated that an appointment was made for this animal for the following
Tuesday Aug. 29, 2017.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* Acquisition and disposition records are not complete. A select review of records revealed several deficiencies in
acquisitions, dispositions, and number of animals. There was no disposition record for a kangaroo consigned to
auction in Feb. 2017. A record of consignment at auction indicated that a kangaroo and a zebra were consigned at
the Madison, FL exotic animal auction for the Feb. 2-4, 2017 auction under the name of the animal care taker, with
no reference to the facility owner. The form 7020 presented at inspection indicated only a zebra sold at that auction
under this facility owner’s name with no reference to the kangaroo.
• No kangaroos were present during the Jan. 19 2017 inspection. There are currently two kangaroos on site but no
acquisition records for those are available. There are disposition records for two other kangaroos so there are at
least 4 kangaroos with no acquisition records, and possibly 5 since one was also consigned at auction.
*Accurate acquisition and disposition records must be kept for all regulated animals that come into or leave the
possession of the licensee.
2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A very young zebra was housed by itself in a stall in a horse barn. It was wearing a halter to which was attached a
long rope that dangled freely and was dragging on the ground and between and around its feet. The young zebra
was not attended by any staff at the time of the inspection. The rope could easily become entangled around the
animal’s legs or other parts of its body or head which could stress the animals and could lead to strangulation or
other severe injury. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that
does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive
cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. The halter rope should be removed when not
in actual use and the animal should not be left unattended with equipment in which it can become entangled.
Correct immediately.
3.81(c)(1)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility breeds nonhuman primates for sale and sometimes sends the infants to other off-site locations to be
hand-raised and bottle fed. At the present time there are two infant nonhuman primates that are being raised at a
location that is not USDA licensed. There was no written plan for the care, handling and enrichment of the infants.
Such a plan should be in place and include details on: if and at what age infants are removed from the parents,feeding and nutritional needs, socialization, environmental enrichment, as well as location and experience of the
responsible person(s). There was no documentation showing approval of this practice by the attending veterinarian.
Infant nonhuman primates require special attention regarding enhancement of their environment, their care, and
promotion of their psychological well-being. Their needs should be based on the needs of the individual species and
in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian.

3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There continues to be no written environmental enhancement plan for nonhuman primates specific to the facility and
approved by the attending veterinarian. The animal caretaker had articles and other reference materials on primate
enrichment, however, there was no facility specific program available. The licensee must develop, document, and
follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of
nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as cited in
appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian.
This inspection was conducted on August 23-24, 2017. Two Veterinary Medical Officers conducted the inspection
with the animal care taker who was authorized by the licensee to conduct the inspection.
An exit interview was conducted by both inspectors in person with the authorized person (animal caretaker).
