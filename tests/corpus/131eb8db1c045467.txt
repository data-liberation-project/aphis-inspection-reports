2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
While conducting a behavioral experiment after hours on Friday, September 29, 2017, a male prairie vole was
discovered alive but not moving normally and with a low body temperature (the vole felt cold to the touch). The
principal investigator's staff euthanized the animal to prevent any further suffering. However, the attending
veterinarian was not notified of this incident for 5 days until Tuesday, October 3, 2017. When daily observation of
animals is performed by research staff, the attending veterinarian must be notified of issues regarding animal health
in a timely fashion in order to assure that adequate and appropriate veterinary care is provided to the animals at the
facility at all times. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication shall be established and maintained to
assure that timely and accurate information regarding animal health issues is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian. To be corrected by: November 24, 2017.
2.35(b)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
In one animal housing room, there were 12 prairie voles that were not identified (on a cage card or any other
document available at the time of inspection). Since these twelve animals were not identified, it is unclear which
research protocol the animals are assigned to and what studies, if any, are being conducted with them.
The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in the research facility's possession or under its
control. A system of accurate and timely identification of all animals at this research facility shall be developed and
maintained. To be corrected by: November 24, 2017.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
