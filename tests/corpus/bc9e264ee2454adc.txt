3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Camel and Alpaca enclosure: An approximately, 2 ft. X 3ft. section of wire fencing separating the camels and
alpacas is in disrepair. There were several bent, protruding and pointed wires within contact of the animals in these
pens that could cause injury.
-Deer enclosure #2: Two of the four overhead light fixtures did not have coverings over the bulbs. These fixtures
were located in an area of the ceiling directly above the enclosure and the animals(cid:25) bedding material. Uncovered,
light bulbs could potentially cause injury to the animals in the event of accidental breakage.
** This item was corrected at time of inspection by the installation of covers on the two fixtures.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp, protruding points or edges in order to protect the
animals from injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and
maintenance must be in place.
This inspection was conducted on 05/23/2016 through 05/25/2016.
Exit interview was conducted with facility representatives, Dr. Jeffrey Lee, VMO and Dr. Tyler Fields, VMO.
