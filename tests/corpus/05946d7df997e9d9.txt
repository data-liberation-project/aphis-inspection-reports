A focused inspection was conducted to check on 2 hedgehogs that were identified during the inspection on
2/3/2015 as having possible veterinary conditions that needed to be communicated to or evaluated by the attending
veterinarian (AV). The licensee had called the AV following the previous inspection and had documented guidance
the AV provided. The one female hedgehog with possible respiratory issues was re-evaluated by the AC VMO
during this inspection and did not appear to be exhibiting the same symptoms seen 2 days previously. The AV
directed the licensee to bring in the hedgehog if she shows any recurrence or develops other symptoms.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representatives, PACFA Inspector, and AC VMO.
