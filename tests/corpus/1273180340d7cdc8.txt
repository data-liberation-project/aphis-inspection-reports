FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The pen for one of the raccoons had standing water and was extremely muddy. This created a condition where
there was no dry area for the raccoon. This could potentially cause distress to the animal. Enclosures need to be
maintained in a condition so as not to cause distress to the animal. The region had recently received a large amount
of rain. The facility is currently in the process of renovating the pen and will be applying dirt and gravel in order to
prevent a muddy condition.
