FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength
There is not an enclosure at the facility that is strong enough to house the tamandua. The animal was discovered
wondering throughout the animal room unsupervised at the start of the inspection. The tamandua was placed into
two different enclosures and escaped from both of enclosures during the time of inspection. The first was a large
veri kennel type travel enclosure. The second was an enclosure constructed from cyclone wire fencing. The
tamandua must not be allowed to wonder through the animal room unsupervised as it could potential injure itself.
Assure that the animal is contained in an appropriate enclosure that is strong enough to contain it.
Note: The animal was placed in a temporary enclosure that appeared to contain it during the time of inspection.
The inspection exit briefing was conducted with the facility owner.
