2.134(a) Repeat

Contingency planning.
The facility has not yet worked on developing a contingency plan since the last inspection. A contingency plan is required
to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of the animals in the event of an
emergency or disaster. The plan should identify the situations triggering the plan, outline the tasks to be carried out,
identify a chain of command, and address how the response and recovery will be handled. The facility shall develop and
document a detailed contingency plan.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
A sheep was seen jumping out of a round pen housing sheep and goats. The round pen has a thick build up of straw and
hay due to the amount placed inside to compensate for the cold wet weather over the last three weeks. The height of the
pen has thus been diminished to approximately three feet. The adult animals in this pen can jump over the three high
sides as evidenced by the sheep jumping out during the inspection. Animals jumping out of the pen may be injured and
may escape. The outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by 1/6/23.



The 3.127(d) citation on the October 17, 2022 inspection report has not been corrected but the correction time has not
passed.

The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
