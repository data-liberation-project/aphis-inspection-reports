3.106(b)(1) Repeat

Water quality.
The facility has been experiencing spikes in coliform levels in the two pinniped pools.

Over the last month, the number of coliform colonies found per 100 ml of pool water exceeded the maximum allowed
number of 1,000 on eight different days in Seal Cove (ranging from 2,100 to 10,650), and four days in Sea Lion Stadium
(ranging from 3,300 to 7,450).

Although the facility has developed an action plan to address water quality issues, the corrective measures are not always
adequate to effectively reduce the coliform levels, and although the facility continues to make improvements to the life
support system, these problems continue to recur, and infrastructure improvements previously planned have not yet been
completed. Pool water access points at Seal Cove that could allow ground water to flow into the pool were identified as a
risk for the introduction of pathogens at the time of the last inspection. At the time of this inspection one had been covered
by a protective structure, and a second was addressed during the inspection by installing cover, but a third entry point
remains unaddressed. Additionally, trees overhanging a water tower which could allow debris to enter the system were
discussed at the last inspection, but the situation had not been adequately addressed at the time of this inspection


(although branches were trimmed during this inspection, and a plan was made to remove the trees in the near future).

The coliform bacteria count for a primary enclosure pool should not exceed 1,000. Coliform counts as high as those
documented recently in the pinniped pools are unhealthy for marine mammals. The facility must maintain water quality
which is not detrimental to the health and the well-being of the animals, and must ensure that appropriate and effective
corrective and preventive actions are taken when high coliform counts, or other water quality concerns are detected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
