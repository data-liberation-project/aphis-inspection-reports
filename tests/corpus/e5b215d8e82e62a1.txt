3.129(a) Critical Repeat

Feeding.
The licensee and caretakers are currently feeding the bear cubs born on approximately February 1, 2021 a home-made
formula that the licensee reports to have been using for years. The diet is prepared in advance and is good for two weeks
according to the licensee. This formula should not be kept more than 48 hours when properly refrigerated. The cream
and yogurt which it contains will contribute to the formula quickly spoiling. This formula is being stored in a cooler
maintained at this location. A kestrel thermometer placed inside the cooler registered at 63.3 degrees Fahrenheit. A
glass jar of formula was inside the cooler. The surface temperature of the jar at the top of the container was 55.5 degrees
Fahrenheit. The surface temperature taken at the middle of the jar was 48 degrees Fahrenheit. Bacteria can rapidly
multiply at temperatures greater than 40 degrees Fahrenheit. This would spoil the diet.
Food shall be of sufficient nutritive value to maintain the animals in good health. It shall be wholesome and palatable and
free from contamination. This diet is not being stored at an appropriate temperature. Feeding the bear cubs, this
improperly stored diet could lead to cub sickness and possible death.
Store the cub diet at an appropriately cool temperature to prevent spoilage leading to bear cub sickness or death.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
