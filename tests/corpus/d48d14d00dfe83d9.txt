Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:15am on 5 May
2021.

The inspector called and left a voicemail for the licensee upon arriving at the facility. After waiting 15 minutes, the
inspector spoke with another individual on the property that stated the licensee would not be available for inspection. This
individual was not a known authorized person for inspections. The licensee was called again to check for any authorized
individuals and a second voicemail was left. The inspector called once more and left a third voicemail after 30 minutes
had passed before leaving the facility.
