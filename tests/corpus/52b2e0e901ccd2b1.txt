The antibody production protocol states complete Freund's adjuvant will be used. This adjuvant may cause a
severe inflammatory reaction that may be painful. Rabbits in the colony have developed a lump at the site of
injection which is monitored and treated when necessary. Complete Freund's adjuvant was not included as a
keyword in the alternatives search, therefore alternatives to this potentially painful procedure have not been
considered. The principal investigator must consider alternatives to procedures that may cause more than
momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals, and provide a written narrative description of the methods and
sources used to determine that alternatives were not available. Correct by: October 1, 2016

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The antibody production protocol lacks detail. It states the initial injection will be administered with complete
Freund's adjuvant, and that five more injections will be given a month apart, but doesn't say what adjuvant will be
used. Also, the procedure for final blood collection fails to describe which anesthetic or sedatives will be used.
Without all the details concerning the proposed use of animals, it is difficult for the IACUC to make a thorough
evaluation and therefore animal welfare may be at risk. A proposal to conduct an activity involving animals must
contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals. Correct by: October 1, 2016
