ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**An adult male binturong in enclosure #52, Chip, appeared to be in thin body condition, had slight shaking or
tremors of his head when standing still and then exhibited an abnormally hunched posture while shuffling his hind
feet and reaching forward with his right front leg. A dead and decaying rodent was found within the enclosure and a
large amount of rodent feces was accumulating throughout the enclosure. There was pink insulation material and
an accumulation of rodent feces around the heater in the enclosure. The licensee stated that he had placed bait for
killing rodents around the outside of Chip's enclosure but did not say what type of bait was being used. An invoice
from a veterinarian dated 4/19/2015 listed "digital radiographs--nasal cavity" but there were no medical records or
any other documents available during the inspection that explained why these were performed, what were the
findings, and whether treatment, monitoring, or follow-up were needed. There was no information provided verbally
from the licensee about why the veterinarian performed this diagnostic testing and no way to know if what was
observed during this inspection is a new finding or is related to that previous examination. The veterinarian that had
conducted the radiographs in April was on site for another purpose at the time of the inspection. Animal Care (AC)
personnel asked the veterinarian about the behavior and posturing that was observed but the veterinarian was
unaware of this and stated that the animal was anesthetized a few months ago and that blood collection was
attempted but was unsuccessful. There was no plan outlined in writing or provided verbally for re-evaluating this
animal following the April examination.
This animal must be examined by a veterinarian and a diagnosis and treatment plan established. The dead rodent,
rodent feces, and possible exposure of this animal to toxic chemicals as well as infectious organisms from the
rodent contamination are of serious concern and need to be addressed immediately by cleaning the enclosure and
excluding rodents from entering the enclosure.
**A 7 week old bottle-raised male tiger cub (DOB 7/23/15), the licensee believed is named Joey, was noted by AC
inspectors to have crusted hair and a clear discharge from both eyes. This condition had not been noticed by the
facility staff and the veterinarian who was on site during the inspection for examination of another young tiger cub
had not been asked to evaluate this cub at the time of the inspection. The environment in the veterinary hospital
enclosure in which this cub is housed with a 7 week old golden tabby liger cub is unsanitary (rodent feces, exposed
drywall which cannot be cleaned or sanitized). Young animals are vulnerable to infectious organisms due to theirimmature immune systems. Discharge from the eyes that crusts on the hair may be a sign of an eye or upper
respiratory infection and this cub should be examined by a veterinarian for a diagnosis with appropriate treatment
and plan for follow-up examination, if needed. This cub should not be handled by members of the public until a
veterinarian has examined him and ensured that his health is not at risk.
**An adult female tiger in enclosure #2, Buffy, was noted to be squinting her eyes in the sunlight before moving to
pace the fence line in a shady area on the east side of the enclosure. Buffy has opaque coloration to the cornea of
both eyes with the left eye appearing completely white. The other female tiger in this enclosure, Spangles, also has
an opaque and cloudy appearance to both eyes, the left eye being more noticeably affected. This condition has
been documented for both of the cats that it is chronic in nature by the attending veterinarian (AV) but, when
compared to the previous inspection, it appears to be worsening in both tigers. There is no documentation that the
licensee has notified the AV of the worsening condition nor of any follow-up by the AV to assess these animals. A
note was made by a veterinarian on Buffy's medical record on 3/10/15 about "healing superficial abrasions to top of
head & lateral to the eye". No record of the eye condition has been made for either animal since 2010.
Eye conditions, particularly chronic conditions that become more active, are serious, often painful to the animal,
and, if not treated quickly, may result in loss of vision.
**A male tiger in enclosure #21, Caprichio, appeared to have an abnormal gait on his left front leg such that the
elbow appeared to swing out to the side before placing the paw on the ground, giving him the appearance of being
off-balance. This same tiger was noted on the last inspection on September 13, 2014 to have an abnormal gait on
the right hind leg and was in thin body condition, particularly in the back leg muscles. The AV noted concerns in the
tiger's medical record on 1/23/11 that this animal needed an increase in calcium supplementation and no other
notes were entered in the record until 9/26/14 by another veterinarian that "no limping" was noted but tiger is
"bowed legged all four limbs, USDA concerned about radiographs, no need to take at this time". The last entry for
this tiger by a veterinarian is on 3/10/15 when he is noted to be "very skinny" with a plan to "panacur deworm",
increase meat, and "dart if not improved in 4-6 weeks". No directions regarding the amount of "panacur deworm"
to give, how much meat to increase for weight gain to be achieved, and no specific criteria as to what would qualify
as "improved in 4-6 weeks" or what would be done if not improved and darting was to be done. An invoice from a
veterinarian dated 4/19/15 does list digital radiographs of back right leg for "Capricio" but these were not made
available for review during this inspection and no diagnosis or plan for monitoring or treating this tiger were
identified in any records or known by the licensee.
**A male tiger in enclosure #32, Waldo, had an abnormal gait affecting his right front leg. When walking, his head
bobs downward noticeably when landing hard on his left front leg. He would stretch out the right front leg gently
before walking at times not putting full weight on that leg. Waldo climbed into water tank used provided for the cats
to soak and cool off but which was filled with contaminated water, dark grey in color with noticeable hair, fecal
matter, and other debris. He began to paw at the water using only his left front leg while resting right front leg onedge of the tank before lying down in the tank. When he jumped out and over the edge of the tank, he landed very
hard on his left front leg and then stood for a moment with his right front leg outstretched and lightly touching the
ground. He then took only a few steps, hopping off of his back legs before entering the shelter structure. Invoices
from a veterinarian dated 3/4/2014 and 4/19/2015 list digital radiographs of right elbow and right front leg for Waldo
but these were not made available for review during this inspection and no diagnosis or plan for monitoring this tiger
were identified in any records or could be explained by the licensee. An invoice from a veterinarian dated 8/5/2015
does identify Waldo as "still lame on RF" and "advise 2 weeks of meloxicam" but the pain medication prescribed is
"on back order" per the facility representative so no treatment has been provided to this animal since 8/5/2015.
**A male tiger in enclosure #65, Toni, had an abnormal gait affecting his right front leg. When walking, his head
bobs downward noticeably when placing his left front leg and he was seen not bearing full weight on his right foot,
barely touching his right toes to the ground when at rest. An invoice from a veterinarian dated 8/5/2015 does
identify "Tony" as "still lame on RF" and "advise 2 weeks of meloxicam" but the pain medication prescribed is "on
back order" per the facility representative so no treatment has been provided to this animal.
Lameness and/or abnormal gait with muscle or weight loss may be indications of injury or underlying illness and
these tigers need to be evaluated by a veterinarian to properly diagnose the cause and provide a plan for treating
and/or monitoring these conditions.
**An adult male tiger in enclosure #26, Andy, was seen to sit on his hind limbs, stroke his penis with his front paw,
bite his left hind ankle, and then get up and urinate. This is unusual behavior and the licensee had not noticed this
before in this tiger. There were no notations in his medical records regarding this behavior and no veterinary
examination noted since 2010 for concerns with hair coat quality.
A veterinarian should examine this tiger to determine if this is behavioral or indicative of an underlying veterinary
condition which may require diagnostic testing (eg. blood work for urinary tract health) and further evaluation and
plan for treatment and monitoring for resolution of any underlying condition if identified.
**An adult black leopard in enclosure #61, Sinbad, was noted to have two large lumps protruding from the left hip
and left lateral thigh with a third faintly noticeable on his right mid-lateral thigh. The veterinarian that was on site
during the inspection stated she had not been aware of these lumps on this animal and visually evaluated Sinbad
while talking with the AC inspectors and the licensee. She recommended no treatment at this time but to monitor
them daily for changes. During review of the facility's medical records. an email dated 10/21/2014 from the
licensee's spouse to this veterinarian and the AV mentioned two lumps on Sinbad and stated they didn't seem to be
bothering him. There is no documentation on the size or location of the lumps noted in 2014 so it is not clear if the
ones seen during this inspection are the same or are new.
Lumps in or under the skin may be a sign of infection, inflammation, or tumors and should be measured and
monitored, at a minimum, for changes in size or character. This animal and the skin lumps need further evaluationby a veterinarian with documentation of location, size, and texture with a diagnosis and plan for treatment, if
needed, and monitoring for changes.
**An adult black leopard in enclosure #14, Aramis, had hair loss and several areas of reddened skin on his tail, with
the tip of the tail being most raw in appearance. Aramis has been receiving two medications, Amoxicillin and
Amitriptylline, as prescribed by the facility veterinarians since early August 2015 but the licensee stated he doesn't
seem to be improving. This leopard has been treated on and off for several years for self-injurious behavior
resulting in loss of hair and damaged skin on his tail and, according to facility medical records, has received this
same treatment when the problem is identified.
Self-injurious behavior in captive large felids is not uncommon and can become chronic leading to infection of the
tissues and possible need for amputation of the tip of the tail. This leopard should be re-examined by the AV for the
reddened, raw skin and to determine if the current treatment should be continued.
**Two coatimundi in enclosure #15, Molly and Macano, have thinning hair coats, especially over their lower backs,
hind legs, and tails. These coati have been noted to have this abnormal hair coat during previous inspections. The
AV has conducted skin scrapings to check for parasites and prescribed adding supplements to the diet but no
further evaluation has been conducted since the hair loss was first documented in 2010.
Thinning hair coats and hair loss may be a symptom of nutritional deficiencies, internal organ (endocrine)
dysfunction, external parasites, and/or many other veterinary conditions and these animals need to be re-examined
by veterinarian to determine a diagnosis and plan to address this chronic, recurring condition.
The animals that were listed in the citation on the previous inspection conducted on September 13, 2014 were
evaluated by a veterinarian. Two of these animals, Capricio and Buffy, continue to have veterinary conditions that
have not been diagnosed nor has a treatment and follow-up plan been established to minimize pain and discomfort
associated with these conditions.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Numerous animals were identified during this inspection to have active or chronic veterinary conditions that were
not identified by facility personnel or had not been communicated to the attending veterinarian for follow-up care as
outlined under section 2.40(b)(2) in this report.
**One tiger cub had not been identified as being ill until the evening on 10/10/2014, according to the licensee. The
licensee did not seek veterinary care until the next morning,10/11/ 2014, and the cub died en route to the attendingveterinarian (AV). The necropsy performed by the AV was "suggestive of an underlying immune system
deficiency".
At least 13 animals since July 2014 had not been observed or had timely information on problems of animal health,
behavior, and well-being communicated to the attending veterinarian and were found dead in their enclosures by
facility personnel, many found frozen and unable to have necropsies performed.
**Tiger, Reyna, found dead 7/12/2014
**Tiger, Zara, found dead 3/1/2015
**Tiger, Tabitha, found dead 3/8/2015
**Tiger, Sissy, found dead 7/5/2015
**Tiger, Mohan, found dead 12/27/2014
**Tiger, Grumpy, found dead 12/27/2014
**Tiger, Aphrodite, found dead 12/27/2014
**Tiger, Tiger, found dead 12/18/2014
**Lion, Simba, found dead 5/25/2015
**Leopard, Thunder, found dead 2/23/2015
**Kinkajou, Studley, found dead 12/22/2014
**Kinkajou, Honey, found dead 1/12/2015
**Bobcat, Bobbie, 3/7/2015
Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being and a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
The licensee must ensure that the animals are observed at least daily to assess their health status and convey the
information to the veterinarian directly and in a timely manner.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The acquisition record for a bobcat named Toby being exhibited to the public does not have the name, address,
driver's license number and State, and vehicle license number and State for the person(s) from whom this bobcat
was acquired on 8/8/2015. The acquisition record states "Unknown previous owner, left at gate in crate, declawed
& neutered".
Complete and detailed information for animals acquired for use in exhibition needs to be complete to ensure that all
animals are acquired legally as well as transported and handled humanely.
Every exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the requiredinformation concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or
otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control including the name and address of the person from
whom the animals were purchased or otherwise acquired and the vehicle license number and State, and the driver's
license number (or photographic identification card for nondrivers issued by a State) and State of the person, if he
or she is not licensed or registered under the Act.
To be corrected on all acquisitions of animals other than dogs and cats from this time forward.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
- The plan for the environmental enhancement to promote the psychological well-being of the nonhuman primates, 2
ring-tailed lemurs acquired in July 2014, is not adequate. The plan, at a minimum, must address social grouping,
environmental enrichment, special considerations, if applicable, and restraint devices and their use. The plan and
environmental enrichment must be approved by the attending veterinarian (AV) and documented when provided to
the animals on the environmental enhancement plan.
At the time of this inspection, there was a written plan signed by the Attending Veterinarian but there is no log book
or calendar showing that enrichment takes place. The animals have different items in their enclosures, but there is
no schedule of rotating or changing the items in the pens in this signed plan or other documentation.
Nonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs that need to be addressed when in captivity. A
written plan that is directed by the AV, guided by current professional standards, and available for review by APHIS
officials is required to ensure that the psychological well-being of these animals is being appropriately addressed.

Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environmental enhancement of nonhuman
primates that is in accordance with currently accepted professional standards and as directed by the AV.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The west wall of the veterinary hospital indoor enclosure housing a 7 week old tiger cub, "Joey" and a 7 week old
golden tabby liger cub, had the vinyl surface torn which exposes the drywall. This wall is in disrepair and cannot be
adequately cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces that are not maintained in good repair and so they can be cleaned and
sanitized pose a risk to the health of these very young animals due to their immature immune function to protect
them against exposure to infectious organisms on those surfaces.
Enclosure #36 housing 2 juvenile black bears, Cody and Pebbles, has a large hole in the wooden shelter structure
near the entry door on the upper right side. This shelter is in disrepair and the hole can allow wind and rain to enterthe structure which can cause discomfort to these animals.
Enclosure #46 housing 2 adult tigers, Kodiak and Kasper had nails protruding from the raised wooden resting
platform, posing a risk for injury to these animals.
Enclosure #39 housing an adult Serval has a warped board with exposed nails on the wooden platform in front of
the shelter structure, posing a risk for injury to this animal.
Enclosure #9 housing an adult black leopard, Jamma, had several nails protruding from a wooden resting platform
and ramp structure, posing a risk for injury to this animal.
In the following enclosures, the doorframe around the den (shelter) had chewed and ripped wood which are in
disrepair and which could cause an injury to the animals:
**Enclosure # 11 housing 2 adult tigers, Charlie and Chainsaw
**Enclosure # 12 housing 2 adult tigers, Seth and Gabrielle
**Enclosure # 23 housing 2 adult tigers, Tutt and Nefertiti
**Enclosure # 24 housing 2 adult tigers, Shenandoah and Sabre
**Enclosure # 25 housing 2 adult tigers, Zena and Zoey
**Enclosure # 60 housing 2 adult lions, Pharaoh and Savanna
**Enclosure # 65 housing 2 adult tigers, Toni and Phoebe
Enclosure # 24 housing 2 tigers, Shenandoah and Sabre, the chain link fencing on the west side of the enclosure
adjacent to the den is pulled and is not in good repair, posing a risk of injury to the animals.

Enclosure # 65 housing 2 tigers, Phoebe and Toni, the chain link fencing on the south side of the den is pulled and
is not in good repair, posing a risk of injury to the animals.
Enclosure #12 housing 2 adult tigers, Seth and Gabrielle the chain link fencing on the west side of the enclosure is
pulled and is not in good repair, posing a risk of injury to the animals.

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.125(c) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.
There were multiple packages of raw chicken and meat in approximately 20-25 large cardboard boxes that were
past the expiration dates (Sept. 4, 2015 noted on several packages). All of this meat was being stored at room
temperature in the main food preparation area and most of the meat was thawed and warm to the touch. Numerous
flies were noted in this food preparation area which would be attracted to raw, unrefrigerated meat. Flies may
contaminate the food items and the surfaces where food is prepared and poses a risk to animals fed this meat
through the transmission of infectious organisms.
Food that is past the expiration dates on the manufacturer's packaging and which is not stored under proper
conditions (eg. refrigeration for raw meat products) deteriorates quickly and may become contaminated with high
levels of bacterial pathogens which are a risk to the health of the animals being fed this improperly stored food.
Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin.
Refrigeration and appropriate storage shall be provided for supplies of perishable food.
3.127(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Several outdoor enclosures housing tigers, lions, tigers, bears, and ligers did not have adequate shade to protect

Four tigers were noted to have abnormal conditions affecting their eyes. Numerous animals were observed laying
in the restricted shadow of shade available to them in their enclosures (approximately 8 feet by 10 feet) during the
inspection.
Inadequate protection from direct sunlight has the potential to cause eye damage and may affect an animal's ability
to thermoregulate without the ability to access shade. In addition, inadequate shade may restrict the animals from
utilizing the full enclosure space.
The licensee was asked by AC personnel if there was a plan for correcting the lack of shade for all of these animals.
He stated that he had no plan and that the "new owner" would have to fix it.
Shelter from sunlight is required when overheating or discomfort of the animals is likely.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from inclement weather.The shelter structure in the outdoor enclosure #35 housing an adult leopard, Selbit, is not adequate to protect this
animal from the local area's climatic conditions (eg. rain, wind, snow, hail). This enclosure previously housed
bobcats, a much smaller animal than an adult leopard, and the shelter structure entrance is too small for a leopard
to enter this structure or to have adequate room to make normal postural adjustments if able to gain access.
Animals housed outdoors should have appropriate shelter, natural or artificial, where they can escape adverse
climatic conditions and stay warm and dry.
Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for
all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.
To be corrected by 9/30/2015.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There were fence panels stacked against the fence on the inside of the perimeter fence on the south side near
Enclosure #43 for 3 tigers, Lazarus, Diablo, and Twinkle.
These panels were stacked in a manner that would allow animals to easily climb over the perimeter fence should an
animal escape from its primary enclosure. These materials may also cause damage to the perimeter fence which
could reduce its effectiveness to keep unwanted persons and animals from entering the facility or to act as a
secondary containment should animals escape from their primary enclosures.
The perimeter fence must be maintained so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals
in the facility and to prevent the entrance of unwanted persons or animals.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
The food in the Enclosure #34 housing two bears, Cody and Pebbles, was not wholesome or free from
contamination. A plastic bag containing a thick, yellow liquid, that the licensee thought might be butter, was mixed
in with the diet. This poses a risk to the animals for an intestinal obstruction if ingested and is not a wholesome food
item. The diet also had noticeable fecal matter on top of the food in the receptacle which contaminates the feed and
poses a health risk to the animals from infectious organisms that is present in fecal matter.
An excessive amount of flies were noted in the food preparation kitchen, around the food for all the bears
(Enclosure #8 housing 3 juvenile black bears, Lil Racy, Coda, and Xena; Enclosure #34 housing 2 juvenile blackbears, Cody and Pebbles; Enclosure housing 2 black bears, Lolli and Holly, and 1 brown bear, Huggy). Flies carry
and transmit infectious organisms and may contaminate food items and food preparation surfaces, posing a risk to
the health of the animals.
The licensee is not following the diet plan approved by the attending veterinarian for "Added calcium supplement for
cubs".The plan lists two calcium supplements to be given, Prima Cal 2 scoops of supplement per pound of meat
and Calcium Citrate 4 scoops of supplement per pound of meat. Only Prima Cal was found during the inspection
and the licensee stated that was all they were using and they were following the directions on the manufacturer's
label. There were three young tiger cubs housed in Enclosure #6, 16 week old male orange tiger Rousey, 15 week
old female white tiger with no name given, and 15 week old female white tiger Aurora. Aurora was being examined
by a veterinarian for the licensee during the inspection due to a right front leg lameness. She appeared to APHIS
inspectors to be reluctant to walk and to be in pain when she walked in the enclosure where she had been returned
after she was examined and radioigraphed. The male cub, Rousey, appeared to have a swollen left wrist at the
time of this inspection. Lameness and joint swelling in young, growing tiger cubs may be caused by inadequate
calcium in the diet and this can lead to serious injury and health consequences (eg. fractured bones) if not
prevented or addressed early by diet supplementation. The licensee should be consulting with the attending
veterinarian about these cubs and should ensure that the calcium supplementation is being given as directed.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and the diet shall be prepared with
consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal.
To be corrected by 9/12/2015.
3.130
WATERING.
The water receptacle in the enclosure #36 for two black bears, Cody and Pebbles, was empty and the only water
available in their enclosure was in a horse trough provided for the bears' enrichment and for cooling themselves.
This water was brown in color and had food, hair, and other debris floating in the water. This water is not potable
and poses a risk to the animals' health if consumed due to bacterial contamination. One of the bears was noted to
sit by the drinking water receptacle as if waiting for it to be filled. After an employee was called over to fill this
receptacle, this bear was noted to immediately drink repeatedly for a total of approximately 1 minute.
At least 12 water receptacles provided for animals to soak and cool themselves contained brown to black water with
noticeable hair, fecal matter, leaves, and other debris (Enclosures #12, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 32, 33, 36, 56, 58, and
64). These receptacles are not being kept clean and sanitary and pose a risk to the animals' health should they
choose to bathe or drink this water due to bacterial contamination.Animals not provided with adequate potable drinking water are at risk for dehydration and overheating. If other
types of water receptacles are provided to animals, these and all drinking water receptacles shall be kept clean and
sanitary in order to minimize contamination by bacteria, algae, and other potentially toxic or infectious materials.
If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health
and comfort of the animal and all water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
Potable water was provided to the two black bears, Cody and Pebbles, during the inspection upon the request of
the AC inspector.
All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary as of 9/11/2015.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Excessive accumulation of excreta was noted in at least three enclosures:
#42 housing 2 lions, Daniel and Chloe
#29 housing 3 tigers, Billy, Jake, and Chepe
#11 housing 2 tigers, Charlie and Chainsaw
There were numerous flies noted throughout the facility and the excreta appeared to have been accumulating for at
least one week based on the color and amount present for the number of animals in the enclosure. The animals
were noted to walk through the feces along the fence line which may allow for contamination of the animals and
poses a risk to their health.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
To be corrected by 9/12/2015
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Rodent feces had accumulated in the indoor portion of the enclosure #52 housing a binturong, Chip. Feces had
accumulated on the floor in the entry way, along the walls of the enclosure, and in front of the wall heater, along with
a pile of pink insulation material. A dead rodent was in the enclosure with the binturong. The licensee did state he
places rodent bait outside of the enclosure but there does not appear to be adequate control of rodent pests in this
enclosure.An accumulation of rodent feces was found in the veterinary hospital on the floor and surfaces around the 2
enclosures housing 2 juvenile tiger cubs and 1 golden tabby liger cub.
Excessive flies were found in the area used for food preparation and all around the improperly stored meat in this
room.
Excessive flies were noted throughout the outdoor facility particularly around the bear enclosures (#8 Rachey, Xena
and Koda, #36 Cody and Pebbles, and unnumbered enclosure Huggy, Lolli, and Holly) and around the west side
enclosures (#46 tigers Kasper and Kodiak, #47 tigers Elijah and Jezebel, # 48 lions Mona and Daniel, and #50
cougar Boo). The flies were numerous enough that the buzzing was audible while observing the animals and one of
the AC inspectors was bit by flies several times. The flies congregated on and around the food in the bear
enclosures. There were several containers hanging on the perimeter fence or near the food preparation building
that the licensee stated are used for fly bait but all were empty except for dead flies and debris.
Rodents, flies and other pests may carry and transmit diseases to the animals and a more effective method of
monitoring and preventing their presence in/around primary enclosures and around food storage/preparation should
be implemented.
The licensee shall establish and maintain a safe and an effective pest control program which should include
reduction of flies, particularly around food and food preparation areas, cleaning of enclosures to remove excreta and
rodent feces and dead rodents, and keeping all water receptacles clean and sanitary.

EMPLOYEES.
The licensee is not regularly involved in the day to day care of the animals and facilities, and he could not provide
basic information about the identity or condition of the animals when asked. The licensee stated that he has 2
employees that live on site. The facility currently has 112 animals including 13 species. These species have
complex medical, behavioral, nutritional, and other husbandry needs. Conditions at the facility currently do not meet
the professional level of husbandry practices described in the regulations and standards. For example, in the last 14
months, 9 tigers,1 lion, 1 bobcat, 1 leopard, and 2 kinkajous were found dead. During the inspection, 7 tigers, 1
binturong, 2 coatimundi, and 2 leopards were identified with veterinary care problems that were no(cid:25)t receiving
appropriate care. Two tiger cubs and 1 leopard had veterinary care problems that were currently under treatment.
Young animals (2 tiger cubs, 1 golden tabby liger cub currently, 3 tiger cubs recently starting to wean) at the facility
were being hand raised and require around the clock specialized care and feeding. A total of 36 enclosures,
affecting 69 animals, had no shade(cid:20). This has been an ongoing problem that has been cited since May 2009.
Inspectors asked when the licensee would provide shade and he stated that the "new owner would have to dealwith fixing the shade". The licensee claimed that all 62 enclosures of animals are provided water three times a day,
however, the enclosure #36 housing 2 black bears, Cody and Pebbles, had little water or water that was severely
contaminated during the inspection. At least 14 enclosures were in varying degrees of disrepair. At least 10
enclosures had evidence of excessive flies, at least 3 enclosures had excessive excreta, and rodent activity was
present in various locations. The excessive number of animal welfare concerns indicates that there is not a
sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain a professionally acceptable level of husbandry
practices.

Facilities are required to utilize a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professional
husbandry standards described in the regulations and standards to ensure that the animals are kept in appropriately
maintained, sanitary facilities and receive appropriate monitoring, veterinary care, feeding, watering, and care.

The licensee must evaluate the current work load and staffing level and ensure that a sufficient number of
adequately trained employees are utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices
described in the regulations and standards.
A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level
of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
To be corrected by 9/30/2015.
