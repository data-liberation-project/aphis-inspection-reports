2.40(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is performing surgical procedures on Sugar Gliders with no direct supervision or written protocol from
a licensed veterinarian, in a non sterile environment, with no anesthesia or pain management. This poses a direct
health hazard to the animals and can result in discomfort, infection, or death to the animals involved. Under no
circumstances are surgical procedures to be conducted in this manner. Consult the attending veterinarian and
create a plan that conforms to standards regarding pre and post procedural guidelines, adequate anesthesia and
pain management, and possible surgical risks involved.
