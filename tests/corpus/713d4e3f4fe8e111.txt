Three pot bellied pigs and one goat are housed together in an outdoor enclosure. Recent snow and rain storms
have caused their entire enclosure to be very muddy with many areas of standing water. During this inspection one
pig and the goat exited their shelter building and entered the enclosure. Both animals were observed walking
through and sinking ankle deep into the muddiest areas. These animals should not have to walk through muddy
areas to gain entrance into their dry shelter building.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water in order to maintain dryer surfaces and to
ensure the comfort and well-being of the animals housed there-in.
During this inspection the enclosure was rearranged and now the animals have access to a dry area.
