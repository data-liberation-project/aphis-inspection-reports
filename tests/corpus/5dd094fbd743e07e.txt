FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The primary enclosure containing the goats Tulip and Dinah had holes underneath the fence that were 12 inches
by 24 inches. These holes were large enough to allow the goats to escape or possible harm themselves by
becoming entangled in the process. The enclosure should be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
*** The primary enclosure containing the goats, No Ears and Odie, and the potbellied pig, Bullseye, had a black
netting that covered the top of the enclosure. The netting had been torn and was hanging into the pen. The netting
could cause the animals to become entangled or cause harm if ingested. The gate to the enclosure did not have a
means to latch it to remain closed and contain the animals. There was also a piece of tin that was part of the
enclosure wall that had been bent and was sticking out into the pen and could injure the animals. There was a
pallet in the pen that had several nail heads exposed by about 1inch that could injure the animals. The facilities
should be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
*** The primary enclosure containing two llamas had a section of fence that had become unattached from a post
and was sagging down about 18inches from the ground. This could allow the animals to escape or possibly
become entangled in the wire. The fence should be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
to contain the animals.3.131(c) REPEAT
