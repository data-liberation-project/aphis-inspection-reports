ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:10PM on
06/30/2016. After arriving at the address, I rang the doorbell, knocked on the door twice, called and left a message
on the listed phone number, and waited 30 minutes before leaving.
