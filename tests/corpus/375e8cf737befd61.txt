2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During review of the paperwork, the Facility Representative informed me that the documented Attending Veterinarian is
semi-retired. From my conversation with the Facility Representative it was not clear if the listed Veterinarian is still acting
as the licensee's Attending Veterinarian. I contacted the listed Attending Veterinarian. He informed me he is no longer
the licensee's Attending Veterinarian.

Not having an Attending Veterinarian doesn't ensure the regulated animals are being provided adequate veterinarian
care.

The licensee must make arrangements to secure an Attending Veterinarian to ensure adequate care to the animals is
being provided.

Correct by 11/11/21.
2.40(b)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

An older male deer died on or around December 17, 2020. The deer was observed laying around more frequently and
moving slower than normal months prior to dying. The Facility Representative stated "the buck was gradually
deteriorating months before he died. He was limping a little bit in the last year and was slow moving around." The
licensee failed to seek veterinary treatment from the Attending Veterinarian during the time it was first observed to be
slowing down to the time the deer died.

Failing to seek veterinary treatment for a sick or injured animal may cause the animal to suffer in pain. In addition the
animal's condition may worsen and it can eventually lead to the animal dying as is the case in this situation.

The Attending Veterinarian must be consulted for all future veterinary care issues.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Facility Representative.

End of report.
