The facility has an environmental enrichment activity document approved by the veterinarian, but it does not

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one of the small clawed otter enclosures, the platform was broken, with a crack that could catch claws or feet and
injure the otters. In another enclosure, the blue castle like toy was cracked, which could also catch claws and hurt
the otters. In several otter enclosures, the rubber mats had evidence of chewed ends, creating an uneven surfaces
that is difficult to clean and is no longer in good repair.
In the sloth, tamarin and lemur night house, fluorescent bulbs were not enclosed adjacent to the enclosures. If the
bulbs broke, the glass is not contained within a cover and could cause injury to the animals.
In the 6 banded armadillo enclosures, there are several screws with sharp pointed ends protruding through the wall
of the enclosure which has the potential to cause injury to the animals.
The facility is to create a system to keep the housing facilities in good repair, to be structurally sound and to protect
the animals from injury.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. Several enclosures for the armadillos and cavy's are not within the existing perimeter fence. The enclosure fence is
a combination of solid metal and fencing to protect the animals, but there has been no written approval from the
Administrator to house these animals without a perimeter fence. A variance may be requested to the perimeter
fence requirement.
The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the
facility.
