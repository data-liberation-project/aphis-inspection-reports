Space. Insufficient space was being provided in two enclosures each housing 16 or more older weanling/adult guinea
pigs. Enclosures measure 48 inches by 24 inches or 1152 square inches of floor space. Guinea pigs weighing over 350
grams require at least 101 square inches of floor space per animal. Can house more than 11 older weanlings/adults in

that guinea pigs are provided with at least the minimum amount of floor space per animal to prevent unnecessary stress
and discomfort. Correct by November 5, 2022.
