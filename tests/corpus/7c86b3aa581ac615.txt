WATERING.
There were four bottom enclosures with dirty water bowls at time of inspection. The water in the bowls was
discolored from shavings and debris. Licensee stated that he cleaned water bowls and offered fresh water in the
morning. He also stated that he is planning to replace the water bowls in the bottom row with an automatic water
system. Dirty water bowls were removed at time of inspection by licensee. Water for guinea pigs must be potable
and provided daily unless food supplements consumed by the animals supplies them with their normal water
requirements. Open containers such as water bowls must be placed in enclosures that minimizes the contamination
from excreta. Water that is contaminated by soiled bedding and excreta can expose the guinea pigs to disease
hazards and health problems. Correct by ensuring that potable water is offered as often as necessary to ensure the
health of the animals and at least daily. Additionally, ensure that watering receptacles are free from contamination
and are properly sanitized when dirty.

An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
