2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Animals identified on the previous inspection of both sites to have veterinary conditions requiring examination,
diagnosis, treatment plan, and resolution or follow-up evaluation by a veterinarian were no longer present at the
facilities and no records were made by the licensee to show that the directions provided by the Attending
Veterinarian (AV) on 9/23/15 were followed and that the veterinary conditions identified were resolved.
**A female juvenile hedgehog that was noted to be sneezing and lying on her side while the other juvenile
hedgehogs were roaming throughout the enclosure during the previous inspection had been examined by the AV on
9/23/15. Oral antibiotic treatment was prescribed by the AV and this animal, along with another from this site, had
been transferred to site 001 by the licensee for monitoring and administration of antibiotics but no records were
made to show this was done and the animals had been sold by the licensee at the time of this inspection. There is
no mechanism to determine that the animals were appropriately treated and had the veterinary condition resolved
prior to release for sale.
**A female hedgehog from site 001 noted on 9/23/15 to have lost a significant amount of weight (13% of total body
weight) was transferred to this site by the licensee and had not been monitored nor reweighed to determine if she
had recovered. All four female hedgehogs on site were evaluated and weighed during this inspection. One female
with pinto markings similar to the one see at site 001 from Bin#43 on 9/21/15 and 9/23/15 weighed 390 grams which
would be improved if this is the same animal but there was no mechanism or records by which this could be
determined.
Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of
emergency, weekend, and holiday care.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representatives and AC VMO, Tracy Thompson, DVM.
