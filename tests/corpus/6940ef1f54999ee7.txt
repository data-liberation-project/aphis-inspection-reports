3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Fallen trees have damaged the perimeter fence in two locations. In both locations, the fence has been flattened
and no longer provides an adequate barrier. The perimeter fence must be a secure, intact barrier from the ground
to at least 8 feet in height. The fallen trees must be removed and the fence repaired/replaced as soon as possible.
The facility must work to ensure that trees around the fence are monitored and maintained as needed to help
protect the integrity of the facility.
