2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A 9 year old male yorkie named Radar (last 3 digits of microchip #226), had heavy tartar along his canine and cheek
teeth, completely encasing the teeth. The gums were slightly reddened and beginning to recess back. The dog was in
good body condition and allowed manipulation of his mouth. Dental and periodontal disease can be painful and can lead
to infections and unwillingness to eat. The licensee must employ appropriate methods to prevent, control, and treat
disease, including ensuring clean and healthy teeth, as directed by their attending veterinarian. Correct by seeking
veterinarian care by 11/30/21.
3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee did not have medical records documenting physical exams of all dogs by the attending veterinarian in the
last 12 months. She did not maintain routine vaccine or deworming records for adult dogs. The licensee is currently
treating a male yorkie, named Radar's (last 3 digist of microchip #226) left eye with an antibiotic ointment but did not
maintain any medical record indicating how long she had been treating the eye or other relevant history. Without accurate
medical records, it is difficult to determine if and when medical problems are being identified and adequately addressed.


The licensee must keep copies of all medical records for dogs and make the records available during inspection. Correct
from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
