ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following guinea pigs were identified as needing veterinary care:
1) The 5th enclosure had a white adult guinea pig and tan on face with hair loss approximately 2 inches in diameter
and two sores on its back.
2) The 8th enclosure had a white adult guinea pig and black on head with hair loss on the right side of the nose that
was approximately 1 cm. The underlying skin was crusty and had numerous scabs.
These two animals were not on any treatment and had not been evaluated by the attending veterinarian. These
conditions are not covered by the current program of veterinary care. Hair loss, sores, and scabs of this type can
occur for a number of reasons including both infectious and traumatic. Failure to properly diagnose and treat animal
conditions can result in worsening of the condition. These two guinea pigs must be examined by the attending
veterinarian so that appropriate veterinary can can be provided. Additionally, the licensee must maintain records of
veterinary recommendations and treatment provided by future evaluation by APHIS officials. Correct by March 15,
2018.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The following enclosures need repair.
1) Enclosure I housing 6 adult guinea pigs had chewed/detached metal on the right partition with bare wood
exposed.
2) Enclosure 33 housing 9 adult guinea pigs had chewed/detached metal on the left partition with bare wood
exposed.
Enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury and to
contain the animals securely. The above enclosures must be repaired or replaced to prevent injury to the animals.
In addition, the bare wood must be sealed or covered with an impervious surface so that the enclosures can berepeatedly cleaned and disinfected. Correct by March 26, 2018.

WATERING.
There were accumulations of brown debris around and inside the drain pipe for the automatic water receptacles.
These accumulations around and inside the drain pipe expose the guinea pigs to potential disease infections with
bacterial, fungi, and parasites. Water receptacles including water valves and drain pipes must be cleaned and
sanitized whenever dirty and at least once every two weeks. Inadequate cleaning of the water valves and drain
pipes can result in contamination of the the guinea pigs in the same enclosure. Licensee must establish and
maintain a program to keep the water valves and drain pipes sanitized when dirty, and must be sanitized at least
once every two weeks. Correct by March 14, 2018.
This inspection was conducted with the owner's daughter and exit interview was conducted with the owner.
