2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee was unable to produce disposition records for one coati, and one Patagonian cavy. Records must be
maintained by the licensee and they must contain all required information pertaining to the animals acquired and
disposed of/sold/transferred by the facility. The licensee located the required documents after the APHIS Official
had concluded the inspection.
*******************Correct from this point forward
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
