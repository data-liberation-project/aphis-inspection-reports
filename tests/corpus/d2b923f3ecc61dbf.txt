Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
-One female red goat has overgrown hooves. The rear hooves were significantly overgrown. On the right rear limb, the
outer hoof was at least 1/3 longer than the inner hoof and was curling inward, growing underneath the inner hoof. On the
left rear limb, the inner hoof was curling inward.
-One male fennec fox had overgrown nails on his forelimbs.

Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, and treat diseases and injuries.

Hooves and nails need to be trimmed as often necessary to prevent overgrowth that can lead to pain, injury and/or gait
abnormality.

Outdoor housing facilities.
There is an approximately 10' section of perimeter fence for the 3 grivets, and 3 ring-tailed lemurs that was removed
yesterday, and has not been put back in place at time of inspection at approximately 11:30 AM.


All outdoor housing facility must be enclosed by a fence that is of sufficient height to keep unwanted species out. Fences
must be a minimum of 6' tall, and must be constructed so that it protects nonhuman primates by restricting unauthorized
humans, and animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going through it or under it and having contact with the
nonhuman primates. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside wall or fence of the primary enclosure to prevent
physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and outside the perimeter fence. Such fences less than 3 feet in
distance from the primary enclosure must be approved by the Administrator.

A perimeter fence must be present for all non-human primates to protect the non-human primates from other animals and
to restrict entrance by unauthorized humans.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There is a large accumulation of dried feces on a resting platform for a pair of common marmosets.

Excreta and food waste must be removed from inside each indoor primary enclosure daily to prevent the nonhuman
primates from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.

Primary enclosures must have feces and excess food waste removed daily to prevent soiling of the marmosets, and to
reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
3.84(d) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

The indoor housing facility, housing 2 grivets and 5 common marmosets, had excessive flies. A significant amount of flies
were observed on one marmoset enclosure floor. At least 1/3 of the grivet floor space was covered with flies. Additionally,
an excessive number of flies were observed in the grivet’s food bowl. A fan and one fly ribbon were present in the facility.
However, it was not effective at controlling the fly population.

An effective program for control of insects must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being
of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.

An effective program to control/eliminate fly infestation must be established and maintained.

Facilities, outdoor.
There is an approximately 10' section of perimeter fence for the 3 Cape porcupines that was removed yesterday, and has
not been put back in place at time of inspection at approximately 11:30 AM.

All outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient
height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out.

A perimeter fence fence must be present for all wild/exotic animals to protect them from other animals and to restrict
entrance by unauthorized humans.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.

A shelter, housing 3 Cape porcupines, had excessive flies. Flies were observed on the floor space and the animal’s food.
There was no method to control or reduce the flies in this area.

An effective program for control of insects must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being
of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.

An effective program to control/eliminate fly infestation must be established and maintained.

Corrected at time of inspection.
