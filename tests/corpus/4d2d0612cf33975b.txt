ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) lacks specific guidance for the use of ivermectin and the drug
Uniprim. The PVC states to dilute 10% ivermectin to a 1:10 solution and use it as a spray. No guidance is included
for amount to spray each guinea pig or how often to treat the animals. Additionally, the ivermectin product produced
by the licensee is 5mg/ml and not a 10% solution. The PVC states to mix the drug Uniprim 1 scoop in 50 pounds of
feed and use it as needed for 14 days then off for 14 days. The bottle of Uniprim produced by the licensee is
labeled 1-2 scoops per 50 pounds of feed. No specific guidance is included for when this is to be used, only stating
"as needed". The licensee stated that he uses it for sick guinea pigs and uses 1 or 2 scoops depending on how sick
the animals are at the time.
The use of these drugs without specific guidance from the attending veterinary can be dangerous or ineffective.
Correct this by contacting the attending veterinarian and follow specific recommendations for the use of these
drugs, including indications for use.

2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** This facility currently has no records of animals on hand, births, deaths, or sales. The only record produced by
the licensee were check stubs from the buyer of the guinea pigs being sold. These check stub only showed an
amount paid to the licensee but no other information such as number of animals sold was included. Failure to
provide current accurate records impedes the inspection process and makes animal tracking impossible, which is
especially important in the case of a disease outbreak. This facility must develop and maintain a record keeping
system that correctly discloses all required information in Section 2.75. Correct by: July 31, 2017

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The front walls of all the enclosures in this facility measure 6 inches in height. Additionally, the current design of
the watering system allows the guinea pigs to possibly escape as the holes in the backs of the enclosures are large
enough for the guinea pigs to get out. At least 3 guinea pigs were found running loose on the floor of this facility.
The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are structurally sound, maintained in good repair, protect the animals
from injury, and contain the animals. Additional height is required for all of the fronts of the enclosures and repair or
replacement of all areas where the guinea pigs may escape is required.

WATERING.
** There are accumulations of brown debris, bedding and feces around and inside the drain pipe for the automatic
water receptacles. This accumulation around and inside the drain pipe expose the guinea pigs to potential disease
hazards. Water receptacles including water valves and drain pipes must be cleaned and sanitized whenever dirty
and at least once every two weeks. Inadequate cleaning of the water valves and drain pipes can result in
contamination of the guinea pigs in the same enclosure and other enclosures as the drain pipes are common to
more than one enclosure. The licensee must establish and maintain a program to keep the water valves and drain
pipes sanitized when dirty, and must be sanitized at least once every two weeks.

SANITATION.
*** Every primary enclosure in this facility requires cleaning. Enclosures have a build of dirt and debris in the
corners, a layer of brown scale and organic material on the walls of the enclosures, and cob/dust webs are hanging
from the ceilings of the enclosures. The licensee stated that they are changing bedding weekly but they only clean
the enclosures once per year. Failure to adequately clean and maintain the enclosures on a regular basis exposes
the animals to disease hazards and does not satisfy accepted husbandry standards. The licensee must thoroughly
clean all primary enclosures and develop a cleaning schedule that will ensure all enclosures are cleaned regularly.

SANITATION.
Currently this facility is only cleaning the primary enclosures for the guinea pigs. No sanitization schedule is in
place to the ensure the enclosures are sanitized with a disinfectant at least every 2 weeks. Failure to provide
regular sanitization can lead to an increase of potential disease hazards to the animals. Correct this by developing
and implementing a sanitization program that adequately sanitizes all enclosures at least every 2 weeks as
required.

3.31(b)
SANITATION.
***There is spent bedding and hay covering a majority of the floor of the guinea pig building. Cob/dust webs were
found in the corners and along the ceiling. The receptacles used to catch water runoff from the automatic watering
system are filled with a greenish/black scale and require cleaning. Failure to maintain the building and premises in
a clean condition impedes normal husbandry practices and makes monitoring for pests difficult. Correct this by
maintaining all premises in a neat and clean condition.
