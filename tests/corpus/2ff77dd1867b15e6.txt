3.6(c)(1)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***A female, Jack Russell terrier mix named “Opal” was in a primary enclosure that did not meet minimum height
requirements as per the Animal Welfare Act. Opal was unable to stand or be in a normal sitting position without her
head touching the wire roof of the enclosure.
Lack of adequate head space limits the ability of the dog to make normal postural adjustments and move freely. The
licensee must ensure that the interior height of a primary enclosure be at least 6 inches higher than the head of the
tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position. Opal was removed from this enclosure at the
time of inspection.
To be corrected from this date forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
