Handling of animals.
On January 18, 2022, an off exhibit, visually impaired, male black footed cat was being moved into a feeding stall when
he got stuck in the shift door and injured. The experienced zookeeper started to close the heavy shift door after the male
cat was seen to be in the stall with his feed, but the male cat double backed through the door opening. The zookeeper’s
attention was focused on the female cat, in the same enclosure, and not the shift door as he continued to push it closed.
After realizing the cat was stuck between the shift door and the wall, the zookeeper quickly opened the door, and the cat
was released. The zookeeper thought the cat appeared to be moving around okay but the cat quickly went to one of his
hiding boxes. The incident was reported to a supervisor at this time. The next morning, the male cat was found laying
sternal in his enclosure, not wanting to move and the attending veterinarian was notified. A physical exam and
radiographs were consistent with a pelvic fracture. The veterinarian elected humane euthanasia as the best treatment.

Improper handling can cause unnecessary stress, injury and death. All handling of animals shall be done as expeditiously
and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress,
physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.



Correct by ensuring proper handling of all animals from this day forward.

This was a focused inspection on the black footed cat enclosure.
