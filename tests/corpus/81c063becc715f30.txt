3.80(a)(2)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On February 10, 2015, personnel discovered a female, cynomolgus monkey outside of her primary enclosure. The
animal was recaptured and evaluated by veterinary staff. She sustained injuries on her left hand and forearm,
received immediate veterinary care and made a full recovery. At the time of inspection, the animal did not appear to
be in any pain or distress.
Upon being notified of the escape of the monkey, the Veterinary Sciences Department immediately conducted an
investigation. All the proper procedures had been followed by personnel. It could not be determined exactly how the
animal was able to escape from her enclosure, but it could have been attributed to the animal being able to unlatch
an opening in the food access door.
As per section 3.80 (a) (2) (iii), primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain the
nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.
The research facility acted to address this item by conducting an investigation and implementing appropriate
corrective actions to prevent any future incidents.
This inspection was conducted on August 10, 2015.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted on August 11, 2015 with Dr. Ashley McIntosh (VMO), Dr.
Christina Der (VMO) and facility representatives.
