RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection report on May 26, 2015, animal births and deaths were not recorded except for the
month of December. Records must be kept on animal births and deaths for animal tracking, assessment of the
animal care program, and to comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that records on
animal births and deaths are kept and maintained. Correct by January 6, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
