ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One young male warthog was observed to have multiple scabbed abrasions on his body. Two of these abrasions
were approximately 1" in diameter and located at the base of the ears on the head. One wound on the right flank
was 1 inch in length and 3/4 inch in width. Both the young male and female warthogs in this enclosure were
observed to be scratching their body and head with the rear feet. The skin on both animals appeared dry, flaky and
reddened.
Scratching of the skin can lead to wounds and discomfort to the animal.
These animals need to be examined by the veterinarian for a diagnosis and treatment plan.
