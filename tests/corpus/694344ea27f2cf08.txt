PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* The primary enclosure wood wall has an estimated three inch chewed hole. One rabbit is in contact with the
affected wall located in outdoor housing. Further deterioration or chewing can affect the structural strength of the
wood surface. If exposed wood becomes ingested, it could cause potential digestion problems. The licensee must
ensure all outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury. Correct by 8/14/14.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The wood frame enclosure gate has an estimated two to four inch gap because this gate does not adequately
close. In addition, two nails protruding upwards were observed along the bottom of this enclosure gate. One goat
is in contact with the affected gate located in outdoor housing. This affects the ability of the enclosure gate to
contain the goat securely and could lead to potential injury. The licensee must ensure the enclosure gate is kept in
good repair to protect the goat from injury and contain the goat securely at all times.
* The facility inspection done on 7/31/14 and exit briefing done on 8/7/14 were conducted with the licensee.
