2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee stated during this inspection that he does not currently have an attending veterinarian or a written
program of veterinary care. The last site visit to the facility by the former attending veterinarian occurred over two
years ago. Since the last inspection, three animals have died of unknown causes without veterinary intervention or
communication. During today's inspection a critically ill lion was identified that has not received veterinary care.
To ensure adequate veterinary care can be available and provided to the animals at the facility, formal
arrangements must be made to employ an attending veterinarian and include regular site visits and provisions for a
written program of veterinary care.

2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection an adult male lion named "Zar" was found to be emaciated. All ribs, vertebral bodies, pelvic
and hip bones were prominently displayed. The skin was noted to be laying flat over the hips and femurs, no
discernable body fat was present and loss of muscle mass was obvious. Respirations were rapid and shallow The
lion appeared reluctant to move, quietly depressed and was not observed standing during the inspection that lasted
several hours.
The licensee stated that the lion had been showing signs of illness for over a month with a depressed appetite and
was recently observed ambulating but was very unsteady standing/walking. The animals condition had not been
communicated to any veterinarian at the start of this inspection. No veterinary examination, diagnosis or treatment
had been obtained.
*The adult male white tiger named "Toby" was noted to have a swollen and discolored left front dewclaw. It was
determined that the claw has grown into the pad of the dewclaw. The claw of the first digit on the left rear foot hasalso grown into the pad. Although the tiger was not limping he was observed licking the dewclaw area. The
dewclaw swelling and inflammation may indicate discomfort is experienced by the animal and/or infection is present.
The ingrown nails were not previously identified by the licensee . No veterinary examination or treatment had been
initiated for these problems as of the start of this inspection.
Delivery of adequate veterinary care under the Animal Welfare Act includes the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control , diagnose and treat animal injuries, diseases and medical concerns. Treatment or veterinary
intervention was not provided for the two animals described above. The lion appears to be in critical condition and
requires immediate veterinary care. These animals must be examined and treated by a veterinarian to demonstrate
adequate veterinary care can be established and maintained by the licensee.

was examined and initial treatment provided prior to the completion of this inspection. Veterinary follow-up for the
tiger must proceed as directed by the examining veterinarian.
