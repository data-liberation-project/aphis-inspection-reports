2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30 on
08/18/2015.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 12:30; I spoke with a facility representative who informed me that the
licensee was at work. Also, due to other commitments the facility representative was not able to perform the
inspection.
