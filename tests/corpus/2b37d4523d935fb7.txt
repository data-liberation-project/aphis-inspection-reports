Several medications and suture materials were expired as follows:

2-One tray feline vaccine exp. 23-4-14
3- Tetanus toxin (5 vials) exp. 1-7-14

10- 1 box 0 PDS exp. 1-14
11- 1 box 0 chromic exp. 1-14
12- 1 chromic cassette 0 exp. 6-30-99
(10 out of the 14 boxes of sutures were expired)
The use of expired materials and medications is considered adulterated and is not an appropriate method to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
.
The refrigerator that is use to store vaccines and medications had frozen and liquid condensate. Several of the
boxes and vials were very wet. This method of storage does not minimize possible contamination of these
products.
A baboon, coatimundi and puma were euthanized on January 30, 2014 utilizing a bottle of euthanasia which had
expired on October 2013. The attending veterinarian had knowledge of the expired drug but had no other
alternative to humanely euthanize the animals. A purchase order was submitted by the attending veterinarian
several months ago, but due to the zoo's purchasing administrative procurement process they have yet to be
ordered.
The procurement process and delivery of medications, equipment, supplies and services shall be expedited so that
the animals receive the proper veterinary care & treatment(s) in a timely manner to relieve pain &/or suffering as
quick as possible; and that the animals do not suffer needlessly or be subjected to a prolonged euthanasia process
due to expired agents.
A puma, coatimundi, & a baboon were euthanized because they were not "fit for exhibition". The medical records
did not list any recent illnesses or work-ups, & the documentation doesn't indicate any problems that would lead to
the decision for euthanasia.
Several mammals (eg: camel, kangaroo) have coccidia with associated clinical signs & illness and have required
veterinary care. These animals are in close proximity to, or in the enclosures with birds. These are routinely
de-wormed, but the medication(s) used is ineffective in treating or controlling coccidia. These animals are not
tested for any parasites by the veterinarian.
Ensure either that these bird species do not pose a disease transmission threat to the regulated mammals, or
institute a program of veterinary care to control or eliminate these species of parasites to prevent illnesses.

Regulated species (deer )that have been on exhibition have been euthanized by cutting their jugular veins with a
knife and then fed to the big cats. Cutting an animal's throat with a knife without first stunning them is not
considered humane and is not an accepted method of euthanasia.
Guinea pigs that were also were on exhibit were fed alive to snakes as food. All regulated species (that have been
on exhibit) shall not be used to feed another species unless they are properly euthanized according to accepted
methods by the AVMA.
Regulated animals used for food and properly euthanized shall not pose a risk of infection from contagious
disesases, parasites, etc., to ensure the well-being and health of the animals fed.
Correct by June 24, 2014.
3.76(c) REPEAT
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***The shelter housing facility of the baboons, patas, and african green monkey had deficient light intensity making it
difficult to conduct inspections and to observe the animals.
**** Lighting must be uniformly diffused throughout animal facilities and provide sufficient illumination to aid in
maintaining good housekeeping practices, adequate cleaning, adequate inspection of animals, and for the
well-being of the animals.3.83
WATERING.
The Lemur exhibit had water bowls but they were empty at the time of inspection.
Water must be offered as often as necessary to ensure the health and well-being of the non-human primates.
Corrected immediately.
3.84(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Several primate shelter facilities (lemur, spider monkeys, baboons, etc.) were observed to have green algae on the
floor, dirt, leaves, etc. which indicated that they are not properly and regularly cleaned.
Housing facilities must be cleaned when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and
practices in order to protect the health of the primates.
Correct by 6-30-2014.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
One gate of the perimeter fence located near the hippo exhibit is not locked. The hinge on the opposite side only
consists of a twisted pliable wire which doesn't provide any security.
The attending veterinarian indicated that this gate was use to accommodate the increase attendance from a festival
in January 2014 and it has not been locked since then.
This gate is accessible to the public because it is located adjacent to a parking area.
The perimeter fence should be secured at all times to prevent animals from escaping and the public from accessing
the animals in order to protect the animals (and the public ) from injury.
Correct by tomorrow.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
****Multiple enclosures (llamas, bongos, camels, big cats, etc.), were observed with food (hay & fruits) on the dirt
floor with mammal & avian fecal material in close proximity, which may cause (and does not minimize risk) the food
to become contaminated.
**** Food shall be wholesome, palatable and with adequate nutritive value in order to maintain all animals in good
health, and free from contamination in order to prevent disease and health hazards.3.130
WATERING.
The water bowls containing drinking water for the llama, bongo, camels, etc. were contaminated by birds roaming in
the area (ducks, peacocks, etc.)
All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary in order to prevent disease and health issues.
To be corrected by 6-19-2014.
****An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
