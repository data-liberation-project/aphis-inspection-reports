2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility currently does not have an attending veterinarian (AV) and has several animals in need of veterinary
attention. In addition, several animals were 'diagnosed' and treated during the last three weeks without a
veterinarian being involved. The facility representative (Park Manager) stated during the inspection that he had
noticed that the AV hadn't been out to the facility for about the past two to three weeks and that the AV usually
came out 2-3 times a week prior to that. He stated that the Collection Manager usually works with the AV. The
inspector contacted the AV by phone and was told that his last day at the facility was three weeks prior. Four
animals were noted during this inspection as needing veterinary attention and no documentation was available to
show show that the needed veterinary attention had been provided. Documentation reviewed included a log book
of procedures completed which showed that since the AV left the facility two animals (one gemsbok and one addax)
were sedated with BAM (butorphanol, azaperone, medetomidine), diagnosed with foot rot and treated (with
injectable prescription drugs). In addition, one red river hog was "euthanized due to old age" but there was no
diagnosis or method of euthanasia documented. There was no documentation available to show that these
diagnoses and treatment plans were under the advisement of a veterinarian. The previously written program of
veterinary plan did not include instructions for facility personnel for using these drugs, for diagnosing/treating foot
rot or performing euthanasia.
Each facility must employ an attending veterinarian who shall provide adequate veterinary care to its animals. In the
case of a part time/consulting veterinarian, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary
care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises. Correct by Aug. 19, 2017.
2.40(b)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The veterinary drug cabinet and vet portable drug box contained a large number of expired drugs. None of the
drugs were labeled or marked as expired. The expired drugs included the following: Spectogard Liquid (8/15),
Valbazen dewormer (12/16), Ivomec injectable (10/16), Safeguard Paste (10/14), Advantage Multi (1/14), Safeguard
suspension (2/15), Tolazine Injectable (6/16), NeoPolycin Opthalmic Ointment (12/14), Lidocaine 2% injectable
(9/16), Tiletamine-Zolazepam (4/17), Atropine Injectable (3/12), Naloxone Injectable (7/12) and Epinephrine
injectable (8/12). Expired drugs may no longer be effective. All medications shall be in-date to ensure proper use ofthe medications. Expired drugs shall be properly discarded or marked as expired and stored in a separate location
from the in-date drugs.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Four animals are in need of veterinary attention:
*One muntjac was seen licking a wound just behind its right shoulder as the inspector approached its enclosure. A
second wound was noted on the right side over the back leg and a third wound was noted on the left side behind
the left shoulder. All three wounds were about 1 in x 1/2 to 3/4 in in size and irregular in shape. All had the top layer
of skin missing with pink/red tissue visible. The edges of all wounds were black in color. No discharge was noted.
The facility representative was unaware if the muntjac had been seen by a veterinarian or what treatment if any was
being done. No documentation was available for review to show that the muntjac's wounds had been observed,
diagnosed or treated.
*An eland was noted to have elongated rear hooves. The hooves on the right rear leg were long enough that the
inner hoof was curling up and over the top of the outer hoof. No documentation was available for review.
*One blesbok in the seperate enclosure adjoining safari 3 was noted to be thin in body condition. The ribs, spine
and hip bones were prominent. A fecal record showed that a fecal on blesbok (herd) had been done 7/13/17 and
that 3 strongyle eggs were noted. The facility representative stated he dewormed the blesbok but that no
documentation was made. The attending veterinarian at the time was called and stated that based on the very small
number of eggs noted on the test run that he did not prescribe any treatment. No documentation regarding the thin
body condition was available for review.
*One thin watusi calf was noted in the enclosure at the entrance to the park. Th ribs, spine and hip bones were all
easily visible. The calf was noted to be bright, alert and walking around with the adults. No observation or treatment
documentation was available.
The facility shall ensure the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries
to include communicating all problems of animal health, behavior and well-being in a timely manner to the attending
veterinarian so appropriate diagnostics and treatment can be instituted. The facility shall have the four animals
evaluated by a veterinarian and follow and document all diagnostic and treatment recommendations made by the
veterinarian. Correct by Aug. 12, 2017.
2.75(b)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The acquisition and disposition records for the facility are not up to date. For example:
*Two young white wallaby are currently present at the facility. No acquisition records are present.*Acquisition records for two Siberian lynx were noted. No lynx are currently at the facility. The facility representative
stated that they were sold. No disposition records are present.
*During the last inspection the facility housed four grivet monkeys. No grivets are currently at the facility. The facility
representative stated they were sold. No disposition records are present.
*No capybara were present during the inspection in January 2016. Two capybara are present during this inspection.
A disposition record shows that four capybara were sold in November 2016. No records could be found for any
acquisition of capybara.
Complete and accurate acquisition and disposition records must be kept in order to ensure that all animals'
identities can be known with certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. Acquisition records shall include
offspring born of any animal at the facility. Correct from this day forward.
2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During this inspection the inspector walked through the interactive portion of the walk thru park twice. In this section
of the park the public can feed the giraffe carrots and can enter an interactive enclosure where they can feed and
pet the goats, sheep and alpacas. In both instances the public was noted interacting with the animals but no
employee or attendant was within view. In one case, a young girl was feeding a giraffe a carrot while an adult was
photographing her. In both cases, kids and adults were in the enclosure with the goats, sheep and alpacas feeding
them. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times
during periods of public contact in order to protect the animals and the public. Correct from this day forward.
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor portion of the macaque sheltered housing in the spider monkey/macaque building is in need of cleaning.
On the floor was an accumulation of food debris, excreta, and vegetative debris the macaques had brought in from
outside. The accumulation was large enough that on over a third of the floor the concrete underneath was not
directly visible. In addition, brown material had been smeared on a couple of the walls a foot above ground level.
Lack of cleaning will lead to odors, pests (a large number of flies were noted) and can lead to spread of disease in
addition to leading to discomfort to the animals. All hard surfaces with which non-human primates come in contact
must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if needed to prevent an
excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, and excreta (Sec. 3.84 of this subpart). Correct by Aug. 11,
2017.
3.77(a)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two of the non-human primate sheltered housing facilities were noted to feel excessively warm in the indoor portionof the sheltered housing despite relatively cool temperature outdoors for this time of year. The temperature outside
reached 85 degrees F (Kestrel measurement).
*Facility building (indoor section) housing tamarins, owl monkeys, ringtail lemurs and macaques: The temperature at
12:20pm measured 85.2 and at 5pm measured 86.4 degrees F (Kestrel).
*Facility building (indoors) housing spider monkeys and macaques: The temperature at 12:50pm measured 87. 7
degrees and at 5pm measured 88.5 degrees F (Kestrel).
The ambient temperature in the sheltered part of the facility must not rise above 85 degrees for more than 4
consecutive hours to ensure the health, comfort and well-being of the non-human primates. Correct by Aug. 16,
2017.
3.78(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Four black and white ruffed lemurs are currently being housed outdoors. A portion of the shade cloth covering their
enclosure was noted torn and hanging inside the enclosure. The facility representative stated that a recent strong
storm did some damage. The enclosure contains just one shelter, a dog igloo style round shelter structure with a
large direct opening. Wind and rain can enter easily enter through the opening causing discomfort to the animals. In
addition, this shelter structure is relatively small and although four lemurs can fit in the shelter, it is not large enough
to provide extra space to turn around easily or for one lemur to move away from the others. A stand structure for a
second shelter is present in the enclosure but does not contain a shelter structure at this time. There are no other
features in the enclosure that could provide protection from the elements. All outdoor housing facilities for
non-human primates must provide adequate shelter from sun, rain, snow, wind, cold and any conditions that may
occur at all times to ensure the health and comfort of the animals. Correct by Aug. 16, 2017.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*During this inspection the inspector noted two young white wallabies in fleece pouches in the commissary. The
pouches were hung at ground level on a shelving unit. One wallaby had its head up and out of the pouch looking
around the room. No employees or other people were present in the room. The facility representative indicated they
spent the daytime while the facility was open in their pouches in the commissary and during the evening hours/early
morning hours were kept outside in a small enclosure. The commissary itself contains an open shelving unit with
husbandry chemicals stored on it along with other shelves storing feed. The wallabies are old enough that if they
chose to jump out of their pouch they might cause themselves harm exploring the room. Also, if loose they might
escape the building if someone opened a door. The housing for the young wallabies must be of such material and
strength that it is structurally sound and protects the animals from injury and contains the animals.
*Several areas of fencing are in need of repair. The back enclosure fence of the newly added drive thru park section
needs to have dead vines removed that are entwined in and covering the fence on both sides. There is a largealmost round hole in a section of fence of the enclosure housing blesbok and hog deer. A fallow deer was noted in
with these animals. The fallow deer was noted jumping back through the hole in the fence. Sharp wire points were
visible in the broken area of fencing on which the animals could injure themselves. All enclosure fences shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The safari 2 section of the drive thru portion of the park needs additional shelter structures for the animals to provide
protection from the elements such as wind, rain and hail. There are currently a number of man made shelters
present however there are not enough shelters present to house all of the animals in this section of the park
simultaneously in a comfortable manner. There are some trees providing shade along the sides of the section and a
few in the center that provide some natural protection but again, not enough for the number of animals in this
enclosure. The facility representative stated that they have plans to build more shelters prior to winter. However,
shelters are necessary at all times since bad weather/storms can occur at any time of year (in fact, a very recent
storm tore the roof off one of the shelters). The facility shall ensure that there is shelter provided for all animals kept
outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort. Correct by Nov. 9, 2017.
3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Two capybara are currently being housed in an enclosure that does not contain a natural or man-made water
feature large enough for them to be able to submerge themselves. They each have a small round rubber tub similar
to a feed receptacle that is kept filled with clean water. The water is only a few inches deep. Capybaras are
semi-aquatic mammals and regularly spend time in the water. In addition, their normal defecation behavior is to
defecate while in watery habitats. In order to allow the capybara to make normal postural and social adjustments
typical of their species, their enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide them access to
enough water to be able to safely submerge themselves. Correct by Oct. 9, 2017.
The ferret cited for veterinary care during the last inspection is no longer at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.
