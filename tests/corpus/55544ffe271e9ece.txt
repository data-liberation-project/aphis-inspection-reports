Facilities, indoor.
On the floor of the room where the guinea pigs are housed, the floor has a crack and a small area (approximately the size
of a quarter) where the paint has chipped off the floor and exposed the concrete floor. The exposed concrete is not
impervious to moisture and therefore cannot be readily sanitized. Interior surfaces of housing facilities shall be
maintained so that they can be readily sanitized in order to ensure the health of the animals.
