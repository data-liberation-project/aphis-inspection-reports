2.126(a)(2)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The facility does not have access to the records (i.e Program of Veterinary Care, records of birth and or death, animal
inventory, animal acquisitions, etc.) which are required to be maintained and made available for review by USDA Officials
during inspection. Records shall be maintained on hand for access during unannounced inspections. Correct by January

3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
The primary enclosure housing the Black angus calf has accumulated piles of feces that have not been cleared out in
days. Accumulations of feces increase the risk of contamination from possible disease hazard. Excreta shall be removed
from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein, minimize
disease hazard, and reduce odors.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
The facility is storing extra supplies of wood, building supplies, pieces of old equipment along the outside of the fence of
the farm animal enclosure. There are piles of wood located inside of the camel enclosure that the camel has access to.
These piles of wood, equipment etc. create havens for rodent nesting and other vermin which increase the risk of disease


hazards. The items stored inside of the camel enclosure may allow the camel to become injured as well as create areas
for nesting vermin. All construction items stored within the pens shall be placed in an area that will not permit the camel
to come in contact with them and thereby protect the camel from possible injury. All broken boards laying on the ground
inside the enclosure shall be removed. The items stored along the outside of the fence shall be moved away from the
fence to allow for adequate cleaning and husbandry practices, and to allow appropriate rodent control.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
