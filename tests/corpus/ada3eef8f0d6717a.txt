Disposition records for animals are not being filled out accurately and completely. The address of the seller is not
listed, there is no date for the disposition and no method of transportation listed for two Tenrec's going to a zoo, or
ten hedgehogs going to a pet store. Disposition forms need to be completed with the required information to track
the movement of animals for their safety.
