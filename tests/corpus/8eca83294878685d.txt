2.8
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
The Inspector arrived at the facility for a routine inspection at 2:30 pm on November 6, 2018. The licensee was
contacted by phone and stated to the Inspector that he had moved from this address and sold his business and all
associated animals. He stated that no animals were at this site.
Failure to promptly notify Animal Care (AC) of changes in operation does not allow officials to inspect for the health
and well-being of the animals. The licensee is required to promptly notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail
of any change in the name, address, management, or substantial control or ownership of his business or operation,
or of any additional sites, within 10 days of any change.
Licensee was provided with form letter for license cancellation and animal disposition records were requested.
To be corrected by Nov. 18, 2018.
