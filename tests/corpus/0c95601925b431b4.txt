2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
On the evening of Oct. 3 2021 two zebras got out of their primary enclosure and went out the building and off of the facility
grounds and crossed a state highway. Their gate was found to have been opened and the building doors were open at
the time. Facility personnel and the licensee report they were captured about 2 hours later and no physical harm to the
zebras or public occurred. Having animals get loose off of the facility grounds and the capturing event could have caused
them stress. Ensure that animals are contained so that prolonged capturing events are not necessary.

Note: The facility reported this incident to the USDA and has made corrective actions to prevent further occurrences.
Ensure corrective actions are maintained from this day forward.
2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
During the inspection, the public was observed feeding the giraffe inside of the barn without an employee or attendant
present. The facility representative indicated an attendant has been present during the weekend, but not during the week.
Attendants must be present during periods of public contact, including feeding, to protect the animal and the public’s
safety.

Note: The facility placed an attendant in the giraffe barn prior to the exit briefing.
Ensure corrective actions are maintained from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
