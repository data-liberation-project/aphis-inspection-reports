2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is currently using the Record of Animals on Hand (APHIS Form 7019) and it is incomplete. The animals do not
have individual identification, two white-tailed deer are missing a date of birth and there is no information listed for where
the deer originated from.

The facility must make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information required
which includes the name and address of the person from whom the animal was purchased from, the USDA license or
registration number of the person whom the animal originated from, the name and address of the person whom the
animal was sold or given to and that person's license or registration number if licensed, the date the animal was acquired
or disposed of, the animal's individual identification, the animal's species or breed, the sex of the animal, the date of birth
or approximate age and the color or any distinguishing markings. This is to ensure that the animals may be tracked if
being used in regulated activities to ensure their humane care and use.

The facility must update and maintain the Record of Acquisition to include the information listed above.
To be corrected by February 1, 2022.

Handling of animals.
The facility representative states that the public throws fruits and vegetables into the white-tailed deer enclosure
frequently. There is no attendant at the deer enclosure to monitor the public and there are no signs posted to the public to
not feed the animals.

If public feeding of animals is allowed, the food must be provided by the animal facility and shall be appropriate to the type
of animal and its nutritional needs and diet to ensure the animals' health and well-being.

If public feeding is going to be allowed, the food must be provided by the facility.

Feeding.
The deer grain is being stored in an open topped portioned space against the external wall of the food storage building.
There is evidence of vermin eating the deer grain in several locations in and around the grain storage.

The food provided to the animals needs to be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination to maintain the health
and well-being of the animals.

The facility must ensure that the deer grain is stored in a manner to prevent contamination.

Sanitation.

The facility currently has an ineffective pest control plan in place for their food storage area. The deer grain is currently
being stored in an open topped portioned space against the external wall of the food storage building. The storage area
does not have a top and is easily accessible to vermin. There is evidence of vermin in the building eating the food. There
are sunflower seeds that have been separated out from the combined feed that has been chewed and piled in the corner
of the food storage area and on the shelf of the grain access door. In addition, there was one Multi-Catch rodent station
placed in the food storage building with a dead mouse. The Multi-catch rodent station did not have any bait or sticky
board present inside. The facility representatives were unsure when the station was last checked/serviced or if the station
was actively being monitored.

Having an ineffective pest control plan in areas with open food can lead to contamination of the food and impact the
animal's health and well-being.

The facility must ensure that that a safe and effective pest control plan is established and maintained.
