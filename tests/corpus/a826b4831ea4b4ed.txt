FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Currently, there are several areas missing in the perimeter fencing surrounding multiple non-dangerous exotic
animals housed outdoors. The licensee is doing construction on the premises and has taken down some of the
perimeter fence. A perimeter fence is required to keep unwanted animals and people from entering the facility and
making contact with the animals. The perimeter fence also acts as a secondary containment system. The licensee
must ensure that all covered exotic species housed outdoors are within an appropriate primary enclosure that is
located inside a perimeter fence. Correct by 7/10/2016.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
