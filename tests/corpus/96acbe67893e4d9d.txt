ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A adult female (tri colored mostly white with a black head and rump, and tan ears) was present in the row 2, third
top enclosure. This animal had a firm movable mass on its neck/under the chin that was approximately 2 cm in
diameter. The treatment for masses is not addressed in the program of veterinary care and there is no record that
this facility had identified this animal as requiring care or started any treatment. This guinea pig was nursing a litter,
housed with 3 other adults, and was eating and drinking normally during this inspection.
Standardized treatment protocols provided by the attending veterinarian in the program of veterinary care (PVC)
may be used by the facility to treat common conditions. When animals are identified as needing care the facility
must either initiate care as outlined in the PVC or obtain care by a veterinarian. The guinea pig with the mass above
requires examination and treatment by a veterinarian to prevent worsening of the condition and to prevent
spreading the illness to other animals. The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian to evaluate this animal
and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment. Correct by February 19, 2020.
