FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a one hundred sixty foot section of Barbados sheep enclosure fencing which is three feet high made of
vertical wooden slats. Several of these slats are missing and the keeper access gate has deteriorated to the point
where there are multiple layers of wooden fencing in this area. This wooden section of Barbados sheep enclosure
fencing is no longer structurally sound and the three foot height may be insufficient to keep the single sheep safely
contained in this enclosure. This section of fence must be repaired or replaced to safely contain the Barbados
sheep and to protect its health and well-being. To be corrected by: May 1, 2015.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
