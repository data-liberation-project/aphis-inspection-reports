2.131(b)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The following incidents occurred in 2015 at the Yemassee location which resulted in distress, injury, or death of
nonhuman primates.
On 8-28-15 a juvenile macaque was removed from its group and treated for trauma. Then its tattoo was read
incorrectly and it was placed into the wrong social group. Although fighting in the group was observed that day and
the new animal removed, it died of its injuries the next day. The facility stated they are retraining employees to
double check both tattoo areas on animals for identification and before returns to proper enclosures.
On 2-17-15, a rhesus macaque was found down in its home cage and immediately taken to the clinic for treatment
for dehydration. It was not until the next day when another animal was found to be dehydrated that it was
discovered the water line supplying the cage rack was still turned off from where the cages were pressure washed
on 2-11-15. The five remaining animals were taken to the clinic for medical examination and treatment of
dehydration and all survived. Although there is a Standard Operating Procedure in place for checking water lixits,
this was not followed when three different animal care technicians washed the cage rack down and did not check
the water lixits. In this case, lack of following protocols and inattention led to discomfort and illness of several
animals and the death of one. The facility states program wide retraining has been done and the facility is reviewing
and making additional programmatic changes to prevent future incidences.
All animal handling needs to be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm or
unnecessary discomfort.
3.80(a)(2)(3)PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During this inspection the USDA inspectors and the Attending Veterinarian entered Building 4 where a female
cynomologus macaque was found loose in the room. The animal escaped from its primary enclosure. Her cage
was closed with a clip not a lock. Two caretakers were notified and the animal was returned to a cage unharmed.
On 6-1-15 two cynomologus, escaped from an outdoor chain link enclosure at Yemassee primate center by
breaking some thin wire attaching the fence to the frame. One was captured with bait, but the other one needed to
be darted because it was near the perimeter fence. The darted one suffered internal injuries which even with
treatment, led to its death. All of the fencing attached like this is being replaced as quickly as possible.
All primary enclosures must contain nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure,
including by the animal. To be corrected from this day forward.
