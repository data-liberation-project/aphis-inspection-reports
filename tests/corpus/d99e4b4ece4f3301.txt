2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
All 5 of the Zebus were observed to have overgrown hooves that extended outward and were beginning to arch
upward. The toes on all of the Zebus were long due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to appropriately
maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s
program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail
care in a timely manner.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wire mesh material (used to prevent digging and escape) in the coyote enclosure and the raccoon enclosure
was exposed in several areas. The exposed mesh poses a risk of injury to the animal such as by abrading the foot
pads or entrapment and fracture of the legs. Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can
cause injury to the animals. A system of monitoring and maintenance should be in place so that all housing facilities
remain structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
