3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
Multiple rooms had stainless steel cages with damaged rims on water line access ports, resulting in sharp metal edges
the animals can reach. Guinea pigs may chew and pull on protrusions and sharp edges of the ports, causing more
damage to cages and possibly injuring their mouths. Primary enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury.
