ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The bottle of Ivermectin that is being used as heartworm prevention expired in February 2014. This bottle was used
for the March & April monthly heartworm prevention administration for the dogs. Both of the dogs have solar
dermatitis (sunburn red area) on their nose bridges which are currently & occasionally being treated by the licensee.

Expired medications are considered adulterated and not an an appropriate method to prevent disease. Consult with
your attending veterinarian before administering any further heartworm prevention medication. Also, consult with
your veterinarian and re-evaluate the solar dermatitis to see if there are other treatment options &/or increased
frequencies of treatment that might be recommended.
