HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage and waste disposal.
The outdoor waste collection tray on the west side of the sheltered housing facility containing 40 dogs has an
excessive accumulation of excreta. The facility representative stated the tray was washed about a week ago.
However, the excreta was not washed completely out of the tray and has accumulated on the north end near the
drainage pipe. The drainage pipe has come apart from the collection tray and should be reattached in order for the
drainage system to work properly. Numerous flies and other insects are present on and around the build-up of
waste material. Failure to remove the waste from the collection tray and maintain the collection of waste can create
disease hazards and attract pests which can affect the health and well being of the dogs. The licensee must provide
for regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes, water, other fluids and wastes,
in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin
and pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All drains must be properly constructed, installed, and
maintained.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Housekeeping for premises.
There is overgrown vegetation along the west and east sides of the sheltered housing facility containing 40 dogs.
Overgrown vegetation can harbor pests and can lead to disease hazards for the animals. Premises where housing
facilities are located must be maintained to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other
pests and vermin. Premises around the housing areas must be free of overgrown vegetation.
