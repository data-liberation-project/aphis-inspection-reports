CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
A dog arrived at the cargo holding area at SFO on Scandinavian flight # 935 from Copenhagen, on waybill #
117-68314960. Nowhere on the animal's enclosure was there information about when the animal had last been
offered food and water, or what the feeding and watering instructions were during travel.
The shipper or consignor must certify in writing that the dog was offered food and water during the 4 hours before
delivery to the transporter. The certification must be securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure in a
manner that makes it easily noticed and read. This certification must include specific instructions for feeding and
watering during travel. Failure to ensure that this information is provided, and clearly visible, could be detrimental to
the well being of the animal.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with cargo facility representatives for the airline.
