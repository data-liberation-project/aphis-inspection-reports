The outdoor runs of the sheltered building in the tent area are excessively dirty. There are nine enclosures containing 10
adults and 22 puppies. All nine outdoor runs are over three quarters covered in fecal material. Outdoor runs that are
mostly covered in feces, dirt and grime can harbor disease, lead to infection, and illness to the animals. The licensee must
ensure that floors by spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with
excreta.
