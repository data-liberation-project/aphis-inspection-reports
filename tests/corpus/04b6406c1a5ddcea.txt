3.84(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the Primate Shack, the following was noted in the food preparation area: 1) There were hard water / mineral
deposits on and around the sink and on a pan used to store clean food receptacles. 2) A plastic cup used to store
knives had a moderate accumulation of debris on the bottom of it. 3) One knife handle was wrapped in masking
tape. 4) At least three shelves in the refrigerator were worn and there was a moderate amount of rust present. 5)
The main food preparation table is worn with areas of rust. 6) The surfaces of the wall and ceiling, in front of the
sink, had a mild amount of debris.
The surfaces in a food preparation area where food, utensils, and receptacles are stored should be maintained in a
manner that allows the required cleaning and sanitizing to minimize the risk of food contamination.
Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings, must be kept clean to facilitate the husbandry
practices required in this subpart. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure housekeeping in animals
areas is being completed as required.
