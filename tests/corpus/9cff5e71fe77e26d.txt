CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest Control.
***The outdoor portion of the facility with 32 dogs had several of the dogs observed scratching. The following dogs
were given a closer observation which revealed them to be heavily infested with fleas; Pugs #0A02265243, #
0A02302065, #0A02303314, and Beagles #0A02264679, #0A02266054. The licensee was unaware the dogs had
fleas, and was currently not using any product to control the fleas. Fleas can transmit diseases and cause
discomfort to the dogs. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program of pest control so as to
promote the health and well being of the animals.
To be corrected by: July 10, 2015.
The veterinary care from the July 15, 2014 report has been addressed.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and Chad Proctor ACI.
