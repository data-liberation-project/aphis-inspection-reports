3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Cleaning.
Two primary enclosures, housing a total of 6 dogs, had an excessive accumulation of feces, which covered at least
half of the floor surface. Some of the feces was dry and turning a whitish color. The licensee stated that it had
been more than one day since the feces had been removed from the enclosures. An accumulation of feces can
contaminate the dogs, can cause odors, can attract pests, and can harbor diseases that can harm the dogs. The
licensee must ensure that waste material is removed from the enclosures on a daily basis and more often if needed.
TO BE CORRECTED BY THE END OF THE DAY.
The Bulldog named Bonnie from the August 14, 2014 inspection report had received veterinary care and her
condition was improving. All the other non-compliant items from the August 14, 2014 inspection report had been
corrected.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
