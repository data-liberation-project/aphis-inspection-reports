FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was a chain-link fence between the lone (fainting) billy-goat enclosure and the enclosure containing five goats
and one alpaca. This fence was bent toward the billy-goat enclosure at the top and the bottom near the front of the
enclosure where public feeding could occur. The bending created gaps between the fence and the ground at the
bottom and between the fence and the support bar at the top. These gaps were sufficiently large that a goat might
pass its head thru and possibly become entrapped. In the upper pasture also containing five goats, there was a
grounding bar outside the shelter that was bent away from the enclosure and presented an end nearly chest height
that could cause injury to the animals. Correct by assuring that bent and damaged fencing and metal posts are
identified and corrected to maintain good repair and protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by 4 November
2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
