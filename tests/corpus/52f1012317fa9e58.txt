3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** In an enclosure containing squirrel monkeys there was a hanging toy made of pvc pipe and fire hoses that were
covered in a brown and greenish residue. These surfaces have not been cleaned or sanitized. The fire hoses are
old and in a condition that may require them to be removed or replaced. The squirrel monkeys constantly come in
contact with these surfaces and they must be cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled
for the health and well-being of the animal. The toy made of pvc pipe was removed immediately and fire hose was
replaced.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the Zoo Director and the Deputy Zoo Director.
