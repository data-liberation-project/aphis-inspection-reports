HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wood in the back sheltered building for the Macaque has not been sealed. This enclosure cannot be adequately
cleaned and sanitized on a routine basis. These areas of wood need to be sealed to facilitate husbandry cleaning
for the species.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The coyote pen continues to have exposed chainlink wire on the bottom of the enclosure. Exposed wire can
entrap a paw and cause injury to the animal. Housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury. Ensure that the floor wire is adequately covered to protect the animal(cid:25)'s feet and limbs.
*** The cougar enclosure continues to have a wood sheltered box that is constructed of plywood. The box is not
lined inside with any material to add structural strength to the sheltered area. This needs to be addressed to assure
containment for the species.
***In the bear's enclosure, a metal post was noted to be bent and protruding into the animal area, posing an injury
risk to the bear. Also, the bear was noted to be pacing in approximately 6 inches of water while brushing against
the electric fence. The licensee stated that the fence was on, which may pose a potential electrical injury risk to the
animal.
***The bear's enclosure has a gap along the base of the back side of the primary enclosure fencing approximately 6
inches tall by 18 inches wide. The gap in fencing may allow contained animals to escape and/or allow entry of
unwanted animals, thereby posing a risk to the animals.
***The enclosure housing the hog Petunia has approximately 4 feet of bent, pushed up fencing along the bottom
edge along the back side, which serves as both the enclosure and perimeter fence. The damaged fencing may
allow contained animals to escape and/or allow entry of unwanted animals, both of which may cause harm to theanimal.
Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Although progress has been made in organizing the freezer storing meat for the big cats and exotics at the facility, it
needs to be addressed further. Two hooved limbs were partially wrapped in plastic, unlabeled and undated, lying
directly on a wooden pallet. There are boxes and bags of unidentified meat in the freezer. There are no dates on
most of the meat and no rotation schedule in use to assure food is used in a timely manner. The method of food
being stored in this freezer has improved but is not yet considered professionally acceptable to assure the food is
protected from deterioration and contamination.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosures housing the white tiger, lions, bear, pigs (3), raccoons and coatis contained mud and standing
water. Algae growth was noted in standing pools of water in the bear enclosure, one pot belly pig enclosure, and
the raccoon enclosure. The hyena, fox, and orange tiger enclosures were mostly dry today. The hyena's enclosure
has an area of gravel at the end closest to the visitor side. However, no other enclosure has received
improvements regarding ongoing drainage issues. Also, the gravel in the white tiger's enclosure has not mitigated
the drainage issues. Standing water and mud that does not dissipate rapidly can lead to hoof and foot problems
and other health concerns for the animals that cannot get or stay dry. Additionally, being wet for extended periods
of time may be distressing to the animals and impact their well being. The facility needs to take immediate action to
facilitate drainage in these enclosures for the health of the animals.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was an abundance of flies throughout the property and animal enclosures during the inspection. Heavy
numbers of flies were specifically noted around the coatis' food and the carcass in the lion enclosure. The excess
standing water and decomposing food material attracts flies and other pests, as does as the weed overgrowth noted
in several enclosures.
Abundant rodent feces were noted along the edge of the floor of the food storage shed, indicating there is not an
effective pest control program for mice in this area. Mice can carry diseases that can impact animal health.The facility needs to have a safe and effective program for the control of insects and rodents for the health of the
animals.
Perimeter fence variance remains under review.
