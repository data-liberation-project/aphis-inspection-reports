2.40(b)(3) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During the inspection, the following veterinary care issues were observed:

- In Pen #36, there is a gray and white adult guinea pig with generalized hair loss
- In Pen #53, there is a white and black adult guinea pig with generalized hair loss
- In Pen #52, there is a tan and gray young adult guinea pig with generalized hair loss, is reluctant to move, and appears
underweight
- In Pen #58, there is an adult gray and white guinea pig with hair loss and walks in an unsteady manner, resulting in loss
of balance and falling over when moving about the pen

All of these guinea pigs were in their original enclosures and were not quarantined or receiving treatment as advised by
the Program of Veterinary Care. When the inspectors alerted the licensee to the condition of these animals, the licensee
then moved them to the quarantine pens to receive treatment. By this time, the gray and white guinea pig who had been
in Pen #58 was now laterally recumbent after being moved to the quarantine pen.

In addition to the guinea pigs noted above, dead juvenile guinea pigs were noted in the following pens:

- Pen #47 (1 dead guinea pig)
- Brown pen (1 dead guinea pig)
- Pen #9 (3 dead guinea pigs)
- Pen #28 (2 dead guinea pigs)

During a discussion with the licensee, he stated that the children were in charge of the animals but some of the children
did not come in on a daily basis to observe the animals they are responsible for. Failure to identify guinea pigs who need
to receive treatment as directed by the Program of Veterinary Care can lead to an increase in severity of these conditions
as well as further disease spread to another animals. Leaving deceased guinea pigs in the enclosures can also increase
incidence of disease to the other guinea pigs. Correct by observing animals on a daily basis and following the Program of
Veterinary Care as directed by the Attending Veterinarian.
3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
During the inspection, it was observed that there were three adult guinea pigs and one young adult guinea pig that were
loose on the floor and hiding under enclosures. It was also noted that in Pen #58, which houses approximately 44
weanlings, they were able to go higher than the top of a section of the back wall of the enclosure. From the bedding to the
top of the wall was measured to be approx 4.25 inches.

Housing facilities need to be able to contain the animals. Loose animals and enclosures with low sides can lead to injury
or death of the guinea pigs. Correct by repairing enclosures so that they contain the animals and protect them from injury.
3.25(c)

Facilities, general.

On the floor of the room housing guinea pigs, there is an open bag of pelleted feed that is sitting directly on the floor and
the top of the bag is left open. Additionally, this bag is ripped on the bottom, resulting in feed spilling out onto the floor.

Open bags of feed need to be stored in containers with tightly fitting lids or covers. Failure to do so can lead to spoilage or
contamination. Correct by placing opened bags of feed into a container that can be sealed. Correct by November 30,
2021.
3.26(b) Direct

Facilities, indoor.
Upon entering the room where the guinea pigs are housed, the inspectors experienced burning of the eyes and nose due
to the severity of the ammonia odor in the room. There was a partially opened window and door leading into the room but
it was inadequate to properly ventilate the room.

Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs need to be adequately ventilated to provide for the health and comfort of the
animals at all times. Failure to do so can lead to health issues and respiratory problems for the animals. Correct by
increasing ventilation so as to minimize ammonia odors. Correct by November 18, 2021.
3.28(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
In Pens #58 and #59, the wood used for the side walls and floor of the enclosure is not sealed and is therefore not
substantially impervious to liquids and moisture. Unsealed wood cannot be adequately cleaned or properly sanitized and
allows the absorption of liquids and moisture, which can increase the risk of disease to the guinea pigs housed within
them. Correct by sealing all wood surfaces within the guinea pig enclosures.
3.29(d) Repeat


Feeding.
In Pen #31, the feed dispenser has been tipped and is lying sideways in the pen, completely devoid of feed. Other pens
are noted to have feed dispensers that are contaminated with feces.

Food receptacles shall be accessible to all guinea pigs and shall be located so as to minimize contamination by feces.
Failure to do so can spread diseases to the guinea pigs if they are forced to eat contaminated feed. Correct by
maintaining food receptacles and cleaning them as often as necessary to keep them free from feces.
3.30

Watering.
Several of the enclosures have water spigots within PVC piping that have fecal accumulation surrounding the spigot itself.
Water receptacles for guinea pigs need to be sanitized when dirty. Failure to do so can lead to the spread of disease as
well as the possible avoidance of water. Correct by sanitizing water receptacles when dirty and at a minimum frequency
of at least once every two weeks. Correct by November 27, 2021.
3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
There were several enclosures with an excessive accumulation of feces and wet/soiled bedding. The licensee stated that
the enclosures were last cleaned a week ago but the weekly cleaning process (method and frequency) utilized is not
effective in removing this accumulation. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards and
health problems. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, excreta,
and soiled bedding. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are cleaned as often as necessary to prevent this
accumulation.
3.31(b) Repeat

Sanitation.

The floor contained accumulations of spilled feed, feces, bedding, dirt, and debris. There were accumulations of dust,
debris, and cobwebs on upper walls, ceiling, animal enclosures, and racks. Animal facilities must be kept clean to ensure
good quality of air for the animals and to prevent unnecessary disease risks. Ineffective cleaning exposes the animals to
disease hazards and health problems. Correct by ensuring the premises are kept clean.
3.32 Repeat

Employees.
The facility still does not have sufficient help to adequately care for the number of guinea pigs housed and to keep up with
the general conditions of the facility. The licensees children are in charge of feeding, cleaning, and caring for the guinea
pigs but as the children are in school during the day and there are fewer daylight hours, there is insufficient help. Failure
to maintain a sufficient amount of help can be detrimental to the health of the animals due to lack of cleaning,
observations, or treatment of sick animals. Correct by adding additional help who are adequately trained to care for the
guinea pigs.
3.33(b)

Classification and separation.
Upon entering the room where the guinea pigs are housed, the licensee's orange tabby cat was sleeping in the primary
enclosure where five guinea pigs were quarantined as they undergo ringworm treatment.

Guinea pigs cannot be housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species. The presence of the cat in the
enclosure can lead to stress, injury, or death if the cat opts to hunt the animals. Correct by ensuring the cat or other pets
do not have access to the guinea pigs or their enclosures. Correct by November 18, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a licensee.
