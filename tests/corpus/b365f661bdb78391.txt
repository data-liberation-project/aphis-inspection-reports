Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
There has been a recent change in the part-time Attending Veterinarian for the Licensee. Although the new AV has visited
the premises (and provided care for some of the animals) and the Licensee is providing various types of enrichment to the
two species of Lemurs that are maintained at the facility, there is not a plan directed by the new attending veterinarian for
the environment enhancement to promote the psychological well-being of the lemurs. Per this Section, exhibitors must
develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological
well-being of nonhuman primates in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as directed by the
Attending Veterinarian. Correct by 9/15/22.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The following structural issues were identified during the inspection of the animal facilities.

*The fence between the bison and sheep enclosure is comprised of a wire mesh-style fence and wooden stockade-style
fence. There were several areas of the wooden fencing on the sheep side where one or more than one adjacent boards
were missing or broken off, and the wire mesh fence was visible. The gaps between the missing boards were wide


enough for a leg or head of a sheep to pass through and the areas with broken wood had sharp edges.
*The wooden stockade-style fence in the female goat pen next to the fallow deer enclosure had areas of disrepair. There
were several areas of the wooden fencing where a portion of a board was missing or broken off and the wire mesh
fencing of the fallow deer enclosure was visible. The gaps between the missing boards were large enough for a leg or
horn to pass through.
*One of the wooden shelters in the female goat pen next to the fallow deer enclosure had some areas of disrepair.
Portions of some of the shingles along the front edge of the roof were missing and an irregularly shaped hole in the back
wooden wall located at ground level was visible.
*The wooden stockade-style fence panel comprising the roof of one of the shelters in the pig pen was missing 1-2
adjacent boards and there was a gap in the roof of the shelter.

Per this Section, indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound, shall be maintained in good repair. and
shall protect the animals from injury. The Licensee needs to make repairs to the structural items listed.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
There was an excessive buildup of solid fecal matter in the area of the bison pen surrounding the feed receptacle used for
the hay/grain. The bison had to walk through and/or stand in the fecal material to access the feed receptacle. In addition,
the open end of the plastic pipe, that is used by the public to feed grain to the bison, exits near the area of the bison pen
with the buildup of excreta. Facility personnel stated that this area of the bison enclosure was last cleaned out 2 weeks
ago.
Per this Section, excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals, minimize disease hazards, and minimize odors. Standing in moist fecal material can affect the condition of the


feet and hooves of the bison and a more frequent schedule of cleaning the bison enclosure is indicated. Correct by
8/19/22.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
