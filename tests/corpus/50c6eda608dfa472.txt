2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The back side side of the jaguar, squirrel monkey/sloth/paca, raccoon, and pigs enclosures do not have a complete
barrier fence. This area is on a hill but the inspector was able to easily climb and walk up to the animal enclosures
with little effort.
A suitable barrier shall be erected in this area so that the public can't easily gain access to the animal enclosures, to
assure both the safety of the animals as well as the public.

3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some of the wood on the platforms of the chimpanzee and squirrel monkey exhibits were deteriorated and flaking
apart.
The surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be
readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. This may be accomplished by (but not
limited to) using plastic wood, new pressure treated lumber, or other impervious surfaces.

3.80(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The exhibit side of the chimpanzee enclosure had some protruding screws on the platforms that were left when the
wood deteriorated. The chimp platform metal framing had flaking rust. The wire mesh covering the drain pipe in the
dry moat also has also deteriorated leaving jagged edges. The ends of the metal hose clamps holding the PVC pipe
which surrounds the suspended cables had sharp edges. These primates can & do have contact with these
surfaces.All surfaces shall be free of points and edges which can potentially injure the primates.

3.84(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The chimpanzee exhibit was observed to have black and green algae on the floor, empty concrete pool, and back
wall. Large accumulations of dirt and leaves were in the dry moat and dirt/algae was observed in the inside the
empty small concrete pool. Cobwebs, dirt, & leaves were also seen hanging from the skylights in the dens. These
observances indicates that these areas are either either not properly or regularly cleaned.
The algae on the floors can become slippery which can cause injury to the primates. Housing facilities must be
cleaned when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices in order to protect the
health of the primates.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The skylights in the tiger & lion shelters had cobwebs, dirt, and leaves hanging. The plastic lens covers for the lights
in the commissary were cracked and had dead flies in them. These covers now have gaps which were directly
above the food preparation table which potentially would allow these flies to fall into the food below.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this
subpart.
To be corrected by 10-1-2014.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
