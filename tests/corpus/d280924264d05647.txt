ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
** I arrived at the facility at 5:00 pm. No one was available so I called the owner. The owner stated that they were at
a traveling site and would not be able to do the inspection. The traveling itinerary stated that they would be available
on March 28, 2016. The owner stated that she reported the dates of the fair and not the actual dates of travel. A
responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:00 pm on
03/28/2016. A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection
process.
