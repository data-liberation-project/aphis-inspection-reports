2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Two maltese females, 16 weeks of age (born 1/28/15), did not have official identification such as a tag, tattoo or
microchip. Facility representative said that she ran out of microchips and has to order some from her supplier.
Failure to properly identify all dogs on premises makes tracking of dogs difficult. Licensee must ensure that all dogs
are properly identified. Cage cards are acceptable when puppies are less than 16 weeks of age and maintained as
a litter in one enclosure. Dogs 16 weeks and older must have official identification.
