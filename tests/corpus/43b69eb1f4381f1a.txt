2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***During the inspection, it was noted that the facility was not following treatment directions provided by the
veterinarian. A treatment sheet for a 6 year old, neutered, hound mix named Bubba indicated that he had been
prescribed Rimadyl to be given orally twice a day beginning on 09/22/17 and ending when the medication had
finished. On 09/23/17 the treatment sheet indicated that Bubba had only received the medication once that day. It
was not until the time of inspection that facility staff realized that the treatment plan had not been properly adhered
to.
Injuries and diseases that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be painful and can lead to
prolonged suffering, infection, and other veterinary care health problems. The facility must use appropriate methods
to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Any change by the facility staff or students to
prescribed veterinary treatments should be discussed with and approved by the veterinarian.
