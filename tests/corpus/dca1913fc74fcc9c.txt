2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is no barrier fence at the back corner of the cat encounter structure. This break in the barrier fence allows
access up to a portion of the kangaroo & adjacent cavy exhibits. This area is not constantly monitored by zoo
employees.
There is also no barrier fence located opposite the entrance to the commissary. This also allows access up to the
serval exhibit as well as a portion of the dingo exhibit. These areas are also not constantly monitored by zoo
employees.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.

re-inspected to ascertain compliance.)

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The public is allowed to enter a lemur exhibit for encounters with 2 red ruffed lemurs & 2 black & white ruffed
lemurs. While inside the exhibit they remain seated on benches with a handler inside with them. During these
public encounters, the lemurs are permitted free access within the exhibit and can (and do) run around and jump on
and off of the seated patrons.
During an encounter, this inspector observed that when one of the lemurs jumped onto the 8 year old boy, the lemur
scratched the back of his neck. There were 2 visible longitudinal scratch marks (approx. 1"), but no blood, that were
easily visualized by this inspector. This boy also indicated that a lemur nipped at his ear lobe (but did not cause any
harm).The licensee indicated that there is a written SOP for this type of encounter, but that SOP was not being stored
on-site and therefore could not be reviewed.
These primates are not under the direct control (as defined as: to exercise restraint or direction over; dominate;
commands) of the handler during these encounters. This type of encounter also does not minimize risk of harm to
the public as it was observed on the day of the inspection.
Fixed public exhibits housing nonhuman primates, such as zoos, must have a barrier between the primary
enclosure and the public at any time the public is present, in order to restrict physical contact between the public
and the nonhuman primates. Nonhuman primates used in trained animal acts or in uncaged public exhibits must be
under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or trainer at all times when the public is present.
Trained nonhuman primates may be allowed physical contact with the public, but only if they are under the direct
control and supervision of an experienced handler or trainer at all times during the contact.

3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were four protruding nails along the left wall in the camel barn. These sharp points can potentially injure this
animal.
The facility indicated that this was corrected by the end of the inspection, but not re-inspected for compliance
The facility shall have an effective on-going system quickly to identify these types of sharp objects within all of the
enclosures and remove them when identified prior to being pointed out by an inspector.

3.126(c)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The light fixture in the left bear den, and the right front tiger den are not working. The intensity of the lighting does
not permit a thorough inspection of all of these areas, specifically to determine the structural integrity of the chain
link tops of the left bear den and the right front tiger den. The lighting in these 2 areas is noticeable darker than the
adjacent dens. It is also not uniformly distributed throughout all of the dens (some dens are much brighter than the
others in the same building)
Lighting shall be uniformly distributed and of sufficient intensity to permit routine inspector inspection to ascertaincompliance with the applicable standards &/or regulations.

An exit interview was conducted on-site with the facility director & facility assistant director. The Director did not
want to sign for the inspection report, and this report will be E mailed.
