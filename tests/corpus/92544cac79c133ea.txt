ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The approved written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) did not include rabbits. All covered species
should be addressed in the PVC to ensure the facility has a program to follow concerning the care of all the animals.
Failure to do so could adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals. A complete and accurate written
Program of Veterinary Care with consultation from the attending veterinarian must be in place.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A large, plastic bag containing timothy hay used to feed the guinea pigs and rabbits is currently being stored on the
floor of an empty animal enclosure. Food stored in this manner and location does not adequately protect such
supplies against deterioration and infestation or contamination by vermin. Food for all animals must be stored in
facilities which provide adequate protection against infestation, deterioration, or contamination by vermin.
Additionally, supplies of food for guinea pigs must be stored in containers with tightly fitting lids or covers. A system
of food storage which adequately protects the supplies of food for all animals must be in place.
