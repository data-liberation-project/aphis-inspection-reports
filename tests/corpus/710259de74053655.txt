FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During the March 2017 inspection USDA personnel noted several trees had been marked with pink ribbons. When
asked what the pink ribbons were for, the staff explained they were to identify trees that needed to be trimmed back.
Those trees were inside bear enclosures and next to fences. If properly motivated the bears could use the trees to
escape their enclosures. Those trees are still waiting to be trimmed because the only person capable of trimming
them has been on extended leave/light duty. The bear enclosures have not been adequately maintained to safely
contain the bears.
The trees identified by pink ribbons and any other trees that may be close to fences within animal enclosures need
to be trimmed to prevent possible escapes.

EMPLOYEES.
This facility has approximately 30 bears, 17 tigers, 2 lions, 3 cougars, 1 cheetah, 1 jaguar, misc small cats, other
mammals and wolves. The current animal care staff consists of 2 full time animal keepers, 1 keeper that would like
to be part time but has been working full time in order to make sure all the animals are cared for, 1 full time
employee who assists with animal care on a part time basis, and one facility maintenance person.
According to these employees they are working 10 to 12 hour days in order to get all of the animals cared for. On
days when one of the animal care employees is off, the remaining 2 ½ employees are doubly rushed to ensure all
the animals are cared for. Exhaustion and overwork can cause mistakes. Mistakes in this situation can mean
leaving a gate unlocked or open, not observing the animals for subtle signs of illness, not maintaining the integrity of
the enclosures properly, not properly cleaning enclosures.
Recently the maintenance person sustained an injury that required extended time off and light duty. Because there
is no one else capable of doing this work many important repairs were not done. For example, during the lastinspection of this facility it was noted that several trees next to fences inside bear enclosures had been identified to
be trimmed back. If the bears were motivated they could escape their enclosures by climbing these trees. At the
time of this inspection those trees had not been trimmed.
A sufficient number of adequately trained employees need to be hired to maintain a professionally acceptable level
of husbandry and to allow all employees adequate time off.
