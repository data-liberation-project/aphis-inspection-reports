2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 524 guinea pigs were counted during this
inspection including adults, weanlings, and newborns. There were no inventory records indicating the number of adults,
weanlings, or newborns present or animals that died. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the
health of the colony by identifying animal losses or deceased number of animals born and to track animals being used in
regulated activities to ensure their humane care and use. The licensee must maintain records containing the required
information which fully and correctly disclose the animals held, owned, and acquired and disposed of including births and
deaths.

Remains uncorrected.

Watering.
There is a buildup of dirt and debris around the automatic water valves and inside and outside of the PVC drainpipes.
Ineffective cleaning and sanitation around the automatic valves and drainpipes can expose the guinea pigs to disease
hazards and health problems. Correct by ensuring that all water valves and PVC drainpipes are kept clean and sanitized
often enough to prevent an accumulation of dirt and debris. Correct by February 25, 2021.


This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
