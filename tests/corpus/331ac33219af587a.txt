Facilities, outdoor.
There is a sizable hole dug under the perimeter fence by the south side of enclosure 15 as well as gaps beneath multiple
gates along the perimeter fence. These gaps range from 6-10 inches between the ground and the bottom of the gates.
An insufficient perimeter fence can allow unwanted animals to enter the facility and potentially harm the animals within.
The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
To be corrected by July 18, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
