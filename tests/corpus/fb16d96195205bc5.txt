3.56(a)(2)
SANITATION.
Two of the rabbits enclosures had a buildup of excreta. The licensee stated they were last cleaned out about three
weeks ago. Enclosures not cleaned out on a weekly basis can contribute to the spread of disease not only among
the rabbits, but also any person that may come into contact with those rabbits. The enclosure needs to be cleaned
on a weekly basis. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
