2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(a)(2) Veterinary care: One fallow deer fawn and four goat kids are being hand raised by the licensee.
Their diet and care have not been approved by the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian must have the
appropriate authority to ensure the provisions of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other
aspects of animal care and use. Specific guidance in the procedure for hand raising baby animals by the attending
veterinarian is required to ensure the animals are receiving an adequate diet and care for their growth and
well-being. Failure to have written, specific, accurate guidance does not ensure that the attending veterinarian is
aware of the current practices at the facility and also does not ensure that the facility is providing adequate care for
the baby animals. Correct by having the attending veterinarian review and approve written descriptions for the diets
and care for the fawn and kids. This information may be an attachment to the facility written Program of Veterinary
Care. Correct by August 1, 2016.
Note: The goat cited on the May 5, 2016 inspection report had her hooves trimmed.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility co-owner.
