Facilities, general.
The indoor housing for the coyotes has paint chipping and flaking in areas accessible to the animals. The ceiling and far
wall of the right enclosure has areas of white paint that are flaking. The ceiling has several pieces of white paint hanging
off that can fall directly into the enclosure. Along the far wall of the same enclosure, at the level of the animals, there are
some areas of chipping and flaking paint that can easily be broken off. Flaking and chipped paint can fall into an
enclosure and be consumed by the animals, leading to potential illness. Correct by 25 May 2022 by ensuring the facility is
maintained in good repair to prevent the animals from injury or illness.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
facility representative.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by 11 July 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
