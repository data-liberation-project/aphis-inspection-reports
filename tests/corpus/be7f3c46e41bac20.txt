and or communicating findings with the AV could result in inadequate medical care for animals and have significant
negative impacts on the health of the animals. Per the regulations, daily observation of all animals to assess their health
and well-being; Provided, however, That daily observation of animals may be accomplished by someone other than the
attending veterinarian; and Provided, further, That a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that

Handling of animals.
The following animal enclosures were not secured and/or locked to prevent unattended patrons from entering the
enclosures: ringtail lemurs, serval, kinkajou, sloth, fox, coati, porcupine, wolves, goats, pigs, hedgehog, rabbit. Not
supervising patrons who could directly access the animal enclosures puts both the patrons and the animals at risk of


injury. Per the regulation, during public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the
animal and to the public, with sufficient barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the
safety of animals and the public. Correct by 11Dec2021.

Handling of animals.
At least seven groups of patrons were observed interacting with animals with no identifiable attendant present. Most
concerning was the presence of a patron inside the lemur housing area between the barrier door and enclosure door –
neither of which were secure and no attendant was present. Patrons were also observed in the kinkajou and sloth areas
with no attendant present and unsecured/unlocked enclosure doors. Not supervising patrons who can directly access the
animal enclosures puts both the patrons and the animals at risk of injury. Per the regulations, a responsible,
knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public
contact.
