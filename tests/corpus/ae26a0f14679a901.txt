WATERING.
Two guinea pigs in an enclosure were biting at their water bottle. I checked the ball on the bottle and no water was
coming out. I took the bottle out and taped it on a wood board. Several pieces of hardened bedding and feces
came out of it. I checked it again and water was now coming out of the bottle. When I replaced the bottle the two
guinea pigs fought over getting water. I asked the licensee to add a second bottle and she did. Both guinea pigs
drank for over 2 minutes straight.
Potable water shall be provided daily.
Check all water bottles daily to ensure they are working and are providing water to the guinea pigs.

EMPLOYEES.
The licensee has previously used an employee to help with daily care and cleaning of the guinea pigs. Because of
the number of citations for basic animal care it appears the licensee is unable to care for the guinea pigs by herself.
A sufficient number of employees shall be utilized to maintain the prescribed level of husbandry practices set forth in
this subpart.
If the licensee cannot provide even basic care for the guinea pigs on hand then an employee must be hired to
ensure that the needs of the guinea pigs are being met.
