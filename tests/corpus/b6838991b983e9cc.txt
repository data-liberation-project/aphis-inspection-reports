3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
One large dog does not have a shelter in his outdoor enclosure. The enclosure is under a roof with the back
against a building and there are solid walls on each end of the group of enclosures but no specific shelter in this
enclosure. A shelter is important to provide the dog with protection from the wind, rain, cold air and other
environmental extremes. Without this protection, the dog could suffer discomfort or become ill. The licensee must
provide a shelter that is accessible to each animal in each outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow each
animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely.
Correct from this day forward.
