2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several expired medications were found intermingled with current supplies:
--2 vials of Fatal Plus expired 04-14
--1 vial of Diazepam expired
--2 vials of Epinephrine expired 7-14 and 6-13
--2 boxes of Clavamox tablets expired 4/13 and 3/13
Expired drugs, especially those used for emergencies, euthanasia, anesthesia, or pain relief, are not safe or
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot
be guaranteed and the animals may experience pain and distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or
due to unexpected side effects.
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
To be corrected by 8/31/2015.
3.106(b)(1)
WATER QUALITY.
The coliform count in the harbor seal and polar bear pools has exceeded 1000 Most Probable Number (MPN) per
100 ml of water for multiple consecutive and intermittent weeks since April 2015 and the facility has not complied
with the requirement to collect two subsequent samples at 48 hour intervals. Since a juvenile harbor seal was born
in June 2015, the facility has not been using chlorine in that primary enclosure pool. The facility has attempted to
address the coliform spikes with partial water changes and cleaning of the pool more often but this has not reduced
the total count below 1000 MPN. The polar bear pool has been more intermittent with high spikes in coliform counts
but the testing during has not been done frequently enough to meet the requirements and to detect these increases
more quickly so that they can be addressed in a timely manner.High counts of coliform bacteria in the environments of marine mammals pose a risk to the health of these animals,
particularly a juvenile seal whose immune system is not mature.
The coliform bacteria count of the primary enclosure pool shall not exceed 1,000 MPN (most probable number) per
100 ml. of water. Should a coliform bacterial count exceed 1,000 MPN, two subsequent samples may be taken at
48-hour intervals and averaged with the first sample. If such average count does not fall below 1,000 MPN, then the
water in the pool shall be deemed unsatisfactory, and the condition must be corrected immediately.
The Curator did increase the ozone level in the seal pool during the inspection and two subsequent samples of the
water should be tested at 48 hour intervals, before 4 PM on 8/2/2015 and 8/4/2015, to ensure this reduces the total
count.
Additional testing and mechanisms shall be added to correct this problem in both marine mammal pools
immediately.
Education of the employees responsible for water quality assessment shall be conducted so that the testing and
corrective actions are compliant with the AWA standards by 8/7/2015.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter fence.
Several sections of the perimeter fence need to be repaired or replaced to be in compliance with the AWA
standards:
--Service road section of fence had trees with limbs on top of the fence, compromising the integrity and height. A
wild black bear was found within the perimeter of the zoo in this area within the last month indicating that the fence
is not able to restrict access by animals to the facility.
--New fencing along the service road had gaps that were approximately 6 inches in height and extending the full
length of one of the 6 foot panels.
--Several gates along the perimeter fence had gaps that ranged between 4-12 inches in height and /or width which
are large enough to allow unwanted persons or animals to pass through (service road gate, electric gate, old exit
gate with turnstile and swing gate)
--Two areas had equipment, plants on plywood panels laid on top of barrels, and other materials piled against the
fence which effectively reduces the height from 8 feet to approximately 4-5 feet in height (service road near the
horticulture area and the shop area).
--The fence behind the caribou and brown bear enclosures had a gap at the bottom hat was 6 inches in height
along 2, 6 foot panels .
--A large tree was growing into the fence near the otter/seal off exhibit holding and was causing the fence to bowand weakens its structural strength.
--The vegetation along several areas of the fenceline (visitor parking lot and far end of the service road between
tigers and the swan pond) has become so overgrown that the fence cannot be observed or accessed for
maintenance.
--The fence was less than 8 feet in height behind the shop area, at the old admissions building next to the parking
lot, and at the greenhouse at the far end of the parking lot.
Perimeter fences that are not maintained to be able to restrict unwanted persons or animals from entering the
facility or act as a secondary containment for exhibit animals pose a risk to the exhibit animals due to potential
contact resulting in injury, exposure to infectious diseases, or prevention of escape from the premises.
A perimeter fence is required to protect the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons
from going through it or under it and to act as secondary containment should exhibit animals escape from their
primary enclosure. Fences less than 8 ft in height for facilities housing dangerous animals must be approved by the
Adminstrator in writing.
Inspection conducted with the Curator on 7/31/2015, Exit interview conducted with Curator and AC VMO, Tracy
Thompson, DVM on 8/1/2015.
