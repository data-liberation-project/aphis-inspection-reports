SANITATION.
In the enclosure housing 23 fallow deer and 1 llama a dead baby skunk was observed lying in the shelter. The
skunk and other pests can carry and transmit diseases to the animals and poses a health risk. A more effective
method of monitoring and preventing in/around primary enclosure should be implemented. Establish and maintain a
safe and effective pest control program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, avian and mammalian pests.
Removal of the skunk is to be done immediately.
