FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the alpaca's primary enclosure there is a fence that has excess wire hanging from it. There is enough slack in
the hanging wire for the animals to become entangled. Also some of the wire has pointy ends which could injure the
animals. The excess wire shall be removed and/or repaired to protect the animals from injury. Correct by October
13, 2014.
The exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
