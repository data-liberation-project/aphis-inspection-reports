FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a)
***** At time of inspection the fence located along the river for the reindeer which at times is submerged partially
under the water from the river when it rises has rusted and needs replacement. The wire currently used is welded
wire and should be replaced with a wire that is better suited for containment of reindeer such as the game fence
which the new enclosure for these reindeer is construted of or a material similar in tensil strengh to the game fence.
The support system for the current fence will not be appropriate for what ever type of fence is selected which would
be considered adequate to contain reindeer appropriately. A support system which can support the material
selected and also withstand partial submersion by the river needs to be erected at time of fence replacement.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(b)
***** At time of inspection a new primary enclosure for the reindeer had been constructed. This enclosure provided
no shelter for the reindeer from inclement weather. A shelter large enough for all animals in the enclosure to have
acess to if desired needs to be constructed that will provide protection from inclement weather and aid in preventing
discomfort to the animals located in this enclosure.
