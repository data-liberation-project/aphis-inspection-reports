SANITATION.
Evidence of vermin/pest infestation was observed at the facility's food preparation room. Several spiders, a frog,
and spider webs were observed making contact with recently washed food bowls. Additionally, rodent droppings
were observed in the floor. The potential for contamination by vermin/pests should be minimized at all times to
prevent health issues on the regulated animals. A safe and effective program for the control of insects,
ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained.
