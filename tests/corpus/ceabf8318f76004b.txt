Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two llamas were due to be sheared in the spring and have not been sheered yet. Their coats now have matted fur and
they have overgrown hooves. Matted fur can be painful and not longer acts as an insulator against heat which can
negatively impact the animals during summer. Llamas should be sheered as a preventative measure for coat
maintenance to reduce overheating in the summer months. Additionally, overgrow hooves can cause added pressure on
the foot pad and cause potential lameness. These animals need to be sheered and have feet trimmed on a routine basis
for their health and well being.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of the inspection, the llamas and goats were not documented as acquired by the facility. In addition, two red
ruffed lemurs were acquired in Oct 2020 (information obtained from another facility) but were never added to the facility
inventory. The female lemur died in March 2021 and her death was not recorded and the male was then transferred to
another facility in April 2021 and there is no disposition record for when he left the facility or where he went to. Records
containing required information such as: animal movements, births and deaths need to be recorded in a timely and

accurate manner to account for all animals at the facility.

Sanitation.
The two rabbits are housed in a large metal round tub. Just under the layer of shavings there is a ring of rust that goes
around the whole diameter of the tub about 1-2 inches in depth. This ring of rust does not allow the enclosure to be
effectively cleaned and sanitized. Rabbits must be housed in enclosures with surfaces that can be effectively cleaned and
sanitized for their health.
