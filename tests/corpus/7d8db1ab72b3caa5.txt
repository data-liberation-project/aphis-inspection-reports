3.106(b)(3)
WATER QUALITY.
Water samples are collected at 8:00 AM daily. On May 13, 2015, no sample(s) were taken from the DNP pool for
salinity & pH determinations, but were taken for chlorine testing. On the same day, no sample was obtained from
PPP for salinity levels, but was also taken for chlorine. On May 15, 2015, no samples were taken from DNP for
either pH or salinity determinations, but were again taken for chlorine. There, however, were no detrimental effects
on water quality or the animals in these pools due to the lack of these tests on these dates
It appears that if the responsible person(s) does not collect these water samples (for any reason) at 8:00 AM than it
does not get done that day. There are no checks to assure that all of the required water samples are taken daily.
A mechanism for assuring that all required water samples, (and water tests) shall be collected & tested daily shall
be implemented.
