3.6(c)(2) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
An adult female Poodle named Posey was lying on her side in an enclosure with three other adult dogs. She did
not move her legs or appear able to rise. When the licensee attempted to pick her up she appeared painful and
snapped at the licensee who had to wrap her in a towel to be able to pick her up. Even when she was removed
from the enclosure, the dog made no effort to stand or use her legs. There was blood covering the back half of her
body and what appeared to be bite wounds on her legs and back. Dogs may be injured when housed with more
dominant or aggressive dogs. The licensee must ensure that dogs housed together in the same enclosure are
compatible.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
****There was a strong odor of urine and feces in the whelping area located in the red building. Most of the
catch-pans under the dog enclosures with grill-type floors contained a lot of urine and feces. The feces under one
pen was dried and was covered in hair, indicating that the pan had not been emptied and cleaned for quite a while.
****Many of the outdoor portions of the sheltered facilities had an excessive amount of feces on the concrete
flooring. Two of these enclosures had so much feces that the dogs could not avoid stepping in the feces and had
fecal matter on their feet.
****During the inspection, the licensee sprayed water with a hose into an enclosure to clean the flooring. The spray
from the hose wetted the dogs inside the enclosure.
Excessive feces and urine can be a disease hazard, can cause odors, and can attract insects and other pests. The
licensee must clean the primary enclosures and the pans underneath them as often as necessary to prevent an
accumulation of excessive waste. When cleaning the enclosures the licensee must ensure that the dogs are not
wetted in the process.TO BE CORRECTED BY SEPTEMBER 23, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
