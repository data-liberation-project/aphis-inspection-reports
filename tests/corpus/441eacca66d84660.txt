2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process from 615 pm to
646 pm on 08/03/2016.
Inspector arrived at 615 pm and called home phone on file with no answer at 616 pm. Cell phone number
provided by facility was called at 618 pm where licensee's grandson answered and stated licensee should be at
home. Inspector asked grandson to contact licensee for the inspection. Inspector waited until 642 pm and called
cell phone again with no answer. A message was left on cell phone. The facility has a gate across the driveway
that does not allow access to the house.
Failure to allow APHIS officials to complete an unannounced inspection does not satisfy the requirements of the
Animal Welfare Act and makes it impossible to determine if the facility is in compliance with the Act and its
regulations.
Correct this by ensuring availability for future unannounced inspections.
