3.53(a)(4)

Primary enclosures.
An outdoor enclosure housing two lionhead rabbits has a dirt floor with wire panels buried under the soil. In numerous
places, the rabbits have dug holes in the dirt leaving exposed wire with empty space underneath. This is a potential injury
and entrapment risk to the animals. The facility must ensure that the flooring is safe for the rabbits and maintained in
good repair.
