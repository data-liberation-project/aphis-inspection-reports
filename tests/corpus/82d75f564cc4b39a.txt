2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female reindeer named "Clarice" was significantly underweight. The ribs, spine, and hip bones were
visually prominent under her haircoat, indicating a lack of adequate fat covering. Weight loss can be the result of
nutritional deficiencies, dental problems, underlying medical conditions, or parasites.
This reindeer also had many patchy areas of hair missing over her back and rump. The skin in these areas felt
crusty and small clumps of hair were continuing to fall out. Skin problems can be caused by bacteria, fungus,
parasites, or underlying medical conditions. They may also be contagious to people or other animals. The licensee
must have this reindeer examined and treated by a veterinarian BY DECEMBER 29, 2017. If the animal's condition
does not resolve with treatment or if it returns, the licensee must consult a veterinarian for further evaluation and
treatment.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative on December 18, 2017. Phone
messages with the result of the inspection findings were left for the licensee on December 18 and December 22.
The inspection took place at a venue in Branson, MO.
