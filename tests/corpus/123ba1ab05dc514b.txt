FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the time of this inspection the tiger and black leopard did not have access to shade. Their enclosure did have
shaded areas but those areas were closed to them. As we walked around the employees were throwing hay onto
the top of the enclosure. The leopard immediately moved into the shade provided by the hay. The temperature and
humidity at the time were approximately 85 F and 87% humidity. Animals must have access to shade at all times
when sunlight is likely to cause discomfort or overheating.
To be corrected immediately.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The pot-bellied pigs did not have access to adequate shelter. There have been severe rain storms throughout the
area over the past several days. The pigs had a shade cloth but no shelter to get out of the rain. All animals kept
outdoors must have access to shelter that protects them from inclement weather.
To be corrected immediately.

SANITATION.
There were a large number of flies in the tent housing most of the animals. Flies can spread disease and cause
irritation to the animals. Some type of pest control needs to be established and maintained to minimize insects.
To be corrected immediately.
