2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In the last two semiannual reports to the Institutional Official, there were multiple deficiencies noted from the
program and facility reviews; however, there was no distinction of significant versus minor deficiency, no specific
plan for correction, and no dates by which these deficiencies must be corrected. These aspects of the report ensure
that the committee informs the Institutional Official of any program deficiencies, identifies facility needs, and, if
present, animal welfare issues, as well as establishing a plan for correction of deficiencies. Animal welfare may be
negatively impacted if a plan for correction of deficiencies is not developed and followed. All reports to the
Institutional Official must identify departures from the regulations or standards, distinguish significant from minor
deficiencies, and provide a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency.
TO BE CORRECTED ON THE NEXT SEMIANNUAL REPORT.
2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In the school's teaching protocol, the rationale for numbers of animals to be used is not given. The instructor
proposing animal activity shall provide a rationale for the number of animals to be used for the review and approval
by the IACUC. By not providing this rationale, an unnecessary amount of animals may used for covered activity.
Protocols must contain a rationale for the number of animals to be used.
TO BE CORRECTED BY 1 DECEMBER 2020.
