2.33(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
In the lab surgery space there were expired supplies stored that might have been used on survival peromyscus mouse
surgeries since the last inspection including sterile scalpel blades (Exp 6/2021), eye lubrication (Exp 2/22), and isoflurane
(Exp 30Sep2014). Non-expired scalpel blades and eye lubrication were open and towards the front of the storage and
were more likely to have been used in recent surgeries, however the expired items cannot be ruled out as not being used.
It was not clear why or how long the expired bottle of isoflurane had been there and it is unknown to what extent it had
been used.
The use of expired medical items in survival surgery, especially anesthesia drugs can cause adverse effects to animals.
Ensure that expired medications and surgical supplies are stored in a manner that prevents improper use of these items.
Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
