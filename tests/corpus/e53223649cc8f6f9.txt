***The adult male capybara has a generalized thinning of its fur of unknown cause.
***One prairie dog has no fur on its tail and patches of thinning, ruffled fur.
The attending veterinarian has not been contacted to discuss the condition of the animals in a timely manner. In doing so,
the proper diagnosis and treatment for the condition of the fur is delayed.
It is important to maintain direct and frequent contact with the attending veterinarian when animals demonstrate any
illness or abnormal medical condition to ensure optimum health of the animals and to minimize the spread of disease. The
prairie dog and the male capybara must be examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment for the abnormal
haircoats. Additionally, a plan to report illnesses to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner must be developed and
followed. Correct by March 8, 2022. The licensee has scheduled an appointment with the veterinarian on March 8, 2022

haphazardly stored throughout the room. Items such as a ladder and other equipment are being stored on top of the
porcupine and bettong enclosures. Other Items include: tools, unplugged heaters, hanging cords, miscellaneous
equipment in an open drawer on the stairs,
