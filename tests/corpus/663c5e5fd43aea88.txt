3.75(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 5/14/17 a young male chimpanzee escaped the primary chimpanzee outdoor enclosure, and was able to access
an incompatible older male chimpanzee which was housed in the off-exhibit enclosure. There was a brief altercation
between the two, during which the older male lost one half of its left middle finger. The younger male then entered
the off-exhibit night house enclosure, and was secured by a keeper.
The same young male chimpanzee was able to escape from the primary enclosure in June, 2014. Zoo staff had
made modifications to the enclosure to prevent any further escapes, but apparently these were inadequate.
Enclosures for non-human primates must be constructed in a manner so that they contain the animals securely, in
order to protect the animals and the public. An enclosure that allows escape puts the animal and the public at
serious risk.
Zoo staff has now added a prominent kick-in barrier at the top of the entire enclosure, with thirteen strands of
electric wire, in addition to smoothing out the wall of the enclosure, to eliminate possible hand/foot holds. The facility
should continue to monitor all enclosures to ensure that they adequate contain the animals housed within.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the zoo director.
