3.6(a)(2)(x)

Primary enclosures.
One enclosure containing one adult husky and one adult eskimo is constructed with raised plastic flooring. The flooring
has shifted along one side creating a gap between the side fence panel and the floor. The inspector measured the gap
and found it to be larger than the eskimo's front foot. The gap is large enough that the dog's foot and leg could pass
through. Gaps large enough to allow a dog's foot and leg to pass through could cause injury to the dog.

Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury and does not allow
the feet to pass through any openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the flooring in a manner that eliminates the
ability of the dog's foot and leg to pass through the gap. The licensee must ensure that the primary enclosures are safe
for the dogs at all times.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class "A" license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by 19-December-2022 or the applicant will forfeit the
license fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License

Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
