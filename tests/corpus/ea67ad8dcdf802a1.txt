ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 7 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian.
In Building 1, Pen 5 there was a brown and tan weanling housed with 17 weanlings. The weanling was laying on its
side and was severely lethargic and minimally responsive. The weanling was observed to have a decreased
respiratory rate. The weanling also had an episode lasting approximately 30 seconds in which it kicked its back feet
and its body contracted in spasms and gradually relaxed. This animal had died by the time the inspection was
completed. The facility reported they had not observed any problems with the animal when they had performed
their daily observation that morning.
In Building 1, Pen 29 there was a tri-color adult guinea pig with a skin abnormality that was housed with 6 other
guinea pigs. There was a circular area of hair loss approximately 2 cm in size on the bridge of the nose. The skin
in this area appeared reddened. The facility had observed the condition but was not treating according to the
program of veterinary care and had not contacted the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was
contacted and was not comfortable with the facility failing to treat this animal according to the program of veterinary
care.
In Building 2, there were 5 adult guinea pigs with swellings under the chin. The swellings ranged in size from .5 to 1
inch in size and were firm movable masses. These were observed on a brown and white adult in pen 1, a brown
and black adult in pen 3, a black and white and a tri-color adult in pen 4, and a brown adult in pen 8. The facility
had observed the swellings but was not treating according to the program of veterinary care and had not contacted
the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was contacted and was not comfortable with the facility failing
to treat these animals according to the program of veterinary care.
Newborns that are lethargic and depressed can rapidly worsen and die if not evaluated and treated. Skin conditions
with hair loss and redness can be a sign of numerous infectious and non-infectious causes and requires
examination by a veterinarian and appropriate diagnostic testing to determine the underlying cause and determine a
treatment plan. Swellings in the neck can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health
and well-being of the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications.
Delays in providing appropriate veterinary care for these conditions can result in worsening of the condition and
potentially spread to other unaffected animals if infectious in nature. The licensee must communicate with the
attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.Correct by: February 5, 2020

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The hay being fed to the guinea pigs in Building 1 was being stored directly on the floor of the facility. Bedding in
Building 1 was being stored in open bags on the ground. The guinea pig pelleted feed in Building 2 was being
stored in open bags on the ground.
Feed/food and bedding that is stored inappropriately can result in deterioration of the food or be contaminated by
pests, mold, or other sources and if used, cause illness in the animals.
Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against spoilage or
deterioration and infestation or contamination by vermin.

3.26(b) DIRECT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There was a strong ammonia odor throughout the indoor guinea pig housing areas causing the inspector’s eyes and
nose to burn. In Building 1 there were only a few windows partially open and in Building 2 there were no windows,
doors, or vents open.
Failure to provide fresh air can cause respiratory distress and expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards.
The indoor housing facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.
Correct from this day forward
3.26(d) DIRECT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In Building 1, all of the self-feeders attached to the inside of the guinea pig enclosures contained fecal material and
bedding material mixed in with the feed. The fecal material appeared dry and not fresh and there was little to no
pelleted feed available in some feeders and the guinea pigs were observed reaching over the top of the feeders to
access fresh feed.
Failure to clean feeders often enough to prevent contamination with fecal material can result in avoidance of food or
spread of disease.
Food receptacles must be located to minimize contamination by excreta and must be kept clean.
Correct from this day forward
3.31(a)SANITATION.
Many enclosures require additional cleaning. Approximately 25% of the enclosures in Building 1 and all of the
enclosures in Building 2 have an accumulation of excess fecal material, debris, dirt, and discarded feed mixed in
with the bedding.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the
enclosure, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material
and sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.
