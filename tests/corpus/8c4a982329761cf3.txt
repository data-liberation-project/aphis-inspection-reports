FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The paddock fence for the zebra "Rambo" is in disrepair. There is a section on the left side of the pen that has
been bent or pressed down by the zebra compromising the structural strength. There is also a portion of the main
fence separating the pasture on the left that has been compromised. The fence shall be repaired or replaced to
securely contain the zebra within his enclosure and protect him from harm. Correct by February 15, 2016.
Exit briefing conducted with the co-owner.
