ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current program of veterinary care is incomplete. There is no information provided indicating any vaccinations
given. There is nothing describing the parasite prevention or control program for any of the animals (exotics and
domestic warm blooded). A detailed description of methods of prevention, sampling, medications and treatment
must be included in the written program of veterinary care. Correct by April 1, 2016.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The male fox "buddy" has a bald area of skin on his back near the base of his tail that is approximately 2 - 3 inches
in diameter. The skin appears to be very shiny and pink. This condition had not previously been observed by the
owner or staff prior to this inspection. Adequate daily observation of the animals is required to assess the animals
health and well-being. Any abnormal findings shall be communicated to the attending veterinarian to ensure
appropriate treatment can be provided. Appropriate veterinary care shall be provided to the fox. Correct by March
25, 2016.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
About 30 percent of the ground in the fox enclosure has the dig barrier exposed. The dirt has eroded or been dug
out leaving gaps beneath the hog wire dig barrier that range from shallow to holes greater than eight inches in
depth. The gaps and holes are hazardous and may allow the fox to get his limbs trapped or become injured while
running around the enclosure. The dig barrier shall be buried properly and all of the holes filled in and maintained to
create a safer environment for the fox.
The hardware cloth at the base of the fence in the raccoon enclosure has been pulled away from the fence leaving
sharp edges and a gap that could allow the raccoon to become trapped or injured. The fence shall be repaired and
the mesh wire secured, removed or replaced to protect the animals from injury.The second level platform for the ferrets has broken in one corner leaving it tilted and not secured to the enclosure
wall. This may allow the platform to fall and cause injury. The platform shall be made structurally sound to protect
the well being of the ferrets.
The divider walls in the shed for the goats has chicken wire partially attached to it. The chicken wire has corroded
and been broken leaving large holes and sharp points. The gate to the camel enclosure also has additional wire
fence material attached to it that has been bent and broken leaving sharp points that may cause injury. All sharp
points and broken or corroded fence material shall be removed and/or replaced if necessary. Corrected prior to end
of inspection.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The room housing the ferrets, birds and chinchillas is cluttered. The sink used to clean the food and water bowls is
cluttered and needs to be cleaned. Excessive clutter interferes with proper cleaning which may lead to vermin and
pest control problems as well as increase the risk of contamination of food and water. The room and sink shall be
cleaned and maintained in a manner that will facilitate adequate husbandry practice. Correct by March 28, 2016.
Exit briefing conducted with the owner.
