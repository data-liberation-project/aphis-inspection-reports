3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the great ape escape area, the Chimpanzee Day Room #4 contains numerous logs connected together
providing climbing/resting structures for the enclosed primates. There are numerous splitting logs and numerous
logs that are deteriorated to the degree that they are no longer anchored securely to the floor and/or walls of the
room. Due to the wood loss, their structural integrity is affected and they cannot be cleaned and disinfected
properly since the wood is cracked, jagged and no longer adequately sealed. The facility must repair or replace all
affected logs, and must ensure that all climbing structures are sound and free of rust and jagged edges.
- In the great ape escape area, the Gorilla Day Room #1 contains numerous logs connected together providing
climbing/resting structures for the enclosed primates. There are numerous logs that are deteriorated to the degree
that they are no longer anchored securely to the floor. Due to the wood erosion and splitting the structural integrity
is affected and they cannot be cleaned and disinfected properly since the wood is cracked, jagged and no longer
adequately sealed. The floor has peeling paint in the bottom level of the room. The surfaces of housing facilities
must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or
removed or replaced when worn or soiled.
