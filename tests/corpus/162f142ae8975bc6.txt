3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On April 7, 2015 one beaver pushed through it's primary enclosure fence and escaped from it's enclosure. This
beaver was observed in the park area around the enclosure. It returned on it's own to it's enclosure on 12 April
2015. Failure of the primary enclosure to contain the animals puts them in danger of escape and injury. The
fencing of this enclosure must be maintained to securely contain the animals.
This focused inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative and Dr. Margaret Shaver,
VMO.
