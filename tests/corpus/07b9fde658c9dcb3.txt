ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two dogs were observed to have signs of health problems and have not been seen by the attending veterinarian
and are not receiving any medical treatment:
A female shih tzu's (id #27) eyes both had crusty materiel around them and the surface of each eyeball was hazy
and discolored.
A male King Charles spaniel ('Alan') was observed to have matted hair around both ears. On closer observation it
was seen to have reddened skin and a moist discharge by both ear canals, and a foul odor was observed around
the ears.
These observations are signs of eye and ear health problems in each affected dog. Eye and ear problems can
have many causes and if not treated promptly can cause pain and worsen. Ensure that signs of health problems
are promptly reported to the attending veterinarian and follow the veterinarian's recommended treatment plan.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure in the southwest corner, and an enclosure on the east wall had sharp corners of sheet metal
exposed to areas that dogs could touch. The elevated enclosure #50 had a wire point about 6 inches long sticking
into the enclosure by the west enclosure door. These sharp points could cause injury to dogs. Enclosures must
kept in good repair, protect animals from injury and contain animals securely.
