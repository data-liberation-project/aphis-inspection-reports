2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection on July 31, 2014, records of animal births and deaths were not maintained for the
guinea pigs. Records must be kept on animals for animal tracking, assessment of the animal care program, and to
comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that records on animal births and deaths are
kept and maintained.
Correct from this day forward.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs are not being cleaned adequately or often enough to remove accumulations of
feces, dirty bedding and debris. All of the enclosures have accumulations of feces, dirty bedding and debris. The
cleaning process (method and frequency) utilitized is not effective in removing this accumulation. Licensee stated
that he cleans and sanitizes enclosures every 2 weeks. A more frequent cleaning program is necessary to prevent
an accumulation of feces, dirty bedding, and debris. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to
potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often
enough to prevent an accumulation of feces, soiled bedding, and debris and must be sanitized once every 2 weeks.
Correct by ensuring that all enclosures are kept clean and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
