2.31(e)(2)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC reviewed and approved Protocol #20010202, which did not include a justification for the number of golden
hamsters requested for the studies. It is important for protocols to include an explanation for the number of animals
requested so that the IACUC can review it and determine if the number requested is appropriate for the proposed work.
Failure to provide and review this detail can result in an excess of animals used and euthanized.
The registrant must ensure that all protocols contain not only a rationale for involving animals and the appropriateness of
the species, but also the rationale for the appropriateness of the numbers of animals to be used.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
At the time of inspection, there are three bottles of expired medications comingled with unexpired medications on the
pharmacy shelves in the vivarium: One vial of 0.5% bupivacaine injectable (exp. 02/01/2022) and two bottles of atropine
sulfate ophthalmic solution (exp. 01/2022). The use of expired medications is not considered to be a safe or appropriate
method to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed.
The animals may experience pain and distress due to unrelieved symptoms or unexpected side effects from the use of


expired medications.
The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This includes provisions to ensure expired medications are not administered to
animals.
