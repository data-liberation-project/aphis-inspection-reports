PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the Saki/Tamarin night house, the cover over the fluorescent light is broken and hanging open, despite the use of
duct tape to try and secure it. Fluorescent tubes should be covered to prevent the non human primates from
touching the hot tubes or to protect them from debris in case the tube breaks. A system of maintenance must be in
place to keep the primary enclosures for non human primates in good repair.

SANITATION.
In the animal commissary, the floor sealant has worn off in several places, revealing patches of porous concrete.
The patches of concrete are not sealed and are not able to be readily cleaned and sanitized. A system of
maintenance must be in place to ensure that the kitchen where food is prepared for the animal diets is able to be
cleaned and sanitized to prevent contamination of food.
