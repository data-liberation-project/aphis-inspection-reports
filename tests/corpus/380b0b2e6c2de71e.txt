ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
While observing the animals in the 40 acre Watani Grasslands exhibit using binoculars, both inspectors noticed an
adult oryx to be lame on its front right leg. The oryx was not bearing weight on the leg while standing still and was
partially weight bearing while walking but appeared in obvious discomfort. The oryx was first noted as lame in the
keeper notes on Mar. 3, 2016. The Mar. 7 keeper notes stated that a visual exam by the vet was being requested.
The vet notes for that date gave a treatment plan of monitoring the lameness and the animal and sedation if not
better. On Mar. 18 attempts to sedate the animal were unsuccessful and the vet recommended the staff move the
oryx herd into a small yard and monitor. The staff was unable to move the herd into the smaller yard. Keeper notes
for Mar. 22 still note a severe limp. Keeper notes for Mar. 24 state the previously improving limp was back to a
severe limp after the animal slid while running from a truck on the road in the exhibit. The Mar. 28 vet record states
that the keepers also reported that some of the other oryx in the herd boss her around making her run more. The
vet again recommended that the herd be moved into the small yard to limit running and to monitor. No specific
diagnosis has been made or treatment plan implemented. No pain medications have been administered. The oryx
remains on public display in the Watani Grasslands exhibit where she is prone to further injury and harassment by
the other animals. The use of appropriate methods to diagnose and treat injuries is a key component of providing
adequate veterinary care. The facility shall ensure that the appropriate methods to diagnose and treat the oryx are
instituted. Correct by Apr. 7, 2016.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The walls of the indoor housing for the chimps and baboons have multiple areas of peeled paint and
chipped/damaged concrete block that leaves the untreated concrete underneath visible and exposed. Some of
these areas are rough and pitted. Water sprayed against the untreated concrete was absorbed rapidly. The
exposed underlying concrete areas cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. The facility shall ensure that all
surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates are constructed and maintained such that they can be readily cleaned
and sanitized. Correct by Aug. 1, 2016. Inspection conducted March 29 by Ellen Magid. SACS (marine mammals), and VMOs Brunkhorst and McBride. The
remainder of the facility inspection on March 29, 30, and 31, 2016 conducted by VMOs Brunkhorst and McBride.
Exit interview conducted with Susanne Brunkhorst, VMO, Mary Ann McBride, VMO, and General Curator, Chief
Veterinarian and Zoo Director.
