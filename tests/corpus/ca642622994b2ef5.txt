FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor enclosure housing 2 Somali wild ass had several areas of the chain-link fencing that was in disrepair.
**The east side fencing near the southeast corner had a large gap at the bottom where the chain-link mesh had
become unsecured. This gap is large enough (~ 6 inches high and ~12 long) to allow unwanted animals to enter
the enclosure.
**The north side fencing has several areas where the chain-link is no longer secured at the bottom and has sharp
points protruding into the enclosure, posing a risk of injury to the animals.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
To be corrected by 4/18/2014.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence adjacent to the Pump House Storage Lot has several pieces of equipment stored against the
outer side of the fence that is reducing the effective height from 10 feet to less than 8 feet. One of these pieces of
equipment was secured to the fencing with straps and was positioned such that an unwanted animal or person
could climb up the equipment and over the fence. This Pump House Storage Lot was not secured at the time of this
inspection to prevent unwanted persons from being able to access this part of the perimeter fence.
All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out.

President for Animal Care, and Clinical Veterinarian.
