Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence doesn’t continuously surround the coyote enclosure. The facility recently constructed a new aviary
over the area where sections of the perimeter fence previously stood. This has resulted in the perimeter fence no longer
being attached to the fence posts on both sides of the aviary. The lack of a continuous perimeter fence could potentially
allow unauthorized animals or persons to access the facility. Repair or replace the affected areas of the perimeter fence.
