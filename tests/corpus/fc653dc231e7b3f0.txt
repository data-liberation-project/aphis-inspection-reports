3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There is soiled bedding underneath the loose hay in the guinea pig enclosures. The bottom of the plastic tubs has a
brown roughened scale/stain buildup. Enclosures are not being cleaned adequately or often enough to remove
accumulations of soiled bedding and the stain buildup. The cleaning process utilized is not effective in removing this
accumulation. Primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of
excreta and debris and enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods
described in section 3.31(a)(4). Inadequate cleaning and/or sanitization can increase the risk of disease and cause
the animals to become ill. Licensee must establish a program to keep the enclosures clean to ensure the health of
the animals. Correct by February 6, 2016.
