2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Facility records indicate that on 2/11/2021, animal care staff found a deceased meadow vole with its head pinned
between a PVC tube used for enrichment and the cage’s metal grid that contains food and water. This vole was housed
alone and uneaten spinach that had been placed on 2/5/2021 was also found inside the cage. According to the attending
veterinarian, it is thought that the animal died on 2/5/2021 after the spinach was given and the caged was closed. Multiple
animal care staff checked off on daily health observations for this room between 2/5/2021 and 2/11/2021; however, the
meadow vole was deceased within its cage for up to six days before animal care staff realized it was dead.
Failure to observe medical problems and/or communicate those problems to the attending veterinarian can result in
prolonged pain or even death. The facility must observe all animals daily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of health,
behavior, and well-being are conveyed and so that the medical conditions of the animals can be evaluated by the
veterinarian.
To be corrected from this day forward to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
3.130 Critical Repeat

Watering.


Facility records indicate that on 2/8/2021, animal care staff inspected a divided cage containing four prairie voles, in which
one vole was found dead and another was found in a state that warranted euthanasia. The two affected voles were on the
side of the divider that had access to a ball bearing water bottle which had become vapor locked. This vapor locked water
bottle resulted in these two voles not having access to water. Facility standards require that any animals in a divided cage
should have access to a water bottle without ball bearings since it is a known issue that the ball bearing water bottles are
prone to vapor lock. The facility has begun transitioning to a different type of water bottle to avoid this issue.
Lack of access to potable water can cause an animal to experience dehydration and lead to other medical issues,
including death. The facility must ensure that if potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be
provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal.

This inspection was conducted on 4/21/2021 and the exit interview was conducted on 4/22/2021 with facility
representatives.
