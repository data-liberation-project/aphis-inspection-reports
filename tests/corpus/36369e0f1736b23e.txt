2.31(c)(7) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***Significant changes regarding the number and use of animals in protocol #15-5602A, involving horses, were not
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The protocol was approved for the use of 30 horses. Five additional horses were added to the study, however the
IACUC was not informed of this protocol deviation. A post-approval monitor (PAM) detected the use of the
additional horses after the study had been completed.
Additionally, APHIS personnel discovered the following procedures were conducted instead of those approved in
the protocol:
-Sedation of 28 horses with detomidine instead of the approved sedation xylazine
-Injection with lidocaine prior to the nerve block instead of application of an approved topical anesthetic
(benzocaine)
-The use of hemostats to tap the teeth instead of the approved use of Von Frey filaments or thermal testing for
confirmation of local analgesia
-The euthanasia of three horses rather than the approved two horses
-The use of six control horses was not included in the protocol. These horses were sedated but did not receive a
mental nerve block prior to the responsiveness testing.
Unapproved significant changes to a protocol can result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animal’s
welfare at risk. All activities involving animals must adhere to those in the IACUC-approved protocols and
amendments. This conformance to protocol is necessary to ensure that the IACUC has the authority to assure the
proper care and use of animals in research projects. Any significant changes to the approved protocol must be
reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to implementing the changes.
2.31(d)(1)(iv)(A)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***In IACUC-approved protocol, 17-7461A, involving procedures in which dogs and cats may experience unrelievedpain or distress, no scientific justification was provided for why these activities could not be performed with
appropriate sedatives, analgesics or anesthetics.
The protocol stated “For Pain Category E procedures, explain why drugs or other ameliorative treatments cannot be
used to fully alleviate pain/distress.” The entry provided by the PI was “NA.” Facility personnel informed APHIS
inspectors that there were no other documents that provided this justification.
Appropriate methods to alleviate potential pain or distress to the animals that is more than slight or momentary are
must be provided for the care and well-being of the animals. In the case that the withholding of such sedatives,
analgesics, or anesthetics is necessary for the study, the principal investigator must provide scientific justification in
writing.
