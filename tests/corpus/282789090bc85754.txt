3.25(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste disposal. There are large piles of animal waste, old bedding, and debris below the guinea pig room. The
drainpipes for the automatic water valves are frozen below the second floor and water is backing up in the
drainpipes and leaking on to the aisles in the guinea pig room. Provisions must be made for the removal and
disposal of animal waste, bedding, and debris to minimize vermin infestations, odors and disease hazards. Proper
drainage for the automatic water system must be provided to prevent the water from backing up and leaking on to
the floor. The wet and slippery aisles makes cleaning, care, and inspection of animals more difficult which can affect
the health of the animals.
