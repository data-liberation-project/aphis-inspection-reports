PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the corner of one rabbit enclosure, a 2in x 2in piece of metal wire flooring was broken. The broken piece of wire
had sharp jagged edges and was protruding into the enclosure. Primary enclosures for rabbits need to be
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to contain them, and to keep
predators out.
