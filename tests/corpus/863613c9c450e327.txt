ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
I uploaded the pictures of the enclosure that the juvenile ring-tailed lemur and grivet share on June 23, 2017. I
noticed that the juvenile ring-tailed lemur had multiple wounds on both ears that have scabbed over and have left
both ear tips deformed. I called the licensees wife and informed her of the wounds and she stated that she was
going to go check them immediately. The licensees wife notified me after she looked at the lemur that she
separated the lemur from the grivet and applied bag-balm to the ears.
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods
to prevent, diagnose and treat injuries.
This animal needs to be seen by the attending veterinarian for appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the wounds.
To be corrected by June 30, 2017.2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The young, female, potbellied pig that had a prolapsed uterus died. The attending veterinarians visit was
documented but no recommendations were recorded. I uploaded the pictures of the enclosure that the juvenile
ring-tailed lemur and grivet share on June 23, 2017. I noticed that the juvenile ring-tailed lemur had multiple wounds
on both ears that have scabbed over and have left both ear tips deformed. I called the licensee and informed her of
the wounds and she stated that she was going to go check them immediately.
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of veterinary care that include daily observations to assess the
health and well-being of the animals held at the facility. The attending veterinarian must be made aware of all
problems of animal health and well-being.
Ensure that animals are observed daily for any problems with their health or well-being and notify the attending
veterinarian when issues are found so that the animals can receive appropriate veterinary care. Document any and
all contact and visits with the veterinarian including diagnosis, treatment and when a recheck with the veterinarian
may be needed.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The plan for environmental enhancement for the primates has been signed, but there are no written
recommendations.
All exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environmental enhancement adequate to
promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently
accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed
by the attending veterinarian.
Develop a program for enrichment for the non-human primates held at the facility. All enrichment must be
documented by the facility and the plan must be approved by the attending veterinarian.
3.84(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL. The juvenile ring-tailed lemur and grivet monkey have been moved to an outdoor enclosure. The outdoor enclosure
is made up of raw wood and rusted metal fencing.
Primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and as often as necessary to prevent an
excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, waste, food waste, excreta, or disease hazard.
Replace or seal the wire and replace or seal the wood so that it can be sanitized a minimum of once every two
weeks for the health of the non-human primates.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is no perimeter fence for the camels.
All outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of
sufficient height, not less than 6' for non-dangerous species, to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. The
fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
A perimeter fence must be constructed or a perimeter fence variance must be requested.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensees wife.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A VALID USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
