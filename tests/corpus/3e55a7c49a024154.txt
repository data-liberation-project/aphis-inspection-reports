HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an unopened bag of bedding inside the kennel on the cement floor of the kennel.
Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination,
and vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls, to allow cleaning
underneath and around the supplies.
Keep all open supplies of food in a container with a lid to prevent contamination by pests and mold.3.4(c) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are 6 T posts left that are used in several of the primary enclosures that have rust on them.
Building surfaces in contact with animals in outdoor housing facilities must be impervious to moisture.
All surfaces that come into contact with the dogs must be able to be cleaned and sanitized. Rust inhibits the
effectiveness of cleaning and sanitizing the posts used in the primary enclosures for the dogs.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The licensee is using diluted vinegar to sanitize the facility. Diluted vinegar has not been proven to be effective as a
sanitizer.
Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
Discuss what sanitizer to use in the kennel with your attending veterinarian. An effective sanitizer reduces the risk of
animal disease in the kennel.
The inspection was conducted on August 9, 2017 with the licensee and the exit was conducted on August 11, 2017
