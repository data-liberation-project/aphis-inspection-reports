At time of inspection the following medication Fenbendazole( one/half gallon) had expired on 04-10-15. This
medication was intermingled with other pharmaceuticals that are currently being used in the facility and are
therefore ready for use. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are
administrated to dogs could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure that

3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At time of inspection round tubing at the bottom that is attached to the divider wire of numerous enclosures is rusted
and jagged with a rough edge. The rust has eaten completely through the metal exposing a hole. The affected
areas are located throughout the outdoor housing. At least nine dogs are in contact with the metal tubing attached
to the divider fencing. Rust can affect the structural strength of the divider panel. In addition, rust can erode and
deteriorate metal surfaces. Rough edges could potentially injure the dogs. Rusted metal is difficult to clean and
sanitize. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in contact with the dogs must be free of rust. To be corrected by
10-01-15.
3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At time of inspection one metal culvert has been converted to an outside dog house. The culvert used by two dog is
located in an outdoor enclosure. There is not a floor in the metal culvert. Metal culverts are not considered to be
adequate housing. Metal culvert do not provide adequate housing and the dog may experience difficulty conserving
body heat during inclement weather affecting the health and well-being of the dogs. The licensee must replace the
metal culvert with acceptable outdoor housing. To be corrected by 09-20-15.3.4(d)(2)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At time of inspection numerous outdoor enclosure housing two, three, or four large adult dogs ( German Sheperds,
Huskies, and Blood Hounds) have one medium or one large igloo shelter for housing. These shelter structures are
not large enough for all of the dogs in this enclosure to be provided with shelter that allows them to sit, stand, lie and
turn freely in a normal manner. Lack of adequate housing does not provide the dogs with protection from the effects
of the wind, rain or snow. Whether dogs use them or not the shelter has to be provided. The licensee must ensure
that the shelter structures are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a
normal manner, and to turn about freely. To be corrected by 09-29-15.
An exit interview was conducted by Cathy Niebruegge, ACI and facility representative.
