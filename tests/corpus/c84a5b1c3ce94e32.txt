HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the sheltered housing facility, the outdoor portion has been fully enclosed and the back wall is constructed of
metal. In one enclosure, containing three dogs, the metal wall along the floor has become damaged and rusty.
This damaged area cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. All damaged or worn surfaces must be replaced or
altered in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization of the surface every two weeks.

FEEDING.
In the whelping area, approximately six of the self-feeders have a caking of old food on the inside of them. This
buildup of old food does not allow for proper sanitization of the feeder and could pose a health risk to the dogs. The
caking of food must be removed and the self-feeders must be kept clean in order to ensure proper sanitization of
the feeder every two weeks.
