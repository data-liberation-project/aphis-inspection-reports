CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
Two European rabbits were observed been housed in the same enclosure with a brown lemur. Rabbits shall not be
housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species of animals unless required for scientific reasons. The
physical wellbeing and health of rabbits as a prey species and that of other species within the same enclosure are
potentially compromised. Separation of the two species should be done immediately.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During the main food storage room/chiller inspection, a trash container without a lid was observed. There were
several live fruit and house flies in the room. Also, several areas with dry meat debris were observed on top of the
main food preparation table. Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas
must be leakproof and must have tightly fitted lids on them at all times. Licensee and/or resident staff must provide
for regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of food wastes, debris, and garbage in a manner that
minimizes contamination by vermin/insects and disease risk.
