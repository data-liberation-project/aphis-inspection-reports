HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.
Several feed bags stored near the husky barn to be used to feed 11 dogs showed evidence that pests had been
present in and around the feed bags. One bag with a tear had not been evaluated for contamination or transferred
to a closed container. Spilled feed was observed around the storage area. This condition of the food storage area
can attract pests to the area and may contaminate feed fed to the dogs. Contaminated feed is a health risk to the
dogs if ingested. Clean and maintain the storage of extra feed in a manner that prevents contamination and
attraction of pests. Correct by: 2 February 2015
The adequate veterinary care issues for dogs #0A01575807 and #0A01575665 cited under 2.40 (b) (2) on the
previous inspection have been addressed and were corrected at the time of this inspection.
