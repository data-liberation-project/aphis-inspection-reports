REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.
These individuals are operating as unregistered carriers transporting regulated animals across the country without
the required USDA Transporter registration. There are two confirmed cases in April and July 2016 of these
individuals transporting puppies to other states, and they have webpages advertising that they will transport
animals, including regulated animals.
Animals cannot be transported by an individual operating as a carrier who is not a registered Transporter with the
USDA.
All carriers must obtain a USDA registration to operate as a Transporter of regulated animals.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
The inspection was conducted with Bill Reinburg, IES and State Inspector Stacey Ballard.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 23, 2016.
