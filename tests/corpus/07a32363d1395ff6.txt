2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Four animals are in need of veterinary care.
*One Nubian goat, red and white, is extremely thin with ribs, spine, hip and rear limb bones easily visible. She was seen
by the veterinarian in the spring and treated for internal parasites. She was seen again June 25th and it was advised to
give another dose of the same medications. She has still not gained weight and needs to be reevaluated for a diagnosis
for the lack of weight gain.
*Three animals were noted limping/not putting any weight on one limb. A black and white goat is lame on the front right
leg. A tan and white goat with a red collar is lame on left rear leg. A reddish goat with a white face is lame on the right rear
leg. The lameness issues were evaluated in the spring and successfully treated with two different medications. The issues
have reoccurred with the heat of the summer. The goats have not been reevaluated for a diagnosis for the continued
lameness issues. The written program of veterinary care does not include any treatment instructions for recurrent
lameness issues.
All animals with health issues must be evaluated by a veterinarian to diagnose, treat and control the issues. If issues recur
or do not improve on a recommended treatment the veterinarian should reevaluate the animals so that the treatment plan
can be reevaluated. Correct by July 27, 2022.


2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
One young bison calf was noted wearing a halter with an attached lead rope and tied to its enclosure/stall fencing inside
the barn. The calf was noted getting caught up in the rope during the inspection when it got excited seeing people.
Leaving an animal tethered and unobserved may lead to the animal getting itself twisted up in the rope and may cause
trauma, injury or discomfort.
All animals shall be handled as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, stress, physical harm or
unnecessary discomfort.
Corrected during the inspection.

Facilities, outdoor.
Two animal enclosures currently do not provide sufficient shade during the middle of the day when the sun is directly
overhead. This includes the coatimundi enclosure and the wallaby enclosure. Shade is only available inside the shelter
structures which hold heat and do not have breeze access when the sun shines on them. The temperature during the
inspection was 93 degrees F with a heat index of 107 degrees F. Access to shade in hot weather is necessary to prevent
discomfort and heat stress.
Animals shall be provided sufficient shade to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight.
Correct by July 27, 2022.
3.130 Repeat

Watering.
Multiple water receptacles including in the enclosures housing blackbuck, zebu, coatimundi, sheep, goats, wallaby,
kangaroo, alpaca and camel are in need of cleaning. Dirt, debris, bugs and algae were noted in the receptacles/water and


coating the insides of the receptacles. Many contained water that was opaque and the bottom of the enclosure could not
be visualized. The water in receptacles that are not kept clean may become contaminated or animals may not wish to
drink the water. Access to potable water is especially important during the hot humid summer days. All water receptacles
shall be kept clean and sanitary.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
Two enclosures are in need of cleaning.
*Two young piglets are currently being housed in a human playpen. The walls and floor of the playpen are brown with dirt
and debris. The towels and a piece of foam on which the piglets are lying are also dirty and stained. The foam, if chewed
on/eaten by the piglets, may lead to health issues.
*The two small shelter structures in the coatimundi enclosure are in need of cleaning. Dirt and debris have accumulated
on the floors.
Dirty enclosures may lead to contamination of the animals, spread of disease and odors. The piglet and coatimundi
enclosures need to be cleaned. Correct by July 22, 2022.
