2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
One of the research rabbits had significant malocclusion of the incisors, with both the upper and lower incisors
visible when the mouth was closed. The lower incisors were visible for a centimeter out of the mouth and angled
towards the right eye, indicating the malocclusion has been present for more than a day, and this condition had not
been previously identified by the registrant. The rabbit was still eating and drinking adequately, maintaining body
condition and finishing the provided food. The daily care standard operating procedure mentions checking rabbits
for evidence of malocclusion, and had not been followed. The registrant needs to communicate with their
veterinarian in order to address this health problem.
Daily observation of all animals to assess their well-being, appropriate documentation of those observations, and
direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding health issues are necessary to ensure
that the animals at the facility receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A system should be in place to ensure
that all animals are observed daily, any health problems are documented, and the attending veterinarian is notified
when necessary.
Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the general manager.
