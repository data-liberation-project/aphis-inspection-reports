fewer than 2 days in advance of travel whenever the animals will be exhibited at a location other than the approved

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
All licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the
species they maintain.
The licensee has not demonstrated that the facility manager or other employees caring for the tigers have adequate
experience or knowledge of the large felids. The inspection dated 7/26/12 states that the facility did not have an
employee training plan and that the training for employees was conducted by a person who has been ruled by an
administrative law judge as not having knowledge or experience to handle large felids. There has been no furtherdocumentation regarding employees experience /knowledge of large felids sent to the USDA. The lack of
knowledge and experience in handling large felids such as tigers can endanger the lives of the animals as well as
the lives of the viewing public and animal caretakers. The licensee must ensure that the persons involved in the
handling and husbandry of the animals have experience with and be knowledgeable of the species they maintain.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the facility manager in Hondo , Texas.
