3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
Several indoor kennels housing puppies had surfaces that were damaged, chewed, or worn:
**Kennel housing 2 German shepherd puppies with 1 golden retriever puppy had a wooden board at the gate that
was severely chewed and had plastic/fiberglass panels on the floors and walls that were broken, exposing the
unsealed floor and wall surfaces.
**Kennel housing 1 Weimerarner puppy and 1 Shiba inu puppy had a wooden board at the gate that was severely
chewed and had plastic/fiberglass panels on the walls that were broken, exposing the unsealed floor and wall
surfaces.
**Raised, open top enclosure housing 3 puppies (1 English bulldog, 1 miniature schnauzer, and 1 Chihuahua) had a
gouged hole in the cement wall which exposes the unsealed surface.
The fenced outdoor yard where puppies are exercised had a plastic storage bin that had a hole in the lid and had a
storage shed with flaking paint on the wooden surface.
These surfaces are not in good repair, cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized, and pose a risk for either injury
and /or for exposure to infectious organisms from the unsealed and damaged surfaces.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility--that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced
when worn or soiled.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Housekeeping for premises. The exhaust vent in the room housing 20 puppies and which is directly over two open top enclosures housing a total
of 5 puppies, had an accumulation of cobwebs, dust and debris. This material was hanging thickly from the vent
and poses a risk to the health of the puppies due to potential inhalation of the material which may contain waste
material.
Premises where housing facilities are located must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals health.
To be corrected by 12/5/2014.
