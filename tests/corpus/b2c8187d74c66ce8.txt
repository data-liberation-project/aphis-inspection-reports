ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The last site visity by the attending veterinarian was documented in 2012. A complete written Program of Veterinary
Care (PVC) was not available for inspection. To ensure that optimum care is provided for the animals, the
attending veterinarian should be contacted to visit the facility at least once a year. Contact the attending
veterinarian to conduct a site visit and document a PVC for the facility. Instructions for medications not labeled for
guinea pig use must also be included in the PVC.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation.
There was a strong ammonia odor in the building during inspection. I could feel my eyes and throat burned due to
the odor. Strong ammonia odors can make animals get sick and do poorly. The guinea pig area must have more
fresh air flow while maintaining an inside temperature between 60 and 85 degrees F.

3.28(a) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***Outside edges of enclosures had signs that water and urine is soaking into the wood. Surfaces that have liquids
soaking into them can cause animals to become sick. Surfaces that animals are in contact with must be maintained
impervious to moisture (waterproof) so that they can be correctly cleaned and to promote the health of animals.
***Many areas by the water hoses and inside of enclosures had points of wire sticking into the enclosures. Wire
points can hurt animals. Holes can allow animals to escape, become trapped, or fall from the enclosure and causeinjury. Any areas that have holes or sharp points must be repaired or replaced to protect animals from injury or
escape.
***At least three feeders were noticed to be rusty and have sharp edges. Rusty feeders cannot be cleaned good
enough to protect animal health and sharp edges can injure animals. Repair or replace any feeder that is
excessively rusty or that has sharp edges.
3.31(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.

The entry way inside of the animal area had a large pile of wet and empty feed sacks. Piles of trash creates and
area for pests to live in and can spread disease . To promote animal health, the floors and animal areas must be
kept free from piles of trash.
