2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care available for review today was signed in January 2014 and is the same
program reviewed on the last inspection. No revisions have been made and the program still lacks sufficient detail.
It does not contain the attending veterinarian's recommendations for routine preventative care (to include any
vaccinations and parasite prevention etc.) or euthanasia if needed for any of the species housed at the facility.
A facility representative stated that the attending veterinarian has not been out to the facility but that facility staff
have taken one of the animals to the vet clinic.
Failure to provide sufficient detail/recommendations may lead to a lack of delivery of adequate veterinary care to the
animals.
Additional detail shall be added to the PVC in the following areas for all mammalian species housed at the facility:
routine preventative care (including vaccinations and parasite prevention) and euthanasia.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An open bag of bedding (for hedgehogs) and an open bag of hay (for chinchillas) were noted on shelves in the back
room. Open bags of food and bedding not stored in a closed container may attract pests and may lead to
contamination or deterioration of the food. All food and bedding needs to be stored in a manner that will adequately
protect them against deterioration, molding and contamination by vermin.
Exit conducted with staff and Director.
