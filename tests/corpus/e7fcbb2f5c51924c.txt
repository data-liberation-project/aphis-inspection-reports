** Male Yorkie #18 was found with extensive build up of brown material on its teeth. This dog has few teeth
remaining in its mouth and those are completely covered with brown material. Remaining teeth that are covered
with brown material include the upper and lower canine on the left side, the 4th premolar on the left and the 4th
premolar on the right. This dog requires veterinary attention.
** Male Maltese #32 was found with excessive build-up of brown material on it teeth. Nearly every tooth in this
dog's mouth has this build-up but it is especially heavy on the upper and lower molars on both sides. This dog also
requires veterinary attention.
Failure to provide adequate veterinary care to animals with signs consisent with dental disease can lead to pain and
suffering in the animals and does not ensure appropriate care to the animals in this facility.
Correct this by contacting a licensed veterinarian to have these animals examined. Licensee must follow all
receommended treatment and maintain documentation of treatment for future review by APHIS officials.
