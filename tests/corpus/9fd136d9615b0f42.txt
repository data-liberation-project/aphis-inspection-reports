ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Yorkie #140 is in need of veterinary care. The dog's left and right upper molars are loose with a small
amount of thick, white discharge at the gumline. The other upper and lower cheek teeth and upper canines have a
moderate amount of tartar built up as well. Dental disease can be painful, cause trouble eating, and/or lead to
infection spreading throughout the body. This dog must have its teeth examined and treated by a veterinarian. In
addition, appropriate methods to diagnose, prevent, control, and treat diseases and injuries including dental disease
must be employed.
