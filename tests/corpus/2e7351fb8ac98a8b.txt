2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On January 25, 2016 the doors to two cages of sugar gliders were left open by a new employee. Seven sugar
gliders escaped from their cages but remained in the animal room. Six sugar gliders were later captured and
returned to their cages but one young sugar glider was found dead. Appropriate handling of animals including
closing of cages is necessary to ensure the animals remain within the safety of their enclosures. All animals shall be
handled carefully in manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary
discomfort. Employee is receiving additional training and supervision. Corrected prior to inspection.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
