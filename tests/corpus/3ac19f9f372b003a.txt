2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol involving cows did not contain an adequate rationale for the numbers of these animals
to be used. The protocol stated that for commercial applications, larger numbers of cows may be required for these
larger projects. There is no quantity or range provided which corresponds to how many more numbers of the
animals this would require.
The rationale approved by the IACUC should provide assurances that the appropriate number of animals is being
used to obtain the information the activity is designed to provide.
It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that proposals to conduct activities involving animals contain an
adequate rationale for the number of animals to be used in those activities.

2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol involving cows did not provide a complete description of the proposed use of the
animals.
- The protocol does not provide a description of the chemical restraint methods for the cows. According to facility
representatives, chemical restraint may occasionally be administered to the cows.
-The protocol states, (cid:28)up to two bleeds may be taken within a two-week period if the condition and health of the
animal allow(cid:29). There is no information or parameters provided in the protocol which would consider an animal to
have an acceptable health status to remain on the study.
A complete description of activities using animals must be included in protocols prior to IACUC approval. The
facility should ensure that all protocols contain complete descriptions of animal use.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The daily treatment records for the rabbits were incomplete. The facility keeps a written, daily observation log
including documentation of any medications administered. According to a facility representative, the medication,
Oxytetracycline has been given to sick rabbits; however there is no written documentation or instructions for the use
of this medication in the records. The lack of complete and accurate documentation of the use of all medications
may lead to inappropriate use on the animals. Accurate information and records should also be available in the
event of communications with the attending veterinarian. A system of complete, accurate and timely information
concerning animal health problems and observations must be in place.

3.51(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
-There were several cracks from 2ft. up to 6 ft. in length in the cement flooring of the rabbit building. Some of the
deeper cracks were filled with organic waste/debris which attracted several flies to these areas at time of inspection.
Large cracks in the flooring are not impervious to moisture and prevent proper sanitization. Also, these areas may
trap debris and bacterial organisms as well as attract flies or pests which all may pose a health risk to the animals.
-Several rabbit cages are moderately covered in rust. The presence of rust may prevent the required cleaning and
sanitization of the enclosures, which may adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals. There are
improvements being made which include sections of new cages and feeders that have replaced older ones.
The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that they are
substantially impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized.

3.53(c)(2)PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Several, primary enclosures housing adult rabbits did not provide the minimum amount of floor space as required.
The rabbit cages were 2 ft. X 1.5 ft. which provides a total of 3 square feet which is the minimum floor space for
adult rabbits between 4.4-8.8 lbs. Several rabbits in the facility at time of inspection weighed greater than 8.8lbs,
therefore requiring more than the 3 square feet provided by the cages.
Enclosures with insufficient space may have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals being
maintained within them. A sufficient amount of floor space for rabbits is necessary in order to ensure that they have
enough space to make normal postural adjustments and adequate freedom of movement. The facility should ensure
that the cages housing their rabbits meet the required minimum floor space set forth in the regulations.

3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the cow enclosure, there was one shade structure (approximately 3ft X 6ft) provided for the four cows. This is not
a sufficiently sized shaded area provided to comfortably protect all animals in this enclosure from the direct rays of
the sun.
Failure to provide sufficient shade to allow all the animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight
could cause overheating or discomfort to the animals. Additional shade for the animals is required to be in
compliance.
