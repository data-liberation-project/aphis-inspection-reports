***The walk-in freezer storing the mammal food was dirty. The floor of the freezer had an excessive accumulation of
debris including dirt, straw, styrofoam, peanuts, and meat. At the back of the freezer there were opened boxes and
bags of food tossed on the ground in an unorganized manner. The food stored in the dirty freezer has the potential
to become contaminated and pose a health risk to the animals once ingested. Supplies of food and bedding shall be
stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding, or contamination.
