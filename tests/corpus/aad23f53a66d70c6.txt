SANITATION.
There is an excessive build-up of fecal material in the pen containing nine sheep, especially along the perimeter of
the primary enclosure. It appears that feces, feed, and bedding material have accumulated along the animal
enclosure fencing due to recent heavy rains. The build-up of fecal material attracts files and other pests which can
transmit diseases and cause discomfort/distress to the animals. All animal enclosures must be cleaned as often as
necessary to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. To be corrected by: August 7, 2017.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
