FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The medium and small pig shelters are in disrepair. The pot-bellied pig enclosure contains three pot-bellied pigs
and three shelters. There are four jagged pieces of tin siding laying on the ground of the enclosure. The tin siding
was ripped off of the medium sized shelter by the pig(s). Additionally there is a piece of wood, also from the
medium sized shelter, laying on the ground. Finally, the smallest shelter has three nails, two nail heads and one
sharp point, exposed and accessible to the pigs. All of these items are hazards and can cause injury to the animals.
Repair, replace, or remove the affected shelters to prevent injury to the animals.
Note: The jagged tin pieces of the shelter were removed before the exit briefing.
The remaining items to be corrected: 2-14-17
