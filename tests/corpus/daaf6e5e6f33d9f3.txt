Handling of animals.
On June 29, 2022, at 11:39am, a female white tiger named Luna escaped her enclosure during open business hours due
to the main enclosure gate being left open. An emergency code red, indicating an animal was out of its enclosure was
called immediately. All public visitors were evacuated from the park. Luna was sedated and moved back into her
enclosure by 12:23pm with all gates closed. Luna never made it beyond the public barrier, which doubles as a perimeter
fence. A complete evaluation and debrief of the incident was completed prior to the inspection. No additional corrective
measures are necessary at this time.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the curator.
