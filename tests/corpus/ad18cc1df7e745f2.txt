RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility representative stated that the facility has not yet acquired or recorded the acquisition information for the
animals on exhibit this spring season (2 sheep, 2 calves, 4 goats and 6 rabbits). In addition, she states that the
facility has not yet recorded disposition information for the animals from last fall's exhibit animals. Complete and
accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to
facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. The facility shall make, keep and maintain records containing all of the required
acquisition and disposition information for all animals used on exhibit.

FEEDING.
The food receptacle currently used to hold the rabbit feed is an old piece of wood board with chewed and splintered
edges and peeling paint placed on the ground in the enclosure. A small amount of rabbit fecal pellets were noted in
the feed on top of the board. Splintered wood boards are not cleanable and sanitizable as required to prevent
contamination of the feed and spread of disease. All food receptacles shall be located as to minimize contamination
by exreta and shall be kept cleaned and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by 5/15/14.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A new goat walk with multiple ramps and a feeding mechanism allowing the goats to be fed by the public at the top
platform has been added to the goat enclosure.The goat walk appears close to 12 feet tall. The top section has
railings but the portion of the ramps leading from the intermediary approximately 5 ft high platforms to the top
platform has no railing, netting or other protective mechanism. Goats that lose their footing or are jostled by another
goat may fall from the ramps between the intermediary and top platform injuring themselves. All facility structures
must be constructed soundly and maintained to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 6/1/14.3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Storage. Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin.
There are open bags of feed in containers along the right wall of the storage shed (upon entering) but the lids are
not on the containers. A large 5 in. square hole is present in the floor of the storage shed through which vermin can
enter. Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that adequately protects the feed and bedding
against deterioration, molding and contamination by vermin.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Just across the aisle from the metal cans holding the feed bags in the storage shed (on the left side) is a large open
bucket type container filled with clumped unrecognizable feed material and moldy feed-fuzzy grey white material
and black droppings on the feed pellets lying on the surface. In addition a can of WD40 had fallen into the bucket.
Facility representative stated that employees were not feeding from this bucket but keeping the non-edible feed so
close to the edible feed may lead to confusion and accidental feeding of the contaminated feed. In addition, food
waste materials may increase vermin infestation, odors and disease hazards. Provision shall be made for removal
and disposal of animal and food wastes, trash and debris. Correct by 5/3/14.
