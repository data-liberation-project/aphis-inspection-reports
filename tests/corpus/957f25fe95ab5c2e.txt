3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A white female Shih Tzu (Shasta m/c # 0A0 131 673) had 10-12 fleas on her ventral area. The owner stated that
the dog had been dipped in flea solution about 10 days ago. There were still many fleas present on this dog. The
dog was treated during the inspection. Fleas can bite and irritate the dogs and possibly lead to illness. An effective
program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs, must be established and maintained so as to
promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce illness and contamination by pests. The owner must
treat the dogs appropriately to remove and prevent fleas and other insects and pests.
The inspection and exit briefing was done with facility representatives.
