Section 3.127(d) Perimeter fence
The perimeter fence by the pond is a chain link fence that is six feet in height with angled frame posts for 3 strands
of barb wire above the chain link. This fence is still only about 7 feet in height. The facility must establish and
maintain a program to keep an 8 foot perimeter fence in good repair to restrict animals and unauthorized persons
from gaining access into the facility and to act as a secondary containment system for the animals housed within the
facility. This is a repeat non-compliance that remains uncorrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
