FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility is comprised of enclosures and a roof that are in critical disrepair. Some gates have openings with
protruding wires, feeders are falling apart, with exposed nails protruding, and the roof where the ewes are is actively
shedding corroded pieces of corrugated metal, with broken pieces on the ground, and others threatening to fall from
above. These elements have sharp edges and falling pieces which present a risk of injury to the animals. The gates
and fencing in disrepair also present an escape risk.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. The facility should make necessary repairs or relocate the animals.

SANITATION.
In the animal enclosures and adjoining areas there was an accumulation of discarded materials. One room, within
an enclosure, had discarded metal items and empty plastic sacs, and another had a bucket of cleaning products
next to a pile of containers that appear to be discarded. Just outside another enclosure there was a large pile of
discarded wool on the ground, that was wet and discolored.
The premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as
necessary to protect the health of the animals. The facility should clean up the premises or relocate the animals.
This was a new site inspection. No regulated activity shall be conducted at this site until it is brought into compliance
and approved.
This inspection was conducted with the site herdsman, and the exit interview was conducted with the University of
Hawaii representatives.
