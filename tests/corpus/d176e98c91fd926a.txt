***New Zealand White rabbit #5314 had a moist pinkish irritation about a quarter-size around in the area below the
left eye and towards the nose. There had been observations made by the employees at 6:15 am and 3:00 pm. The
lesion had not been noted or reported prior to the inspection of the rabbit which was within an hour later. Daily
observations of all animals should be performed thoroughly to properly assess the health and well-being of the
animals. Correct from this day forward.
The inspection was conducted with the Senior Clinical Veterinarian and Director of IACUC. The exit briefing was
performed with Director of IACUC, Senior Clinical Veterinarian and Associate VP of A.R.P.
