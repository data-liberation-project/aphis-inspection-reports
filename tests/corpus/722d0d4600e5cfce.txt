3.1(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Five enclosures for the Outside Enclosures have metal panel dividers. These dividers were excessively rusty and
corroding along the bottom of the dividers.
Two enclosures for the Main Kennel have metal bar framing for the dividers. The bottom bar for two of these
dividers were excessively rusty and corroding. One bare had a hole as a result of corrosion.
These metal surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. Thus, increasing the disease potential for seven
adult dogs. Excessive deterioration of metal surfaces can weaken the structural strength.
All metal surfaces must be free of rust. This will allow the metal surfaces to be readily cleaned and sanitized
decrease the disease potential for the animals. Also, this will maintain the structural integrity of the metal surfaces.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two enclosures in the Weaning Area had a wood board within the enclosures. These wood boards were
excessively chewed and scratched. One wood board was painted white and the paint was scratched and chewed
off the surface, which exposed bare wood.
These mentioned wood surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. As a result, this can increase the
disease potential for the two adult dogs and 12 puppies.
All surfaces must be maintained and kept in good repair. This will allow for the surfaces to be readily cleaned and
sanitized in the prevention of diseases. 3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* There were wire ties used to secure the divider panels to the posts for four enclosures housing four dogs. These
wire ties were protruding out into the enclosures approximately ½ inch to 1 inch. These points were at head and
eye level for the dogs in housed in the enclosures. The dogs could be injured by these sharp points.
For the prevention of injury, all housing facilities must be free of jagged edges and sharp points.
