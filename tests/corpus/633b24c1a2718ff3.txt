MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
On 5/29/14 a puppy arrived at SFO from Canada on Air Canada flight # 566/29 in cargo with waybill #
014-0132784. The receiving owner completed a health department quarantine document and recorded the puppy's
date of birth as 4/7/14. At the time of inspection at the SFO Air Canada cargo office on 7/30/14, and to date, the Air
Canada cargo representatives were not able to locate a certificate of veterinary inspection that would have been
required at time of shipment to verify that the puppy was old enough to ship.
Transporters should assure that animals handled meet the minimum age requirements for shipment. Shipping
puppies less that 8 weeks old could put their well being at risk. To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit briefing was completed with a cargo office representative.
