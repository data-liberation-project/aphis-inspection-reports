FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The top surface along the upper horizontal wood fence support around the camel enclosure is splintered along its'
entire circumference. The camel's necks do rub against these surfaces which can potentially injure the camels.
The backside of the pressed wood shelter door in the kangaroo enclosure is also splintered which can injure the
kangaroos if they should make contact with these surfaces.
There is also splintered wood at the left lower portion in the porcupine enclosure which also can injure this animal.
Repair or replace these pieces of wood. All enclosures shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury
