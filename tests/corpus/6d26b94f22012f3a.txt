SANITATION.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs are not being cleaned adequately or often enough to remove accumulations of
dust, dirt, cobwebs, soiled bedding, and debris. There is dust, dirt, cobwebs, and dirty bedding accumulating on
wire surfaces, wooden supports, shelves, and enclosure floors. The cleaning process utilized is not effective in
removing this accumulation. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards and health
problems. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of dust, dirt, excreta,
cobwebs, and debris and enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Licensee must establish a
program to keep enclosures clean.
