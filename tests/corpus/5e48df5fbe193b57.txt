ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:40 a.m. on
06-MAR-19.
When I arrived at the facility the gate was closed, so I called the contact numbers provided. I spoke with the
licensee. She stated she was away from the facility at a medical appointment and would be unable to return. I then
left the facility.
End of report.
