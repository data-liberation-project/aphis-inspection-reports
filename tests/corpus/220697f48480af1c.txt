Facilities, general.
One tenrec escaped her enclosure and climbed into the enclosure above. The facility has four tenrecs housed in a "ferret
nation" type cage with two on the bottom and two on the top. At the beginning of inspection, the female from the bottom
enclosure could not be found. Later, she was found in the upper portion of the cage within the enclosure of the top two
tenrecs. Enclosures must be structurally sound to contain the animals securely. Animals that can escape their enclosures
can be harmed or lost. Correct by 4/28/2022 by ensuring that all enclosures are structurally sound and contain the
animals securely.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
