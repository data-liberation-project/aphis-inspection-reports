3.80(a)(2)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In an enclosure housing ring-tailed lemurs, there are two wire loops dangling from the top of the cage, and a broken
segment of wire in the same area. These wire loops do not appear to serve any useful function, and are a potential
source of injury or entrapment to the enclosed animals. The wire loops and the broken piece of wire must be
removed from the enclosure.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures housing, respectively, a single adult lion and a single adult tiger are open topped cages, with fence
heights approximately 10 feet. There are short kick-ins on both fences. Cage fences of this height may not be
sufficient to adequately contain adult lions or tigers. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures housing adult big
cats are constructed and maintained to adequately contain the animals.
