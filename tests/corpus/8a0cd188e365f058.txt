3.31(a)(4)
SANITATION.
*** Currently this facility is only cleaning the primary enclosures for the animals. No sanitization scheduled is in
place to ensure the enclosures are sanitized with a disinfectant at least every 2 weeks. Failure to provide regular
sanitization can lead to an increase of potential disease hazards to the animals. Correct this by developing and
implementing a sanitization schedule to adequately sanitize all enclosures at least every 2 weeks as required.
