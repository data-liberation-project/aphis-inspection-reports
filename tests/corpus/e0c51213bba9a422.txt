2.31(e)(2) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
**Protocol L14508100Q gives an inadequate rationale for the numbers of animals to be used. The principal
investigator indicates the total number of animals to be used will not exceed 150 over a 3 year period. The protocol
indicates a total of 60 animals will be utilized in experiment 1, 50 animals in experiment 2 (30 males + 20 females),
none in experiment 3, 40 animals in experiment 4 for a total of 150. Section B in the protocol indicates 40-60
animals will be used in year 1, 40-60 animals in year 2, 40-60 animals in year 3 for a minimum of 120 animals and a
maximum of 180 animals. There is not a clear rationale indicated for the discrepancy in the numbers listed. It is the
responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that activities involving animals includes a clear and concise rationale for the
species and numbers of animals to be utilized.
