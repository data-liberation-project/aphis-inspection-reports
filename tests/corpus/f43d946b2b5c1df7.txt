FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the time of inspection, it was observed that the adult male camel named "Roger" could reach his head and neck
outside of his primary enclosure fencing and come into physical contact with members of the public. This is a
potentially dangerous situation as a camel can inflict a very nasty bite if given the opportunity. A fence at least 3
feet in distance from the outside of the camel enclosure must be constructed to prevent physical contact between
animals inside the enclosure and people on the outside of the enclosure. This fence must be constructed so that it
protects the animals in the facility by preventing unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having
contact with the animals in the facility. To be corrected by: February 10, 2017.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
