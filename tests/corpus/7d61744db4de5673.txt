2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The program of veterinary care was incomplete. The attending veterinarian only signed the PVC. The program of
veterinary care needed to address all of the species and the specific care that the attending veterinarian will
provide. The program also needs to be updated, reviewed and approved at least once a year. The exhibitor has to
arrange a formal written agreement with a veterinarian to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals in the
event veterinary care needs to be provided for the betterment of the animals. The plan didn't include any
preventative treatments, euthanasia and emergency procedure. The program should include these components to
ensure there is a plan in place if an animal must be euthanized or if there is an emergency. The program needs to
be complete so that appropriate measures can be taken and promptly addressed. Correct by November 20, 2014.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The records documenting the disposition of animals were inaccurate. The disposition records of the kangaroos,
ringtail lemurs and the coatimundi were either an incorrect count, duplicated or not listed. The exhibitor shall make,
keep and maintain records or forms which correctly disclose the information of these animals. The records shall
include offspring born of any animals while in his/her possession or under his or her control. The records shall
include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. Correct by
November 20, 2014.
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the brown lemurs, ringtail lemurs, rhesus macaques and olive baboon enclosures the perches, ropes and
ground had an excessive amount of old feces. Also the ropes have a green film or residue that needs to be cleaned
or replaced. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and
sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards. If the species scent mark, the surfaces must be
sanitized or replaced at regular intervals as determined by the attending veterinarian in accordance with generally
accepted professional and husbandry practices. Floors made of dirt must be raked or spot-cleaned with sufficientfrequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta. Contaminated material must be removed
or replaced whenever raking and spot cleaning does not eliminate odors or diseases. All other surfaces of housing
facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and
practices. Correct by November 15, 2014.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In Aubie and Brianna the tiger's enclosure there is a section of their primary fencing that is down and is no longer
16 ft. straight up. There was a roast and two chicken quarters thrown into the fencing by the owner. The owner
stated that during feeding the tigers he attempted to throw the meat into the cat's enclosure. In the failed attempt to
do so the meat was hung in the fencing causing it to hang down. The fencing was not sturdy enough to hold the
meat and is now in disrepair. Currently the height and structural composition of the primary fencing for these tiger's
enclosure is not constructed of such material and of such strength to securely contain the tigers. All enclosures
fencing for big cats should be measured. The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
***In Agatha and Athena the tiger's enclosure their platform was broken with several planks of wood caving in. This
platform needs to be repaired and/or replaced to prevent the animals from being injured. The outdoor housing
facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
***During the inspection there were three goats that were roaming the park. The park was opened to the public with
the main gate open as well. The main gate opens directly to the road where there are several vehicles speeding
past the facility. The goat's pen is located near the main gate entrance. These animals should be properly contained
in their enclosure and not allowed to roam the park with the gate open. The outdoor housing facilities shall be
structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to contain the animals.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***While entering into the perimeter fencing for the lions, tigers, bears, nonhuman primates, cougars and leopards
we noticed that the fencing was not locked. All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence to
keep unauthorized persons out and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the
facility. The park was open to the public at that time and anyone could have accessed the potentially dangerous
animals. Correct immediately.
3.129(b)FEEDING.
***In Aubie and Brianna the tiger's enclosure a roast and two chicken quarters were hanging in the fencing. The
owner stated while throwing the meat into the cats enclosure during feeding that the meat became lodged in the
fencing causing it to hang. It is evident that the owner is currently throwing the meat into the enclosure. During a
previous inspection the owner stated that he always fed the tigers on a clean surface which wasn't occurring during
this inspection. This method of feeding doesn't prevent the meat from becoming contaminated once it touches the
dirt floor. The feed shall be placed so as to minimize contamination for the health and well-being of the animals.
Correct immediately.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
