ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The zoo has obtained the services of a new attending veterinarian last week but does not have a program of
veterinary care completed by this new veterinarian.
Several of the animals have not received some of the vaccinations that the previous veterinarian recommended on
his program of veterinary care, which was the facility's program of veterinary care at the time these vaccinations
were due. Examples are as follows:
Opossum & 1 sloth: No current Rabies vaccinations as per the PVC
Giraffes: 1 no current CDT & the other no current CD vaccinations as per the PVC
1 Rhino: No current EEE/WEE, West Nile & tetanus vaccinations as per the PVC
3 Camels: No current CDT vaccinations as per the PVC
1 Otter: No current canine distemper as per the PVC
All goats: No current CD vaccinations as per the PVC
Pig: No current Rabies & tetanus as per the PVC
Warthogs: No current Rabies & tetanus as per the PVC
1 Black footed cat, 2 servals, & 2 clouded leopards: No current tetanus as per the PVC
Alpaca: No current Rabies & EEE/WEE vaccinations.
These vaccinations were recommended by your previous veterinarian and should have been performed during the
time when he/she was your attending veterinarian.
The established quarantine procedure for llamas is to perform three Johnes fecal exams at weekly intervals. This
was not performed.
You must follow the recommendations of your attending veterinarian to provide the appropriate methods to prevent,
control & diagnose diseases. The attending veterinarian shall have the appropriate authority to ensure the provision
of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of all other aspects of veterinary care and use.Your new attending veterinarian shall complete a new written program of veterinary care.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee does not obtain the Driver's license number & Vehicle Tag number for the acquisitions that occurred
within the previous year from unlicensed USDA sources. The facility was able to retroactively obtain the required
information for the acquisitions of the Eland, Zebra, Blackbuck, wildebeest, goats, &pig during the inspection, but
has failed to obtained this information for the 2 opossums acquired on 5/9/13 which were acquired from private
individuals.
The drivers license number and vehicle tag number are required to be recorded for all acquisitions of regulated
mammals from unlicensed/unregistered USDA entities.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The camel had a lead chain (approx 3") hanging from the halter. This chain can pose a risk of entrapment and
injury if it should get entangled on something within the exhibit.
This chain should only be attached to the halter right before the camel is to be taken on a lead and only under
supervision of a qualified animal handler.
This was corrected after it was observed during the inspection. No further correction is necessary at this time.
On August 4, 2013, a guillotine door was dropped on a brown lemur (#83P062) by one of the keepers. This
resulted in this primate fracturing the right ulna & 1st phalanx on the left 4th digit. All keepers shall handle all
animals as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma or physical harm, and shall be adequately
trained on the operation of all equipment that will be used in the care of the animals in his or her charge.
The public barrier located in the area on the right rear side of the Amur leopard exhibit consists of some low rock
work and a single stand of rope which is not monitored by a zoo employee at all times when the public is present. A
member of the public can easily pass under, over, or through this barrier and gain direct access to the rear of this
leopard's exhibit.
During public exhibition, there must be sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general
viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. This type of public barrier does not minimize the
risk of the public & the animal and shall be modified to assure that the public cannot gain access to the animal
exhibits.Correct by April 30, 2014
