***One geriatric female camel was non-weight-bearing on her left hind limb at the time of inspection. Once standing,
the female would not bear weight or would intermittently toe touch. Additionally, it was noted by APHIS personnel
that her left hind limb would shake and twitch when toe-touching. Although this animal was seen by the veterinarian
on July 31 2016, the veterinarian confirmed this animal was weight bearing at that time. Non weight bearing on a
limb may be an indicator of pain.
***One tricolor goat was intermittently non weight bearing on its front right limb and walked semi-lame. The animal
manager stated he had trimmed this animals hooves two days prior and had "nicked the quick". The manager stated
after trimming the hooves, he had to apply a "kwik stop" like substance to aid on stopping the bleeding. Lameness
and non weight bearing is an indicator of disease and often pain. It can result from numerous causes including both
infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment
can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.
The licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on August 10, 2016, to obtain
accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation
must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary
diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any
medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health
record that list when the medication is administered to the animals.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each
animal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and
the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate
veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for
providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries.***There are three pigs, housed in the indoor barn, that are in need of hoof trims. The hooves on both front legs
were excessively long, extending out approximately three to fives inches. Failure to appropriately maintain
hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility(cid:25)s programs
of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a
timely manner.

***One goat, which is currently under veterinary care, had gone several months with a skin condition that was not
conveyed to the veterinarian. The animal manager stated he had noticed this condition for approximately a year and
was self treating the condition for over six months with no resolve. According to the veterinarian, this animal is
currently being isolated from other animals and is receiving diagnostic testing and treatment for lice or a dermatitis.
The veterinarian also stated she had been notified last week regarding this animal and looked at it for the first time
on July 31, 2016.
***The veterinarian was not notified regarding one female sheep that required veterinary care. When questioned
about a female sheep that was singly housed at the time of inspection, the animal manager stated, this sheep was
found down on the ground, with its legs splayed out paddling, some time ago (no definitive date was given). The
manager stated he had "nursed this animal back from death and saved it". Additionally, the animal manager stated
he had contacted the veterinarian regarding this animal. The veterinarian stated to APHIS personnel she could not
recall this incident or recall being involved in the treatment of this animal.
***At the time of inspection, the veterinarian had not been notified regarding the two animals (one camel, one
goat)identified during this inspection which require veterinary care. Additionally, the facility staff had not identified
these animals' conditions prior to APHIS personnel identifying them.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems, in a timely manner, can result in prolonged
pain and suffering and the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct
daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and
appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The enclosure housing approximately 26 goats had a feeder bottom that was rusted out and missing in several
sections with sharp edges. The rusted sections pose a risk of injury to the animals.
***The chain link material in the enclosure housing 7 pigs and 7 goats is turned up and in with several sharp points.
Additionally there is a gap between the ground and the chain link approximately 8 inches. The material is not
maintained in a manner to can't cause injury to the animals or securely contain them.
***There is a metal structure in an enclosure housing approximately 15 goats, that has sections of rust along its
bottom with sharp edges. This structure is not structurally sound and poses a risk of injury to the animals.
***The chain link in the enclosure housing one sheep has a hole in it with sharp points protruding into the enclosure.
This material poses a risk of injury to the animals.
***The chain link in the enclosure housing three deer has a hole in it with sharp points protruding into the enclosure.
This material poses a risk of injury to the animals.
***The den box in the enclosure housing three female coati mundi has edges that are excessively chewed and
worn. Additionally, the top of the den box has a hole in it from excessive wear that has sharp edges. This structure
is not structurally sound and poses a risk of injury to the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The enclosure housing 15 goats did not have adequate shade to protect all of the animals from direct sunlight.
The area of shade provided to all animals was a 6 feet by 6 feet area. This area is not large enough to allow all of
the animals within the enclosure to be protected from direct sunlight. Inadequate protection from direct sunlight may
lead to overheating or discomfort from squinting.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***An approximately 60 ft. section of the perimeter fence is no longer structurally sound. The fence posts in this
section are severely rusted and were broken or bent during a wind storm according to the animal manager. In this
state, the perimeter fence is not structurally sound and may allow animals or persons to enter or exit the facility. The
fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorizedpersons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals.
To be corrected by 8/18/16.
Inspection was conducted with the animal manager.
Exit briefing was conducted via telephone with facility representative.
