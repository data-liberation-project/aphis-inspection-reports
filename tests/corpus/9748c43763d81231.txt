3.25(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During the inspection, three guinea pigs were observed to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor
of the building. The side walls of the enclosures measured approximately 7 inches in height but in some areas
where the bedding and hay was compacted, the side walls measured approximately 6.25 inches in height. Guinea
pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The enclosure must contain the animals. The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all
times and does not allow them to escape.
3.25(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A partial bag of shavings was observed to be open and on the floor and huddled next to the bag was a rabbit. Also
on the floor was a bale of grass hay that was used as feed for the guinea pigs. Rabbits that were loose in the
building were moving freely around the bag of shavings and the loose bale of hay.
Feed and bedding need to be stored in facilities which protect them from contamination. Contaminated bedding and
feed can lead to the spread of disease in the animals as well as potential respiratory issues. Correct by keeping the
feed and bedding stored in such a manner as to prevent contamination.
3.26(a) DIRECT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The temperature inside the guinea pig housing building as measured with a kestrel was 51.2 degrees F. Although
there was a wall heater, there were several windows open and the garage door at the front of the building was also
open.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may predispose them
to developing other health issues.The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.

3.29(d) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
Feeders in several of the guinea pig enclosures had fecal pellets contained within the feeders and mixed in the
feed.
Feeders and food receptacles need to be clean and free of fecal material. Failure to do so can lead to disease or
can lead to the avoidance of feeding, both of which can have negative impacts on animal health. Correct by
keeping the feeders clean and sanitizing at a minimum of once every two weeks.
3.30
WATERING.
Several of the guinea pig enclosures had water spigots that were found to be surrounded with a mixture of hair and
wet, greenish/brown material.
All watering receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty and at a minimum of once every two weeks. Failure to do so
can lead to an increase in disease or avoidance of the water, both of which can have negative impacts on animal
health. Correct by cleaning the water spigots as needed and sanitizing at least one every two weeks. Correct by
January 17, 2020.
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The guinea pig pens contained a large amount of soiled, wet bedding especially in the areas of the automatic
waterers. In addition, there was a large amount of fecal material and discarded food and hay mixed with the
bedding and the pens were in need of more frequent cleaning. There was also a large piece of blue bailing twine
covering an area approximately 5 inches by 5 inches in size in one of the guinea pig pens.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the
enclosure, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent the accumulation of excreta or
debris.3.31(b)
SANITATION.
There was a large amount of discarded bedding, hay, and debris on the floor under and around the guinea pig pens.
There were at least 3 loose rabbits in the building housing the guinea pigs which were observed running around
and defecating on the floor. There was debris and dirt coating the windowsills. There were numerous spiderwebs
hanging from the ceiling over the open guinea pig pens.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris and rabbit fecal matter may attract pests into the room, result
in unpleasant odors, and may contribute to spread of disease.
Housing buildings must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate
prescribed husbandry practices.
