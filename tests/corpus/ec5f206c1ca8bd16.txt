3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the building containing 5 spider monkeys, there is a buildup of feces and urine on the left side of the inside of the
building, under the primate loft area. While the right side of the building is being spot cleaned daily, the keeper is
unable to clean the left side properly due to the inability to lock the primates out of the building long enough to allow
for proper daily spot cleaning. The buildup is from the past 2 to 3 days as the owners are out of town. While the
animals can get away from that area of the building and do not have to make contact with that area, there still has to
be daily spot cleaning provided. The surfaces above the windows, upper PVC pipe holds on the swings, and door
flap have a buildup of dirt and grime that needs to be cleaned/sanitized more often to prevent the amount of buildup
that was observed during this inspection.
The primary enclosure of the primates is to be spot cleaned on a daily basis to prevent the buildup of feces and
urine, that can become a possible health hazard to the regulated animals if left for several days.
There are five areas under the windows, above the base board area where there appears to be some water leaking
or dampness that is leaving water marks and damp areas on the wall surfaces. Under one of the windows there is a
wet mark (approx. 1ftx1ft) that has a moderate amount of black looking mold on the surface of the wall in the water
marked area. These areas are not able to be sanitized properly if they are damp or if mold is growing on the damp
surface. These areas can also become weak in structure and be a source of damage or contact with dangerous
materials if dug at by the primates when the surfaces deteriorate due to the moisture. The back of the entry door
inside the primary enclosure appears to have had the surface along the base of the door peeled off, exposing the
wood beneath. Once the water resistant covering is removed the area is unable to be sanitized properly and the
area should be repaired or replaced to allow for proper sanitization.
Any moldy, damp or damaged surface that cannot be cleaned or sanitized can be a possible source of bacteria or
disease if left in contact with the regulated animals.
All surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals must be repaired or replaced when worn, soiled or
damaged in order to allow for proper sanitization. The licensee must provide daily spot cleaning and removal of
feces and urine from the primary enclosure. If they are out of town, the daily spot cleaning must continue, and if thekeeper is unable to do the job due to the animals interference, then the facility must provide a method of locking the
animals out during the cleaning process, both for the safety of the keeper and the regulated animals.
