3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The lower shelter wall for two shelters is coming apart where the seams are and are loose. These seams are
located below the dog door insert. Some of the plastic is chewed away or missing where the seams are. The
galvanized dog door insert above the seam is also loose. This is creating a gap and is exposing bare wood, thus
preventing required cleaning and sanitization.
All shelters must be kept and maintained in good repair, for the prevention of disease from required cleaning and
sanitization and for the prevention of injury to the two adult dogs.
* Four enclosures, all housing a total of four adult dogs, have black plastic flooring with openings. The flooring is
not properly supported. The area where the flooring seams are, is bowing downward. This is creating a large gap
between the flooring and chain-link divider panels above the flooring. The dogs could get stuck in this gap trying to
crawl under the dividers, thus potentially causing injury. The flooring bounces as the dogs walk across it. This is an
indication of improper support under the flooring. If the flooring breaks this could allow the dogs to escape or
potentially get injured from collapsing or escape.
For the prevention of injury and escape, all enclosures must be kept and maintained in good repair.

3.1(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* 21 galvanized metal feeders were used to feed 35 adult dogs. The surfaces of these metal feeders was
excessively rusty and pitting. The surface area where the dogs eat out of the metal feeders was extremely corroded. The galvanized metal of three red plastic feeders used to feed four adult dogs, metal surface, was excessively
rusty, flaking and or corroding. The galvanized metal was located in the area where the dogs eat out of these red
plastic feeders. (cid:9)
* 16 metal frames are used in the dog entryway for 26 adult dogs and five puppies shelters. These metal frame
surfaces are excessively rusty, pitting and in areas have corroded away. There are jagged edges caused by the
corrosion for some of the metal frames. This could injure the dogs.
* 41 adult dogs have framed galvanized pipe chain link enclosures. The surface of 25 metal pipes that are along
the bottom are excessively rusty, pitting and or flaking. A few of the pipes, the pipe or metal surface had corroded
away.
These metal surfaces prevent required cleaning and sanitization, thus increasing the disease hazards. The surfaces
have corroded away in areas affecting the structural strength allowing possible injury to the dogs.
For the prevention of disease potential from required cleaning and sanitization and the prevention of injury from
structural integrity, all metal surfaces must be maintained repaired or replaced when worn and rusty.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* A plastic box used by one adult dog and five puppies is excessive chewed along the top or edge. Four plastic dog
entryways used by a total of eight adult dogs were excessively chewed along the edge. These chewed areas had
an accumulation of grayish to light brown grime. This indicates these surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and
sanitized. Therefore, improper cleaning and sanitization can increase the disease hazards for the animals.
For proper cleaning and sanitization and the prevention of disease hazards, all surfaces must be repaired or
replaced when worn, soiled or excessively chewed and or scratched.

3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Two enclosures, all housing a total of three adult dogs, have galvanized dog door inserts or galvanized
channeling. The metal has corroded away causing a jagged edge and is bent outward into the dog shelter. These
protruding jagged edges are at eye level of the dogs in normal standing position. These jagged edges could
potentially injure the animals.
For the prevention of injury to the animals, all enclosures must be free of sharp points and jagged edges.To be corrected by, 25-August-2019.
3.6(a)(2)(x)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* A litter of five puppies was observed walking across the plastic flooring with openings. The puppies feet were
passing through the openings as they walked. This could potentially harm the puppies and affect their gait.
For the prevention of injury and proper development, all flooring with openings should not allow the animals feet to
pass through.
To be corrected by, 21-August-2019.
3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
* Three Red plastic feed receptacles in three enclosures used to feed four adult dogs were chewed and dirty. Two
plastic feed bowls were used to feed four cats.
The feeders were chewed along the upper edges with hair and grime stuck to the chewed areas prohibiting
appropriated cleaning and sanitization. The grime was grayish to light brown in color in the chewed areas. this
indicates the feed receptacles are not clean and or santitized often enough and can increase the disease hazards
for the animals
Feed receptacles must be made of durable material that can be easily cleaned and sanitized in order to provide
wholesome uncontaminated feed. Food receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or
more often if necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste and other disease hazards.
3.10
WATERING.
* Two water receptacles used to water four cats have an accumulation of brownish to yellowish grime on the surface
of the plastic receptacles. This indicates the water receptacles are not being kept clean and could increase disease
hazards.
For the prevention of disease hazards to the animals, all water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized. to be corrected by, 21-August-2019.
