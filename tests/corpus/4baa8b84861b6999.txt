ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection four animals were observed to have active health conditions requiring treatment:
A female red white and brindle guinea pig in pen 47 was noted to be excessively thin with a readily palpable spine,
pelvis, ribs and scapula. The animals also had hair loss over its rump and down its back.
A female red black and white guinea pig in pen 45 was noted to be thin with a easily palpable spine, pelvis and ribs.
The animal had hair loss over its rump and down its back. Neurological symptoms were also noted including a head
tilt and unsteady gait.
A female brindle guinea pig in pen 8 was noted to have a 1 cm soft round mass under the skin on the left side of the
neck under the jaw.
A female black and white guinea pig in pen 22 was noted to have a 1 cm soft round mass under the skin on the left
side of the neck under the jaw.
Hair loss, thin body condition and swellings indicated there is an underlying health condition that requires treatment.
Left untreated these conditions cause pain and distress to the effected animals. Contagious conditions may spread
to other animals in the pen. Correct this by contacting your attending veterinarian to have these animals examined
and following all treatment recommendations.

SANITATION.
Several enclosures containing adult guinea pigs had excessive feces and/or wet bedding. The licensee stated that
they are cleaning enclosures and replacing bedding on a weekly basis. Wet bedding and excessive feces can
increase disease hazards to the animals. Correct this by ensuring primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized
often enough to prevent an excessive accumulation of excreta and provide dry bedding to the animals.
Additionally, all enclosures shall be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
