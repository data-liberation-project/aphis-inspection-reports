Watering.
In an enclosure containing two pigs, the only water receptacle available has a coating of brown film on all interior surfaces
and contains murky water. There is debris covering the bottom of the receptacle and old plant material floating in the
water.
Contaminated water can cause illness or be unpalatable to animals. All water receptacles must be kept clean and
sanitary.
To be corrected by 15 October 2021.
