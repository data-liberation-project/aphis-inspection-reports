FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The pig enclosure needs to be repaired so that it contains the animals in a dry environment. At the time of this
inspection the pig enclosure was a muddy mess and several of the smaller animals were outside of the enclosure.
Allowing the animals to escape the enclosure puts them at risk of injury or death from dogs and/or cars. Although
pigs like to wallow in the mud they should have access to more dry area than wet and they should be able to eat
without getting their food containers full of mud.
