SANITATION.
A small, miscellaneous supply/tool storage area located directly between two rabbit enclosures contained an
accumulation of old, dried feces. Also, there was a small plastic pan with old, discarded, pelleted rabbit food lying on
top of one of the rabbit enclosures.
Decomposing food or organic/waste material may create noxious odors, attract pests, and potentially create disease
hazards thus adversely impacting the health and well-being of the animals housed nearby.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set
forth in this subpart. A system should be in place to ensure areas surrounding animal housing areas are cleaned as
required to protect the health and well-being of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Camel pen: A corrugated metal panel on one side of the shelter structure is partially loose and detached from its
wooden, support beams exposing sharp and pointed metal edges within contact of the camel.
-Hoof stock pen: Several, sharp, pointed metal screws were protruding from the back side of a metal, shelter
structure within contact of the hoof stock animals.
Sharp, protruding points or edges in areas of contact with the animals may lead to injury. All enclosures must be
kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges or other hazards in order to protect the animals from
injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and maintenance must be in
place.Correct by 01/23/2017.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Food storage shed: There was an open bag of mixed grain feed used for camels located inside the food storage
shed leaving it unprotected from vermin or pests. Additionally, pesticide products and animal shampoos were
stored directly above several bags or containers of animal feed. Inappropriate storage of potentially toxic or
hazardous products may result in the unintentional contamination of the food supplies. Licensee removed all
pesticides and other potentially hazardous products from the food storage shed at time of inspection.
-Camel pen: Several alfalfa hay bales were stacked and stored directly on the ground inside the shelter structure.
This has reduced the available space within the shelter allowing the camel to lie directly next to these stored hay
bales. Also, the ground in this pen is wet due to recent precipitation in the area. Hay stored directly on the ground
within the animal shelter does not adequately protect it from deterioration, molding or contamination from pests or
animal waste. Facility staff removed all the stored hay bales from the shelter structure at time of inspection.
All supplies of food must be stored in a manner which adequately protects such supplies against deterioration,
molding or sources of contamination to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. A system which
adequately and safely protects all animal food supplies must be in place.
