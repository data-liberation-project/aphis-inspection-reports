2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On May 12, 2017, 15 ducks were found dead by the caretaker during the morning’s observations, due to
dehydration. The facility necropsy report indicated the severity of signs and drop in egg production would be
consistent with multiple days without access to water. The lack of drinking water can cause dehydration, pain,
suffering, and death. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner
that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary
discomfort. The facility has established new policies for daily observation of animal health and to ensure daily
access to potable water.
To be corrected from this date forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
