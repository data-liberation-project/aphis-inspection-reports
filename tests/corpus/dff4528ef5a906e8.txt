**Female Dachshund ("Bella" DOB 4-23-07) with chip number OAO2350968 has a heavy coating of dental calculus
covering both upper canines, the molar and premolar teeth, and partially coating all of the remaining incisor teeth.
There is creamy discharge mixed with hair and debris along the gum line of the upper premolar teeth. The gum line
is mildly recessed here and along the upper incisor teeth. There is one loose upper premolar tooth.
**Female Dachshund ("Windy" DOB 11-2-06) with chip number 090 548 536 has excessively heavy dental calculus
completely coating the upper canine teeth and remaining premolar and molar teeth. The excessive dental calculus
on the upper 4th premolar teeth causes a visible bulge to the face when the dog's mouth is closed. There is creamy
discharge and a recessed gum line over the left premolar teeth. There is one loose upper left premolar tooth.
Dental disease can be painful as it can cause damage to the gum tissue, teeth, and the bone of the jaw supporting
the teeth. Dental disease can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and affect the overall health of the
animal.

medical problems and be painful.
The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
