FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***There is a 5 foot property perimeter fence that it is not continuous in some areas. The two camel pastures are not
withing a 6 foot perimeter fence on all sides.The camel enclosures are 5 foot high constructed of 4 rung wood
boards with electric wire across the top of the fence. High tensile wire panels are attached to the board fencing.
Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet in height and of sufficient
distance from the outside primary enclosure to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. An appropriate
perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. The
appropriate fence would also function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. Correct by
