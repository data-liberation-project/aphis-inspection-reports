2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On Sunday March 19th, 2017, a small child (aged 3-4 years old) entered a portion of the outdoor giraffe exhibit
through a gap in the enclosure fence.
The gap was located at one end of the enclosure fence near a keeper gate. The keeper gate was locked, but there
was an approximately eight inch space between the fence post and another fence (giraffe crossing fence). Beyond
the fence is a plateau area roughly 20 x 20 feet that is approximately 10 feet above the giraffe’s exhibit. The child
walked out on to this plateau and another zoo patron climbed over the barrier fence to retrieve the child. The
giraffes were on exhibit at the time of the incident, however, no injuries to the child or the animals were reported. No
parties involved notified the zoo staff at the time of the incident.
When the inspector arrived on Wednesday March 22nd for this focused inspection, that gap had been corrected, but
an even larger space was identified in the same area between the keeper gate door and the giraffe crossing fence.
When the giraffe crossing gate is closed to allow the giraffes to move from the indoor enclosure to the outdoor
exhibit, a larger gap is created between the crossing gate and the keeper gate. That gap (approximately 15 inches)
is large enough for an adult to squeeze between the gate post and the crossing gate. The giraffes were not on
exhibit at the time of inspection, but there are 9 giraffes that typically have access to this exhibit.
This area where the gap is located is adjacent to a public walkway which allows the direct entry of unwanted
persons into the exhibit. This could lead to animal or human injury.
The enclosure and/or any fences must be constructed in a manner to ensure the public does not gain access to an
area that will allow direct contact with the animals. During public exhibition, any animal must be kept with sufficient
distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals
and the public. The barrier fence shall be maintained to prevent public contact with the animals to assure the safety
of both the animals and the public.
This item was corrected on the day of the inspection. This is a focused inspection to address the incident with the giraffe enclosure.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the General Curator.
