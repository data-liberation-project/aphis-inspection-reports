The pot-bellied pig enclosure appeared very damp for having no rain in several days. When asked about the
enclosure the licensee'(cid:25)s representative explained that when it rains, runoff from the roof collects in the pot-bellied
pig enclosure. The current enclosure is in a walled courtyard attached to the main building. This courtyard has a
solid concrete wall approximately 8 feet high on all sides limiting air circulation at the ground level. A slatted wood
awning slopes from the roof of the main building to the wall. The sides between the wall and the awning are
composed of vertical wood slats.
A temporary shelter to protect the pig from inclement weather has been built but this does not prevent the area from
becoming muddy during and after rain. Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the climate and the species needs
to be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to the animals. A
more permanent solution for providing this pig with an enclosure that allows him to stay dry, warm, and out of the
mud needs to be implemented. One alternative to considered is to cover the slatted awning with a solid material so
that the rain does not runoff into the pig enclosure but to the outside of the courtyard allowing the pig enclosure to
remain dry. The slatted sides between the wall and the awning could be left open for air circulation and a small
house could be provided for additional warmth if needed.
