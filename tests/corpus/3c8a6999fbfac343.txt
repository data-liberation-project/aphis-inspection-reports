3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris,
and at least once every two weeks.
Accumulations of excreta and debris were seen consistently throughout the enclosures, and were found especially
in the interior corners of the enclosures. Accumulations of debris were also observed particularly alongside the
interior enclosure walls throughout the facility. Some of the debris accumulations along the walls and floor appeared
to be moist and sticky, and much of the debris accumulation along the walls appeared to be adhered to the
enclosure surfaces.
Accumulations of debris and excreta can create health hazards for guinea pigs. Although the facility representative
indicated that enclosures are cleaned on a regular basis, the presence of the debris and excreta accumulations
illustrated that the enclosures must be cleaned more thoroughly and/or more frequently to prevent excreta and
debris accumulations.
The licensee must thoroughly clean and sanitize the enclosures at least once every two weeks or more often as
necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris. Correct by November 20, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
