2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is not a complete public barrier around the enclosure housing the two adult striped skunks. Members of the
public can potentially walk to the back of the skunk enclosure and have access to the animals housed within.
Lack of a complete public barrier does not adequately protect the public from a bite hazard. It also does not protect
the skunks from hazardous actions by members of the public.
Develop and maintain a complete public barrier around the skunk enclosure to help ensure for the safety of the
public and the animals.
