ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two of the dogs inspected at this facility need to be seen by the attending veterinarian for an evaluation and
treatment for their dental condition. Casey a female, poodle has a heavy buildup of brownish-grey dental tartar on
most of her teeth with slightly reddened and recessed gums. There was an odor coming from the mouth with
increased salivation. BomBom, a male, poodle has a heavy buildup of brownish-grey dental tartar on the entire
surface of both sides of the upper and lower cheek teeth as well as the upper portions of both upper canine teeth.
The gums are also slightly reddened with gum recession of both upper sides of the mouth.
Dental problems can cause pain and distress, can lead to inadequate nutrition and potentially affect the overall
health of the animal. All dogs with a heavy buildup of tartar or teeth and gum issues must be evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian for a diagnosis of the problem and to develop an effective treatment plan which must be
followed by the licensee. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
