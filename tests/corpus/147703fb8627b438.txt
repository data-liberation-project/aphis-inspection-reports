2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee did not have the Animal Inventory and Program of Veterinary Care available for review at the time of
inspection. Lack of records does not allow APHIS Officials to track animals as necessary or to review the Program
of Veterinary Care as required. Ensure copies of all required records are available during inspections. Correct form
this time forward.
3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
During the inspection that occurred at approximately 1:30 pm the petting zoo was located under direct sunlight. Only
one shade structure was available for use by the farm type animals, which included 5 sheep, 9 goats, 1 alpaca, 1
calf and 1 llama. This shade structure was not large enough for all of these farm type animals and the other animals
being exhibited to protect them from direct sunlight. Lack of sufficient shade can cause overheating and discomfort
of the animals and affect their wellbeing. Provide sufficient shade to protect all of the animals being exhibited from
direct sunlight. Correct immediately.

Note: The licensee corrected this noncompliance by providing additional shade for all of the animals at the time of
inspection.
Inspection conducted at Good Neighbor Days in Hugo, MN.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with President and this Veterinary Medical Officer.
