ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A Responsibe adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:30 pm on
03/24/2014.
There was no one available to conduct an unannounced inspection. A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process. I was able to make contact by phone and discussed the
need to provide business hours. I am providing my business card with this mailing. Please update your weekly
schedule. It may be emailed to me at the address on the card. Thank you.
