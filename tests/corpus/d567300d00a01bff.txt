ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A red adult female Brussels Griffon named “Pippy,” with microchip number 941-18989312, is limping on her right
front leg. When the inspector first saw the dog, she was jumping up and down on her back legs, but when she
stood back down; she started holding her right front foot up and walking on three legs. Occasionally she would put
some weight on the paw, but it appeared painful to do so. The representative took the dog out and manipulated the
leg and wrist joint, and the dog had no noticeable reaction. When the inspector palpated the bottom of the foot, the
dog pulled away slightly, and it appeared uncomfortable to her. The representative held the paw up for the
inspector to visualize it, and there is a soft, half-moon shaped pink swelling under the toe pads, approximately the
size of half a dime. When speaking with the licensee over the phone, she stated that she had not noticed the dog
limping, that Pippy is usually jumping up and down on her back legs. The licensee stated that she already had a
veterinary appointment the next day, so would also take Pippy in to have her examined by the attending
veterinarian.
Abnormal swellings on the foot can be uncomfortable or painful, impact the dog's gait and can affect the well-being
of the animal.
The licensee must have the dog examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis and possible treatment. The licensee
must ensure there are appropriate methods in place to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries
for the health and well-being of all the animals.
To be corrected by September 13, 2018.
This inspection was conducted with the facility representative, and the exit interview was conducted with the facility
representative and later with the licensee via phone.
