SANITATION.
Housekeeping. The windows, walls, and ceiling are covered in cobwebs. There is dust and dirt on the window sills
and walls. Housing facilities must be kept in a sanitary manner to prevent exposing the guinea pigs to potential
disease hazards including fungal, bacterial, and viral agents. The licensee must ensure the building housing the
animals is kept clean to maintain the health of the animals. Correct by August 16, 2017.

SANITATION.
Pest Control. Numerous flies were observed in the guinea pig enclosures as well as throughout the building. Fly
strips were present, but were covered with flies. There were six open windows in the facility, but no screens present
to prevent the entry of flies. The presence of these pests creates conditions which promote undue stress for the
animals and creates conditions which promote the spread of disease within the facility. Guinea pigs exposed to
numerous flies can increase health hazards such as parasitic disease, bacterial disease, and viruses. Additional
measures must be taken to control the fly problem such as increased sanitation, exclusion, other fly control
products, and/or consulting with a pest control company. Licensee must establish and maintain an effective
program for the control of pests to protect the health and well-being of the guinea pig colony. Correct by August 16,
