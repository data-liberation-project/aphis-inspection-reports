3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The metal water bottle holders in some enclosures still had jagged, sharp points that were pointing into the cages.
The sharp points are an injury risk to the animals within the enclosure. A system should be in place to ensure
primary enclosures, including accessories, are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

WATERING.
The majority of the water bottles in the animal cages had black and brown debris floating around in them. Upon
inspection we saw clean water bottles, filled with water, that were uncovered while fans in the facility were blowing
around dust and debris in the air. The licensee stated the debris could be from the debris in the air or from pieces
of the black rubber lixit stopper, which were worn and breaking down. It is the responsibility of the licensee to make
sure all water receptacles be kept clean and sanitary for the overall health and well-being of the animals.

3.31(c)
SANITATION.
In the facility there were many flies that were primarily around the uncovered feed storage bin near the animal
cages. These insects can contaminate food and potentially transmit bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can have a
negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals. There needs to be an effective program for control of
insects and other pests where the animals and their food are being stored to prevent the spread of disease and
maintain the animals overall health and well-being.
