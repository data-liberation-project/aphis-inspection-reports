RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
Review of records for auctions held in Sep. 2015 and Nov. 2015 reveals multiple consignment forms that are
missing required information including one or more of the following: USDA number of the person selling/consigning
the animal, or the driver's license number/state and vehicle plate number/state if not USDA licensed, and complete
description of the animal to include sex, date of birth or approximate age and color/markings. The following records
are representative examples of missing required information noted:
Consignor 245 (CG) consigned a male zebra in the Sept. auction-no USDA license number and no vehicle plate
driver's license numbers and states are recorded.
Consignor 457 (KM) consigned 8 prairie dogs at the Sept. auction-no sex or age is listed for the prairie dogs
Consignor 818 (DH) consigned 2 male zebra and 2 male camels at the Sept auction-no USDA license number and
no vehicle plate/driver's license numbers and states are recorded.
Consignor 5515 (RF) consigned 1 chinchilla and 2 cavy at the Nov. auction-no sex or age is listed for the animals
Consignor 383 (DS) consigned one male and one female camel at the Nov. auction-no USDA license number and
no vehicle plate/driver's license numbers and states are recorded.
Consignor 664 (PM) consigned 2 male cavy at the Nov.auction-no USDA license number and no vehicle
plate/driver's license numbers and states are recorded.
All required information for each consigned animal needs to be kept and maintained to allow for proper identification
of the animals consigned/auctioned. The required information must include: the name and address of the person
who owned or consigned the animal, the USDA license number of the person selling/consigning the animal or the
vehicle license number and state and the driver's license number and state of the person if not licensed under the
Act, the date of consignment, and a description of the animal which shall include the species and breed/type, sex,
date of birth/approximate age, color and any distinctive markings and the auction sales number assigned to the
animal.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Review of the Nov. 2015 auction records show multiple consignment forms in which the consignor is one of thefacility principals. It was established by conversation with the consignor that the animals were purchased elsewhere
(at an auction in Mississippi in Sept. 2015) and resold (brokering). There are no records available during the
inspection to show where or when the animals were originally acquired. They include the following: a total of thirty
four hedgehogs and one porcupine.
Each dealer shall have all records including all required acquisition records availabe to allow APHIS officials to
examine records required to be kept by the Act.

PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
*At the Nov. 2015 auction, two male capybara (consignor 837) were accepted/consigned without the
owner/consignor having a valid USDA license.
*At the Nov. 2015 auction, nine hedgehogs (five female and four male) were accepted/consigned (consignor #40
SF) without the owner having a valid USDA license.
*At the Sept. 2015 auction, one neutered male kinkajou was "purchased in the parking lot" by an auction
principal/representative according to a conversation with the inspector and was then consigned under the auction
representative's name since the kinkajou owner did not have a valid USDA license. A Florida Health Certificate was
attached to the auction consignment record with the name and address of the unlicensed individual.
No USDA one time exemption forms were noted on file with the auction's records.
The facility may not consign or purchase any animal from a person required to be licensed but who does not hold a
current, valid, unsuspended license.
Exit conducted with facility representative.
