ANNUAL REPORT.
The annual report provided to USDA for fiscal year 2015 did not include Rabbits, and indicate only 1 ferret was used
on a research protocol. The inspection inventory from 17 September, 2015 reported rabbits on hand, and the facility
records indicated that more than one ferret was utilized during fiscal year 2015. A facility representative stated that
there had been personnel changes in recent past that may have resulted in this discrepancy. Current animal
numbers are being kept by the attending veterinarian and they are currently exploring multiple options for future
back-up systems to ensure that numbers are checked and remain accurate. Numbers of animals must be accurately
kept and reported on the annual report in order to ensure proper regulatory oversight by and communication with
USDA.
Correct by ensuring that numbers of animals used in regulated activities are accurate from this point forward, and by
submitting an amended report for the fiscal year 2015 to the regional office.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Several marmoset enclosures contained areas with a plastic coated wire mesh; however in some areas the edges
of the wire were left with sharp points, in areas the animals could reach (both inside and outside the enclosure).
Exposed sharp points could injure nonhuman primates. The enclosures must be kept in good repair. Primary
enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they: have no sharp points or edges that could injure the
nonhuman primates and protect the nonhuman primates from injury.
