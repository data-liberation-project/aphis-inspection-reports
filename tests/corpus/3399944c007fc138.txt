ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:25pm to
1:00pm on 03/24/2015. Nobody appeared to be present at the facility; I knocked on the front door and left a
message via phone for the licensee while there. A facility representative returned my call later in day.
