2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A male llama, just over 1 year of age, was found dead in the enclosure during the inspection. The licensee reports
he had talked to the attending veterinarian in the past about this animal(cid:25)s failure to gain weight. When inspectors
contacted the attending veterinarian, he reports that he last talked to the licensee about this animal at the end of
October 2015, of this year, approximately one month ago. The licensee does not have any documentation of
having communicated with any veterinarian at any time regarding the care or treatment of this animal. Failure to
address the animal'(cid:25)s inability to gain weight or failure to thrive can result in an animal that suffers from an
undiagnosed problem.
The licensee must ensure that all animals with health problems be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to
ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.
Animals with ongoing problems must be evaluated as needed to ensure that care is provided over time. This
information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made
available to the inspector upon request.
The two camels and one goat from inspection on 11-September-2015, were seen by the Attending Veterinarian.
2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
* During the inspection, the one sheep that had escaped through the perimeter fence was being chased by a dog.
The sheep was seen darting back and forth at a full run, trying to avoid the dog. Harassment or chasing of animals
by other, non-compatible animals can cause injury during the chase or behavioral stress to the animal.
The licensee must ensure that the handling of all animals will be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a
manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. To be corrected by, 3-December-2015
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Several large round bales are stored next the animals'(cid:25) enclosure and are ready for feeding. The large bales are
exposed to the elements. Several bales are stored directly on the ground. Three bales of hay are wet and soiled.
Deteriorated hay can affect the wholesome nutritional value of the hay. This hay can affect the health of one goat,
one sheep and two dromedary camels.
The licensee must provide adequate storage for the hay to prevent deterioration and molding. This will ensure the
hay is wholesome and preserve the hay'(cid:25)s nutritional value.
3.127(b) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
* The shelter for the animals at this facility is a large metal building with large, drive-through doors on each side.
During the inspection, the west side door was open to allow access to the shelter. The wind was blowing from the
west. There was no bedding in the building. One heat lamp bulb was on in the center of the building. The
temperature in the building was measured by the Kestrel thermometer to be 35.6. Two adult llamas in the shelter
were seen shivering. Shivering indicates cold stress in animals.
The licensee must ensure that natural or artificial protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals. Individual
animals must be acclimated before they are exposed to the extremes of the individual climate.
To be corrected by, 2-December-2015.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
* There is a perimeter fence under construction around the enclosure housing the two camels. This is also acting as
the enclosure fence at this time. At the start of the inspection, 2 sheep were seen outside the perimeter fence. The
sheep were able to exit the housing area through gaps under this fence. The outdoor enclosure, housing thecamels, must have a perimeter fence at least six feet high and a minimum distance of three feet from the primary
enclosure fence. As of the last inspection, this non-compliant item has not been corrected. A perimeter fence will
provide protection to the camels by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence also function as a secondary containment
system for the camels in the facility.
3.129(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
* The two feeding stations on the ground used to feed four Llamas, four goats, four sheep and two camels had no
hay. The feeding stations only had a little hay on the ground intermingled with fecal waste and dirt. This little bit of
hay was soiled. Some of the animals were observed browsing for food at the feeding stations. There was no grain,
mineral blocks or vegetation available to the animals at the time of inspection. The licensee stated, the only food for
the animals is hay.
The lack of access to wholesome food for the animals and can affect their health and well-being, can cause poor
body condition, sickness and even death.
The licensee shall provide food that is wholesome, palatable, free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and
nutritive value to maintain the animals in good health.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
* In the Paddock housing four goats, four Llamas, Four sheep and two camels there are two large piles of manure
approximately four to five feet high and at least six to seven feet across.
Excess manure in the enclosures can attract pests and can cause disease hazards and odors.The licensee must remove the excess excreta as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

Wagner (ACI).
