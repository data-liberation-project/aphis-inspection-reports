3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A rabbit was injured after it escaped from its enclosure. The rabbit fell from the enclosure as its door was not
secured. The animal's injuries were enough to warrant veterinary care. Unsecured animal enclosures can lead to
animal escapes and injury.
Assure that the enclosures contain the rabbits and protect them from injury.
To be corrected: The rabbit enclosures have been modified since the escape.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
