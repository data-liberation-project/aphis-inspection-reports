Handling of animals.
On October 22, 2020, during a contracted animal interaction at the facility, a guest was bitten by a lion cub. Evidence of
the incident was posted on social media (Instagram) the same day showing two photos; lion cub interacting with guest,
and the bite marks on the guest's skin.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with
sufficient safeguards as to assure the safety of animals and the public. When interacting with guests, the handling of
animals by trained facility personnel must be done as safely/carefully and expeditiously as possible in a manner that does
not cause physical harm neither to the animal or the public.

Correct from this day forward.
2.131(d)(3) Critical

Handling of animals.
On March 18, 2021, a photograph was posted on social media of a guest petting a juvenile lion, over 16 weeks of age.
Handling of big cats over the age of 16 weeks pose a risk of injury to the public, and maintaining control is questionable
even while tethered.


During public exhibition, dangerous animals such as lions, tigers, wolves, bears, or elephants must be under the direct
control and supervision of a knowledgeable and experienced animal handler.

Correct from this day forward.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
An appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman
primates was not available for inspection. Additionally, the attending veterinarian was not satisfied with the facility's
implementation of the current enrichment program for nonhuman primates. The licensee must develop, document, and
follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman
primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate
professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the facility's Attending Veterinarian (AV). As required by the
Animal Welfare Act, the plan must be developed / updated and available to APHIS inspectors upon request.
