2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The attending veterinarian has not visited the facility since January of 2021 and the program of veterinary care states that
routine visits to the premises are to occur a minimum of two times per year.

Regularly scheduled visits to the premises is important so that the veterinarian can evaluate the adequacy of veterinary
and other aspects of animal care. Formal arrangements with the attending veterinarian must include a written program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer or exhibitor. Correct by 15 JUN 2022.
2.40(b)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A goat named "Duke" became sick and eventually passed away on 3/16/22. The licensee claims to have contacted a
veterinarian by phone prior to his passing but could not provide a name or records of such consultation. No exam or care
was provided by any veterinarian. Two veterinarians that have previously provided care at the facility (the attending vet
and another local vet) also could not confirm that they were consulted in this case.

The lack of appropriate methods could lead to more serious disease or death and cause unnecessary pain or discomfort


to the regulated animals. The program of veterinary care must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries. Correct by ensuring the provision of adequate veterinary care for all regulated animals.
