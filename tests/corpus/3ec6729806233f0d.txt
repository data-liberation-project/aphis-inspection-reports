3.13(c)(3) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
A juvenile dog was arriving from Ontario, CA on United Airlines waybill # 016-ONT-30844516 en route to Eugene,
OR. The shipper's declaration attached to the top of the carrier was not filled in appropriately. Whereas the shipper
and consignee's name and contact info were filled out, the section that has the time the animal was last offered food
and water, and instructions regarding feeding and watering was left blank.
Failure to ensure that the shipper provides certification in writing regarding feeding and watering instructions at the
time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment can put the animal at risk. The airline must ensure that the owner has
provided this information in writing, and that animals are adequately cared for while in transit.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the United representative at the cargo office.
