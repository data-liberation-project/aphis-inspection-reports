Facilities, indoor.
The temperature in the guinea pig housing facility was 55.6 degrees F as measured with a kestrel. There was a wall
propane heater but the boiler that powered the floor heating was off.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may cause discomfort and
predispose them to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.

Watering.
There was a buildup of bedding, fecal material, and debris around the nipples of the automatic waterers.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.

Sanitation.


There was a large amount of discarded bedding, hay, and debris on the floor under and around the guinea pig pens.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and
may contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.
