ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30-2:00 on
14-May-18.
She was with an insurance adjuster at the time and couldn't do the inspection. Told her i could come back if
possible but i had a lot of others to do. Never made it back.
