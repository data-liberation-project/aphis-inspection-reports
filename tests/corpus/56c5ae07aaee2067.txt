2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male poodle #147, “Joker” has matted fur underneath his belly area. Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin which
can be painful and trap urine and debris in the fur. Per the PVC, these dogs are to be checked weekly for matted fur and
trimmed as needed to prevent these types of issues. This needs to be addressed for the health and comfort of the dog.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Housekeeping at the facility needs to be addressed. In the main kennel, and whelping building, there is excess food
scattered on the floor and several of the feeders in empty enclosures still have food in them. The unused whelping boxes
in the main kennel have rodent bait and rodent feces in the boxes that needs to be cleaned. Excess food that is left out
should be cleaned daily to reduce this attraction to pests and to promote good housekeeping at the facility.
