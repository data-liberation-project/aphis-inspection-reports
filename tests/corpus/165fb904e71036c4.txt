A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:25 AM on
11/20/2014. Multiple attempts were made to contact the licensee and the animal caretaker at the contact numbers
provided. The Animal Care Inspector waited for 1 hour for a responsible individual to respond before departing.
APHIS Officials must be allowed to access the facility during business hours to inspect and ensure the minimum
standards set forth in the Animal Welfare Act are being met and to check on the health, safety and well-being of the
animals.
