ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Sophia the tiger's right eye is draining with a yellowish substance and the third eyelid is reddend in color. The
owner stated that this has been an ongoing problem since it ws treated in January. They also stated that they hadn't
contacted the attending veterinarian since then about the animals condition. After the inspection the owner was
instructed to contact the attending veterinarian about the eye and the veterinarian has prescribed drops for the
felines eye as treatment. When I contacted the veterinarian he stated that he had not spoken to the owner in a
while. The veterinarian was also asked about the several deaths that have occurred in the last year and he stated
that the owner has not contacted him about any deaths at the facility. The owner is not communicating with the
veterinarian about the health concerns of his animals. As a result the animals are going extended periods of time
without adequate veterinary care. The owner must consult their attending veterinrian on health concerns of the
animals in a timely manner in order to provide the proper preventatives and treatments to ensure good health and
well-being of the animals. Correct from this day forward.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The olive baboon's enclosure had perches, platforms, structural and support beams that had been chewed
through. The chewed support beams integrity may be compromised and could cause injury to the animal or allow
the animal to escape. Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are
structurally sound for the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and
they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.
Correct by July 24, 2014.
***The rhesus macaque's fencing was pulled up under the den from the inside and a hole was made that exited to
the outside of the enclosure. Something has been coming in and out of the enclosure and this hole could be an exit
point for the macaque as well. Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that
they are structurally sound for the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair,
and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from
entering. Correct by July 24, 2014.3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The bonnet macaque and black spider monkey's guillitine doors to there dens is rusted and needs to replaced
and/or repaired. The surfaces of housing facilities including perches, shelves, swings, boxes, houses, dens, and
other furniture-type fixtures or objects within the facility must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required
cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface for the health and well-being of the
animals. Correct by July 17, 2014
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the brown lemurs enclosure on the perch and on the ground there was an excessive amount of old feces. Hard
surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent
accumulation of excreta or disease hazards. If the species scent mark, the surfaces must be sanitized or replaced
at regular intervals as determined by the attending veterinarian in accordance with generally accepted professional
and husbandry practices. Floors made of dirt, absorbent bedding, sand, gravel, grass, or other similar material, and
planted enclosures must be raked or spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to
avoid contact with excreta. Correct by July 5, 2014.
3.125
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the goats primary enclosure there is a large mound of cut down trees and limbs that had not been removed.
There are several pointy sticks and jagged pieces of wood that could potentially injure the animals contained within
the enclosure. These items should be removed to ensure the animals safety in their primary enclosure.
***In a primary enclosure containing one wolf housed in a dog pen next to the main trailer where people check-in to
the park there are holes being dug by the fence line by the wolf. In one hole they had attempted to fill it the holes
but the wolf has dug several more holes that haven't been filled. If the animal continues to dig without the holes
being filled he will soon be able to escape his enclosure. Corrected immediately by relocating animal to a more
secure enclosure.
***In the lions, tigers and the wolves enclosure there is an abundance of foliage and trees growing on the fence line
causing the barbed wire to come down and pulling at the fence. It also makes the fence line virtually impossible to
observe and inspect completely for deficiencies. There were dead trees that had fallen on the fence that haven't
been removed and several 3 foot kick-ins have been removed and haven't been replaced. ***The fence for Tabitha the tiger is barely 10 feet on the open side. Being that she is highly aggressive her
enclosure definitely needs to be repaired as soon as possible.
*** The wolves enclosure can't be visualized in the rear because it is overgrown and there could be several
deficiencies like at the front of the enclosure. The wolves enclosure has an opening under the gate that could allow
the escape of the wolves. Also since the enclosure is overgrown you can't count the animals contained within.
***In several lock-out pens for the tiger's there were holes under the fence line and there is a tree that is so close to
the fence line that a tiger could climb up and out.
***There was a chain link fence added to the top of a tigers enclosure that was not securely fastened to the old
fence leaving a gap in the fence line. This could allow the animal to escape.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals. The fencing for the tigers and lions should be at least 8 ft tall with a closed
top, 12 feet tall with a 3 foot kick-in or 16 feet tall straight up. Correct by July 31, 2014.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***A wolf that was being housed in a dog pen in the front of the facility where the public checks in doesn't have a 3
ft. barrier and the public can put their hands right on the cage.
***The perimeter fence for the tigers, lions, wolves, bears, cougars and leopards was open when we arrived. There
was no one around that worked with the facility. We had been there 10 minutes before the wife walked over to lock
the gate. Other guest had arrived in the meantime. Anybody could have walked right in with the dangerous animals
before the owner would have realized.
All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals such as large felines (e.g.,
lions, tigers, leopards, cougars, etc.), bears, wolves, rhinoceros, and elephants, or less than 6 feet high for other
animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the
animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having
contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical
contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such fences
less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the Administrator. Correctedimmediately.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
***The food fed to the lions, tigers, bears and wolves are not being placed in food receptacles. Instead the food is
being placed on the concrete that has dirt and grass on it. In one tigers enclosure the food and the animals feces
were in close proximity on the ground. The coatimundi has a feeder that is dirty and soiled. The area in which the
food is placed is not clean and in times is subjected' to feces and pest like ants. Food, and food receptacles, if used,
shall be sufficient in quantity and located so as to be accessible to all animal's in the enclosure and shall be placed
so as to minimize contamination. Food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times. Correct by July 17,
2014.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***In the tigers enclosure there is a big metal bucket that is being used as a platform but in 100 deg. F weather it is
a dangerous object. They animals didn't lay on it and if they did they would get burned.
***In the goats enclosure there are several strands of green hay bale twine scattered across the ground and it
needs to be removed from the enclosure.
The items and anything that could potentially harm or injure the animals should be removed from the enclosures.
The premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices set forth.
The exit interview was conductd with the owner.
