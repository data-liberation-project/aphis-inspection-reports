FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An opened plastic bag containing bedding material used for several covered species of small mammals is currently
being stored on the floor inside a ground level cabinet. Also, there were several accumulations of spilled bedding
material on the floor near the opened bag. Bedding stored in this manner and location does not adequately protect
such supplies against deterioration and infestation or contamination by vermin. Bedding for all animals must be
stored in facilities which provide adequate protection against infestation, deterioration, or contamination by vermin.
A storage system for animal bedding which adequately protects these supplies for all animals must be in place.
