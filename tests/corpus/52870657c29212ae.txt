2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee was not able to provide records with the acquisition information and the current number of animals on hand
at the facility.
Failure to maintain records for animals on hand can make it difficult to track their movement and make it hard to identify
trends in animal losses, which could indicate disease conditions.
Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully disclose the information concerning animals,
purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or
which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.
