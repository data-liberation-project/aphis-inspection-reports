The breathing of one female sheep (Mary Ann) was shallow and rapid during the entire time she was observed
during the inspection. She also stood with her head down at times and occasionally shifted weight off of her left front
foot and was seen to take a few steps without bearing any weight on her left front foot. Increased respiratory rate
can indicate pain, respiratory disease, or a variety of other medical problems. Altered gait may indicate pain which
can result from trauma, chronic skeletal problems and other medical problems. The animal listed above must be
examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the
condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult, male Japanese macaque had areas of hair loss on the right forearm. The skin of this area does not
appear to be red. The macaque was observed to pluck at the hair/skin in this area of his arm during the majority of
time during the inspection that he was observed while in the outdoor portion of his enclosure. The facility
representative believes that the plucking has improved since first cited in December 2015 but has no documentation
to show this and document his progress other than the fact that he is now plucking one forearm rather than both.
This animal was evaluated by the attending veterinarian (AV) on 11 Dec 2015. At that time, the AV recommended
providing insects in a fleece pad to simulate social grooming. The facility representative reports that the animal did
not seem to enjoy this but did not report that information back to the AV for further instructions. Also at that meeting,
the AV suggested looking into finding the animal a new home or providing antianxiety medications. As of the time of
this inspection, the facility has not has not communicated with the AV about these options or about the ongoing
condition of the animal.
Daily observation and direct, timely, and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is essential for the
heath and care of the animals. Lack of communication of ongoing problems might result in a delay of treatment if
severity of the problem is not known by the veterinarian. The licensee must establish as part of the program ofveterinary care a plan of daily observation and a mechanism of direct, timely and frequent communication so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the
attending veterinarian.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The adult, male Japanese macaque that was observed showing signs consistent with psychological stress (plucking
his hair/skin and had areas of hair loss on his right forearm) has not had his environmental enhancement plan
altered by the attending veterinarian (AV) beyond a few suggestions given at the time of the physical exam. The
written environmental enrichment plan that has been approved by the (AV) does not include special considerations
for nonhuman primates that are showing signs of being in psychological distress. The facility has been offering a
variety of enrichment items but the items and the plan for their use are not specified in the current enrichment plan
and the hair/skin plucking continues. Nonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs that must be
addressed when in captivity. Failure to do so can result in a variety of behavior problems including, but not limited
to, hair/skin plucking. The licensee must provide certain nonhuman primates special attention regarding
enhancement of their environment based on the needs of the individual species and in accordance with the
instructions of the attending veterinarian. Nonhuman primates that show signs of being in psychological distress
through behavior or appearance must have these special considerations addressed in the written program of
environmental enrichment.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are still two places on the outside east wall of the bear enclosure where the concrete blocks were starting to
deteriorate. In these areas the blocks were starting to slough off layers of the concrete. One area nearest the bear
egress door had been repaired since the last inspection.

The top wooden rail on the inside of the donkey enclosure has been chewed to the point where the majority of this
board is missing.
Surfaces that are not maintained may cause injury to the animals. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and
kept in good repair.This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO
and Kendall Lundy, ACI.
