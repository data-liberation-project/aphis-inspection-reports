CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures
The outside portions of three enclosures containing 10 dogs total have not been cleaned in approx. 3 days. A large
amount of feces was within these areas of the enclosures. Excessive feces in kennel areas poses a disease, odor
and pest hazard to the area and the dogs. All enclosures must be spot cleaned at least once every day or more
often if necessary to reduce disease, odor and pest hazards. To be corrected by: 12/12/14
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
