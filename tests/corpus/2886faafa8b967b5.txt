2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On August 31, 2020, approximately at 6:00 pm, upon a paid agreement with a member of the public, the licensee allowed
the member of the public to enter the enclosure of an adult female black leopard, for a contact/interaction session with the
regulated animal. Immediately after entry to the enclosure, the leopard attacked the member of the public, causing several
injuries, resulting in hospitalization of the member of the public. The licensee failed to assure the safety to both, a member
of the public and the animal. As required by this section, during any interaction with the public, the regulated animal must
be handled by the licensee or designated handler, so there is minimal risk of harm to the public and/or animal.

Correct by: Resolved. At the time of this inspection, the leopard was not in the premises; it was transferred to another
USDA licensed facility.
2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A current/ updated written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available for inspection. The PVC presented for
inspection was signed and dated over three years ago; May 2017. Since then, the licensee acquired other species: black-
and-white ruffed lemur, squirrel monkey, domestic pig, domestic rabbit, red fox, and alpaca. A current PVC is required to


ensure adequate veterinary care for the species on hand. In order to comply with this section of the Animal Welfare Act
(AWA), the licensee must identify and employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements, that shall include a
written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits by the attending veterinarian to all areas on the premises
where the animals are kept.
