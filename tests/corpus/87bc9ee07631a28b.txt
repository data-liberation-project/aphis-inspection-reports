PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The building housing the Chinese dwarf hamsters had weanlings in at least 51 enclosures that housed 22 animals
within the each enclosure. Enclosures measured 20in x 13.5in, or 270 sq inches, which provided 12.27 sq inches of
floor space per animal. However, the maximum population of hamsters allowed per enclosure is 20 animals. No
more than 20 hamsters can be housed in the same enclosure. Licensee must ensure that adequate space is
provided in order to prevent stress and allow for sufficient freedom of movement. Correct by February 24, 2018.
