FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A six (6) foot perimeter fence had been constructed around the lynx cage. However, the fencing is not anchored in
the ground. An anchored fence ensures structural integrity to prevent direct contact with the animal contained
within. The perimeter fence for the lynx must be anchored to prevent it from being easily moved or disassembled.
NOTE: The Asian clawed otters were not present for this inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the co-owner.
