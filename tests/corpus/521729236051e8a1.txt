Feeding.
The fridge located in the food prep area contained old organic material sticking to some shelves. The food prep counter
contained a chopping board which appeared to have pieces of dried old food material sticking to it. Several meal worms,
which are fed to the animals, were observed on the floor of the food prep area, some of which were still alive. Unsanitary
surfaces in the food prep area can contaminate the food or attract pests. Sanitize food prep area as often as necessary
to avoid contamination. Correct by 08/10/2021
