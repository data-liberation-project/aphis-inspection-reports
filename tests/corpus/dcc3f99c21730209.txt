2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The alpaca and goat enclosures do not prohibit unsupervised contact between the animal and the guests at the
facility.
Unsupervised contact between the animals and the public puts the animals and the public at risk of potential harm.
Steps should be taken to minimize such risks, either by assuring that a trained attendant is present any time contact
could occur, or by installing sufficient barriers to prevent such contact.
To be corrected immediately via temporary means, and with a permanent correction to be completed by 12/1/15.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The rabbit enclosure had a large accumulation of excreta, used bedding, hair, and debris.
Inadequate husbandry in the rabbit enclosure could promote disease, parasites and / or vermin.
The rabbit enclosure should be cleaned immediately, and maintained in sanitary condition.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures for the alpacas and for the goats contained elements that are potentially hazardous to the animals:
- The alpaca enclosure had exposed electrical wires on the ground, inside the enclosure, within reach of the
animals.
- The goat enclosure contained wooden pallets that had protruding nails.
Two exotic feline enclosures were in need of repair: - In the inside shelter enclosure for the bobcat the linoleum on the floor was peeling, and deteriorating.
- In the inside shelter enclosure for the serval named "Ptah" the linoleum floor was discolored, buckling and lifting
from the floor, suggesting that moisture had gotten underneath of it. Next to the door there was bare wood exposed.
Additionally there was a small hole in the wall opposite the door (less than an inch in size), and upon examining the
back of the enclosure from the outside it was observed that there was severe deterioration of the wood, threatening
the structural integrity of the enclosure.
Failure to maintain enclosures in good repair could result in injury or escape. Sharp objects and electrical wires
could cause injury or death. Deteriorating surfaces present an ingestion risk, threaten structural strength, and
impede cleaning.
Animal enclosures should be free of objects that could cause injury to the animals. Enclosures should be
maintained in good repair, so that they can be kept clean. Enclosures should be regularly repaired so as to maintain
their structural integrity and prevent escape or injury. Steps should be taken immediately to remove all hazards from
enclosures. Repairs should be completed by 12/1/15.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
