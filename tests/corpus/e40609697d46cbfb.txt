The attending veterinarian diagnosed caseous lymphadenitis (CL) in the goat herd. The attending veterinarian wrote a
protocol for the treatment and management of this disease for the licensee to follow. The attending veterinarian had
previously stated to the inspector that the licensee is not following this protocol. The licensee stated today that she is not
following the protocol and has not yet had the additional treatment that she is utilizing approved by the attending
veterinarian. At least one goat has received treatment since the time of the last inspection. Each exhibitor shall assure
that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to
oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. The attending veterinarian must be given appropriate
authority to oversee all aspects of adequate veterinary care. All attending veterinarian instructions must be followed to

The drug cabinet contained the following expired drugs: Estrumate injection expiration date 09-2001, BO-SE injection
expiration date 05-2021 and thiamine hydrochloride injection expiration date 07-2021. Using expired drugs is not an

appropriate method to prevent or treat injury or illness. The efficacy of these products beyond their expiration date is
uncertain. Use of these drugs could lead to failure to prevent or treat illness causing animal harm and suffering.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A young Jersey calf approximately three months old was observed to have a cough and cloudy nasal discharge present in
its left nostril. This calf coughed multiple times while it was being observed. The facility had already conducted morning
chores in this area and the staff failed to notice the condition of this calf. It is important that animal health conditions such
as this be noted in a timely manner and reported to the attending veterinarian or that previously prescribed veterinary
SOPs be followed for treatment. A calf as young as this can quickly become very ill which could lead to suffering and
even death of the animal. Thorough daily observations must be completed for all the animals and animal health
conditions must be reported to the attending veterinarian as appropriate. Contact the attending veterinarian for evaluation
and treatment of this calf.

A pig known as Richard had a large lump present on his ventral abdomen. This lump was about eight inches long, four
inches wide and three inches in height. The attending veterinarian has not yet seen or evaluated this pig for treatment.
The facility had treated the pig for a period of ten days with dexamethasone and amoxicillin. It is important that animal
health issues be reported promptly to the attending veterinarian to determine a diagnosis and treatment. A delay in
reporting could lead to serious animal health issues and possibly death. Thorough daily observations must be completed
for all the animals and animal health conditions must be reported to the attending veterinarian as appropriate. Contact the
attending veterinarian for evaluation and treatment of this pig.
