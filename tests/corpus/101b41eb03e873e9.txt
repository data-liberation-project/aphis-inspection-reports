The written program of veterinary care is incomplete. The guidance included in the written program of veterinary
care is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods to prevent,
control, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites. Currently the written PVC
contains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed. Additionally, the recommended treatments
consist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of
administration, which are necessary when drugs are intended for use in species for which there are no
manufacturer label instructions, or which personnel have been trained in proper administration. Regarding
frequency of administration the written PVC says (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) for the majority of the species. There is no guidance
elsewhere clarifying what (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) means. A written program of veterinary care is required when attending
veterinarians are employed on a part time basis to ensure that the licensee and facility staff understand the direction
of the Attending Veterinarian and provide a mechanism by which APHIS Officials can determine their compliance
with those directions. Failure to include complete written guidance regarding these topics does not ensure good
welfare of the animals maintained by the facility as miscommunications may lead to failure to provide measures for
prevention, control, and treatment of disease. Correct by working with the attending veterinarian to ensure that
complete guidance regarding the dose, route, and frequency of administration for all drugs listed for each species
that are not specifically labelled by the manufacturer are incorporated into the written program of veterinary care. At
a minimum guidance must include species-specific directions for vaccination, euthanasia, capture and restraint, and
the prevention, control, and treatment of internal and external parasites.
The attending veterinarian has added additional information to the written PVC giving his authority for (cid:28)farm
personnel(cid:29) to perform tail docking and castrations. This note does not provide adequate guidance to carry out these
procedures. For tail docking, the note states the band will be placed (cid:28)in the desired place(cid:29). More specific guidance
is required. Also, this note does not give ages of animals these procedures may be performed on, of if any drugs
are to be used and what dose, route, and frequency to give them for each species, and any post-procedural care or
complications to watch for. The Farm Manager stated that the licensee is the only person who is doing these
procedures. Tail docking and castration can cause significant complications if performed incorrectly.. Failure to
maintain a written program of veterinary care, including guidance for procedures to be performed by the licensee or
facility staff, does not ensure adequate care for the animals on hand. The licensee must obtain additional guidance,including detailed instructions from the attending veterinarian in order to perform these procedures in accordance
with accepted standards of adequate veterinary care. Correct by maintaining a written program of veterinary care
that includes specific written guidance for procedures to be performed by the licensee or other facility personnel.

***There is a male tricolor Nubian goat with a round mass approximately the size of a large chicken egg in the right
flank region. This could be indicative of an infectious disease or other process involving enlargement of regional
lymph nodes. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated accordingly, including
instructions on control of spread of infection if applicable. Correct by November 11, 2015.
***There is a female tricolor Nubian goat with a discolored area on the left shoulder that appears to be stained from
recent infectious drainage. Lesions in this region are very typical of an infectious process that has been identified in
previous animals at this facility. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated accordingly,
including instructions on control of spread of infection if applicable. Correct by November 11, 2015.
***There is a female Nubian goat #7000 that has a small wart-like growth on the right side of her mouth, and
another similar lesion between the front toes of her right foot. This is suggestive of a contagious, infectious disease
that can potentially be transmitted to humans. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated
accordingly, including instructions on control of spread of infection to both animals and people, if applicable.
Correct by November 11, 2015.
*** During the August 25, 2015 inspection, a spotted fallow deer in the drive-through area near the entrance gate
was lethargic and dull in mentation. At the conclusion of that inspection, the licensee asked the Farm Manager to
go into the drive through to look for fallow deer that wouldn(cid:25)t move when approached. On the day of the exit
interview, the farm manager informed APHIS Officials that facility personnel had driven through the park several
times and were unable to locate any fallow deer that were acting abnormally. Additionally, the Farm Manager
contacted an APHIS Official several days after the 25 August 2015 inspection and stated the facility had never
found the animal noted on the report. The APHIS Official informed the Farm Manager to be sure to document this
animal was not provided veterinary care since it could not be located. The Farm Manager stated during this
inspection that the facility believes this animal was sleeping and not ill or in need of medical care. The facility must
develop a plan to ensure that animals can be identified and treated if needed. Although group housing of animals is
acceptable, the facility must be able to identify, isolate if needed, and treat all animals found in need of veterinary
care. *** The current program of veterinary care still authorizes the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for
(cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29) (without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority
of species including: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat, Aoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai,
Fallow Deer, Eland, and Elk. During this inspection, the Farm Manager was asked if the facility has acquired any
equipment for ventilating animals if needed. He stated that the facility will continue to follow the guidance contained
in the Program of Veterinary Care and no changes were planned, nor was any new or additional equipment
available.
Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this
drug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered
distressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug
can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated
they can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,
or training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis
of respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available
which are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.
Because of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or
neuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of
general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.
The licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care
as required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and
is likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your
attending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides
adequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of
administration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. Documentation of all
changes or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must
maintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request.
This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
Note: The remaining animals identified on the 08-25-15 inspection report found in need of veterinary care have
been examined by the attending veterinarian and treated accordingly.
The animals identified on this inspection found in need of veterinary care were examined by the attending
veterinarian on 11-09-15.2.40(b)(3) REPEAT

*** Three animals were found in need of veterinary care during this inspection including a male Nubian with a mass
on its right flank area, a female Nubian with a discolored area on the left shoulder, and a female Nubian with a
wart-type growth on the right side of its mouth. Although the facility continues to maintain logs of daily observations,
all of these veterinary problems were identified by USDA inspectors during this routine inspection and were not
observed by the facility. All licensees must establish and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care which
includes daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being. Additionally, a mechanism of direct
and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian (AV) is required so that timely and accurate information
on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed to the AV. Correct by ensuring that adequate
daily observations are conducted and that information is conveyed to the attending veterinarian as required. This
continues to be a problem at this facility.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public continues to be permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of
animals. This includes camels, cows, sheep, goats, African porcupines, kangaroos, muntjac deer, and mini-zebu
cattle. These animals are housed in multiple areas including the pastures near the parking lot, the walk through area
of the zoo, the production barn, the dairy barn, the Daughty barn, and the camel pasture, all of which are open to
the public. There are no barriers or signs present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to
feed food sold at the entry gate. There are no attendants present during public contact and guests may walk directly
up to enclosures and pet the animals. Primary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large enough for
the guests to reach through and touch the animals. Unattended public contact continues to be a problem at this
facility and has been documented on many previous inspections. Continued unattended public contact does not
ensure safe public interaction with these animals. Licensees must ensure that during periods of public exhibition
animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so
as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent public contact with these
animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of these locations to ensure the
safety of both the public and the animals.

*** Guests are still allowed to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. Public contact with animals in this
area is encouraged through the sale of food. No attendant is present in the drive through area when these
unaccompanied visits and public contact are taking place. Animals in the drive thru area include: watusi, elk, eland,
Tahr goat, deer, antelope, bison, llamas, zebra, water buffalo, pigs, and others. A hand-out pamphlet given to
guests at the entry gate advises them to remain in their vehicles at all times but also provides instructions for
feeding from the buckets provided. This facility also has horse drawn wagons that takes guests thru and allows
public feeding with an attendant present. On the wall of the kitchen area of the horse barn, directions stating the
following: (cid:28)Attention Wagon Drivers See list of rules cars doing the drive thru are given at the t-booth when
checking in. Wagon drivers are to monoter to ensure they are following rules. Any violators: If you have any
chance to talk to them, do so nicely. If not call on radio for help Per USDA rules(cid:29) Allowing guests to feed from
vehicles without attendants present does not protect the animals and the public nor does it provide a barrier or
distance from the animals and the public. Correct this by providing an attendant at all times during public contact.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The large heap of animal waste and bedding remains in the drive through area of the facility. Animals continue to
have access to this large pile and have been observed on previous inspections browsing and lying in the pile.
During today(cid:25)s inspection, no animals were observed in or on the pile, but additional spent bedding continues to be
added to the existing pile. Continued animal contact with this waste pile has been a concern on many previous
inspections (including 8/25/15, 4/20/15, 3/2/15, 11/12/14, 6/4/14, 2/19/14, 10/22/13, 6/12/13, and 12/4/12) as this
unnecessarily exposes the animals to potential disease transmission. Correct this by removing this waste pile and
dispose of all animal wastes properly.
