3.131(d) CRITICAL
SANITATION.
On December 12, 2016 this licensee hosted an inspection at another facility. During that inspection, the licensee
stated to me that she had lost a serval at her facility last summer to bee stings. After the serval was found
deceased the licensee stated that she found a bee's nest inside the shelter for the serval.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects shall be established and maintained at the facility.
Facilities must be checked regularly for the presence of bees and bee nests/hives. A program to eliminate, or
reduce bees must be established and followed to ensure that animals do not die or suffer from insect pests such as
bees.
To be corrected by the time bees are present this year.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
