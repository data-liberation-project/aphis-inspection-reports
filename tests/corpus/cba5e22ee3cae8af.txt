HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the food preparation area, an opened bag of nonhuman primate food was being stored on a rack in the freezer.
When not in use, open food must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage and
contamination. Feeding of spoiled and/or contaminated food can adversely affect the health and well-being of the
animals. A system should be in place to ensure open bags of food are stored as required.
Corrected during inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
