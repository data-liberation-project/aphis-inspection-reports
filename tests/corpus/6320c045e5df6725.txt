ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are two large Standard Poodles a Female (#42) white and Male (#31) Brown that have numerous matts all
over their legs, neck, ears, feet and rib area. The matts are very thick and plate like in appearance. The matts come
right down to the skin in several areas, however there is no skin damage or pinching of the skin at this time. The
matts make some movements restricted due to the location and size of the matts. The faces have been kept
trimmed, however the rest of the body on both dogs need serious trimming.
Matts on dogs can cause discomfort due to the pulling of the hair against the skin for extended periods of time. The
skin can become torn or infected due to moisture and infection being covered up by the matts holding the infection
against the skin.
The licensee must trim both dogs, completely removing all matts anywhere on the body, face, ears, tail, legs, feet,
ribs and chest and neck.
