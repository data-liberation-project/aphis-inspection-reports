Facilities, outdoor.
The facility housed an opossum in an outdoor enclosure which was not surrounded by a continuous 6-foot perimeter
fence. There was a large portion of the perimeter fence missing at the Northwest aspect of the premises. During the
inspection, numerous people were observed hiking at a nature preserve near the unfenced portion. The lack of an
adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the animals within the facility in that there isn’t an adequate secondary
containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or a sufficient barrier to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. The facility must ensure that the above listed animal being housed outdoors is enclosed by a 6-
foot perimeter fence at least 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure or shall obtain a variance from the regional
office. To be corrected by January 15, 2023.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
