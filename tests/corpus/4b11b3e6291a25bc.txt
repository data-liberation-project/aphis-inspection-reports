2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** In building #1 a six year old female Pug named Rosebud (#210) had an inter digital cyst covering over fifty
percent of the top portion of the front left foot. The foot had a puffy feel when touched. The affected area is circular
in appearance (estimated size of a quarter) and there is some swelling due to fluid buildup on the top of the foot.
The licensee stated that today was the first time the problem with the foot had been noticed and this dog along with
17 others had been purchased two weeks prior to the inspection. Rosebud (#210) maintained a normal
stance/posture when all four feet were on the ground. She showed no signs of pain or distress when the foot was
palpated. Swollen tissue can be painful causing discomfort and could potentially affect the mobility and daily activity
of this dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis and treatment of the foot is provided. Any medical records must be made available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care to ensure the
health and well-being of the dog.
**** In building #1 an adult, female Pug (chip#Homeagain 0A02005516) had an inter digital cyst about the size of a
dime in between the outside toes of the left front foot. The affected area had a very small amount of swelling due to
fluid buildup. The licensee stated that today was the first time the problem with the foot had been noticed and this
dog along with 17 others had been purchased two weeks prior to the inspection. This female Pug maintained a
normal stance/posture when all four feet were on the ground. She showed no signs of pain or distress when the foot
was palpated. Swollen tissue can be painful causing discomfort and could potentially affect the mobility and daily
activity of this dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that
an accurate diagnosis and treatment of the foot is provided. Any medical records must be made available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care to ensure the
health and well-being of the dog.3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
**** In the outdoor portion of the facility, containing 21 adult dogs, there were 3 Sheba Inus heavily infested with
ticks/external parasites. The ticks were observed to be concentrated on the face, ears, and in between the toes of
their feet. The licensee stated that he had used a product called Adams to spray the ground recently. Lack of an
effective program that controls insects and external parasites can lead to the transmission of diseases affecting the
health and well being of the dogs. Insects or external parasites living on the dog can be painful causing discomfort
for the dog. The potential for infection exists when the skin becomes inflamed because of continued scratching by
the dog. Left untreated severe insect and external parasite infestations can affect the ability of the dog to gain or
maintain body weight. Elimination of all insects and external parasites living on the dog is necessary to ensure the
health and well being of that dog. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program of external
parasite control.
