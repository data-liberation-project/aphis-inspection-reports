ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30pm on
11-Sep-19.
The APHIS Inspector arrived at the facility but no one answered when the door was knocked on and no one was
observed to be in barn. The APHIS Inspector then left a voice mail for the licensee who then called back to inform
the Inspector that no one was available to facilitate an inspection at this time.
