Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There were two live mice observed in the indoor blue monkey enclosure, and one live mouse observed in the indoor
colobus enclosure. These netted enclosures are surrounded by natural substract and live vegetation which can allow for
the harborage of rodents. The facility stated that they are actively trapping pests, however, their current program does not
appear to be effective in these animal areas. Failure to maintain an effective program to control mammalian pests can
have a negative impact on the the health of the animals through the spread of disease or contamination of animal areas
and feed. The licensee must correct by implementing an effective pest control program in all animal areas.
