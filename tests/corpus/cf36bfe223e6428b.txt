2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility did not have an updated program of veterinary care available for review on today’s inspection. The written
program of veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the attending veterinarian
in regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that the written program of veterinary
care is available for review during all USDA inspections.

Each applicant shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and
regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the applicant.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility did not have complete acquisition and disposition records for fourteen opossums that are no longer on the
premises. Acquisition and disposition records, including offspring born at the facility, are necessary to accurately track
animals being used in regulated activities. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition/disposition
of all animals that fully and correctly disclose the required information.



This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by June 25th, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
