ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:50pm on
27-Aug-19.
I arrived at the facility and found no one present after knocking on the door and calling out. I then called the number
provided and was told that neither the licensee or any other authorized personnel were available to conduct an
inspection that day. I then left the facility.
