The facility currently has an approved program of social housing, enrichment and psychological well-being for
non-human primates on file. The plan addresses social grouping and environmental enrichment; however, it does
not address special considerations, restraint devices, and exemptions.

Research facilities must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate
to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently
accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed
by the attending veterinarian.
The plan, at a minimum, must address each of the following:
(a)Social grouping(b) Environmental enrichment(c)Special considerations (d) Restraint devices and (e)Exemptions.
