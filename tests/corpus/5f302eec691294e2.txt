ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:40 AM on
20-NOV-17.
The licensee had given me the dates of November 20 and 21, 2017 as dates she would be conducting classes at
Haslett Middle School in Haslett, MI. I arrived at 10:40 AM and the school office informed me that they changed
their curriculum and the licensee was not invited this year. I spoke with the licensee and she had not made me
aware of this change. The licensee does not have any other exhibits scheduled until March, 2018.
