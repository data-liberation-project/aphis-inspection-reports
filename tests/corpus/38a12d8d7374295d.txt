3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
A majority of the guinea pig enclosures contained a large accumulation of fecal material and debris. Within the weanling
pen, the hay used as the primary bedding was barely visible. Failure to clean and sanitize primary enclosures often
enough to prevent a buildup of excreta can introduce disease hazards to the animals as well as create unpleasant odors
and attract vermin. The licensee must clean the enclosures as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of fecal material
and sanitize at least once every 2 weeks.

3.31(b)

Sanitation.
There is a build-up of dirt, dust, and cobwebs on the walls and ceiling of the guinea pig housing area. Failure to clean
animal facilities regularly can adversely affect the health of the animals by spreading disease and can potentially attract
pests. The facility must maintain the premise by keeping it clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from
injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
