2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
**In March 2016 husbandry staff found 3 GPs with parts of an approved metal hanging enrichment device/toy stuck
in their mouths; veterinary staff were immediately contacted. Two of the GPs were humanely euthanized and the
3rd animal was treated.
Upon being notified and in response to this information, the IACUC and AV immediately looked into the incident. It
was determined that husbandry staff had placed the enrichment device/toy in the enclosure using an unapproved
method that resulted in a portion of the toy to become stuck in the animals’ mouths during interaction by the GPs
with the device/toy.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the handling of animals by all personnel, including husbandry staff, should be
done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
The research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to
USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future. Corrective
actions included but were not limited to providing additional re-training on the proper set-up of enrichment devices in
enclosures as well as on the daily husbandry SOPs, and discontinuing use of the enrichment device/toy in GP
enclosures. No additional incidents have occurred.
This item has been appropriately addressed and corrected by the research facility.
