2.33(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Caretakers failed to communicate with the facility veterinarians when two or more adult, male deer were potentially in
need of veterinary care. Between 12/8/22 and 12/13/22, an observation log contains entries made by two different
caretakers indicating two deer (one identified as, "buck with green tag" and another identified as, "buck 4") were
potentially injured, experiencing some degree of lameness and that "bucks may need hoof trim." The more experienced
caretaker corroborated slight lameness and the potential need for hoof trims but did not concur that there was aggressive
behavior or bleeding as noted by the new, less experienced caretaker. The inspector utilized binoculars but was unable
to confirm overt lameness or a need for hoof trimming within the running, closely grouped herd in the very large, grassy
pen. Regardless, there were no notes documenting a visit by the veterinarian to evaluate the animals for lameness or
injuries since noted in the log on 12/8/22, and the veterinarians stated that they were not notified until the time of
inspection. The veterinarians traveled to the site to inspect the animals that afternoon following the inspection and
determined: "No evidence of aggression, fighting, limping or bleeding noted. No treatment necessary". However, the
failure to report potential issues of animal health or behavior to the veterinarian can result in delayed provision of care and
prolonged pain and discomfort from issues that may be present. Research facilities must establish and maintain
programs of adequate veterinary care that not only include the daily observation of all animals to assess their health and


well-being, but also include a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
