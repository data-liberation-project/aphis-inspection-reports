3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Located in the main kennel building are four pens on the south side of the center aisle. In the first three pens there
is evidence of chewed wood on the interior surfaces of the south kennel wall affecting five dogs. The damage to the
sealed wood panels in all three pens is located along the edges of the panels and in two of these pens there is
evidence of damage from chewing on the sealed wood that provides the framework for plastic panel inserts. The
licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis. If these surfaces cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized they must be repaired or replaced when damaged or worn.
