3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***In the enclosure housing 23 goats, 24 sheep, 2 alpacas, and 1 llama, there was an excessive accumulation of
feces on the ground in the indoor and outdoor portions of the enclosure. Due to the accumulation of feces the
animals could not stand or lay in their enclosure without becoming contaminated by the waste material. In the indoor
portion of the enclosure, the ground was covered with dirty straw and there was a strong odor of ammonia.
Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards, to
reduce disease transmission, and to prevent the animals from becoming contaminated or soiled. The licensee must
ensure that excreta be removed from primary enclosures and ensure that all enclosures housing animals are
cleaned as often as necessary to promote appropriate husbandry standards.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
