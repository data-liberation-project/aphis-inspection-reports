3.75(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the lemur round pen, nails are used to secure the wooden roof, with the points of the nails protruding inside the
roof. Most of these areas are not accessible by the enclosed animals. However, there are several spots where a
lemur that climbs to the top of the cage wall could potentially make contact the exposed nail points. These nails
within reach of an animal at the top of the wire wall must be removed or repaired to ensure the animals cannot
contact sharp points.
- In the lemur pen in the central row, there are three exposed screws which appeared to have been used to connect
a short piece of bracing wood. The piece of wood is gone, but the screws are still embedded and exposed. These
screws must be removed or driven completely into the wooden wall to protect the lemurs from potential injury.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The hotwire which runs along the interior of the kangaroo pen is broken, with one end lying on the ground. A
broken hotwire is not effective, and needs to be repaired.
- There are several exposed nail heads along the interior surface of the wooden fence in walk-in portion of the
kangaroo enclosure. These are a potential hazard to the enclosed animals, and must be removed or adjusted.
- The wooden camel shelter has two large, ragged holes in the side. This renders the shelter ineffective at
protecting the animal from weather, and is a potential source of entrapment and injury. The holes in the shelter
must be repaired and maintained in good condition.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- Behind the food storage area, the perimeter fence has several fallen trees draped across the top of the fence. Thefence itself is still intake but appears to be "bowing" in a couple of spots. This section of the perimeter fence is not
stable and secure. The weight of the fallen trees could cause the fence to buckle and break. The trees also provide
a means for animals and unauthorized personnel to enter and exit the facility. These trees must be removed, and
the fence repaired as needed. Trees along the perimeter fence need to be maintained to ensure they do not
compromise the fence in any way.
