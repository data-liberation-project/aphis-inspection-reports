2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On 10-3-18 a male giraffe reached over its enclosure fence and picked up a child car seat then dropped it. The
facility reports that nobody was injured in the incident and promptly added public barriers to prevent the giraffe from
contacting the public on the outdoor portion of the enclosure where the incident occurred. During inspection, we
observed visitors inside the giraffe barn feeding carrots, petting the giraffe on the head, and taking photos of the
animal with their phones. A ticket booth vendor was sitting in sight of the barn, but the person in the ticket booth
could not act as an attendant as it was impossible to see and manage all of the activity between the public and the
giraffe at all times. A facility employee immediately added an additional barrier to the barn entrance so that the
public could not have any contact with the giraffe without an attendant present.
Appropriate barriers and/or distance between animals and the general viewing public must in place to assure the
safety of the animals and the public.
Maintain correct from this day forward.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility employee. A thorough exit interview was conducted
with the licensee by phone.
The inspection was conducted at Goebbert's Pumpkin Patch in Pingree Grove, IL.
