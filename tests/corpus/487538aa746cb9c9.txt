2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There were 116 sheep present at the facility during this inspection. Several hours were spent trying to reconcile the
discrepancy between the number of sheep seen and the initial numbers in the records. Ultimately the records
provided by the facility indicated that 122 sheep should have been present at the facility. There were still 6 sheep
that could not be accounted for in the records. The facility personnel could not find disposition records or death
records for these 6 animals that were not present at the facility. Animal disposition records are required to trace
animals for health and ownership purposes. Records on animal death and euthanasia are used to evaluate and
monitor the health of the flock. Records must be kept for animals sold, euthanized, died or otherwise disposed of by
the dealer.
Correct from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the resident attending veterinarian.
