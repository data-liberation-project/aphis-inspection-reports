RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The Licensee is not currently keeping proper records for his the offspring that are born at his facility. The licensee is
electing to use cage cards to satisfy the form 7005 record-keeping requirements for puppies, however, these cards
are missing information that is required by this subpart of the AWA. Specifically, the current cage cards do not
include a description of the puppy (color and distinctive markings), the sex of the puppy, a puppy number, a date of
disposition, or method of disposition.
The Licensee is currently missing one dog on the facilities current APHIS Form 7005. The Licensee was able to
find an APHIS form 7006 that was obtained from the breeder at the time the dog was acquired on 8/28/2019. In
addition, the Licensee has four dogs listed on his APHIS Form 7005 as being "original breeding stock" and did not
have any other information listed on the form to indicate who or where these animals were purchased from. These
dogs were not on the premise during the February 14, 2019 pre-licenses inspection and were acquired from
sources that are not currently listed after the last inspection. Two of the dogs listed on the APHIS Form 7005 are
Aussie doodles that are documented as being acquired by the Licensee on 7/19/2019. Two of the dogs listed on the
APHIS Form 7005 are King Charles Cavaliers that are documented as being acquired by the Licensee on
8/19/2019. In addition to the missing acquisition information for these dogs, all four of these dogs are missing
Identification information. After being asked about these dogs, the Licensee was able to find information for thebreeder from which the dogs were acquired for the King Charles Cavaliers that were purchased on 8/19/2019.
However; he was not able to find any documentation or information regarding the two Aussie Doodles that are listed
as being purchased on 7/19/2019
Complete and accurate records are necessary to facilitate tracking of the animals and compliance with other
aspects of the AWA such as minimum age at disposition. The Licensee must ensure that all animals, including
offspring born at his facility and that are purchased or otherwise acquired, are recorded appropriately with records
that reflect all required information. If cage cards are used to satisfy the record keeping requirements for nursing
puppies, they must contain all required information.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On today's inspection, the wash downs under the indoor whelping area has an excessive buildup of mineral
deposits and other organic material. In addition, the licensee stated that he is not cleaning or sanitizing this area
often enough or every two weeks as the regulation requires. The Licensee's current program of veterinary care
states that cleaning and disinfecting of the wash downs are recommended daily. Not having proper cleaning
contributes to the odor within the facility. All surfaces, including the wash downs, of housing facilities must be
cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
