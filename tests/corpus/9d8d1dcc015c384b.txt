CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an accumulation of excreta on and pushed into the grooves of the resting perch located in the Capuchin
enclosure. The excreta is attracting flies. The presence of the excreta creates odors, soils the animals, attracts
flies and can contribute to the spread of disease. Clean primary enclosures daily and as often as necessary to
prevent the accumulation of excreta on all surfaces in contact with the monkeys. Correct by September 2, 2016.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a gutter cleaning system in place to assist in the elimination of water used in the cleaning of enclosures,
food and animal waste and soiled bedding from the animal facility. However, at the time of inspection there is
standing water in approximately half of the gutter. The water is dark in color, dirty with animal waste and discarded
food and has a foul smelling odor. The standing water also is contributing to the attraction of flies. Failure to
provide adequate and frequent waste disposal that eliminates the standing water and soiled organic material
increases the risk of odors, insects and disease hazards. Establish and maintain and effective waste disposal
system in order to minimize insects, odors and disease hazards. Correct by September 2, 2016.

the spread of disease and can irritate the animals and cause discomfort. Establish and maintain an effective
method to control flies and other insects. Correct by September 2, 2016.
