2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
--Three animals are noted during inspection to have medical concerns with undocumented veterinary care.
**Elsa, an adolescent female white tiger, has a tail tip wound that is actively bleeding during inspection.
Approximately 1.5 cm of reddened tissue is exposed beyond the skin margin. Although no veterinary documentation
could be provided, staff indicates that the attending veterinarian (AV) was contacted and a picture was sent via text.
Antibiotic treatment and tincture of time was reported to be AVs proposed treatment plan, which was reportedly
followed. No direct veterinary examination has been performed to date, 6 days after reported injury and no
diagnostics, treatment plan or follow-up plan is provided. This is a direct noncompliant item. This animal requires
immediate veterinary examination.
**Logan, a young male li-liger, has significant hair loss over approximately 40% of his body. The tops of the
paws appear reddened and the skin appears thickened. Staff reports that topical miconazole is being applied, but
no veterinary documentation could be provided regarding veterinary examination, diagnostics, treatment plan and
follow-up plan.

**Zara, a very young female white tiger cub, has significant swelling around her eyes and yellow ocular
discharge, with staining of surrounding fur. She also has at least two quarter-sized patches of hairloss on her rear
quarters. Staff reports that some medications have been used, but no veterinary documentation could be provided
regarding veterinary examination, diagnostics, medications prescribed, treatment plan or follow-up treatment plan.
Provision of adequate veterinary care, along with appropriate documentation, is required to assure that the
animals are receiving proper, timely veterinary care, in both chronic and acute medical situations. All three of these
animals must be provided proper veterinary care by July 8, 2016.
--In the medications/treatment room, 4 expired medical products are located in the in-use treatment area (Eye wash
exp 3/13, Albon exp 2/15, Tylenol exp 12/15, Oxytetracycline exp 4/16). Using expired medications can yield
unanticipated and potentially detrimental results in the treatment of animals. Correct by July 8, 2016.--Approximately 25 llamas and alpacas and 14 domestic sheep are noted to have long, heavy, and/or matted coats.
Unshorn animals exposed to extreme temperatures with high humidity may not be able to thermoregulate
appropriately and may overheat. Correct by having all llamas, alpacas, and domestic sheep sheared by August 3,
2016, and by developing and implementing a program to have them sheared annually in April/May.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Acquisition and disposition records of animals at this facility are in disarray. Records of acquisition and disposition
for multiple animals are not available for inspection. Of those available, many are missing accurate animal
descriptions, identification and approximate ages. Many animal movements cannot be accurately traced due to the
unavailable records, including those for cougars, multiple tigers, lion, lemur, macaques, zebra, binturong and camel.
The facility does not have an accurate documented inventory for many of the hoofstock species on the premises.
The ability to account for and trace animals is key to disease outbreak management and the maintenance of more
precise documentation of animals moving through this facility is crucial.
2.80(b)(2)
RECORDS, DISPOSITION.
Records of disposition of several tiger cubs could not be located. The ability to trace animal movement is key to
disease outbreak management and animal tracking. Exhibitors are required to maintain records of euthanasia or
disposition for a minimum of 1 year post event. Correct by August 3, 2016.
3.83
WATERING.
The open water receptacle in the snow macaque enclosure contains unclean water with floating pieces of what
appears to be disintegrating fruits and vegetables. The sides of the receptacle are coated with a brown film. For the
health of the animals using this receptacle, it must be kept clean and sanitized as often as necessary to keep the
water clean and free from contamination. Correct by July 8, 2016.
3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The cougar and the lion enclosures do not provide adequate shade from the sun.
**The cougar enclosure shade consists of 6 boards approximately 4(cid:29) inches wide and 12(cid:25) feet long laid over a
frame. Sunlight penetrates the gaps between the boards. There is also one plastic kennel in the primary enclosure,
which the cougars are also using to seek relief from the sun. Both cougars were noted to be panting. Todays
temperature is recorded at 95 degrees Fahrenheit. Excessive exposure to direct sun in extreme hot weather canlead to heat exhaustion and death. Correct by providing sufficient shade for both cougars to independently protect
themselves from direct sunlight by July 8, 2016.
**The lion enclosure shade consists of a cave-like den (approximately 5 foot x 10 foot) covered with artificial rock,
the lock-down area, and a black plastic tunnel. The unshaded ground in the enclosure measures 96 degrees
Farenheit. The interior of the tunnel records at 95 degrees, and the interior of the lock-down area is recorded at 86
degrees and both are noted to have no cross ventilation capability. The interior of the cave located in the center of
the enclosure could not be measured, due to the occupancy by the lions, who were noted to be panting. Excessive
exposure to direct sun in extreme hot weather can lead to heat exhaustion and death. Correct by July 8, 2016, by
providing sufficient shade for both lions to independently protect themselves from direct sunlight.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
In the two large walk-in freezers, there are bags and boxes that are not labeled with contents, procurement or
expiration dates. There are multiple boxes of chicken that list expired use-by dates (example: 1/2013 date). There
is no clear product rotation schedule to ensure that foods get fed in an appropriate order. The freezer on the left has
a significant foul odor and water condensation on the ceiling, indicating the need for close evaluation and monitoring
for proper function., although product in the freezer appears appropriately frozen during this inspection. Correct by
August 3, 2016.
The barn housing the hay and ruminant feed needs to be addressed. There are Christmas lights and products
intermixed throughout the feed storage area. There are multiple bags of feed that have been torn open and
therefore contaminated by pests. Feed is spilled on the floor in many areas in the barn and has lingered long
enough to become moldy, which presents a health risk to the animals. The large round hay bales rest directly on the
floor, which encourages pest problems via burrowing and nest building, rendering that hay unwholesome. Proper
storage of feedstuffs is essential to a successful pest control program and ensuring the wholesomeness and
palatability of the food. Correct by August 3, 2016.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Two chinchilla enclosures (Western Town and Back Reptile Room) have excessive build-up of fecal material
throughout their cages and scattered onto surrounding floor. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as
often as necessary to prevent contamination of animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards.
Correct by July 8, 2016.3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Western Town, meds/treatment room and food prep room areas have excessive buildup of dust and grime, spilled
litter, spilled medications, and/or dirty walls. Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to facilitate good husbandry care.
Inspection conducted on July 5, 2016. Exit interview conducted with owner on July 6, 2016.
