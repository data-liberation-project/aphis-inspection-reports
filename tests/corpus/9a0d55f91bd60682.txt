The nocternal building houses nine (9) primates. The middle support boards and all the surfaces within the
enclosure, have matted organic buildup. The saw dust and wood chipped floors also had an excessive amount of
old food and feces. These surfaces need to be repaired and cleaned to prevent disease hazards and
accumulations from leading to negative health issues for the animals.
