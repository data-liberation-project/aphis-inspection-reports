ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Five dogs are in need of veterinary care:
Tri-colored male hound with USDA tag #959 has moisture accumulated around his eyes. The hair around both
eyes is wet with clear to opaque discharge. The lower lids of both eyes appear rolled inward causing the hair to
have contact with the globe.

A tri-colored female Basset hound with USDA tag #119 has moisture accumulated around both eyes. The left eye
appeared red, with yellow/green discharge adheared to the lower lid. Her nails are overgrown, and her teeth are
covered with a thick layer of brown-to-grey material, with slightly swollen gums.
A red and white female Basset hound with USDA tag #715 has hazy eyes. A blue tinge is apparent over the brown
color, with an increased redness over the surrounding area of the globes. The nails are excessively long, and her
teeth are covered with a thick layer of brown-to-grey material that is adhered, with red, swollen gums.
A tri-colored female Basset hound (USDA tag #717) and a tan and white male hound USDA tag #970) both have
teeth that are covered with a layer of brown-to-grey material that is adhered.Eye problems are painful and may lead to blindness if left untreated. Dental disease is also painful and can
progress to affect multiple body systems. Overgrown nails are more prone to injury and affect the dog's mobility.
Licensee must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. These dogs
must be examined by a licensed veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the veterinarian's
assessment, treatment, and plan shall be maintained for examination by APHIS officials.
