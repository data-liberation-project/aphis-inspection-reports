FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength.
There were three loose boards with nail points sticking out of one side laying on the ground in the enclosure
housing five muntjac. Sharp points could cause injury to the animals and must be removed to prevent injury.
Corrected during inspection by licensee removing the boards from the enclosure.
There was a damaged section on the wood wall near the floor in the back corner of the enclosure housing two
whitetail deer fawns. Portions of the wall were gone leaving an area of the wall open and exposed to the insulation.
The fawns could potentially enter the wall or ingest the insulation causing harm to the animals. Repair or cover
opening in the wall to protect the animals. Corrected during inspection by licensee covering up the damaged area.
The gate inside the shelter for one zebra and one bactrian camel was secured to the metal posts with bailing twine
in the middle of the post only. This gate is not secure and was easily pushed to a leaning position by the animals.
This could cause injury or escape and must be properly secured to the posts to prevent these risks. Correct by June
9, 2016.

WATERING.
The metal automatic waterers for the dromedary camel enclosure and the enclosure housing five muntjac is not
being kept clean. The sides of the waterer were green with algae and indicates the water receptacles are not being
cleaned on a frequent enough basis to prevent contamination of the water. The muntjac waterer also had bird
excreta on the edges of the receptacle, which could also contaminate the water or cause disease in the animals.
Clean water receptacles and remove bird excreta on a more regular basis to prevent algae and provide for the
overall health of the animals. Correct by June 9, 2016.
3.131(a)
SANITATION. Cleaning of enclosures.
The dromedary camel's enclosure had an excessive buildup of soiled bedding and feces throughout the entire
enclosure. The camel must walk on the buildup to access the shelter, water receptacle and food. Inadequate
cleaning can increase disease hazards, pests and odors. The waste must be removed and a regular cleaning
schedule developed to prevent contamination of the animals and to minimize disease hazards, pests and odors.
