2.31(c)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC conducted an animal facility inspection on May 2, 2019 and a program review on May 7, 2019 with a
completed semiannual report sent to the Institutional Official (IO) on May 13, 2019. However, the report to the IO
did not contain signatures from the IACUC members.
Reports submitted to the IO shall be reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members to confirm
agreement with the inspection findings. Failure of a majority of the IACUC members to review the findings and sign
the report could lead to the omission of a minority view or a deficiency in the facility's animal use program.
Correct by having the semiannual reports reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members before
submission to the IO.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the vet tech program coordinator and attending veterinarian.
