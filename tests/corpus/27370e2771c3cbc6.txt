2.40(b)(3) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The white tiger, Sasha, had an open wound along the edge of the pinna of her left ear that was approximately 1.5 inches
long. The facility states that they fly spray her ears regularly but had not contacted the AV about the open wound on the
ear.

The left eye of the white camel was noted to be closed with moderate tear staining of the area below the eye. Upon
observation by the inspector, the licensee contacted the AV for guidance. AV-directed treatment was started prior to
completion of this inspection.

Daily observations of all animals and frequent communications with the AV are important in minimizing pain and distress
in the animals. Per this section, Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being; Provided, however,
That daily observation of animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian; and Provided,
further, That a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian;
3.131(d)



Sanitation.
The serval was observed biting at the numerous flies around it and flicking its ears repeatedly. No breaches in the serval’s
skin were noted, but the cat was exhibiting distress due to the numerous flies. Excessive amounts of flies can cause
distress and injury to an animal. Per this section, a safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites
and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Additional fly control measures were implemented
prior to the conclusion of this inspection. Correct by October 11, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
