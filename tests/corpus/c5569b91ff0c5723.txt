Major operative survival procedures on a covered species are being performed in a laboratory room that is not a
dedicated surgical area and is not being maintained appropriately.
At time of inspection, the following items/conditions were noted in the laboratory space: a sink was present; card
board boxes were being stored on shelves and under a table; clutter and dust was present on countertops, shelves,
a desk, the surgical table and under a table. The floors underneath the surgical table had a moderate amount of
dust and debris.The presence of clutter can impede cleaning. Supplies should be stored in containers that can be
readily cleaned and sanitized.
Rooms designated for major survival surgeries should be maintained in a manner that protects the health and
well-being of the animals.
