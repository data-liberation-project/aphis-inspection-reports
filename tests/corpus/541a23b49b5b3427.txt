2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The male Patagonian Cavy (Mara) was observed holding its left front leg up. Closer examination found that the leg
was broken. The sharp end of the broken bone was protruding through the skin by approximately 1 inch. The
licensee stated that they obtained the cavy approximately two week ago and it happened the first night the cavies
were at the facility. The licensee stated the limb appeared to be limp. The licensee stopped by the attending
veterinarian's office and spoke with him about the leg. The cavy was not examined by the veterinarian and no
medications were obtained to make the animal comfortable until it could be evaluated and treated. About a week
later they noticed the bone protruding from the skin. Again, the licensee spoke with the attending veterinarian.
Evaluation and treatment still did not occur. The licensee does not recall telling the veterinarian that the bone was
protruding through the skin.
The lack of appropriate veterinary treatment can prolong pain and discomfort, as well as allow for infection. The
licensee must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
called the attending veterinarian at the time of the inspection and scheduled an appointment for examination and
treatment.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The two Patagonian Cavies (Maras) did not have a perimeter fence around their enclosure.
The lack of perimeter fence does not protect the animals from predators and unwanted people and does not provide
a means for secondary containment if the primary enclosure fails. Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a
perimeter fence not less than 6 feet in height or receive a variance by the administrator.
