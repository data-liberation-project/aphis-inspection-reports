HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(d)(2)
***** At time of inspection the public was allowed to have self guided viewing and feeding of the Elk without
oversight of a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant who must be present at all
times during periods of public contact. The public should be accompanied by an employee who has the above
mentioned qualifications on all future tours or a public barrier system which will prevent contact with the animals
needs to be erected.
***** At time of inspection there was a Reindeer feeding tour where the public was guided into an enclosure with
approximately 30 head of Reindeer and allowed to hand feed the Reindeer. The tour during inspection which was
observed had 23 members of the public and only one attendant. The public members ranged in age from pre-teen
to adult.
The attendant was during several periods of this tour and feeding encircled with various members of the tour
answering their questions while the balance of the tour was unobserved and allowed to mix with the Reindeer. This
allows for the potential for injury to the public which may not be familiar with Reindeer, as well as the Reindeer to be
mishandled by the public.
There should be enough readily identifiable employees present to observe the feeding and interaction of the
reindeer and public which can aid in preventing potential injury to either the public or the Reindeer.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a)
***** At time of inspection the fence for the reindeer pen located next to the road between the Reindeer and Elk wasin several places supported by posts which were leaning in various directions and no longer providing the support
which the rest of the posts along this fence line are doing. These posts need to be repaired to provide the support
intended.
In several areas the wire has been damaged and needs to be removed to prevent potential injury to the animals.
The repair which is currently in place in this line of fence consisting of livestock panels which are damaged needs to
be replaced with fence material or panels which are not damaged.
***** At time of inspection the Elk fence along this roadway is constructed of square tube panels which have been
covered with welded wire from the ground upward approximately 3 ft in height which is damaged in many areas
exposing sharp points which can cause injury, and a section which is constructed using game fence and post
construction. Many areas of the game fence is damaged and in some locations allows areas where the Elk can get
their head through the fence and could in some of these areas be injured. This fence for the Elk needs to be
repaired or replaced with a material which will prevent injury to the animals and the public which hand feeds these
Elk through this fence.
