2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One brown and black, adult, female sheep was observed to be excessively thin, with protruding hip bones, spine,
and ribs. The bones of her spine, hips, and each rib were easily felt by both APHIS inspectors upon palpation. She
had a rough, unthirfty hair coat with multiple patches of hair loss along her back and right and left sides. She also
had overgrown toes on her right front foot. Poor body condition can be an indication of health issues, including
parasitism, poor dentition, malnutrition, and systemic disease.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and appropriate holiday care for all of
the animals at the facility. The animal mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate
diagnosis and appropriate treatment plans for the problem cited above. The licensee must ensure that all animals at
the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program
of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods
to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
3.130 DIRECT
WATERING.
A lactating, adult female camel, "Camela," and her nursing baby did not have access to drinking water. The water
receptacle had a hole in the bottom of the bowl and the hose leading to it was broken. The facility representative
was unaware when the water was turned off for these animals; he believes it was turned off the evening of February
5th. When the facility representative provided water for this camel, she was drinking and searching for water
sources for approximately 8 minutes (with approximately 4 minutes of it being filmed). Lack of adequate water
intake can lead to dehydration and other health issues.
If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health
and comfort of the animal. Frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of the
animal. Date to be Corrected: This was corrected by the facility representative at the time of inspection.
A complete routine inspection was conducted on February 6, 2018. This report is limited to the direct non-compliant
items identified on the inspection. A second report containing indirect non-compliant items will follow.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives on February 6, 2018.
