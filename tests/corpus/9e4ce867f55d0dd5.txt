2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility does not address rabbit care and treatments in the current written program of veterinary care. This is
important so that a preventative medicine program is established and implemented to insure that the animals are
maintained in good health. The rabbit is to be added to the written Program of Veterinary Care. The program is to
be updated at least yearly, whenever there is a new species obtained, whenever there is a new veterinarian, or
when other veterinary health changes occur.

3.54(a)FEEDING.
A food receptacle was not provided for a rabbit and the rabbit was being fed on the ground. The ground cannot
easily be sanitized to prevent food contamination and could impact the health and wellbeing of the animal. Any food
receptacle or platform used should be sanitizable. A system should be in place to ensure the rabbit is fed in a
manner that minimizes contamination.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The cougar compound has a concrete waterer with a drainage pipe (approximately 6-8 feet long) extending out from
the cage. Two shovel(cid:24)s worth of the dried fecal material has accumulated on the ground at the end of the pipe
(there is a secondary water source for the animal). This material can attract a variety of pests and could impact the
health and well- being of the animals in the compound.
A system should be in place to ensure the removal and disposal of animal wastes on a regular schedule so as to
minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards.
