ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The male Dachshund (D19), housed in a separate facility with no other animals, had a complete protrusion of his
male reproductive organs. It was very swollen, dry and the lower portion of the phallus was bright red. It was noted
that the phallus would drag on the floor of the elevated enclosure and gather debris. The Licensee advised that the
condition was not noticed since the last daily observation.He also stated that the male had a female housed with
him, for breeding purposes, three days ago but she had been since removed. Veterinary care issues, as described
above, can cause serious adverse effects if left untreated. The Licensee shall seek immediate care for the dog by a
licensed veterinarian. Moving forward, additional and frequent daily observations should be implemented to discover
any veterinary care issues in a timely manner.
*The dog was taken to a licensed veterinarian for care as soon as the inspection concluded.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The elevated enclosure, housing a male Dachshund, had an excessive accumulation of excreta in the washdown
directly below it. The Licensee explained that they usually don't clean under the enclosure. Additionally, the
Licensee stated that the sheltered facility (ground level concrete enclosures), housing English Bulldogs and
Dachshunds, had not been cleaned since Saturday. Unsanitary conditions can adversely affect the health and
well-being of the animals. Moving forward, the licensee must implement a proactive cleaning schedule to include
the removal of excreta on a daily basis.
