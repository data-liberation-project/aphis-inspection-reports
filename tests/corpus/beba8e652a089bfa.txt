Facilities, general.
It was reported to APHIS by the facility that on November 12, 2022, at approximately 7:30 AM a female red panda had
escaped overnight from an enclosure that she had been placed in early the day before. This enclosure was currently
housing a male red panda that remained in the enclosure. The animal was presumed to have dug out under a section of
cinder blocks and wire fencing. This animal was located approximately 45 minutes later in a tree on zoo property. She
was darted by the attending veterinarian and recaptured. The red panda did have to undergo a surgical procedure for
dart removal and chip fracture repair. Both red pandas are being held in other enclosures while the enclosure from which
the female escaped is being improved. The red panda was observed to be recovering well at the time of the inspection.
Housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained in a manner that contains the animals and protects them from
injury. This was corrected by the time of the inspection.
Correct by: Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
