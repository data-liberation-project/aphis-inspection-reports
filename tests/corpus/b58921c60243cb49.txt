A white, adult, female Labrador identified by tattoo #71, has a problem with its left ear. There are several lacerations
on the top surface of the ear and around the dog's ear canal which appear to be layered in the flesh. A moist
yellowish-green discharge is present and the area is warm to the touch. There is a dark brown crusty material
matted in the fur around the lesion and on the underside of the dog’s left ear. The facility representative stated that
he was unaware of the dog’s condition and that it has not received veterinary care.
There are two dogs (#36 female Shiba Inu and #12 female Labradoodle) with open wounds on their lower
abdomens. The wounds run along the midline of the abdomen and are approximately two centimeters in length. The
wounds are deep and create a hole through several layers of tissue. The tissue surrounding the wounds is bright
pink and there is a creamy yellow/red tinged discharge coming from the wounds. The abdomen surrounding the
wound on #12 is very firm for several inches around the open wound. The facility representatives state that they had
not previously noticed the wounds.
One male Shih Tzu (#2 “Cole”) has a cloudy left eye. There is a severely cloudy circular lesion on the surface of the
eye that is about 0.5 cm in size and is located in the middle of the eye. The remainder of the eye surrounding that
area is moderately cloudy. The white of the eye is mildly reddened. There is a small amount of clear discharge
coming from the left eye. The facility representatives state that they had not previously noticed the cloudy eye.
One male English Bulldog (#14) has a small, approximately 1-1.5 cm long wound on the top of his right foot. The
wound is located on top of one of his outer toes. The wound is deep through several layers of tissue. The tissues
surrounding the wound are bright pink/red and there is a creamy white/yellow discharge coming from the wound.
This dog also has a large mass on his chest. The mass is approximately 4 by 5 inches in size and protrudes off the
surface of the chest. The surface of the mass is uneven and is made up of multiple large and small firm lumps that
are bright pink/red in color. There are brown to black crusts present on the surface of the mass and some areas are
moist with red-tinged fluid. In one area a moderate amount of creamy red discharge dripped from the mass.
Female Shiba Inu puppy (#116) was observed vomiting a yellow liquid. After vomiting, the puppy wrinkled up the
sides of her snout and kept her eyes mostly closed. The puppy maintained this appearance throughout the time itwas evaluated. The puppy acted lethargic and when removed from the enclosure she hung limply when held.
Closer observation revealed the puppy’s gums were a pale purple to nearly white color. When placed back in the
enclosure, the puppy stood still with her head lowered, eyes partially closed and appeared depressed.
Female Shiba Inu (#65) is non-weight bearing on her left front foot. She was observed holding her foot off the floor
and licking the bottom of the foot. Closer evaluation of the animal’s foot revealed a small, approximately 0.5 cm in
size, round abnormal growth on the bottom of the foot and it is located between the toes. The growth was red and a
discharge coming from it has stained the hair around the area a reddish color.
Female Shiba Inu (#81) has an abnormal growth between the toes of the right front foot. The growth was slightly
warm to the touch and was moderately red and swollen. The surface of the growth is moist with a slightly creamy
discharge present. The toenails of this dog have also become excessively long and were observed to lay sideways
when the dog stood on the enclosure flooring.
Female Shiba Inu (#85) has an abnormal growth between the toes of her right front foot. The growth is hair-less,
slightly purple to red in color, and approximately 0.5 by 1 cm in size.

Female Bulldog (#303) has an abnormal growth between the toes on her right-hind foot. The growth is severely
swollen and is approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. The growth is warm to the touch and purple in color. There is an
abrasion on the surface of the growth.
Conditions such as these can be painful and can lead to further health complications. The animals listed above
must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an
appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and
resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.
Female Labrador (#83), female Shiba Inu (#14) and female Wheaton terrier (#59) have excessively long toenails.
On all three of these dogs, the toenails have become so long that the toes and nails of the front feet were observed
to lay sideways across the flooring.
Long nails can be painful for the animal and can lead to further health complications. The licensee must ensure that
all toenails are trimmed in order to prevent, control and treat injuries associated with long toenails.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives, Heather Cole, VMO, Kelly Maxwell,
ACI, Corbin Ranslem, ACI and an APHIS Physical Security Manager.
