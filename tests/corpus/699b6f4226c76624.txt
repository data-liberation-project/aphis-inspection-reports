HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
****Inside of the sheltered whelping building there were twelve enclosures, housing a total of 12 dogs and 23
puppies that had an accumulation of blackish brown grime, food, feces and shredded paper bedding material that
was damp with urine and water. The amount of fecal material in these enclosures made it difficult for the puppies or
dogs to avoid stepping in it. The walls and exit doors of these enclosures had grime and fecal material smeared on
them. Several of these enclosures had fecal material smeared on the flooring covering about 50-70%. The outdoor
portion of two of the enclosures had fecal material that had not been picked up for several days. Throughout the
outdoor facility most of the dog houses need to be cleaned. Facility representative stated that it had been weeks
since the last cleaning. The accumulation of dirt and grime can cause diseases and attract pests. Surfaces which
are not cleaned and sanitized properly or often enough, increase the risk of disease hazards for the dogs and
puppies. The licensee must ensure all surfaces in contact with the dogs and puppies are spot cleaned daily andsanitized at least once every two weeks. The licensee must ensure all other surfaces of housing facilities are

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Ventilation
**** There was a strong odor of ammonia upon entering whelping facility. Eighteen dogs and thirty three puppies
are housed in this building and are subjected to the strong odor. The inspector felt a burning and stinging sensation
to the eyes and nasal cavity upon entering the whelping facility. Dogs subjected to strong odors could experience a
burning or stinging sensation to the eyes or nasal cavity. Strong odors could potentially cause respiratory problems
and cause discomfort and stress to the dog. Sheltered housing facilities for dogs must be sufficiently ventilated at
all times when dogs are present to provide for their health and well-being, and to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia
levels and moisture condensation. The licensee must provide adequate ventilation or air exchange at all times to
ensure the health of all dogs.

****In three outdoor enclosures, housing 8 adult dogs, there are puddles of water with the majority of the enclosure
being wet and muddy. The dogs in these enclosures were observed with varying degrees of wet and dirty hair
coats, especially on the dogs' paws, legs, chest & abdominal areas. When the dogs' hair coats become wet and
dirty it can decrease the comfort and well-being of the animals as well as increase the risk of disease hazards. The
licensee must correct the drainage issue in these enclosures and ensure that all primary enclosures are constructed
and maintained so that all the dogs remain clean and dry.
