FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor shelter for the 2 kangaroos and 4 wallabies has exposed insulation hanging down from the roof. The
insulation can fall allowing the animals to have direct contact, which can be harmful to these animals. Maintain
indoor and outdoor facilities so that they are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals.

WATERING.
At the time of inspection, the water receptacle for the 2 New Guinea Singing Dogs had a very small amount of
brown liquid. Water was provided to these animals at inspectors request and one of the dogs was observed
drinking for several minutes. Frequent access to water is necessary for the health and well-being of the animals.
Potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. All water
receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.
