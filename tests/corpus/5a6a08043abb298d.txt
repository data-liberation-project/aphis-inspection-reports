2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
On January 13, 2016 APHIS inspectors conducted a search to see if this individual had more than 4 breeding cats.
The individual was not home. The individual called this inspector on January 19, 2016 at approximately 12:45 PM.
The individual stated to this inspector that she had 4 breeding females. I did let her know that if she had 4 or fewer
breeding females she would be exempt from licensing.
This individual sells kittens to a licensed pet store. The store(cid:25)s records, recovered after the search, reveal that on
August 26, 2015 the individual sold two litters of kittens, 3 Ragdoll and 3 Siamese/Ragdoll mixes. On November 13,
2015 the individual sold 3 litters of kittens, 1 Ragdoll, 5 Siamese/Ragdoll mixes and 1 Himalayan. Feline gestation
is approximately 9 weeks and kittens cannot enter commerce until they are 8 weeks of age, which is the age stated
on the certifications. With five litters being sold in less than 3 months it shows that the individual has more than 4
breeding females.
This individual does need a USDA, APHIS, AC license to sell kittens to pet stores, brokers or if she sells kittens
(cid:28)sight unseen(cid:29). This individual is dealing without a license. The statement from the individual to this APHIS official
that she had only 4 breeding females was inaccurate.
Any person operating or intending to operate as a dealer must have a valid license.
A USDA, APHIS, AC license must be obtained if the breeder has more than 4 breeding female cats and sells to
brokers, pet stores or sells kittens "site unseen".
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A VALID USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
A copy of this report was left at the facility with the owners daughter in law, sent by regular mail and sent by certified
mail.
