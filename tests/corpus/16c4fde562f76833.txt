2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On December 18, 2016, the transporter placed a portable propane heater inside the cargo area of a truck, which
contained 211 puppies. She set the temperature setting on "low" and left for 1.5 hours. According to the
manufacturer's website, this model of propane heater does not have a thermostat, is for outdoor use only, and is not
safe to use indoors. The puppies became overheated and 53 puppies died from excessive heat. The use of
inappropriate equipment can result in injury, pain, or death in animals. The transporter must ensure that handling of
all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

3.17(a) CRITICAL
CARE IN TRANSIT.
Surface transportation (ground and water).
On December 18, 2016, the transporter placed a portable propane heater inside the cargo area of the truck, which
contained 211 puppies. The puppies became overheated and the transporter removed 103 puppies from the truck
to a cooler environment. Many of these puppies were already dead, and at least 47 of the puppies were described
as "distressed" and 9 puppies were described as "critical" by the transporter. She gave subcutaneous fluids to all
puppies and a nutritional supplement to the smallest dogs. She did not have a thermometer to monitor the
temperature of the puppies. A total of 53 puppies died, including 6 of the "critical" puppies. The transporter did not
take any of the puppies to a veterinarian and did not speak to a veterinarian about the incident for at least 8 hours
after the overheated puppies were discovered. By that time 50 puppies had died. Immediate care by a veterinarian
is necessary whenever puppies are suffering from an illness or injury. The regulated person must ensure that she
obtains any veterinary care needed for dogs or cats in obvious physical distress at the closest available veterinary
facility.
TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the transporter in Neosho, MO on December 21, 2016. An
additional exit briefing was conducted by phone on December 28, 2016.
