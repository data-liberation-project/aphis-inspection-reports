INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Item IACUC 2.31 c 3 Repeat
For 2014 the IACUC only met once , that being in Feb of 2015 to perform a Semiannual inspection and report.
Since that time almost a year the IACUC failed to meet and perform an inspection , program review and semiannual
report as required under the act.
The IACUC needs to insure it meets at least once every 6 months to perform an inspection, program review and
completion of a semiannual report signed by a majority of the IACUC members.
Exit interview took place at the end of inspection
