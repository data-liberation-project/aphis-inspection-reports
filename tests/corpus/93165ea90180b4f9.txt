ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has a written program of Veterinary Care that addresses the care that is provided for the Common
marmosets. However, the care for the new hedgehogs has not been documented. The program of Veterinary Care
must be updated to include the hedgehogs, as well as any other new species that are acquired, to ensure that these
animals are receiving the appropriate care for their health and well-being.
