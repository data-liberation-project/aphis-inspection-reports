ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Vials of canine distemper vaccine were found to have expired 11/20/15. The licensee informed me that she has not
used those expired vaccines. Expired vaccines doesn't ensure that the products are safe to use. All expired
products must be discarded. Correct by end of business today.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A doggy door within one enclosure containing two dogs had grime building up on the top of it. The licensee stated
she is now sanitizing the enclosures once every two weeks, but indicated she may have missed that. Not sanitizing
all parts of the enclosures every two weeks or more often as necessary doesn't ensure that the enclosures are
clean enough to prevent the spread of disease amongst the dogs. The licensee must sanitize all parts of the
enclosures every two weeks or more often as necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste,
excreta, and other disease hazards.
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Mouse feces was accumulating on top of an end of two wooded boards up against the door frame within one of the
dog enclosures. It appeared the feces was coming from a hole within the ceiling that was directly above this spot.
The licensee has mouse traps in place. It is not clear if the mouse feces is recent or was not cleaned up from the
last inspection. In addition, grime had accumulated on electrical cords that were running through the first room in
the building and dust had accumulated on top of a PVC pipe in the second room. Unclean surfaces within the
kennel can contribute to the spread of disease. All surfaces within the kennel must be cleaned on a regular basis.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
