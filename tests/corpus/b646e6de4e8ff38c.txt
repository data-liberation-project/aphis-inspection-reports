Sanitation.
Dry fecal material covered the floors of the enclosures housing guinea pigs. There was more fecal material than clean
bedding present. Enclosures are currently being cleaned weekly. The weekly cleaning process (method and frequency)
utilized is not effective in removing this fecal accumulation inside the enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation
exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and other diseases. Correct by ensuring that
all enclosures are kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta (feces) and soiled
bedding, and that primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by January 30, 2021.
