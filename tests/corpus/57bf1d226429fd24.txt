ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45 AM on
18-JUN-19.
The inspector arrived at 10:45 AM on 6/18/19 to conduct an inspection but there was no one on the premises. The
inspector tried to reach the Licensee at the telephone number on the most recent renewal application but the call
was not answered. The inspector left a voice message, sent a text message to the same phone number, and
waited an additional 30 minutes for a response and then left.
Unannounced inspections are used to evaluate compliance with the AWA Regulations and Standards. Contact the
