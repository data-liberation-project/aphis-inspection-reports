INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(c) Lighting.
* The whelping building housing approximately 66 puppies and 43 adults had no windows. Upon entering the
whelping building, at approximately 1300 hrs, the lights were turned off and the room was dark except for the light
produced by 11 heat lamps used to keep puppies warm. The licensee turned on three overhead/wall lights to
provide more light for the inspection. Even with the lights turned on, there was not enough light to observe the dogs
and puppies in the far back end of the building without using a flashlight. Sufficient light is necessary for adequate
inspection of the animals and to ensure their well-being.
** The licensee must ensure the whelping building provides sufficient illumination to aid in maintaining good
housekeeping practices and adequate inspection of the animals. This light must be on a regular, diurnal cycle and
uniformly diffused throughout the building. TO BE CORRECTED BY: This non-compliant item was corrected at the
time of inspection.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
* There were several sheltered enclosures that had an excessive accumulation of feces. Three of those enclosures
were on concrete slabs and the others were on raised wire with plastic, solid resting surfaces. The licensee stated
the enclosures were spot cleaned daily and a caretaker was in the process of cleaning the enclosures at the time of
inspection. However, these enclosures contained as many as four to five dogs so an excessive amount of feces
had built up since the last spot cleaning. The feces was smeared across the ground/floor and some of the dogs'
paws and undercoats were wet and soiled with waste material. Two dogs had feces speckled throughout their
coats, apparently from cagemates stepping in feces and then jumping up on the dogs. An excessive amount of
feces in an enclosure greatly increases the chances of the dogs becoming soiled with fecal material which poses a
health risk for them.** The licensee must ensure that excreta is removed from primary enclosures at least daily, or more often as
necessary to prevent soiling of the dogs and to reduce disease hazards. TO BE CORRECTED BY: Close of
business on the day of inspection. (Verbally instructed)
The inspection and a thorough exit interview were conducted with the licensee on 13 November 2014.
