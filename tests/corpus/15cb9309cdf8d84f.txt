2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In an enclosure containing three North American Porcupines, there was a male identified as Pumpernickel that
had limited weight bearing on his front feet. When weight was placed on the right front foot, the distal portion of the
foot turned inward. Closer observation revealed two excessively long claws on the right front foot. The facility
representative stated that they have had no success at trimming Pumpernickel's claws. A veterinarian had not been
informed at the time of the inspection. Excessively long claws left unattended can lead to damages of the foot or
leg. The licensee must have this Porcupine evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for appropriate diagnosis and
treatment and assure that all regulated animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.
To be corrected by February 15, 2019.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***In an enclosure housing two Brown Lemurs, on the outer portion of the housing unit, there was the sharp point of
a screw that was exposed and in reach of the Lemurs.
***In an enclosure containing one Red Ruffed Lemur, there was a board containing two screws. The sharp ends of
the screws were protruding through the board. Sharp points and edges create a potential injury for the animals
within the enclosure. The licensee must remove the sharp point and assure that all enclosures are free of sharp
points and edges as required.
To be corrected by February 19, 2019.

***In an enclosure containing one Mountain Coati Mundi, there was chicken wire attached to the primary fence
panel. The chicken wire ended at the gate and there were sharp points where the chicken wire had been cut off.
These sharp points were in reach of the Coati Mundi. Sharp points and edges create a potential injury for the
animals within the enclosure. The licensee must remove these sharp points and assure that all primary enclosures
