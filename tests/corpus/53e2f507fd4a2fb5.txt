2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Although multiple attendants were circulating in the public contact areas, they were not readily identifiable as
employees. The facility provides feed for the public to feed the animals, allowing public contact, which can lead to
human-animal contact concerns requiring assistance. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable
employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact. Correct by July 21, 2016.
Exit interview was conducted with facility representative, Ellen Magid, SACS, and Mary Ann McBride, VMO.
