FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength.
1. Some of the tension wire strung along the bottom edge of the chain link fence in the front of the pen housing the
2 young Goats was not tight. The tension wire was no longer next to the chain link and as a result there were
oval-shaped spaces along the bottom edge of the chain link fence between the tension wire and the chain link.
These spaces are a risk for possible entrapment of a hoof, limb, or horn that could result in an injury to the 2 Goats
that are housed in the pen.
Per this Section of the Regulations, outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained ingood repair to protect the animals from injury.
The Licensee needs to address this item for the safety and welfare of the animals.
