2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
In February 2017 one female Labrador Retriever was able to leave the property when let out of the primary
enclosure for exercise. The dog did not return to the facility, and at the time of the inspection was still missing.
Lack of measures to keep the animals safe at all times, and not limiting the access of the dogs to the property of the
facility can cause the loss of the animal, physical harm, and exposure to disease. The licensee must handle the
regulated animals carefully to prevent loss, trauma, physical harm, or disease.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: This date forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a licensee and ACI Bartels.
