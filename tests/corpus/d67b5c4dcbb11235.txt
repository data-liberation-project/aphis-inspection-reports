ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is one female Mastiff ("Sophie", approximately 4 years old, Microchip #0A02130637) with a swollen muzzle.
The swelling is on the left side of her muzzle and includes both the upper and lower parts of her muzzle/jaw. On the
top portion of her muzzle the swelling is very firm and is approximately three to four inches in diameter. There is a
small open area 1-2 cm in size that is red and the area surrounding that red area is moist with crusting and slight
yellow/green discharge. The swelling on the lower jaw is large and takes up nearly the entire lower left side of the
jaw. The swollen area has multiple large, smooth lumps that are firm and pink in color.
There is one male Old English Sheepdog ("Apollo", approximately 7 years old, Microchip #0A02124940) that is
limping and barely putting weight on his left front leg. There are multiple red and swollen areas on the front part of
the leg and on the top of the foot. There is a scab over the red and swollen area on the front part of the upper leg.
The swelling on the top of the foot is red and firm. The licensee states that he had treated a wound on the leg with
antibiotics, but stopped treating the animal four days ago. He stated he had not talked to the vet since he stopped
the treatment.
There is one male Standard Poodle (approximately 7 years old, Microchip #0A02124063) with two open skin
lesions. One area is circular, approximately one inch in diameter and located on his lower back. The skin and
tissues surrounding this lesion are moderately red and swollen. The second area is located on the left side of the
rump, approximately half an inch in diameter, firm, and moderately red and swollen. The surface of the swelling is
open and there is debris stuck to the open area.
Veterinary care issues such as those listed above can cause pain and discomfort to the animals and can lead to
further health complications. The licensee must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian for proper diagnosis and an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be
documented and made available to the inspectors upon request.
There is one cream colored, female, toy poodle (approximately 7 years old, Microchip #0A02127830) with matted
hair and long nails. The matted hair covers nearly the entire face and body of the animal. Most of the mats on the
face and head are tightly adhered to the skin and some of the skin under the mats is mild to moderately reddened.One of the mats is tightly adhered to the skin just under the right eye and slightly crosses over the surface of the
lower eyelid. Most of the mats on the muzzle, under the eyes, and on the top of the head are wet and dirty. There
are superficial mats (not tightly adhered) covering nearly the entire rest of the body. The nails are excessively long
with sharp points that are starting to curl.
Matted hair and long nails can be painful and can lead to skin disease and other medical conditions. All dogs need
to have their hair coats and nails routinely maintained in order to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases
associated with excessive matting and long nails.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were three adult Saint Bernard dogs housed in one enclosure made out of wire livestock panel. The openings
were approximately 6 inches square and were large enough for the dogs' noses to fit through, but small enough that
their noses rubbed on the top wire of the open space. The tops of the dogs' noses rubbed on this top piece, and
scrapes occurred. The licensee confirmed this was the cause of the scrapes on the noses.
Enclosures that are not constructed appropriately for the breed and size of dog can cause injuries. The licensee
must design and construct enclosures so that they are structurally sound, they must be kept in good repair, and they
must protect the animal from injury.

3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Throughout the facility there were chewed and worn surfaces in multiple enclosures housing four adults and five
puppies. A plastic threshold around an egress door, rims of water bowls, a large wooden whelping box stood up on
edge, and wooden walls of shelters in the outdoor enclosures were chewed or worn and had varying levels of dirt,
debris, and hair stuck in the uneven surfaces.
Chewed and worn surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which can lead to disease hazards. All surface
of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized
must be replaced when worn or soiled. The damaged and worn wood and plastic must be replaced or altered in a
manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces remain in good
repair a tall times.3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the "tool shed" enclosure had five puppies with their feet passing through the mesh floor of the enclosure.
Surfaces that allow the feet to pass through can cause injury or inhibit the movement of the puppies. The licensee
must construct the floors in a manner that does not allow feet and legs to pass through the openings in the floor.

3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Throughout the facility in multiple enclosures housing 22 adults and 8 puppies there was brown grimy residue on
egress doors, thresholds, interior and exterior walls, and support structures of raised mesh flooring. An
accumulation of hair and debris was present on wire dividers/walls throughout the indoor and outdoor portions of the
"tool shed"
The build-up of dirt, feces, and debris can harbor diseases. The licensee must spot-clean all used primary
enclosures, and food and water bowls daily and sanitize at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Throughout the indoor and outdoor portions of the "(cid:28)tool shed(cid:29)" and the "red roof building" housing 28 adult dogs
and 28 puppies, was a large number of flies flying around and landing on objects within the enclosures.
The presence of pests can cause food contamination and lead to health hazards for the dogs. The licensee must
ensure that a safe and effective program for the control of pests, including flies, is established and maintained.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, IDALS, ACI Bartels and VMO Cole.
