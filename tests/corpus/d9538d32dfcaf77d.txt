Facilities, general.
The rodent pellets stored in the lab for a short-term mouse holding protocol had an expiration date of 2019 and had signs
of deterioration. These pellets were fed to a study using wild-caught mice for 2 days in July 2022, although the lab reports
that the mice also had free access to 6 different varieties of fresh produce to choose from throughout the study.
Deteriorated outdated rodent pellets are not a wholesome food and could possibly make animals sick. To ensure food is
safe for animals, maintain food storage in a manner that protects food against deterioration, molding or contamination by
vermin.
Note: The lab reports affected food is no longer needed in 2022 and will be disposed of and replaced prior to future
studies.
