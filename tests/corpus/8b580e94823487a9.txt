ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
2.40(b) (2) - Attending Veterinarian and Adequate Veterinary Care- Two syringes were found in the refrigerator with
an unknown liquid substance in them. There was also a bottle of Ivomec found in a container. Any and all
medications on hand must be labeled by the attending veterinarian. The label must include what medication the
medication is, what the medication is used for, what the instructions for use are and when the medication expires.
This is a very serious veterinary care issue and could cause injury if the wrong drug is given to the wrong animal. If
the medication is expired the medication may not have the expected effect. The licensee must have the AV label
all syringes and any future medication dispensed.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from inclement weather- 8 Patagonian cavy’s are housed with only one plastic shelter for them to get out of
inclement weather conditions. On this day it poured rain for quite a period of time. It was noted that one cavy was
soaking wet and all the rest were dry. This indicates another shelter is needed to allow for all cavies to escape
inclement weather conditions. The license must provide an additional enclosure so all the cavies can remain dry.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a gate on the back side of the perimeter fence. This gate was left open approximately 18”-24”. The
perimeter fence protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility. The gates must remain shut to ensure that unauthorized people
and animals do not enter the facility and harm the animals.
