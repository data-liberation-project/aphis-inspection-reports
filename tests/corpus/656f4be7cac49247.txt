3.137(a)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
The elevated resting surface in the 2nd compartment from the right side in the transport vehicle is splintered and
has 2 nail/screw heads that are now protruded from this surface. These protrusions pose a risk of injury to the cats
both during the actual transportation, as well as when they are parked at a venue.
This stop is the first on the 2016 tour. The trainer informed the inspectors that the transport vehicle is approximately
a year old and has not received any repairs.
The transport vehicle should have been inspected by the licensee or his representative, and the repairs should have
been made prior to loading the animals back into their transport enclosure prior to the start of the tour. The interior
of the enclosure shall be free from any protrusions that could be injurious to the animals contained therein.
Corrected by the end of the inspection
The exit interview was conducted on-site with the trainer. This inspection report will be E mailed to the licensee.
Inspection performed by Robert Brandes, D.V.M. & Megan Adams, ACI at the Universoul Circus in Jacksonville, FL
