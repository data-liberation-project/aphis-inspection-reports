FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**The enclosure housing a 1 yr old male tiger is an approximately ten foot vertical, 9 gauge chain link fencing with
no kick-in or top. It has been determined that the current performance standards have not been adequate to ensure
that all tigers are contained within the animal enclosures. The vertical walls must be increased in height with kick-in
fencing or a top be provided to ensure the tiger is contained within the animal enclosure.
Containment at all times is necessary to ensure the protection of the animals from injury, for their safety and
well-being and to ensure the protection and safety of all employees and the public. Provide the necessary changes
for the tiger to ensure that all animals are properly and safely contained at all times.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
**Several enclosures housing a tiger, lion/lioness and black leopard did not have adequate access to shade. The
enclosures only contained a small tarp in the corner which is not adequate to provide proper shade for the animals.
Inadequate access to shade by natural or artificial means does not allow animals that are kept outdoors the ability to
protect themselves from sunlight. The outdoor animal enclosures must be changed to provide adequate access to
shade in order for the animals to protect themselves from direct sunlight.
