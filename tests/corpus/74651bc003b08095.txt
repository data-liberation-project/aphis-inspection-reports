HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The ring-tail lemurs have a piece of furniture that is stained in a brown color. The owner stated that they power

and sanitized, then it shall be removed and/or replaced.

be removed daily and the perches shall be cleaned and sanitized.
Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in
accordance with Sec. 3.84 of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards. If the species
scent mark, the surfaces must be sanitized or replaced at regular intervals as determined by the attending
veterinarian in accordance with generally accepted professional and husbandry practices. Floors made of dirt,
absorbent bedding, sand, gravel, grass, or other similar material, and planted enclosures must be raked or
spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta.
Contaminated material must be removed or replaced whenever raking and spot cleaning does not eliminate odors,
diseases, insects, pests, or vermin infestation. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized
when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. Sanitization may be done by any
of the methods provided in Sec. 3.84(b)(3) of this subpart for primary enclosures. Correct by January 27, 2017.
