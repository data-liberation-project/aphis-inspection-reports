HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
At a previous exhibit on July 7, 2017, there were not an adequate number of attendants to prevent a member of the
public to gain entry behind the barrier fence. Upon entry this person was able to get through another partial fence to
get close enough to the primate enclosure to make contact with the animal, and get bitten on the finger. While there
were two attendants in the tent working with the public, there were not enough present to be watching the entire
exhibit in order to see a person untie a gate, and walk past other enclosures, and make their way to the other side
of the primates. This member of the public was then bitten, and walked back out from behind the barrier and left the
tent. The entire interaction had not been observed by the two attendants working the exhibit.
The lack of an appropriate number of attendants to be able to fully observe an exhibit with live animals, can be a
source of possible contact and injury, if the public is able to go about the exhibit unnoticed.
There must be enough attendants working an exhibit that can observe all of the animal-human interactions, during
exhibition hours.
Corrections made: Since the incident, there is one attendant that is assigned to stand behind the barrier fence next
to the primates, to ensure that no members of the public gain entry behind or around the barrier fence. The tied off
ends of the fence have been improved, and more distance has been added between the barrier fence and front of
the enclosures.
The corrections must be maintained and updated as needed to prevent public contact with the primates from this
day forward.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee at the DuQuoin Fair, in Southern Illinois.
