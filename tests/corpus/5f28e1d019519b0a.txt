3.75(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
While repairs had been made to the rusted areas cited on the previous inspection report, excessive rust was
observed in different non human primate den areas. Rust was seen in several places in chimpanzee dens. Patches
of peeled paint and rusted metal were observed on both furniture and enclosure walls and doors. The metal had
rusted completely through the bottom of a section of metal tubing at the base of one of the chimpanzee doors.
Another section of metal tubing was heavily rusted in the baboon den area.
Rusted metal may have rough edges that may injure the animals and be difficult to clean. Rust may compromise the
integrety of metal structures. Animal housing should be maintained in good repair to protect and contain the
animals.
