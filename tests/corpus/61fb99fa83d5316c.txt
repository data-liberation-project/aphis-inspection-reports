2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care remains incomplete. The guidance included in the written program of
veterinary care is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods
to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites. Currently the written
PVC contains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed. Additionally, the recommended
treatments consist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of
administration, which are necessary when drugs are intended for use in species for which there are no
manufacturer label instructions, or which personnel have been trained in proper administration. Regarding
frequency of administration, the written PVC says (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) for the majority of the species. There is no guidance
elsewhere clarifying what (cid:28)as needed(cid:29) means. Additional guidance for the use of these drugs must be provided in
the written PVC for all species for which these drugs are intended to be used. Failure to include complete written
guidance regarding these topics does not ensure welfare of the animals maintained by the facility as
miscommunications may lead to failure to provide measures for prevention, control, and treatment of disease.
Correct by working with the attending veterinarian to ensure that complete guidance regarding the dose, route, and
frequency of administration for all drugs listed for each species that are not specifically labelled by the manufacturer
are incorporated into the written program of veterinary care. At a minimum guidance must include species-specific
directions for vaccination, euthanasia, capture and restraint, and the prevention, control, and treatment of internal
and external parasites. During this inspection, the farm manager stated that the facility has made no changes to the
current PVC.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary (PVC) remains and the same and continues to authorize the use of succinylcholine as
the primary drug for (cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29) (without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia or equipment for respiratory
support) for the majority of species including: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat, Aoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and
Grants Zebra, Nilgai, Fallow Deer, Eland, and Elk. During this inspection, the Farm Manager again stated that no
changes to the written guidance in regards to the use of this drug.Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this
drug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered
distressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug
can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated
they can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,
or training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis
of respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available
which are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.
Because of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or
neuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of
general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.
The licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care
as required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and
is likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your
attending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides
adequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of
administration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. Documentation of all
changes or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must
maintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public continues to be permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of
animals. This includes camels, sheep, goats, African porcupines, kangaroo, muntjac deer, and mini-zebu cattle.
These animals are housed in multiple areas including the walk through area of the zoo, the production barn, the
dairy barn, and the camel pasture, all of which are open to the public. There are no barriers or signs present to
discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food sold at the entry gate. There are no
attendants present during public contact and guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals.
Primary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch
the animals. Unattended public contact continues to be a problem at this facility and has been documented on many
previous inspections. Continued unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction with these
animals. Licensees must ensure that during periods of public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance
and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the
public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent public contact with these animals or by ensuring that an adequate
number of attendants are present at each of these locations to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals.2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Guests are still allowed to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. No attendant is present in the drive
through area when these unaccompanied visits are taking place. Animals in the drive thru area include: deer,
antelope, bison, llamas, zebra, water buffalo, pigs, and others. A hand-out pamphlet given to guests at the entry
gate advises them to remain in their vehicles at all times but does not discourage feeding. This facility also has
horse drawn wagons that takes guests thru and allows public feeding with an attendant present. The Farm Manager
stated during this inspection that the guidance to guests has not changed regarding feeding from cars. Allowing
guests to feed from vehicles without attendants present does not protect the animals and the public nor does it
provide a barrier or distance from the animals and the public. Correct this by providing an attendant at all times
during public contact.
3.75(a) DIRECT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The lemur enclosure consists of a solid structure with windows to the outside, which the animals have unfettered
access in and out during good weather. The structure sits on an island surrounded by a moat containing several koi
fish, and the moat is surrounded by shrubbery and a fence. There is no vertical barrier or ceiling, it is open to the
air. The records of animal inventory indicate that one young lemur (unsexed) disappeared from the enclosure.
There are no records indicating that the animal was sick or otherwise in poor health. The staff is unsure if the
animal escaped or was removed by a predator. They looked for the body and did not find it anywhere. Animal
escapes or predatory deaths may occur if enclosures are not designed to prevent these events from happening.
The enclosure structure must be maintained to properly contain the animals housed therein, and also to prohibit
entry of any unwanted animals.
APHIS officials returned to the facility to re-inspect the lemur exhibit and found one of the lemurs on the public side
of the moat feeding in the shrubbery between the moat and the barrier fence. The lemur ran to the area of the
moat where the caretakers walk across a submerged walking bridge and then leaped across the moat into the
exhibit. When the Farm manager was informed of the animal being on the public side of the moat, he secured the
animal in the indoor area of the facility.
Correct from this day forward
