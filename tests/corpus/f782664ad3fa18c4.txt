FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation.
In the north side of the barn there was a strong ammonia smell during inspection. I could note my eyes burned
lightly when in the area. The doors to the building were closed and little fresh air flow was observed. Strong
ammonia odors can cause animals to get sick easier and to do poorly. To prevent strong odors in the building
maintain fresh air flow by means of windows, doors, vents, fans or air conditioning. Animal areas must have
appropriate fresh air flow while also maintaining appropriate temperatures for the species being housed. Changing
bedding for animals more often can also decrease ammonia odors.
Correct and maintain fresh air in the indoor animal areas by 4/11/14.

Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
