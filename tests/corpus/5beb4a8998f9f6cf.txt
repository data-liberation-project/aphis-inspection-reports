FEEDING.
Accumulations of bird excrement were visible on four feed troughs in the west barn of the sheep unit.
Contamination of feed troughs with bird excrement poses a disease risk to animals feeding from the receptacles.
Accumulated bird excrement on feeders needs to be removed and the surfaces where accumulations have
occurred, cleaned and sanitized. Feed troughs/receptacles need to be protected from accumulations of bird waste
and contamination.

WATERING.
Accumulations of bird excrement, some partially encased in ice, were found on three automatic livestock water
fountains in the west barn of the sheep unit.
Contamination of livestock water fountains with bird excrement poses a disease risk to animals drinking from the
receptacles. Accumulated bird excrement on the livestock water fountains needs to be removed and the surfaces
where the accumulations have occurred, cleaned and sanitized. All water receptacles need to be protected from
accumulations of bird waste and contamination.

SANITATION.
Heavy accumulations of bird excrement were found throughout the west barn of the sheep unit. Top rails of the
fence and lower boards of the fence separating the pens from the north alley were also found to have heavyaccumulations of bird excrement. Heavy accumulations of bird excrement were also visible on the floor of the alley
and on the sill plate between the wall studs on the north wall of the barn. The barn contained over 200 sheep at the
time of inspection and a facility representative verified that sheep contained in the barn are occasionally used for
regulated activity under the institutional vet tech program.
The accumulation of bird excrement throughout the facility indicates a failure or lack of adequate pest control and
sanitation. Accumulation of bird excrement may pose a disease risk to animals housed in the facility. An effective
pest control program must be developed to prevent continued infestation and contamination of the barn
environment by birds. The accumulated bird excrement also needs to be removed or effectively mitigated to
prevent continued contamination of the livestock housing environment. Relocation of livestock away from affected
areas is recommended if cleanup of bird waste or control of bird infestation is deemed not possible by the
institution.
