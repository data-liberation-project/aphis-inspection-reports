PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One enclosure was observed housing an adult Yorkshire Terrier female with her litter of seven puppies, approx. 6 to
7 weeks old. The interior portion of the enclosure provided a solid floor but the exterior portion was constructed of a
coated wire mesh flooring with a strand spacing of 1 inch by 1 inch. The facility has placed a piece of plywood
covering approximately half of the floor space of the exterior portion, providing a solid surface. During the
inspection it was observed the puppies walking on the solid surfaces but nothing prevented the puppies from
walking onto the wire mesh flooring. One puppy was observed walking on the wire surface and having feet and one
leg slip through openings. Flooring that allows feet and legs to pass below the surface pose risks due to injury of
the puppy. Measures must be taken to prevent the puppies from having access to floor surfaces that allow feet and
legs to slip through openings. To be corrected by: 04/17/15
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with designated person by Curt McGruder-ACI.
