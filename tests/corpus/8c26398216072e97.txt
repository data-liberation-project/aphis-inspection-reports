3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence line behind the office is constructed of woven wire and has at least four broken wires which are creating
sharp points at the level of the animals. There is an opening in the fence line that allows the animals to move
between two enclosures. On either side of this opening is a fence post. On one of these fence posts there is a
loose wire. The wire is located towards the lower part of the post and could come into contact with the animals.
There are six elk and three deer housed within this enclosure.
Sharp points can cause injury to the animals. The licensee must remove all sharp points from the animal enclosures
in order to protect them from injury. Two of the sharp points were removed by the facility representative at the time
of the inspection.
The facility representative stated that the broken fence posts located next to the round bales of hay that were cited
on the inspection report dated June 15, 2016 have not been repaired or replaced.
Broken fencing is not structurally sound and could cause injury to the animals or allow the animals to escape. The
facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals housed within. The
facility must be structurally sound and kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury. The licensee must
repair or replace the broken wooden fence posts to ensure the animals are safe from injury and cannot escape.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representatives.
