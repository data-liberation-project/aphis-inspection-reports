ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A number of animals had conditions that required veterinary medical assessments and treatment. There were
several animals exhibiting lameness, many with ear lesions suggestive of fly-strike, one animal with a large open
sore on its hip, one animal with severe hair loss on her tail, and one animal who had ear tip lesions but was also
flicking his ears, shaking his head, and holding his head slightly tilted to the right. The following is a list of animals
and their associated conditions:
** Limping animals included: 1) British Columbian wolf (“Baby Chaco”) – right front leg limp. The foreman stated that
this was due to an old injury/infection that the veterinarian said was not going to heal any further. There were no
records on hand verifying what veterinary treatments or assessments were done. The limp indicates a possible
painful condition. 2) Arctic wolf (“Inuk”)- Appears to have a stiff gait on rising and a left hind limp. The foreman
indicated this animal often seemed to be stiff initially on getting up but would loosen up after walking around for a
little while. 3) Arctic wolf (“Celeste”)- left front limp. This animal was frequently holding it’s left front foot off the
ground and often appeared reluctant to put weight on that foot, sometimes hopping a little to avoid using it. 4) Arctic
fox (“Lucy”) –severe non-weight bearing left hind leg lameness. This animal also had large clumps of hair that were
matted and dangling as its winter coat was shedding. It was moving around on three legs with the left hind tucked
up under one of the dangling mats of hair. The foreman said he hadn’t noticed “Celeste” or “Lucy limping before and
thought it was new since Saturday (two days prior to the inspection). When asked he said a veterinarian had not
seen them yet.
** Many of the wolves, including all six white Arctic wolves (“Inuk”, “Spirit Prince”, “Yeti”, “Mishka”, “Celeste”, and
“Sakima”) and at least two Gray wolves (“Minquah” and “Sage”), had wounds on their ear tips that appeared to be
consistent with fly strike. At the time of the inspection only a few flies were observed actually landing on the ears but
several large flies were heard buzzing in the vicinity. The ear tips exhibited hair loss, had varying degrees of
redness, swelling, sores, scabbing, and in some cased a very dark reddish to black discoloration that raises concern
about the vascular supply to the tissue. The foreman said that they were treating the ears with Vetericyn and
TRIcare but that the veterinarian had not looked at the ears. Fly control was discussed. At the time of the exit
interview the licensee presented a new ointment from the veterinarian (VIP clear fly repellent ointment).
** “Sakima” , one of the Arctic wolves, also had a large open sore or wound on the left hip area. The foreman and
the licensee both stated that it was a “hotspot” but this wound was quite large, had black crusting/scabbing and
thickened margins. It appeared very red as if the wound had split open to reveal bright red inflamed tissueunderneath. Several flies were seen landing on this wound. The foreman said it was being treated but he didn’t think
the veterinarian had seen it.
** A grey wolf, “Minquah”, had ear tip lesions but was also exhibiting very frequent ear flicking and head shaking as
well as a slight head tilt to the right. These signs may possibly indicate some other problem such as an ear infection.
This animal is also missing most of his left ear, which is apparently an old injury, but the remnants of the pinna had
some of the fly-strike lesions on it also.
** The gray wolf “Sage”, in addition to the flystrike-type ear sores, had severe hair loss on her tail and some
possible underlying redness. The hair loss gave it a rattail-like appearance.
**The attending veterinarian must be notified of animal health problems so that they can provide appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Health records are needed to convey
necessary information to all people involved in an animal’s care. Every facility should have system of health records
sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate the delivery of adequate health care.
At the exit interview the licensee indicated that she has an appointment for the veterinarian to come out in the
afternoon to have them look at these issues.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Required records were not accessible for inspection. When the records were requested staff members contacted
the owner/licensee and went to the on-site residence where the files are apparently stored. After some time the
licensee came to the visitor center where I was waiting and continued to look for the records. She stated that she
had just had the file out recently when a Fish and Wildlife Commission officer had inspected but now could not find
where she had placed it. The licensee departed in an agitated state. The Foreman returned a little while later with a
few pieces of information including a page with the attending veterinarian’s signature indicating recent visits and a
receipt showing the veterinarian had provided vaccinations for most of the animals during the last visit in mid-April
2017. Records on animal acquisition and disposition, the plan of veterinary care, and records demonstrating
adequate veterinary care for sick or injured animals were not available at the time of the inspection. The a new copy
of the veterinary plan an disposition records were provided at the time of the exit interview. Licensee must ensure
that required records are accessible for inspection. Correct from this point forward.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Enclosure housing a grey wolf ("Grey Cloud") was flooded in the lower portion. The water trough had a constant
inflow of fresh water, but it was overflowing and creating a large pool of water that covered about a third of the
enclosure floor including part of the ground where the den box was located. The excessive water prevents the wolf
from using the den box and also limits the effective amount of dry floor space where it can get out of the water.Constantly wet feet can potentially be detrimental to the health and well-being of the animal. A suitable method shall
be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water from the enclosure.
Correct by the exit interview.
The inspection of the animals and enclosures was conducted on May 15,2017 with the Foreman. The Licensee was
not initially available. After records were requested the Licensee arrived for a very short while and indicated that her
records had apparently been misplaced and she could not find them. She left again to continue looking for the
records.
The exit interview was initially conducted on May 16, 2017 with the Foreman. When the Licensee returned from the
veterinary clinic, the exit interview was repeated with her.
A copy of Animal Policy #3 Veterinary Care was provided to the licensee.
