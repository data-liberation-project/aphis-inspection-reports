Requirements and application.
This was a search inspection.

The facility was licensed with USDA APHIS Animal Care but failed to complete the Re-license process by the end of the
60-day timeframe (3-December-2021). The facility’s license was cancelled, and a facility representative was instructed by
email and phone they cannot conduct regulated activity without a license. The facility states they were going to pursue
raising the kangaroos for meat. When the inspector asked about any kangaroos being used for meat on 23-May-2022,
none have been used for meat.

The facility is conducting regulated activity without a license. The inspector arrived at the facility as a tour was taking
place, a group of approximately 12 individuals were in the kangaroo enclosure containing approximately 6 kangaroos.
Participants were seen feeding the kangaroos. The facility posted on their Facebook page on March 31, 2022 that tours
were beginning 1-April-2022 and several tour activities were listed including the chance to “pet a kangaroo”. On a 7-April-
2022 Facebook post advertising tours, the post stated you can “Come meet our cows and kangaroos”. On their website
where the public can book tours, there are two types of tours listed. In the Hands-On Tours and Animal Petting Tours, it’s

listed that participants may “Pet the kangaroos” as one of the activities included in the tour package.

Conducting regulated activity without a USDA license does not comply with the Animal Welfare Act or ensure that APHIS
officials can assess the care of the animals. The facility must either cease regulated activity or obtain a license from the
USDA to continue conducting regulated activity under the Animal Welfare Act.

No regulated activity may be conducted until USDA license is obtained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
