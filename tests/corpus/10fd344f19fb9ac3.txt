ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1pm on
20-DEC-17.
I arrived at the property at approximately 1pm on 12/20/2017 and was met by the daughter of the licensee. She
stated her parents were away and would not be back until later in the afternoon. Neither her or her sister were of an
appropriate age to conduct the inspection. I gave her my card and left the property.
