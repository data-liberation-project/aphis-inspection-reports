ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30am on
05-Sep-19.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 10:30am. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I called and the
owner answered. She stated that they were out in the field cutting hay and would be unavailable until the evening
through the end of the month.
