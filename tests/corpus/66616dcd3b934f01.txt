No method of euthanasia is described for animals undergoing terminal cardiac bleeds under deep anesthesia in
protocol 01-15-16-CR. According to facility staff the method of euthanasia described for animals prior to anesthesia
(CO2 inhalation) was not used on the animals undergoing terminal bleeds.
In order to ensure the wellbeing of the animals all methods of euthanasia should be appropriate for species and
animal activities, and should be in accordance with American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)
recommendations. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) should ensure that all pertinent
methods of euthanasia are described in protocols prior to committee approval.

ANNUAL REPORT.
The facility(cid:25)s 2014 Annual Report of Research Facility did not reflect the fact that 376 cotton rats being used under
protocol 01-15-16-CR should have been placed in Category D. According to the Annual Report the animals were
included in Category C, however according to the protocol the animals were classified as Category D.
