Facilities, general.
The wooden enclosure fence on the left side of the camel enclosure has recently been damaged leaving broken boards
that are loose and hanging on the fence compromising the fences structural strength. The camel has access to this area
and may potentially become injured by loose boards that may contain exposed nails which could cause puncture wounds,
and boards that may easily fall injuring the camel. The fence shall be repaired to contain the camel securely within his
enclosure and protect him from injury.

The shelter provided in the goat and alpaca enclosure at the entry to the park is in disrepair. The animals have chewed
on, kicked and broken the panels on the left and right side leaving split wood and splinters that may cause injury. The
shelter shall be repaired to protect the animals from injury. Correct by October 13, 2022.
