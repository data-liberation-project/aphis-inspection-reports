ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several llamas, goats and rabbits were observed to have excessively long hooves or nails. Specifically,
approximately twenty rabbits in Barn 1 were observed with long toenails. One goat in the Quarantine pen had front
hooves with splits and cracks, while the back hooves were overgrown, and several other goats had overgrown
hooves. Several llamas, especially the one adjacent to the cow enclosure had overgrown feet that needed trimming.
Overgrown nails and hooves can result in injury, discomfort, and/or lameness.
Appropriate methods and services should be employed in order to provide necessary maintenance of nails and
hooves for all the animals.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Two llamas were wearing halters with lead ropes attached that dragged on the ground and could wrap around their
feet. The llama adjacent to the cow pen and the llama mixed with the large herd of sheep wore long lead lines. The
llama in the smaller corral with several goats had a slightly shorter lead line, but there was a lasso underfoot and
tangling with the llama's feet.
Long lead lines dragging on the ground while animals are loose in their enclosures has the potential to cause
trauma, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort if the lead line is caught underfoot or on something in the
enclosure. Animals shall be handled in a careful manner that does not cause trauma or physical harm.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The waste material from the breeding barn of rabbits is flushed out of the barn via a partially open channel, througha large pipe underground and into an uncovered animal waste pile containing manure from farm animal species as
well. The channel is not adequately flushed and fecal material is built up in the area where the channel transitions
from open channel to underground pipe. The open channel with fecal material built up and sprawling waste pile
potentially attract vermin and can result in disease hazards.
Animal waste can contribute to unsanitary conditions, vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards The facility
must ensure that animal waste is removed often enough to minimize any potential contamination, odors or disease
hazards.

3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The new sheep quarantine/project pen was directly adjacent to the large and uncovered animal waste disposal
area. The animal waste disposal area included the runoff from the rabbit breeding barn, as well as the collected
waste from the cows, llamas, sheep and goats on the property. This material can attract a variety of pests and could
impact the health and well- being of the animals in the enclosure.
A system should be in place to ensure the removal and disposal of animal wastes on a regular schedule so as to
minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards. The disposal facilities shall comply with applicable laws
and regulations relating to pollution or the protection of the environment.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the new quarantine/project pen for ten sheep, the only shelter provided is shade cloth stretched over one side of
the enclosure and a small cover directly over the food trough. In the larger sheep pen with approximately forty
animals, the shelter covered the food trough, but all the sheep could not all comfortably fit under the shelter, and the
bedding under the shelter was damp. In the rainstorm earlier this week, the sheep in the quarantine pen had no
shelter provided to afford protection and prevent discomfort, and shelter in the larger pen was not sufficient for all
the animals, and the uncovered portion of the ground in the enclosure was muddy.
The inability to shelter from seasonal winter rains could cause discomfort to the animals and adversely impact their
health. The facility should ensure that all animals housed at the facility have access to natural or artificial shelter to
adequately protect all animals from inclement weather and prevent discomfort.Correction date 25 October, 2016
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
In the llama and goat enclosure, there was a large raised feed bin. The feed bin contained both food and feces and
was tall enough that the young goats in the pen would have difficulty accessing the food.
In the cow enclosure, the hay was on the ground and intermingled with fecal matter.
Any food receptacle, hay manger, or platform used is to be sanitizable (the ground is not considered sanitizable).
This feeding situation can negatively impact the health and wellbeing of the animals.
Food and food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times and shall be placed so as to minimize
contamination and accessible to all animals in the enclosure.
