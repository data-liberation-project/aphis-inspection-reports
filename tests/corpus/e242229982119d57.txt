2.55(c)

Removal and disposal of tags.
According to APHIS Forms 7006 completed by the facility, there were at least six instances that the same identification
number was used for more than one dog within a one-month time period. For example, one form dated 7/2/2022 included
a male “Corgi” (date of birth 9/23/21) identified as 22-132; another form dated 7/12/2022 included a female Rottweiler
(date of birth 4/24/22) which was also identified as 22-132. A form dated 6/27/2022 included a male Golden Retriever
(date of birth 4/26/22) identified as 22-143, while a form dated 7/12/2022 included a female Shiba Inu (date of birth 5/7/22)
also identified as 22-143. Proper identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with
certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements. The applicant must ensure that no animal identification number is
used within any 5-year period following its previous use.
2.80(b)

Records, disposition.
The applicant has not maintained records for some of the puppies that were born at the facility within the past year. The
applicant is using cage cards to meet AWA identification and recordkeeping requirements for puppies that were currently
present at the facility. However, when asked to see records for puppies from previous litters born at the facility within the
past year, a facility representative stated that they no longer had them. Failure to maintain the required recordkeeping


information for the required amount of time can interfere with the ability to properly identify and trace animals. The
applicant must make, keep, and maintain all records or forms required by this subpart, including cage cards, for a period
of 1 year and make them available to the inspector upon request.
3.6(a)(2)(x)

Primary enclosures.
An enclosure housing a female Chihuahua and her three puppies had a floor with openings big enough that the puppies’
feet and legs were observed passing through the flooring during the inspection. The flooring has openings that are
approximately one inch by one inch. These openings increase the risk that the puppies could get their feet or legs stuck
and/or easily injured. The applicant must ensure, at all times, that the flooring does not allow the dogs’ feet to pass
through any openings in the floor.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 11/13/2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
