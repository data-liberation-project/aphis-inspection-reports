3.27(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Guinea pigs were housed outdoors in a hutch without a variance. The guinea pigs still need to be moved indoors or
a variance obtained. Steps should be taken immediately to ensure the well-being of the guinea pigs, and the
licensee should either request and be granted permission for outdoor housing, or make other arrangements for
housing guinea pigs.
