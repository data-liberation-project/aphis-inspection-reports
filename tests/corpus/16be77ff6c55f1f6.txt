ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male hedgehog (cage card HH40) is missing several quills over the entire length of its back extending from its
neck to its butt. Additionally, there is dried, crusty material on the skin over the areas that are missing quills. The
animal was picked up and then placed back in the enclosure by the license holder. The animal immediately fell on
its side and was unbalanced as it got up and slowly moved around. The license holder stated that he contacted the
veterinarian two months ago because of the missing quills and that he had been treating the animal as per the
veterinarian's instructions. The license holder added that the hedgehog has lost more quills and that he did not
notice the animal's behavior prior to the inspection. Finally, the license holder stated that he hasn't contacted the
veterinarian about the additional quill loss. Frequent communication, including informing the veterinarian of the
decline or worsening of issues is necessary to prevent pain and discomfort in the animals.
Contact the veterinarian regarding this animal's condition and follow all prescribed treatments and/or instructions.
To be corrected: By the close of business on 7-21-17
2.131(a) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The license holder stated that two Patagonian cavies died after they aspirated formula that he fed them by bottle.
He indicated that both animals started spitting up milk, had labored breathing, and started to convulse shortly after
being fed the bottles. He also stated that he contacted the veterinarian, but the animals died several minutes later.
Inappropriate feeding methods/techniques resulted in the death of these animals.
All license holders must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the species they maintain, including
appropriate feeding methods and techniques.
To be corrected: From this day forward3.126(a)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The ambient temperature (combined with the heat index) in the animal room housing the adult raccoon was very
warm during the inspection. The temperature with the heat index factored in was 98.4 as per the kestrel 3000. Two
windows were open to the room, but they didn't help to relieve the heat and humidity as there was no breeze
coming in. There are no other means to protect against extreme temperatures in this animal room. Extreme
temperatures can cause distress in animals.
All animal rooms must be sufficiently regulated by heating or cooling to protect animals from extreme temperatures
to provide for their health and comfort.
To be corrected: A temporary solution must be implemented by 7-21-17. A long term solution must be implemented
by 8-3-17
3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The facility has inadequate ventilation in the following animal areas:
The upstairs animal room containing six foxes, two sugar gliders, four guinea pigs, two short-tailed opossums, eight
prairie dogs, two juvenile raccoons, one mountain coati, and one Patagonian cavy. This room has strong feces and
animal odors present.
The basement animal room containing fourteen sugar gliders, four hedgehogs, and two lesser tenrecs, This room
also has strong feces and animal odors present.
Inadequate ventilation causes odors and can cause respiratory problems for the animals.
Assure that all animal rooms are adequately ventilated to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Six foxes are housed in enclosures with inadequate space. Four of the foxes are housed in three enclosures that
measure15h x 24l x 24w. The final two fox enclosures measure 20.5h x 39.5l x 17w and 15h x 34l x 16w
respectively. The fox in the smaller enclosure is not able to stand normally as its head is taller than the enclosure
ceiling. Its back also continuously touches the enclosure ceiling. None of the foxes are able to make normalpostural and social adjustments as the enclosures are not large enough. Inadequate enclosure space can cause
stress, depression, and abnormal behavior patterns in animals.
The foxes must be housed in enclosures that allow for normal postural and social adjustments to provide for their
health and well-being.

SANITATION.
Excessive feces and/or food wastes and flies are present in and around the following animal enclosures:
The enclosures containing the fourteen sugar gliders, the sliding litter pans under their enclosures, the shelf space
and floor surrounding their enclosures, were all soiled with feces and foods wastes. An old apple core was riddled
with fruit flies/gnats in the enclosure on the top shelf closest to the hedgehogs.
The enclosures containing four hedgehogs and two lesser tenrecs all had excessive feces and flies/gnats in them.
The enclosure containing the two juvenile raccoons has excessive feces and urine all over the floor.
The enclosure containing the mountain coatimundi had excessive feces and urine all over the floor.
The enclosure containing the single adult raccoon had excessive feces located near the entrance door.
The empty transport kennel that previously housed the Patagonian cavy was soiled with feces. The kennel was
loaded with flies/gnats and located adjacent to the enclosure containing three prairie dogs.
Feces and food wastes can cause odors and spread disease.
Thoroughly clean and sanitize all of the affected areas and repeat often enough to prevent build up.
To be corrected: 7-23-17
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There are abundant amounts of flies and gnats in the upstairs and basement animal rooms. The flies and gnats
were observed in and around the animals' enclosures, on the animals' feces and food, and on the walls and ceilingof the animal rooms. An abundance of fly spots were present on the ceiling of the upstairs animal room. The
license holder had no fewer than four sticky fly strips that were loaded to capacity with flies. There were no
additional provisions for fly control. Flies carry and spread disease.
Implement and maintain an effective program to control the flies and gnats for the health and well-being of the
animals.
