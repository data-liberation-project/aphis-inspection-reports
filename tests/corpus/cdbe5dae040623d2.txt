(1) General requirements...
(i) Be free of excessive rust.
***In the indoor portion of the sheltered facility on the north side, the wire used to divide the primary enclosures and
on the gates was constructed of uncoated wire. Approximately two feet from the floor up, in all enclosures, the wire
was beginning to rust. On the outdoor portion of the north side, there was an enclosure that had chain link frame
work that was rusted completely through on the bottom rail of the fence and the corner of the gate. This enclosure
also had a piece of angle iron up against the bottom of the building that was rusted completely through and created
sharp edges. The sheet metal against the angle iron was beginning to rust through also. Excessive rust cannot be
cleaned and sanitized as required. It increases the risk for disease by creating a harboring place, can cause sharp
edges that can injure the animals and can cause damage to the structural strength of the enclosure. The licensee
must repair these areas and assure that all areas of rust are maintained as required.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
***In the outdoor portion of the sheltered facility, on the south side, there was an excessive amount of feces in the
enclosures. Approximately half of the feces was dried and white. The facility representative stated that it had been
approximately a week since these areas had been cleaned. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of
disease by attracting pests and providing an unhealthy environment for the animals. The facility representative must
clean these enclosures and assure that all primary enclosures are cleaned daily as required.
