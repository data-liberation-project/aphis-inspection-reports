2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was no program of veterinary care available for review at the time of the inspection. The written program of
veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the attending veterinarian in
regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. It outlines preventive veterinary care practices, such as
deworming and vaccinations. The facility should ensure that the written program of veterinary care is available for
review during all USDA inspections.
To be corrected by 9/4/15.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was 1 female brown gobex that had long toenails on both front limbs that were affecting her gait (VMO
observed the gobex to be partially lame). Lameness is an indicator of disease and often pain. Failure to maintain the
toenails of the animals can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal. This animal's
toenails should be trimmed appropriately and the facility should maintain a program of appropriate hoof and toenail
care.
To be corrected by 8/25/15.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The enclosure housing 2 kinkajous has twisted enclosure wire with sharp points. The sharp points pose a risk of
injury to the animals and can decrease the structural stability of the structure. The affected structures must be
repaired or replaced. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.131(a)SANITATION.
***In the enclosure housing 7 goats/ibex, there was an excessive accumulation of feces present on the ground. Due
to the accumulation, the animals could not lay in their enclosure without becoming contaminated by the waste
material. Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry
standards, to reduce disease transmission, and to prevent the animals from becoming contaminated or soiled. The
licensee must clean these enclosures and ensure that all enclosures housing animals are cleaned as often as
necessary to promote appropriate husbandry standards.
To be corrected by 8/28/15.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted on-site with the animal manager and the owner.
