ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility owner refused to allow APHIS inspectors to conduct the Animal Welfare Inspection. On March 24, 2014 I
called the facility owner and inquired about optimal hours of operation. I arrived to conduct the inpsection during the
optimal hours the owner had provided on March 24, 2014.
On 3/31/14 at 12:13 PM I attempted to conduct an inspection of the facility. I introduced myself to the licensee and
that I was there to conduct a routine inspection. The licensee did not want to allow an inspection. The licensee
made it clear that this was not a good time and that she did not have the time to conduct an inspection today and
was busy with other work. I asked the licensee " are you refusing to allow the inspection?" She stated yes she was
too busy this week and I was welcome to return next week. I asked her if her father who was on the grounds could
accompany me on the inspection and she stated that he was not on the license. I stated to the licensee that a
refusal to allow inspection is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act, and will be cited on the inspection.
