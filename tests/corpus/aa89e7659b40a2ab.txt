2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In the past year, the registrant has not completed the regulatory requirements for the IACUC to conduct
semi-annual inspections and prepare a report to the Institutional Official regarding these inspections. There have
been no animal activities, but this does not exempt the IACUC from fulfilling its required functions. The IACUC must
complete facility inspections, conduct a program review, and send a report of its activities to the IO as soon as
possible, but at least within 60 days.
An exit interview was conducted with the registrant.
