3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
Thirty seven feeders were observed to have edges that were rusted out and rough. The facility showed me new feeders
they have on hand to correct this and began replacing the affected feeders during inspection. Rough and rusted edges
could injure guinea pigs. Ensure that all enclosure surfaces are maintained more often so guinea pigs can't touch any
rough or sharp edges.

Correct by 6/8/2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
