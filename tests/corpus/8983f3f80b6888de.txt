HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An open bag of goat milk replacer was found sitting on the east floor in the puppy barn. A box of dog biscuits was
also found open and sitting on top of a covered trash receptacle along the south wall. Open containers of food
may attract vermin and become contaminated. All opened food items and open food bags should be kept in
leakproof containers with tight fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.
