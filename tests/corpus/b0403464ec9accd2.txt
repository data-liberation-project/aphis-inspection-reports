ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**Charcoal, a 2 year old fuzzy lop, subject of citation on 11/30/15, was found dead on 1/31/16. No necropsy was
conducted. A grey calico rabbit, undocumented age/ID, was reported to have died when brought in for treatment of
respiratory distress on 2/2/16. Young rabbit ID 52-5 was reported to have been euthanized by the AV on 2/24/16 for
pasteurellosis/abscesses. Rabbit 21-3 was found deceased on 1/10/16. Rabbits 51-2 and 52-3 were found
deceased on 1/28/16. There are no records from the AV documenting the examinations of these animals. Pencil, ID
49, a harlequin lop, was found deceased on 3/4/16. The record says "autopsy ordered", but there is no record of a
post-mortem exam. A facility representative stated that the rabbit was still on-site in the refrigerator.
**Two rabbits, IDs 51-7 and 52-8, were found dead on 2/24/16 and 2/28/16, respectively. It was noted that the
suspected cause was coccidia. Treatment via water supply was ordered by the AV in January 2016 to treat
coccidia, and the licensee described how the medication was administered. The container of the medication has a
proper prescription label, but there is no documentation of the treatment and ordered repeat course of the treatment
in the medication records.
**Veterinary records for four rabbits (unnamed, no ID on forms) seen in February 2016 - three for fight
wounds/abscesses, and one for coccidia - indicated that courses of medication had been ordered, but there is no
record of medication administration in the medication record book.
**Yeti, a white angora lop, had discharge from the eyes and swelling of the 3rd eyelid of the left eye. Yeti had been
treated for an upper respiratory infection in January 2016. The last treatment was documented on 1/19/16. The
condition appears to have recurred, but the AV has not been contacted to follow up.
**Wazine, a wormer medication labeled for turkeys, chickens, and swine, was reported to have been prescribed for
use in the rabbits, and was reported to have been added to the water. There is no proper prescription label on the
bottle for its use in the rabbits, no written instructions, and there is no record of its use.
**A bottle of Vitamin A capsules, two tubes of triple antibiotic ointment, and a bottle of gentamycin ophthalmic drops
were in the rabbit rabbit mediction storage. None were labeled for use in rabbits, and there was no veterinaryprescription or written instructions for any of them. An expired bottle of enrofloxacin solution was discarded at the
time of inspection.
Failure to document veterinary care and treatment, and to follow up with the AV if the treatment is not effective or if
the condition recurs, does not constitute appropriate veterinary care because there is no way to evaluate whether
the treatment was effective, or if the prescribed treatment was actually given. The licensee must ensure that
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries are provided in a timely manner,
and must provide documentation of these veterinary evaluations and treatments (if prescribed) to the inspectors
upon request. This may include performance of necropsies on young, otherwise healthy rabbits who suddenly die in
order to diagnose conditions that can cause illness in the herd. The medication supply must be monitored to ensure
that expired medications are discarded so that they are not inadvertantly used in the animals. Only medications
labeled for or prescribed for the rabbits are to be used in the rabbits.
This is a repeat noncompliant item previously cited on 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, and 11/30/2015.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility has a method of documenting acquisitions and dispositions. However, the record of acquisition is
confusing and incomplete. Eleven animals are in the quarantine area in cages that have no means of identification
for the animals. Some dispositions of animals were missing the name and address of the individual who obtained
the animals. Some dates on disposition forms are missing or have two conflicting dates
Accurate record keeping is essential to allow APHIS to accurately track animals and ensure that all animals are
receiving proper care as required by the Animal Welfare Act. Additionally, specific information regarding sources for
acquisition and disposition are necessary in the event of disease to facilitate tracking animal movement and to
ensure animal health and welfare. The licensee must make, keep and maintain records which fully disclose
information regarding all acquisitions and dispositions; including all births, deaths, and animals euthanized.
Previously cited on reports dated 4/29/2015 and 11/30/2015.
2.131(d)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A 1 lb juvenile rabbit, ID 1-6, from doe Chockie, was documented to have died suddenly at a party on 10/3/15. The
licensee stated that they thought it was probably due to coccidia because it was a runt of the litter. Animals must only be exhibited in such a way that concern for their health and well-being is a priority. Any animal
that might not be of optimal health, appropriate age or temperament to withstand the stress of participating in a
party situation must not be included in the exhibition group.
Correct by carefully evaluating each animal before they are included in a group for exhibition prior to each event
from now on.
3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**Three rabbits died after escaping from their enclosures since that last inspection. Rabbit 52-2 was found dead in a
trap on 1/19/15, rabbit 16-3 was found dead on grounds on 12/22/15 or 1/3/16 - record is unclear, and rabbit 51-1
was found deceased on grounds on 10/15/15 or 1/10/16 (15?) - again record is unclear.
Failure to provide enclosures that are structurally sound can lead to escape of the animals. The licensee must
ensure that the enclosures are structurally sound so that they contain the animals
This is a repeat noncompliant item previously cited on reports dated 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, and 11/30/2015.
3.53(a)(5) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**This facility is not using properly constructed nest boxes for females with litters less than a month old. Four litters
of rabbits less than a month old observed by inspector did not have nest boxes. The youngest litter was reported to
be three days old. A doe currently raising a litter of five was reported to have lost three out of four kits from her
previous litter.
Nest boxes are necessary in order to have a safe place to give birth for the doe and to nurse her babies. It is also
important to allow for the motor coordination and the heat-regulation capacity of the baby rabbits to develop. A nest
box needs to be provided to all females due to kindle and must be maintained in the enclosure until the litter is a
month old to ensure comfort and safety of the animals.
This is a repeat noncompliant item previously cited on the inspection reports dated 4/29/2015 and 11/30/2015.
3.53(c)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**One cage contains 9 rabbits, which are reported to be a doe and her litter. The juvenile rabbits are well pastweaning age. The cage measures 30(cid:29) x 30(cid:29), or 2.5(cid:25) by 2.5(cid:25). This is 6.25 square feet or 0.69 square feet per rabbit.
Another cage contains eight rabbits, a doe and her litter, also past weaning age. Their cage is 24 x 36, or 6 square
feet; 0.75 square feet per rabbit. The two pairs of NZ cross rabbits previously cited for inadequate floor space are
still housed in the same sized cages as at the time of that citation.
Each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be provided a minimum amount of floor space according to USDA
APHIS Animal Welfare Act regulations. For rabbits >5.4 lbs, the minimum amount of floor spaces is 5 square feet
per rabbit. If the juveniles weigh less than 4.4 lbs, they would require 1.5 square feet each. The group of 9 rabbits
should have 17 square feet; the group of 9 should have 15.5 square feet.
Housing rabbits in an inappropriately sized enclosure may stress the animals. This can lead to increased
susceptibility to disease, incompatibility, and fighting. Rabbits must be housed in enclosures with the minimum
required floor space for their health and well-being.
Previously cited on 11/30/2015.
3.54(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
**Two of the metal self-feeders attached to rabbit enclosures were observed to be excessively dirty and rusty. Dirt
and rust can contaminate feed stored within the feeders as particles flake off into the food, possibly rendering it less
nutritious, wholesome, and palatable to the rabbit.
Two of the feeders had been knocked off of the cages onto the ground, leaving the mount area open so an animal
could get a body part entrapped in the opening, and leaving the aimals without access to food for the length of time
the feeder was on the ground.
The licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are cleaned and sanitized and properly secured to the
enclosures to minimize disease hazards.
Noncompliant items associated with feeding practices were also cited on inspection reports dated 11/19/2014,
1/13/2015, 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, and 11/30/2015.
3.56(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
**Four enclosures (with at least 8 rabbits affected) had an excessive amount of dirt, urine, feces, hair and other
organic material build up on the wire flooring.
Sanitation issues can damage the hair coat and skin and make the animals susceptible to infection, especiallypododermatitis (foot infection). Poor sanitation also exposes these animals to bacterial growth that can be
hazardous and lower the immune system of these animals. A compromised immune system does not allow these
animals to build up the necessary antibodies to fight disease and infection.
Licensee must ensure that there are adequate measures in place to remove all dust, dirt, urine, feces and all other
organic material from all surfaces of the facility.
This is a repeat noncompliant item cited previously on reports dated 11/20/2014, 1/14/2015, 4/1/2015, 4/29/2015,
and 11/30/2015.
3.56(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.
**At present there is no evidence that primary enclosures are appropriately cleaned and sanitized on a regular
schedule. A facility representative said that the hair, feces, and hay debris that collects on the caging is swept off
with a brush.
This may be done by washing them with hot water and soap or detergent, by washing all soiled surfaces with a
detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam or
flame. The licensee must employ one of these effective methods to clean and sanitize all surfaces at least once
every 30 days. Enclosures that are not regularly cleaned and sanitized may harbor micro-organisms that can cause
illness in the rabbits.
Previously cited on the report from 11/30/2015.
3.56(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
**This facility has clutter within and around the facility perimeter. The materials consist of unused wire cages, plastic
materials, wood, trash, and wire mesh. There is no organization of these materials and the majority is being kept in
unsanitary conditions and potentially contributing to disease hazards within the facility. Excessive clutter of materials
creates an ideal breeding ground for mammalian and insect pests and creates numerous hiding areas that may
conceal predators.
**There was also a moderate to large amount of dirt and evidence of urine splatter on the plastic sheetingsurrounding the outdoor rabbit enclosure area.
The licensee must ensure that that all unwanted items are properly discarded and removed from the property, and
that premises shall be kept clean in order to minimize odor and pests. Additionally, useful items must be properly
cleaned, organized and stored so that all areas of the premise, including the quarantine and storage areas are kept
clean, in good repair and free of the accumulation of materials in order to facilitate proper husbandry practices.
This is a repeat noncompliant item cited previously on inspection reports dated 4/1/2015, 4/29/2015, and
11/30/2015.
3.61(a)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE RABBITS.
**This facility is still using blue Rubbermaid-type totes with removable tops on a regular basis to transport rabbits to
and from parties. The ventilation openings for the rabbits while in these totes are small holes that have been placed
in the top of the tote lids. Inadequate ventilation can restrict necessary airflow to the animals and result in
overheating or otherwise compromise health during transportation. Although staff indicated they remove the lids
during transport, this is not appropriately containing the rabbits. In addition, several totes are cracked and do not
have the structural strength necessary to withstand the rigors of travel. At the time of this inspection, an associate
returned from a party with 15 rabbits in three of these totes. One tote contained two rabbits, one contained a doe
and her four week old litter of seven kits, and the last contained a doe and her four week old litter of four kits At least
one of these totes had significant cracks, potentially exposing sharp edges and making it difficult or impossible to
clean and disinfect.
All licensees are required to ensure that transport enclosures for rabbits have ventilation openings located on two
opposite walls of the primary enclosure and that the ventilation openings on each wall are at least 16 percent of the
total surface area. Alternately, transport enclosures for rabbits may have ventilation openings located on all four
walls of the primary enclosure provided that those openings are at least 8 percent of the total surface area of each
wall.
As they are currently constructed the Rubbermaid-type totes do not provide adequate ventilation or structural
strength as required. Correct by ensuring that all transport enclosure used in the future are constructed in a manner
that adequate ventilation is provided to all animals and that all other requirements for enclosure construction are
met.
This is a repeat noncompliant item cited previously on reports dated 4/1/2015, 4/29/2015, and 11/30/2015.The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives on 4/12-13/2016.
