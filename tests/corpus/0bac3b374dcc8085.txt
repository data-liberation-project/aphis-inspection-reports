Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of inspection, while reviewing records, there was a disposition document for the sale of a 4-month-old, male
Spider Monkey on March 25, 2022. However, there was no acquisition document for the same animal. Acquisition and
disposition documents are utilized to keep track of USDA regulated species. Such records are important as to ensure an
accurate count, assessment and proper acquisition and disposition of all animals that the facility deals, purchases, and/or
resales. Every dealer must make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully disclose the following information
concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased, or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in
his/her possession or under his/her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that
dealer: The name and address of the person from whom the animals were purchased or otherwise acquired; the USDA
license number of the person if he/she is licensed under the Act; the vehicle license number and State, and the driver's
license number (or photographic identification card if a non-driver and State) and State of the person, if he/she is not
licensed under the act; the name and address of the person to whom an animal was sold or given; the date of purchase,
acquisition, sale, or disposal of the animal(s); the species of the animal(s); and the number of animals in the shipment.

Sanitation.


At the time of inspection there were many flies in the guinea pig breeding room that housed more than approximately 120
guinea pigs (a mix of adults and offspring). The flies were on the guinea pigs, their food, enclosures, and flying around the
room in general. In addition to this area, there were many flies outside of this building, and several other areas of the
premises. Flies can transfer germs from dirty surfaces to clean ones, and therefore possibly lead to illness of the animals
through food contamination. Furthermore, some species of flies can transmit diseases and can inflict painful bites/skin
issues when feeding on the animals. An effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and mammalian pests
shall be established and maintained.
