HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**One of the upright freezers storing chicken was severely iced over and should be replaced or defrosted and
cleaned. One of its shelves had also broken.
**The lid of the freezer chest storing beef had split in one area (approximately 6" x 4") exposing the freezer's
insulation. The lid is also held down by cinder blocks, likely to improve sealing.
Currently there is no reliable way to assess whether these freezers are functioning consistently. Both freezers
appear quite old and their future efficacy is questionable.
Food may deteriorate or become contaminated if not stored properly. This can occur if equipment, such as freezers,
are not functioning appropriately due to disrepair (issues with sealing, leaking, insulation, etc.). As deteriorated food
can cause food-related illness in animals, this situation must be addressed.
