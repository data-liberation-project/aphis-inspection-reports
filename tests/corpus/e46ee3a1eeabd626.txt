*During this inspection a Husky puppy arrived at IAH from RDU and was continuing on to ALB. The food and water
certification attached to the outside of the enclosure did not contain the date and time that the puppy was last fed
and watered or instructions for feeding and watering for the next 24 hours,
To ensure dogs are fed and watered during transport according to the standards and regulations of section 3.16
under the AWA the required certifications for travel must be complete. A carrier must not accept a dog for travel
unless the certification signed by the consignor contains the date and time of last watering and feeding and food
and water instructions for the next 24 hours. In cases of extended travel and unforeseen delays these instructions
will provide information to those unfamiliar with the animals that may prevent potential dehydration and nutritional
compromise.
