Facilities, general.
The September 8, 2021 IACUC minutes describe an incident where an animal care technician found an escaped ferret
and returned it to its enclosure. The enclosure was inspected, and no problems were found. Another employee later found
the ferret had escaped but was unaware of the earlier incident and returned it to its enclosure. The ferret was later found
outside its enclosure a third time. The enclosure was evaluated and determined to have slightly bent bars allowing for the
animal to escape. The animal was found to be in good health and was placed in a new enclosure.
In the October 13, 2021 IACUC minutes three more incidents are described. In the first, a kit was found with its paw
caught in the enclosure. The ferret was freed, evaluated, and flagged for veterinary follow-up. No treatment was
determined to be needed. The enclosure was taken out of use until fixed and the jill and kits were relocated to a new
enclosure.
In another incident, a ferret was found with its lower jaw stuck in the cage bars. It was freed, treated for a skin lesion
under the jaw, and relocated to a new enclosure. The cage was evaluated and found to have bent bars. The enclosure
was repaired.
In the third incident, a ferret was found with its paw caught in the enclosure. The ferret was freed and evaluated. No
treatment was determined to be needed. The cage was taken out of use until fixed and all ferrets in the enclosure were


relocated to a new one.
Enclosures need to be designed, built, and maintained so that they keep the ferrets contained, protecting them from
potential injury, and so they don’t pose a risk of injury to the animals within. The enclosures in these incidents were
repaired. The facility has implemented procedures to try to better identify enclosures in need of repair and many
enclosures have already been repaired or removed from service.
Correction: Ensure the process of identification of defects and repairs is ongoing.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian.
