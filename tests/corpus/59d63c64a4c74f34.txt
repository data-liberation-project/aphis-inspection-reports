2.8
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
I arrived at the facility and found the licensee had vacated the property about a month ago. The property was
occupied by new renters and there is no knowledge of where the licensee has relocated. Regulations require the
licensee notify the Animal Care Regional Director within 10 days of a change of address. The licensee has failed to
comply with this regulation. As a result, Animal Care cannot perform inspections as required by the Federal Animal
Welfare Act.
Correct by: Within 10 days of this inspection report ( July 20, 2018).
The exit interview could not be completed since the licensee was nolonger at this address.
