3.31(a)(1) Critical

Sanitation.
At the time of inspection, there is an empty enclosure in the tortoise room of the Reptile House which recently housed
three adult guinea pigs. The floor of the enclosure is uniformly covered in 1-2 inches of feces, food debris and moist,
soiled straw bedding, and there is a strong ammonia smell present. When the inspector inquired as to the location of the
guinea pigs, the facility representative called zoo staff and was told that the animals were found deceased, one on
12/7/22 and the other two on 12/11/22. The caretaker observation log for those days does not indicate any abnormal
findings, including the finding of the deceased animals, and the facility representative did not know when the guinea pig
enclosure was last cleaned. The facility representative stated that all three of the guinea pig carcasses are frozen,
awaiting necropsy from the veterinarian. Failure to adequately sanitize primary enclosures as frequently as needed can
result in noxious fumes as well as accumulation of feces and other debris that can foster microbial growth, attract pests
and vermin, and cause discomfort, distress, illness and death. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are
cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris, and not less than once every two
weeks in the manner provided in Section 3.31(a)(4) of the Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations.

Housing facilities, general.
There are two containers of cleaning chemicals stored on the shelf above bags of primate diet inside the commissary. A
facility representative removed the chemicals to a separate storage area at the time of inspection. Storing chemicals near
food can allow the food to become contaminated, leading to animal illness or death. Supplies of food and bedding must
be stored in a manner that protects them from spoilage, contamination and vermin infestation. Substances that are toxic
to nonhuman primates but that are required for normal husbandry practices must not be stored in food storage and
preparation areas, but may be stored in cabinets in the animal areas.

3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
In the indoor portion of the enclosure housing two adult genets, there is an electrical outlet with a heating appliance
plugged into it. There is plastic conduit covering most parts of the electrical cord, but only old, soiled tape covering some
of the outlet, electrical plug and wire. There are no solid barriers to prevent the animals from potentially having direct
contact with some parts of the outlet box, plug and electrical wire. Animal access to these items poses a risk for injury or
death due to electric shock or other injury. The licensee must ensure that facilities are constructed of such material and of
such strength as appropriate for the animals involved, and housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury.
3.131(d) Repeat

Sanitation.
Inside the haybarn, peacocks and other birds roost above and nest on the straw bedding and hay used for feeding.
Feces have fallen inside the haybarn on and around the hay and bedding. There are no effective methods in place to
prevent the entry of birds or other vermin. The presence of pests and vermin encourages contamination of food and


bedding, which can lead to animal illness. The licensee must establish and maintain a safe and effective program for the
control of avian and other pests.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the zoo director.
