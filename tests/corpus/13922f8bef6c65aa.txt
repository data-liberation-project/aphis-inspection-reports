Non-interference with APHIS officials.
During physical inspection of the facility on September 15, 2021 at approximately 11:45 AM, CDT the inspectors found
that 16 puppies in a holding room on the second floor did not have water. The inspectors explained to the licensees
husband that puppies need water available continuously. The inspectors asked that water be made available to the
puppies and the puppies drank continuously for 30-60 seconds. The inspector was explaining how lack of water is
determined on inspection when the licensee started video taping the inspection and in a raised, angry voice asked the
inspector if she was blind?, and calling the inspector a liar because he does not abuse or neglect his puppies. The
inspector stated that abuse or neglect had never been said on inspection, and was just trying to explain the inspection
process. The licensee's husband then grabbed a Pomeranian out of an enclosure to show us stating his puppies well
cared for and healthy. I pointed out the water bowl in the corgi enclosure was almost empty after they had just filled it,
and he pushed the door in, almost hitting the puppy, grabbed the bowl and dumped it out in front of our feet. The
licensee's husband asked the inspectors to leave, and asked to speak with the manager. The inspector informed the
licensee's husband what Refusing an inspection meant. The licensee's husband continued calling the inspector a liar and
stating he does not abuse or neglect his animals. The inspector stated to the licensee's husband that if he didn't calm
down the inspectors would leave due to interference with the inspectors continuing the inspection. The licensee's
husband continued ranting, and interfering with the inspection. The inspectors felt they could not continue as they felt

threatened, and could not ask questions related to inspection so the inspectors left. All the way down the steps, and out
the door of the facility, and around the corner of the property, as the inspectors left the facility, the licensee's husband
followed and continued the video tape and stating the animals are not abused or neglected and that he was not interfering
with inspection.

A licensee shall not interfere with, threaten, abuse (including verbal abuse), or harass any APHIS official in the course of
carrying out his or her duties.

Interference with inspection prevents accurate assessment of animal welfare. Licensees, or their representatives must
not interfere with inspectors carrying out their duties of inspection.

2.78(a)

Health certification and identification.
The majority of the puppies were acquired from breeders/brokers in other states and health certificates were not present.
The licensee said they had health certificates but did not provide them for review during inspection. There were puppies
sold to other states. The method of transportation was not selected, therefore it is unclear if the licensee should hold
health certificates for these puppies that were transported or not.

No broker shall transport in commerce any dog unless the dog is accompanied by a health certificate executed and
issued by a licensed veterinarian.


All puppies transported by the licensee must be accompanied by a health certificate issues by a licensed veterinarian.
This is to ensure the puppies are healthy enough for transportation, and to ensure the puppies acquired and sold are
healthy.

Primary enclosures.
The first lower enclosure on the left housed two black puppies. A piece of wire was holding the enclosure closed in
addition to the latch on the door. The licensee's husband stated one of these puppies was adept at escaping. These
puppies were seen extending their arms out near the piece of sharp wire.

Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the
dogs and cats.

Primary enclosures for dogs must be maintained to that they do not have sharp points that could cause injury to the
puppies in the enclosure. The licensee removed the wire during inspection.
