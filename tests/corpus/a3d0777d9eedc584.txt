3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
The facility has new construction on the outside enclosures for the sheltered building that had gaps between the building
and the enclosure. These gaps allowed some dogs to go between enclosures. These gaps could trap dogs or cause
harm to dogs if they get into another enclosure. The applicant must ensure all enclosures contain the dogs securely .
3.3(e)(1)

Sheltered housing facilities.
The flooring in the building is not impervious to moisture. Flooring not impervious to moisture can harbor diseases and
hold odors. The applicant must ensure surfaces are impervious to moisture.
3.13

Veterinary care for dogs.
Although the applicant had the attending veterinarian recently do a hands on exam and do fecal and heartworm tests,
these were not recorded in the program of veterinary care. Also missing from the program of vet care was the
preventative care section. Failure to have these plans could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the
animals. The Program of Veterinary Care must include a frequency of hands on exam, parasite sampling/testing and
appropriate plan of preventative care and treatment to maintain healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed toe

nails, and healthy teeth, ears, eyes and skin. The applicant must add the missing plans to the Program of Veterinary Care
in order to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class A license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by February 8, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
