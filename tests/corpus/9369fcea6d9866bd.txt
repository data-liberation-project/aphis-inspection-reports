2.131(d)(2) Critical

Handling of animals.
A member of the public was able to enter a nonhuman primate enclosure housing two Ring Tail Lemurs, resulting in a
three-old-child getting injured. This incident was reported on August 31, 2020. The encounter occurred when the facility
was not open to the public, as the licensee had allowed friends of the family to visit. Due to no park staff or employees
accompanying the guests, they were able to walk directly up to, and enter, the Ring Tail Lemur primary enclosure.
Although barriers are in place that sufficiently distances the general viewing public from the animals, the visitors had been
unattended during their visit at the facility.

Public contact oversight is necessary to safeguard animal encounters and prevent injuries to the public. The facility must
ensure that a responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or attendant is present at all times during
periods of public contact.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
