2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On 5/25/21 the licensee allowed for the transport of one female and one male bobcat kitten that were under four weeks of
age. Records show that the bobcat kittens were born on 5/1/2021. Nondomestic cats of this age do not have a completely
developed immune system and are unable to fight off disease or infections and allowing them to be transported under four
weeks of age puts them at risk for illness or death. Nondomestic cats must be protected from harm by not releasing them
for transport if they are 4 weeks (28 days) or younger in age. Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
