ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:30-5:00 pm
on 16-Oct-18.
I knocked on the house door and honked my car horn. I called the cell phone number but was not able to leave a
message.
