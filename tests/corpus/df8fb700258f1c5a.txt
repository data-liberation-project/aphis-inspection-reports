Facilities, general.
During the early morning hours on 12/30/2021 , two dogs gained access to the upper petting zoo by the guest cabins .
One goat and seven sheep were killed by the dogs . The dogs may have gained access to the area thru a small gap on
either side of the gate into the petting zoo. Facility employees check perimeter fence lines daily to ensure predators are
not digging under the fence line. There was no reported evidence of an area where the dogs gained access to the
property . There is suspicion the dogs were pets and brought on the property during the night by guests staying in the
cabins. The gap on either side of the gate must be repaired to prevent predator access . CORRECT BY : 1/8/2022

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility employee and the manager.
