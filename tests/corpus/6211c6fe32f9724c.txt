2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection there were three rams observed in the front pasture that were limping, and noticeably lame.
The licensee had not noticed the lameness, and had not contacted the veterinarian.
Failure to observe animals on a daily basis in order to detect any problems that might affect their well-being could
result in unnecessary suffering, and / or a poor medical outcome for the animals.
The licensee must consult with his veterinary practitioner as soon as possible, and initiate a treatment plan for any
currently lame animals within 48 hours. All animals should be observed on a daily basis, with any problems promptly
reported to the attending veterinarian, from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
