ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The attending vet listed on the consultant agreement has recently left the area. The facility has made
arrangements for the emergency vet clinic to become the attending veterinarian, but those arrangements have not
been formalized with a written agreement. The new attending vet needs to visit the facility and work out the
consultant arrangements through a new written document. This is to assure the new attending vet has adequate
authority over the care of the animals and that communication methods are in place regarding health care needs.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A large breed dog male # 001 has a small wound on the left ear tip. The area appears to be healing overall but
there is also still a small open area of red tissue. No treatment was given to the dog and the injury was not
communicated to the vet for an appropriate treatment plan.
*** A large breed dog female # 011 was blinking her eyes continuously and pawing her face. She did not seem to
want to open the right eye. The licensee looked closer at the eye and there appeared to be some irritation. This
dogs condition needs to be communicated to the vet and the dog examined as eye injuries can have lasting
negative impacts.
Daily observation of the dogs must take place with a method of communicating any health care issues to the vet in a
timely manner to provide guidance on treatment options for the dogs.
