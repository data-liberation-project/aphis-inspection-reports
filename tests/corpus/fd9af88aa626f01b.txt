ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult female pronghorn named "Vela" had overgrown hooves on both front feet. The hooves on the right front
foot were beginning to cross over each other. Overgrown hooves can cause changes in the angle of the toes,
change the gait, cause discomfort when walking and can lead to chronic problems in the feet and legs such as
arthritis. The hooves must be trimmed and a plan needs to be developed and documented, with the input of the
attending veterinarian (AV), to address the need for hoof trimming for all animals that may need more frequent
trimming to prevent the development of chronic foot and leg problems.

WATERING.
The water trough for the adult male black bear named "Koshari" had clumps of green floating matter on the surface
of the water. A green slimy substance was adhered to the inside surfaces of the water trough. This water trough is
the only source of drinking water for the bear in this enclosure. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and
sanitary.
