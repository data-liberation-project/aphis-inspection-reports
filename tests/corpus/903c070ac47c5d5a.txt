HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the primary enclosure of the greyhound, Stormy, the bottom portion of one of the walls has chipped paint,
exposing the cement underneath. The IACUC meeting minutes from October 18, 2016 showed that the chipped
paint and exposed cement in the dog enclosure had been noticed during the semi-annual facility review. One dog
has the potential to come into contact with the affected surface, which cannot be readily cleaned nor sanitized on a
regular basis.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis and that any surface that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled.
The facility representative is going to move the greyhound into a different enclosure today.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two research horses, Marley and Scout, that live together in a primary enclosure. Three trees in the
horses’ enclosure are surrounded by chain link fencing. The bottom of the chain link around the Eastern-most tree is
curving in an upward direction. This chain link has numerous sharp points that could come into contact with the
horses and lead to injury.
All housing facilities must be maintained in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings
in order to protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be
in place.
