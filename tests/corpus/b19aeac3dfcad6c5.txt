CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The indoor resting perch for the female baboon is dirty and smeared with feces. Also, the outdoor lemur
enclosure floor has an excessive accumulation of feces that must be removed and the area cleaned. These
surfaces must be kept clean, replaced when needed, and spot cleaned as needed to reduce disease potential.
Failure to properly clean surfaces in contact with the animals exposes them to potential diseases and parasites.
Correct this by maintaining these surfaces and cleaning on a more frequent basis.

SANITATION.
*** Several enclosures require cleaning to reduce disease hazards to the animals. The enclosure containing the wolf
and wolf hybrid, the enclosure containing the 2 red fox, and the enclosure containing the brown bear cub have
plastic igloo shelters that are covered with dirt and grime. Additionally the enclosure containing the 3 adult black
bears has an accumulation of feces and spent food items including bread on the ground that requires cleaning.
*** All of these enclosures must be cleaned and maintained on a more frequent basis to ensure the animals can
remain clean and to reduce disease hazards. Additionally, spent food must be removed on a regular basis to deter
potential rodent problems, especially due to the fact that evidence of rodents was found during this inspection.

the regulated animals on the premises.
