2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male red and white Welsh Corgi, date of birth 5/22/17 and ID number 048, had a health condition requiring diagnosis
and treatment in consultation with the attending veterinarian. There was a moderate build-up of hard whitish brown
material on the surface of the cheek teeth especially along the upper part of the teeth near the gum line. The gums did not
appear red or swollen and the dog was in good body condition. The medical records indicate the veterinarian performed a
physical exam on 4/21/21 and did not include any abnormalities documented. The Program of Veterinary Care on file did
not address the condition or provide any treatment options. The licensee had not observed the condition and had not
contacted the attending veterinarian.
The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This condition
could be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally, and may result in spread of bacteria to other parts of the
body such as liver and kidneys which can negatively impact the overall health of the animal.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate the dog and determine an appropriate plan for
diagnosis and treatment.
