3.75(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
In several of the baboon enclosures surfaces were in disrepair. There was plywood with deteriorated, jagged edges; metal
flashing with lifted sharp edges; a deteriorated board attached to fencing with projecting, exposed metal screws; and den
boxes with peeling paint and some rust.

Surfaces in primate enclosures should be maintained in good repair so that they can be readily cleaned and sanitized,
and so that they are not hazardous to the animals. Failure to maintain surfaces could be hazardous to the well-being of
the animals.

To be corrected by 12/18/2021.
