Contingency planning.
The facility has not yet completed their contingency plan (using the APHIS form 7093 form). The third page which
documents the tasks required to be carried out in response to identified emergencies/disasters is blank. Tasks to address
should include details such as steps to take to address the emergency, instructions for evacuation/moving animals or
sheltering in place, and for addressing animal needs such as food/water, sanitation, ventilation, and heating/cooling. A
written detailed plan is necessary to plan for emergencies/disasters that are likely to be experienced. Correct by ensuring
the written contingency plan includes an outline of the specific tasks required to be carried out in response to the identified
emergencies/disasters.
3.84(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The non-human primate enclosures are in need of cleaning. The marmoset enclosures have an accumulation of excreta
on the bottoms of the enclosures. Urine has dried on items outside and immediately adjacent to the marmoset enclosures.
The perches/cloth items in the marmoset enclosures are dirty. The shavings in the spider monkey and snow macaque
indoor enclosure portion have multiple wet soiled areas (excreta) that are over a day old. Excreta and food waste must be


removed from indoor primary enclosures daily to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors and prevent the
animals from becoming soiled. Correct by 12/14/22.
3.84(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The indoor non-human primate building is in need of cleaning. Stored items are dirty and dusty. The floor has an
accumulation of dirt and debris around the wall edges especially along the wall where the marmoset enclosures are
located. Empty feed bags are present and have not been put in the trash. The shelf holding the refrigerator and food
stores is in need of cleaning with accumulated dirt and debris. Premises need to be kept clean and free of trash, waste
and discarded matter to prevent the spread of disease and eliminate breeding/living areas for rodents/pests/vermin.
Correct by 12/23/22.
3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
The enclosure housing the zebra, an alpaca and other domestic equine species has a large muddy area in front of the
water and feed trough. The hooves of the zebra were noted sinking partially into the muddy ground. The ground of this
enclosure slopes toward the corner where the troughs are currently located and with the large amount of rain over the last
week the area has become muddy. The remainder of the enclosure is currently not muddy. The animals may not want to
walk into the muddy area to get to the water/feed troughs or they may slip and injure themselves getting to the troughs.
Options for providing dry ground at the troughs could include for example correcting the slope of the ground in that corner
of the enclosure or moving the troughs to higher ground. The facility shall ensure that the areas where the animals have
to go to access feed/water/shelter have a suitable method by which excess water is rapidly eliminated. Correct by
1/13/23.
