2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection report on September 21, 2017, records of animal births and deaths were not
maintained for the guinea pigs except for the number of weaned animals which were last recorded in March 2018.
Records need to be kept on animal births and deaths to comply with the regulations, to help keep track of animals,
and for assessment of the animal care program. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
