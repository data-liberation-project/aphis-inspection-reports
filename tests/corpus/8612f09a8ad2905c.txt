PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On the morning of March 11, 2014, a juvenile rhesus, #535, was found dead in a combined double stacked primary
enclosure that group housed six juvenile rhesus. The cause of death was determined to be dehydration. Two other
animals in the enclosure found clinically dehydrated were treated and recovered.
The three affected animals were confined to an upper level of the enclosure without a functional water source. A
subsequent investigation indicated that the animals had closed a cage divider; essentially trapping themselves.
They were unable to re-open the divider because of their size/age. Although a water device was installed in the
upper and lower levels of the enclosure, the water source in the upper level had become disconnected from the
water supply.
Primary enclosures for non-human primates must be constructed and maintained so that they safely contain the
animals and protect them from injury. The ability of these animals to close the cage divider and their inability to
re-open it contributed to a death and clinical illness in three animals.
The facility has taken corrective measures to prevent future compromise of animal safety in these enclosures by
latching the enclosure dividers in the open position when applicable.
Correct by: All future housing for non-human primates must safely contain the animals and prevent injury.

WATERING.
On March 11, 2014 a juvenile non-human primate died from dehydration and two other group housed juveniles in
the same enclosure were found to be exhibiting clinical signs of dehydration.
A facility investigation indicated that sometime after 4 p.m. on March 10 the three affected animals closed an
enclosure divider confining them to the upper level of their enclosure. A water device was available in the confined
area and was attached to the water supply line by two recoil hoses connected together with a "quick connect." It isassumed that because of the length of the hoses the unsupervised, confined animals were able to reach the recoil
hoses and disconnect them. Potentially, the animals may have been without water for up to 15 1/2 hours.
Potable water must be provided to every non-human primate in sufficient quantity and offered as often as necessary
to ensure their health and well-being. The lack of access to water for an extended period of time contributed to a
death and clinical illness of three juvenile rhesus.
The facility has taken corrective measures that include discontinuing use of extended length water hoses and
re-training of personnel regarding water devices.
Correct by: In the future adequate water must be provided to all non-human primates.
This was a focused inspection of animal facilities and IACUC documents. The inspection and exit interview were
conducted with the executive director of animal care operations.
