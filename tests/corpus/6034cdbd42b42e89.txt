2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On the evening of December 29, 2021, the facility's contracted employee went over a public barrier and placed his hand
inside the primary enclosure of an 8 year-old tiger, where he sustained a serious injury. No first party animal husbandry
staff were present to implement emergency protocols to handle the situation. As a result, local law enforcement shot the
tiger to free the employee. The tiger subsequently died from the bullet wound.

Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma
or physical harm. To be corrected by February 2/5/2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
