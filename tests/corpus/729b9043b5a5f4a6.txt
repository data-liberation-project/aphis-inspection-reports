3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
***In an enclosure containing nineteen goats and two alpacas, there was an excessive buildup of green debris
covering all interior surfaces of the water receptacle. Additionally, the water was contaminated with bird droppings.
There is no alternate water source in the enclosure.
Animals must be provided with clean, potable water to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain
adequate hydration. Water receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. They must be cleaned
at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
