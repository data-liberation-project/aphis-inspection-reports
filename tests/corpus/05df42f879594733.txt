3.1(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
Several areas of excessive rust or areas that do not allow surfaces to be readily cleaned and/or sanitized were noted
throughout the facility. This included at least 90% of the metal poles in the outside enclosures and at least 10% of the
outdoor enclosure handle locking mechanisms. All concrete flooring throughout the facility is not maintained in a manner
that would allow appropriate cleaning and sanitizing. All outdoor dog shelters have a buildup of dirt, bird excreta and
green organic material on the outside surfaces. The licensee stated he cleans the exterior of these dog houses every 6-12
months. Surfaces with excessive rust and areas that are not impervious to moisture can prevent the area from being
cleaned and sanitized. Having surfaces that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized can lead to disease spread, such
as the current parvo outbreak within the facility, and can also cause structural degradation. Correct by repairing, replacing
or resurfacing all areas that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. Correct by Oct 31st 2021.
3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
In both sheltered housing buildings all hard surfaces were not being appropriately clean and sanitized. The windowsills
had an excessive amount of dust, debris and other organic build up. The structural supports of the primary enclosures
had a thick brown build up. The outside walls of the whelping enclosures had several areas of brown spotting consistent
with fly feces. The heating elements in the whelping building were covered with a thick brown buildup, dead flies and hair.

All interior surfaces of the facility including walls, doors, dividers and other objects had a moderate to heavy buildup of
dirt, debris and other organic material. Proper cleaning and sanitizing practices must be done to prevent odors, insects,
pests, or vermin infestation. Correct by cleaning and sanitizing all interior surfaces as often as necessary to satisfy all
cleaning and sanitization requirements. Correct by Oct 31st, 2021.
3.9(b)

Feeding
The open lip where animals access their food on the self-feeders have caking of feed or other brown matter adhered to
the surface. When the licensee was asked how often these surfaces were being sanitized, he said every 3-4 weeks.
Several food receptacles in the outdoor enclosures were housed in a manner where they would not be protected from the
rain and snow. A couple outdoor feed and water receptables also had an excessive amount of rust and build up of green
or brown material. Food receptables must be located as to minimize contamination by excreta and be protected from rain
and snow. In addition, receptacles need to be cleaned and sanitized every 2 weeks or as often as necessary. Correct by
taking ensuring receptacles are laced in an area that is protected from the rain/snow and ensure cleaning methods are in
place to prevent molding, deterioration and caking of feed on all receptacles. Correct by October 19th, 2021.
3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The overall area in the whelping and small breed building is not being properly cleaned and sanitized to include the areas
under the primary enclosures. The entire length of both washdowns had an excessive amount of green and brown build
up of excreta, mineral deposits, organic material and debris. The entire length of the slotted floor had an excessive
amount of hair, excreta, organic material and debris. This area under enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary
to prevent accumulation of feces, hair and food waste and to reduce disease hazards pests, insects and odors. Correct by
Oct 31st, 2021.

3.11(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
At least 3 of the outdoor enclosures had large areas of overgrown weeds, grasses and/or bushes that were not being
maintained. Having overgrown areas within an enclosure allow nesting areas for unwanted pest and do not allow for
proper cleaning of enclosures. The premises must be free of weeds, brush and in good repair to facilitate husbandry
practices, to reduce pests and to protect the health and well-being of the animals. Correct by Oct 15th, 2021.
