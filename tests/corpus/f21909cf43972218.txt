HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The gravel in a minimum of 4 of the outdoor enclosures was mixed with a brown substance that was soiling the
dogs. There were standing puddles of a yellowish brown liquid. The dogs were wet and soiled and the conditions
are conducive to harboring disease. Gravel floors must be raked or spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure
all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta. Contaminated material must be replaced whenever this
raking and spot-cleaning is not sufficient. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 11/ 8/2015
