ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee performs tail docking and dewclaw removal procedures on Yorkshire terrier puppies within 72 hours
after they are born. A scissors type dog nail trimmer is being used for tail docking and surgical scissors for the
dewclaw removal. The licensee stated he uses hot water with a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit to sanitize
the tools after each use. The procedures are done in the housing facility on a plastic countertop next to the sink.
Clotisol is a blood clotting suspension that is used occasionally by the licensee as an aid to stop bleeding.
The licensee does not have written guidance, training and approval from a qualified veterinarian to perform the
procedures.
Veterinary medical procedures, especially painful procedures involving amputations, must be conducted by
appropriately trained and qualified personnel in a manner that is safe for the animals. If the licensee is going to
perform tail docking and dewclaw removal procedures on the facility puppies, the licensee must seek written
guidance, training and approval from a qualified veterinarian. The guidance should include the surgical procedure,
including age limits and provisions for pre and post-surgical care to ensure that appropriate techniques and
methods are used including infection prevention, use of appropriate instruments, appropriate tissue removal
methods, blood loss control, pain control, and to obtain guidance concerning how to react in the event of a
complication or emergency.
To be corrected this day forward.
