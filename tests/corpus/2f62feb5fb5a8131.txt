FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is not a separate six foot perimeter fence at least three feet away from the enclosure fences for the
non-dangerous exotics on the property. Animals on exhibit on the property requiring the perimeter fence include 8
fennic foxes, 2 coatimundis, 2 bobcats, 2 wallabies, 1 serval, 4 Patagonian cavies, 6 foxes, 1 zebra, 3 Aoudads, and
4 camels. All but the camels and the Aoudads are within the five foot fence and gates surrounding the park. One
side of the camels and Aoudads enclosures is part of the park fence alongside the road which cuts through the
owner's property.
Either a separate six foot fence at least three feet away from the above named animal's enclosure fence would
need to be constructed, or a variance to the perimeter fence requirement obtained.
To be corrected by 11-3-17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
