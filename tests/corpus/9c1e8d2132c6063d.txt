FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the time of this inspection there was no perimeter fence enclosing the outdoor facility housing the camels. The
primary enclosure for the camels must be surrounded by a perimeter fence at least 6 feet high and at least 3 feet in
distance from the enclosure.
A perimeter fence is required for the protection of the animals in the facility by restricting other animals and
unauthorized persons from going through or under it and having contact with the animals in the enclosure. The
fence can also function as a secondary containment system in cases of escape.
