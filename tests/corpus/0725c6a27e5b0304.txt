SANITATION.
The enclosure that contained three of the reindeer had numerous bird nests within the enclosure. Multiple birds
were observed to be perching or flying around within the enclosure. Two of the reindeer in the enclosure were
observed to have bird feces caked all over their backs. The employee working the barn stated that the feces had
been there for some time. Bird feces within the enclosure and on the backs of the reindeer is a disease hazard not
only to the reindeer, but also the employees on site and the general public when these reindeer are on exhibit. An
effective pest control program must be established and maintained to control the birds within the barn. Correct by
4/18/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
