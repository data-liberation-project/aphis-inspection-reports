*Diarrhea was noted under one cage housing a litter of puppies in building number 1. The owner stated that she has
a plan in place to treat all puppies with diarrhea using LS-50. The label of the bottle of LS-50 powder states "for use
in chickens". There were no written directions approved by the attending veterinarian for the off-label use of this
product in dogs and puppies. The veterinarian shall dictate and approve directions for the use of all off label
products including the LS-50 with directions for mixing/concentration and the directions for use (dosage, frequency
of administration, when to contact vet during treatment).

Two pens were noted that did not supply sufficient floor space for the dogs being housed in them in Building 3. The
pens measure 2ft.by 4ft and supply 8 sq ft of floor space. Pen 108 housed two Bichon Frise dogs measuring 20 in in
length from tip of nose to base of tail. They require a total of 9.4 sq ft of floor space. Pen 103 houses three Maltese
each measuring 16 in. in length. They require a total of 10 sq ft of floor space. Adequate floor space is necessary to
allow dogs the freedom to make normal postural and social adjustments. Each dog shall be provided a minimum
amount of floor space in sq. ft. calculated as follows: find the square of the sum of the length of the dog in inches
plus 6 inches and divide by 144.
