3.6(c)(1)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** One 24 inch x 36 inch enclosure housed 3 weaned puppies each measuring approximately 15 inches in length.
The minimum space requirement for each puppy is 3.06 square feet of floor space, for a total of 9.18 square feet.
The enclosure provided 6 square feet of floor space.
*** One 30 inch x 36 inch enclosure housed 3 weaned puppies each measuring approximately 15 inches in length.
The minimum space requirement for each puppy is 3.06 square feet of floor space, for a total of 9.18 square feet.
The enclosure provided 7.5 square feet of floor space.
*** Two 30 inch x 36 inch enclosures each housed 4 weaned puppies each measuring approximately 15 inches in
length. The minimum space requirement for each puppy is 3.06 square feet of floor space, for a total of 12.24
square feet. The enclosures provided 7.5 square feet of floor space.
The lack of space can impact the growth and well-being of weaned puppies and restricts their natural movement
and posturing. The licensee must provide the minimum space required for each adult and or weaned puppy. The
required space is calculated by adding 6 inches to the length of the adult or weaned puppy(from tip of nose to base
of tail in a natural standing position) and multiplying it by itself for the required floor space in square inches. Divide
that total by 144 for the required floor space in square feet. The licensee began to correct the situation at the time of
the inspection.
