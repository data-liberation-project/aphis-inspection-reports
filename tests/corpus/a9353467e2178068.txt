Dental disease can be painful as it causes damage to the gum tissue, teeth, and the bone of the jaw supporting the teeth.


Dental disease can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and affect the overall health of the animal. Thin body
condition can indicate a lack of nutrition as well as result from a variety of medical problems. Eye conditions are painful
and can be a result from problems such as trauma, infection, and conditions such as “cherry eye.”
The facility representative mentioned that they had noticed that the dogs’ needed teeth cleaning, but the veterinarian had
not been contacted and appointments were not scheduled. The licensee stated that she was aware of the other issues
noted above but that none of the dogs had been examined by the veterinarian since September or October of 2020 and
no appointments with the veterinarian were scheduled to address these issues.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Failure to report
health issues when detected can result in a delay in appropriate care and potentially worsening illness/injury or even
death. These animals need to be evaluated by the veterinarian at the earliest opportunity, and the licensee must establish
and maintain a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

Outdoor housing facilities.
***There are 12 dogs being housed in outdoor enclosures. Most of these dogs are small-bodied and six are short-haired.
Additionally, of these dogs, the Chihuahua, "Tot," is in poor body condition. A total of 8 dogs are cited on this report as
having medical conditions requiring veterinary care. According to the National Weather Service, the low temperatures for
the area are projected to fall between 39-43F for the next seven days, with other forecasts projecting that temperatures
will drop below freezing in nine days; daytime highs for the area during the summer months very often exceed 85F.
However, there are no means for heating or cooling the outdoor areas. There is no statement from the attending


veterinarian that specifically approves that these animals are acclimated to the temperature ranges they will encounter in
their outdoor housing situation.
Housing short-haired, small, or sick/infirm animals in outdoor conditions to which they are not equipped or acclimated to
adequately thermoregulate can cause discomfort, illness and even death. The licensee must ensure that dogs that are
not acclimated to the temperatures prevalent to the area or regions where they are maintained, or which cannot tolerate
the prevalent temperatures of the area without stress or discomfort, or animals that are sick or infirm, are not housed
outdoors; if such dogs are kept in outdoor facilities, the details must be specifically approved by the attending veterinarian.

Primary enclosures.
There is an enclosure containing three, 8-week old standard schnauzer puppies (1 male, 2 female) which provides a total
of 1,104 square inches of floor area. The animals housed in this enclosure require a total minimum floor space of 1,432
square inches.
Overcrowding prevents animals from moving freely and getting adequate exercise, causes stress, can lead to
incompatibility, and encourages soiling of the animals as well as the spread of disease and illness. Each dog housed in a
primary enclosure shall be provided at least the minimum amount of floor space according to their measurements and
calculated as described in the regulations.

Veterinary care for dogs.
At the time of inspection, there is an incomplete Program of Veterinary Care in place. The information on the form does
not include details as requested for parasite testing and treatment or other preventative care, as required by the Animal


Welfare Regulations.
A written program of veterinary care is required to ensure that there is an expectation about the care provided to all of the
dogs. Failure to establish and maintain a written program of veterinary care can decrease the ability to ensure optimal
care of the animals. A written program of veterinary care must be established and maintained so that the licensee has a
plan for providing adequate preventative care and treatments as necessary, to include: Regularly scheduled visits (not
less than every 12 months) by the veterinarian to all premises where animals are kept to assess and ensure the adequacy
of veterinary care and other aspects of animal care and use; a complete physical examination from head to tail of each
dog by the attending veterinarian not less than once every 12 months; vaccinations for contagious and/or deadly diseases
of dogs (including rabies, parvovirus and distemper) and sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests (including
fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia and heartworm) in accordance with a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian; and
preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy
eyes, ears, skin, and teeth.

Primary enclosures.
***There is one enclosure containing two juvenile rabbits that provides a total of 2.33 square feet of floor area (including
the area unavailable due to the feeder). The animals in this cage require a minimum of 1.5 square feet each (3.0 square
feet total), not including space occupied by food and water receptacles.
***There is one enclosure containing two adult rabbits that provides a total of 3.4 square feet of floor area (including the
area unavailable due to the feeder). The animals in this cage require a minimum of 3.0 square feet each (6.0 square feet
total), not including the space occupied by food and water receptacles.
Overcrowding prevents animals from moving freely and getting adequate exercise, causes stress, can lead to


incompatibility, and encourages the spread of disease and illness. Each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be
provided the minimum amount of floor space according to their body weight (as listed in the regulations), exclusive of the
space taken up by food and water receptacles.
