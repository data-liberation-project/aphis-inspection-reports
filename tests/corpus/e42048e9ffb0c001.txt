2.32(c)(4)
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Section 2.32(c)(4) Personnel qualifications: The two handling incidents involving hamsters did not get reported to
the IACUC in a timely manner. Facility personnel involved were not aware that these types of deficiencies in animal
care required reporting to the facility IACUC. The facility IACUC provided new written guidance for facility personnel
regarding incidents that must be reported to the IACUC. This was issued to all facility investigators, and posted in
the animal facility and on the website for the IACUC. There have been no further incidents of unreported
deficiencies in animal care to the facility IACUC.
Training and instructions of personnel must include methods whereby deficiencies in animal care and treatment are
reported, including deficiencies in animal care and treatment reported by any employee of the facility. Corrected by
the facility prior to this inspection.
2.33(b)(5)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Section 2.33(b)(5) Veterinary care: There were no completed surgical records, including administration of the
anesthesia dosages given to gerbils on a terminal procedure for protocol 194. Current established veterinary
medical and nursing procedures include documentation of the drugs given and procedures performed on animals.
This information is also necessary for the attending veterinarian to provide adequate veterinary oversight and to
ensure protocols are being followed as approved by the IACUC. Correct by documenting the procedures performed
on animals and the administration of drugs to animals. Correct from this day forward.
2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
Section 2.38(f)(1) Handling: There were two handling incidents each involving one hamster.1) One hamster was improperly euthanized using CO2. On April 23, 2015 the hamster was exposed to CO2 for
euthanasia and then placed inside a plastic bag and into the facility freezer. The hamster was later found dead
outside the bag and the bag had evidence that the hamster had escaped the bag suggesting that the hamster was
alive when it was placed into the freezer. Freezing is not considered an appropriate method for euthanasia and
causes unnecessary discomfort. The facility identified this incident and the person involved was retrained in the
procedure of CO2 euthanasia and determination of death. The facility also purchased a commercial euthanasia
chamber, wrote a new standard operating procedure for its use and trained the applicable personnel in its use.
There have been no further incidents in the failure of CO2 to euthanize the animal.
2) One hamster was left without food or water for approximately 36 hours. A student investigator removed this
animal from its enclosure for use on a protocol. The hamster was subsequently left in its testing enclosure instead
of being returned to its home enclosure after the test was completed. This resulted in the hamster being without
food or water for about 36 hours which would have caused the animal unnecessary discomfort. The hamster was
discovered by facility personnel on March 2, 2015; was immediately given water and food; and survived. The
person involved was retrained and is not currently working with animals. There have been no further incidents of
animals left in enclosures without food and water.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavior stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Corrected by
the facility prior to this inspection.
This inspection was conducted on February 3-4, 2016. An exit briefing was conducted with the facility manager of
research integrity.
