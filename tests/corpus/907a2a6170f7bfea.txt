ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:05 on
30-Jul-20.
Upon arrival at the facility, I called Mr. Martin's number and left a message, then lightly honked the horn. I then
spoke from a distance with a family representative who conveyed that Mr. Martin was out of town. Mr. Martin and I
then spoke on the phone, at which time he confirmed he was out of town and conveyed his preference not to have
another family representative accompany me on an inspection on that particular day.
