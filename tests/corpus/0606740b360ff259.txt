2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility does not have a written program of veterinary care (PVC). Lack of a written PVC does not ensure that the
facility understands the expectations of the attending veterinarian regarding the veterinary care of all regulated animals.
The facility must develop a written PVC. Correct by November 30, 2022.

Watering.
The automatic water receptacle in the bison enclosure was not clean. Moss like plants were growing on the sides and
into the center of the drinking basin. There was other organic debris such as leaves and dirt floating in the water basin.
The facility representative worked to clean the water receptacle and had to use a stick to dislodge an accumulation of
debris so the water could be drained. Dirty water receptacles can make water unpleasant to drink and can harbor disease
producing organisms if not maintained. The facility must ensure that all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Facility Representatives.
