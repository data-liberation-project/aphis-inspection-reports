2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 7-year old male Pomeranian ("DeeCee's One Tough") had abnormal behavior during the inspection. He had a
left head tilt (leaning his left ear towards the floor) and was walking in circles. When he walked, his gait seemed stiff
or unstable. The owner said that this dog has done this off and on since they acquired him but most of the time he
acts normal. The abnormal behavior in this dog has not been reported to the Attending Veterinarian. Abnormal
behavior such as a head tilt, walking in circles, and an abnormal gait can suggest a possible health problem. To
ensure that this dog is not in pain and does not have a sickness that could spread to other dogs, this dog must be
evaluated by the Attending Veterinarian. Promptly report any abnormal behaviors or health problems observed in
dogs to the Attending Veterinarian so that the affected animal can be evaluated and treated.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
