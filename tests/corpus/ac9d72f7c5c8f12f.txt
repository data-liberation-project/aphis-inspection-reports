ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Timely and accurate information regarding the health status of a marmoset was not conveyed to the attending
veterinarian by facility staff. A female marmoset being treated at the facility showed significant signs of decline on
January 13, 2014 but this information was not conveyed to the veterinarian until the following morning at 8:26 by
email. The veterinarian responded by email at 4:37 p.m. with questions and treatment advice. Daily observation
records for January 14 stated that the animal had declined even further during the course of the day on the 14th, but
this information was not conveyed to the veterinarian until 5:03 that evening by email. There was no return email
that evening by the veterinarian. A staff member made an appointment for the animal on the 14th for January 15.
The animal died on the way to the clinic on the 15th. A gross necropsy revealed pancreatic nodules consistent with
pancreatic cancer.
Communication with the veterinarian should be timely and appropriate to the animal's circumstances. Email
correspondence may not result in timely communication between parties, as evidenced by the email strings
regarding the above animal. The facility should ensure that health issues are conveyed to the attending veterinarian
promptly in order to facilitate the appropriate treatment of illness or injury and avoid unnecessary suffering by the
animals.
This non-compliant item was corrected by the facility immediately after the above incident.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
