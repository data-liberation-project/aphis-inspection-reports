ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a female Shihtzu 'Jessie' (#95) that has been seen by the attending veterinarian on March 20, 2015 with
directions of treatment to be given 'artificial tears' twice a day, however as of the date of this inspection the
treatment has not been given, and the eye still needs to be attended to. There is another female #158 that has been
on intermittent treatment for an ulcer on her left eye. The attending veterinarian wrote down the treatment to be
given, however the licensee has been inconsistent with the treatments. The licensee is currently treating this animal
and has been for the past 4 days, however had forgotten this mornings treatment.
It is imperative that all treatments prescribed by the veterinarian are carried out completely and for the duration of
time that is required to cure the condition. If only partial treatments are carried out, or if the treatments are not
treated with the correct dosage and for the right time, a treatable condition could become chronic or even fatal if left
unresolved. This would put the animals under unnecessary pain and discomfort.
The licensee must follow the attending veterinarians directions exactly as prescribed with the right medicines,
dosages and time of treatment in order to assure proper veterinary care.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Currently the outside runs for the regulated animals are made of unsealed cement. The kennel is new and has just
had the animals introduced, however the cement outside still needs to be sealed in order to provide a surface that
can be cleaned and sanitized.
Unsealed cement can hold grime and bacteria that absorbs into the surface that comes in direct contact with the
dogs, which can provide a vector for disease or illness. Unsealed cement can not be sanitized or cleaned properly.
The licensee must seal the cement in the outdoor runs in order to properly sanitize and clean the surfaces coming incontact with the regulated animals.
