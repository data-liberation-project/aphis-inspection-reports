***** The diet outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care does not adequately address the nutrition needs of the
resident animals. The PVC states they feed (cid:28)approximately 2 (cid:19) 3% of the animal(cid:25)s body weight(cid:29) then goes on to
state (cid:28)lions, tigers, cougars, and leopards are fed 8 (cid:19) 15 lbs. a day.(cid:29) There is a large difference in weight between
healthy adult lions and tigers and healthy adult cougars and leopards. Cougars and leopards fed 8 (cid:19) 15 lbs. of meat
a day are being fed well over 3% of their body weight. Animals receiving this much food should be in better body
condition than the cougar currently at the facility. The PVC states they are currently feeding (cid:28)whole prey diet(cid:29) with
bone but does not explain how they determine the meat on the bones is actually 8 (cid:19) 15 lbs. of meat. The PVC state
(cid:28)Oasis vitamins with extra taurine is given when determined a supplement is necessary(cid:29). They do not explain how
they determine a supplement is needed. The PVC states (cid:28)when whole prey diet is not being utilized we feed a
commercially prepared zoo diet(cid:29). They do not explain when or why a whole prey diet might not be used nor do they
identify which prepared diet they use. There was no prepared diet on site at the time of this inspection.
The licensee is responsible for providing adequate veterinary care from a veterinarian experienced with the species
who can oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care. The current diet outlined in the PVC does not
adequately address the age, species, or condition of the animals being fed at the facility. The poor body condition
of the following animals confirms the inadequacy of the diets:
1.(cid:9)A male cougar named Boudreaux.
2.(cid:9)Boo-Boo a female lioness housed with Batman and one other female lion.
3.(cid:9)A male tiger housed with 1 other tiger in the pen on the north side of the pen in which the tiger Samson is located.
.
4.(cid:9)Samson a male tiger.
The licensee needs to find a veterinarian experienced with the different species housed at the facility and get all
animals onto an adequate diet.2.40(x) DIRECT REPEAT

***** According to clinical notes provided by the attending veterinarian, (cid:28)Batman(cid:29), an 11 year old male lion was
anesthetized on Aug 10, 2014. According to the clinical notes his left eye was examined. This animal has had a
problem with his right eye since March of this year. I suspect the veterinarian meant to write (cid:28)right(cid:29) eye in her
clinical notes. The notes indicate no abnormalities were identified with the affected eye. The AV flushed the eye,
applied topical antibiotic ointment, and recommended monitoring for (cid:28)erythema and color to the discharge(cid:29). The
clinical notes also indicate the AV suspects a clogged nasal lacrimal duct may be the cause for the squinty eye
however she did not have equipment with her to check the nasal lacrimal duct during the anesthesia. Anesthesia in
old, ill, large cats can be difficult and risky for the animals. Because of this difficulty the veterinarian should have
been thoroughly prepared to evaluate all problems with this animal while it was anesthetized.
The clinical notes also state (cid:28)ataxic in rear(cid:29) however there is nothing in the notes or the laboratory tests to indicate
how or if the ataxia was evaluated.
The licensee is required to have an adequate program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. As of August 11th this animal continues to
have a squinty eye with the third eyelid protruding across half of the eye. This indicates some type of continued
irritation with the eye and nothing has been done to evaluate the documented ataxia therefore appropriate methods
to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries have not occurred.
The licensee needs to obtain adequate veterinary care for the resident animals.
This was a focused inspection to address the Direct, Repeat NCI regarding Adequate Veterinary Care cited on Aug
5, 2014. This report also addresses the diet portion of the Program of Veterinary Care received from the attending
veterinarian on Aug 14, 2014.
This inspection was conducted by APHIS, USDA, ANIMAL CARE PERSONNEL and the Director on 8/11/14.
The exit interview was conducted by APHIS, USDA, ANIMAL CARE PERSONNEL with the Vice President of the
Inc. on 8/18/14.
