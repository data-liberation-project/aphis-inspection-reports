2.33(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
There was an incident identified by the number 2015-11 which took place during the month of December 2015.
The attending veterinarian (AV) inspected a rabbit for a post surgical procedure in which the skin edges were not
apposed. The attending veterinarian gave specific written instructions to treat it as an open wound and let it heal by
2nd intention.
Research personnel decided to anesthetize the animal, debride the wound, and close the open wound without
consulting the AV.
The next day the rabbit was found dead and there was no peri-operative monitoring documentation indicating that
the rabbit had recovered from anesthesia.
Each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include guidance to
research personnel involved in the care and use of animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia,
analgesia, tranquilization, and euthanasia, etc.
The facility has corrected this issue by providing operative and recovery documentation training and provided a
copy of the IACUC policy for veterinary medical care and best practices.
3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some plastic toys/objects provided to NHP for enrichment were noticeable worn and with chewed edges.
The surfaces of housing facilities--including furniture-type fixtures or objects within the facility-must be made of
materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn.
In order to avoid animals from ingesting plastic particles and to properly clean and sanitize toys/object, these should
be replaced when worn.
To be corrected by 6-30-2016.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
