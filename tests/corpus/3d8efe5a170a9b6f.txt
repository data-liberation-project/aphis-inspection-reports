2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC continuing reviews of activities involving animals. The active protocol 00-002 was not reviewed at the last
two semiannual facility inspections/IACUC meetings and the previous modification approval date on the protocol
was September 2013. There was no additional documentation indicating the annual review was completed by the
IACUC.
One review of the protocol shall be done to record ongoing updates and other modifications that may be necessary
for the completion of the study. Facility shall ensure that reviews are appropriately done as determined by the
IACUC, but not less than annually. Adequate IACUC review of animal use is necessary to ensure that activities
involving animals are being conducted in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. The IACUC should make certain
that all activities relating to the care and use of animals receive adequate oversight.
Correct from this day forward.
2.31(e)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC (Institutional Care and Use Committee) approved protocol (00-002) utilizing a regulated species did not
identify the approximate number of animals to be used in the study. The IACUC should ensure that a proposal to
conduct activities involving animals includes the appropriate information prior to approving the proposal. The
approximate number of animals the study proposes to use during a specific time period is important for the IACUC
to assess and approve. Additionally, any significant changes (such as the total number of animals used) to activities
should have IACUC approval prior to their implementation.
IACUC oversight is intended to ensure that the facility is in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. Inadequate
program oversight may be detrimental to the welfare of the animals used in the program.
