3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
Program of Veterinary Care presented at time of inspection did not mention the sampling and treatment of parasites
(including fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia and heartworm) nor did it include a schedule for the sampling. The Program of
Veterinary Care did not mention any schedule of when preventative care and treatment (including eyes, ears, skin, teeth,
hair coat and nails) would occur.

An appropriate Program of Veterinary Care must include sampling for parasites and preventative care to ensure the
health and well-being of the dogs.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that includes the plan for the routine sampling
of heartworm, intestinal parasites and ectoparasites. It must also include a schedule for preventative care. The licensee
must add to have the dogs sampled for parasites and a schedule for preventative care to the Program of Veterinary Care
for Dogs.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class A license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
licensee.
