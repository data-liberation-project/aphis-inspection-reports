Housing facilities, general.
There are two outdoor enclosures housing two wolf hybrids in each that have multiple areas that are dug up exposing the
underlying fencing. Several of the holes are 1 to 1.5 feet in depth either beneath the exposed fencing on the ground, or
holes beside the edges of exposed fencing. The holes provide a possible source of injury if the feet of the animals drop
into the holes, or through the fencing into the holes. The hybrids are continually running around and jumping over these
areas as they are near their water source and along their pacing routes. There is a 1ft x 1ft hole under the fence inside the
lockout area in the first enclosure on the right with with black wolf hybrid in it. If accessed this would allow for one of the
hybrids to enter the secondary lockout area. The front gate has a 1ft x 1ft hole in the bottom of the gate door of the
perimeter fence where the wire has been bent up away from the framing, with a piece of wire used in a repair attempt.
This hole could provide an area for an animal to gain entry or exit from the primary enclosure areas within the perimeter
fence.

The wooden dog house in the primary enclosure with the black hybrid has been damaged. The house is partially
collapsed in a hole with multiple wooden sides with holes chewed in them and chewed boards on the upper platform area.
There several chewed sides and boards on the platform located in the enclosure with the two gray hybrids.


Exposed fencing and holes in the ground can be a source of possible injury. If the regulated animals are running and trip
into the holes or drop a leg through the fence into the holes beneath there is an increased risk of breaking a leg.
The broken down dog house and holes chewed in the platforms and sides of the shelters can be a source of possible
injury causing splinters in their mouths, and the instability of damaged shelters and platforms the animals climb on or into
for shelter.

All holes should be filled and exposed fencing covered. All wooden shelters and structures should be repaired or replaced
when worn, soiled or damaged.

Watering
The water bucket in the primary enclosure with the two gray hybrids had an accumulation of dark green/black algae along
the sides and bottom of the steel water bucket. The other two steel buckets had dirty brown water brown in them. While
the licensee replaced the chewed plastic buckets with steel ones, the regular cleaning of the buckets is not done often
enough to prevent the buildup of algae and dirty water. The black plastic tubs (2ft x 3ft) were filled with brown/dirty with
water used for bathing and/or drinking and have a chewed rims around all three tubs, which does not allow for them to be
properly sanitized.

Algae can be a possible source of illness if the regulated animals can not get access to a fresh clean water source. The
chewed plastic cannot be sanitized and can be a source of bacteria and possible health issues.

All water sources must be clean and free of debris, algae and contamination. All chewed plastic water tubs should be
repaired or replaced as they become chewed and damaged.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The area between the three primary enclosures and the perimeter fence have become overgrown with grasses, weeds
and small trees, some over 5 ft tall. The bottom of the fences of the primary enclosures and perimeter fence are unable to
be seen for possible holes that could facilitate entry or escape of other animals or the hybrids.

The overgrowth of vegetation can provide a home for vermin/pests to be in close contact with the regulated animals and
cause possible safety or health issues. The inability to see the bottom of the perimeter and enclosure fencing could hide
an exit/entry hole in the fences that could provide escape or entry of other animals.

All weeds/grasses/trees should be trimmed and maintained within the enclosures and in the area between the primary
enclosure fence and perimeter fencing.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
