3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
One Patagonian cavy escaped its primary enclosure fencing in spring/early Summer 2020. The facility made attempts to
locate the exit used in the fencing and to recapture the cavy. The cavy continued to come and go from the enclosure for
several months. Rock was added to close any gaps in the fencing and gate areas where it was suspected the cavy was
escaping through. The added rock appeared to effectively close the escape route; however, the cavy was not recaptured.
After several months of coming and going from the primary enclosure, the cavy was later inside the petting zoo area
fencing but left prior to recapture. Later, the cavy was found inside the perimeter fence, but outside of any enclosure, with
injuries and taken to the vet, but due to the injuries was euthanized.

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. All enclosures must safely contain the animals and to protect them from
injury.

Correct by ensuring that all enclosures are constructed and properly maintained to protect and contain the animals within.
Enclosure corrected prior to time of inspection.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
