HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an accumulation of waste on the ground directly under the drainage system of the outside washdowns.
The drainage system is not located far enough away from the animal area of the housing facility to prevent odors,
diseases, pests, and vermin infestation. Disposal and drainage systems must be properly constructed, installed,
and maintained to minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors and disease hazards.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are three wire mesh dividers (six enclosures affected) with broken wires and sharp points protruding into the
enclosures. Having sharp points can injure the animals within the enclosures. Licensee must ensure that all
enclosures are kept in good repair and free of all sharp points.

3.6(a) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The fourth bottom outside enclosure on the pasture side of the kennel has a small gap in the wire mesh on the floor.
Two enclosures are affected however; only one enclosure contains dogs. In addition, there are two mesh dividers
that are missing wires leaving openings large enough for the animals to stick their nose and limbs through the holes.
Enclosures that are not structurally sound or kept in good repair expose the dogs to potential injury or escape.
Licensee must ensure that all enclosures are designed and constructed of suitable material so that they are
structurally sound and kept in good repair.Correct By: Remains Uncorrected
3.11(b) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Six doggy doors have a moderate buildup of brown material, dirt, feces and other organic matter. When surfaces
are not properly cleaned and sanitized, pathogens can be harbored, promoting the spread of disease. All surfaces
in the primary enclosure must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt,
debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
