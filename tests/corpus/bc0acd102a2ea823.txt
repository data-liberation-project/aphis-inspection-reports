2.38(f)(1) Critical Repeat

Miscellaneous.
A male macaque sustained a right arm fracture on 9/23/2021 while being handled for observations and weighing. An
improper step in handling was found to be the cause of the incident and personnel was re-trained. Preventable fractures
are a physical harm and cause unnecessary discomfort to the involved animal. Ensure that handling of each animal is
done in a manner that is as careful as possible and in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical
harm or unnecessary discomfort.

Note: The facility found this incident was promptly noticed and reported to the clinical veterinarians for treatment, the
affected animal was treated and recovered, and the facility took appropriate steps to determine the cause and prevent
further occurrences.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
