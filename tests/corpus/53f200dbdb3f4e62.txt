ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Sec. 2.40 Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors) (b) Each dealer or exhibitor
shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include: (2).
* An approximate nine year old female, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, " Raven" with number 0A01784917 has a
dry appearance to the surface of her eyes. Both eyes also have pigment and a rough surface on the surfaces. The
whites of the eyes are red. There is a dried dark discharge around the eyelids of both eyes and mucus on the
surfaces of the eyes. The mucus on the right eye of the dog was green. Eye problems can be caused by a variety of
problems and can be painful.
There is Rugby Artificial Tears Ointment prescribed by the attending veterinarian to treat the eyes. Due to the
ongoing condition of the eyes, the licensee must have this dog reevaluated by the veterinarian for additional
veterinary care and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided
to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all
times.
* An approximate nine year old tri-colored, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, (cid:28)Mandy(cid:29) with number 093093000 has an
excessive clear fluid discharge from both eyes. The centers of both eyes, the (cornea), are bluish white. Eye
problems can be caused by a variety of problems and can be painful.
(cid:28)Mandy(cid:29) has an accumulation of brown material completely coating and obscuring the " cheek teeth " (premolars)
and molars and the canine teeth. The gums have receded away from the canine teeth and some of the molars.
There is a white, creamy discharge along the upper gum line. Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue
and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall
health of the animal.
* An one year old male, Wheaton Terrier, (cid:28)Patrick(cid:29) with number 4C2C4DoC36 has an open wound on his left back
leg. The wound is approximately one inch in diameter. This wound is red to pink in color with a moist creamy
substance. Also, there is a wound on top of the cranium (head). This wound is reddish brown in color and moist. The wound is approximately ½ inch in diameter. Although the owner is treating the wounds with iodine, there was
no communication with a licensed veterinarian about this dog. Open wounds can be painful and become infected
and can affect the overall health of the dog.
* An approximate six year old black and tan, Miniature Pincher male with microchip number 4A2D017F29 had a
raised lesion between digits three and four. This lesion was approximately 0.25 inches wide by .75 inches long. The
raised wound was moist and pink. Wounds can occur as the result of injury, illness, or other medical conditions that
could be painful.
* An eight year old male, Wheaton Terrier, (cid:28)Luther(cid:29) with number 483451B2821 has an accumulation of brown
material completely coating and obscuring the " cheek teeth" (premolars) and molars that extends about half of the
canine teeth. The gums are swollen and have receded away from the surface of the " cheek teeth " and molars.
There is a white, creamy discharge along the upper gum line. Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue
and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall
health of the animal.
The licensee must have the above mentioned animals examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that
an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all
animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces--(1) General requirements. (i).
* Seven panel dividers in the small dog kennel and two panel dividers in the medium shed kennel are excessively
rusty. The metal surface of the panels is flaking and or corroding away along the bottoms. These rusty surfaces
prevent required cleaning and sanitization. Improper cleaning and sanitization can increase the disease potential for
the 26 adult dogs. The flaking or corrosion can affect the structural strength. A structurally jeopardized panel can
break allowing for the dogs fight between enclosures or escape. These metal dividers must be repaired or
replaced. All surfaces must be free of excessive. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitization and provide a
structurally sound surface.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces--(2) Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
* Two plastic whelping boxes are excessively chewed along the top of the box. There is gray dirt stuck in the
chewed areas. These chewed surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. This can increase the disease
potential for two adult dogs and five puppies. Chewed or worn surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis and
must be repaired or replaced when worn or soiled. Surfaces that can be readily cleaned and sanitized will reduce
the disease hazards for the dogs and puppies.

3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces- (3) Cleaning.
* The inside walls of the two outdoor dog houses, housing seven adult dogs, have excessive brown film on the
surfaces. The concrete flooring for an outdoor enclosure and the outside concrete flooring of the large dog kennel,
both housing 16 adult dogs, has an accumulation of fecal waste and excessive brown film on the surfaces. Six
metal dog doors in the medium dog kennel, affecting 13 adult dogs, have an excessive accumulation of brown to
black film on the surface. This indicates that daily spot-cleaning is not taking place. Without daily spot-cleaning of
enclosure surfaces, the disease potential can increase for the dogs. All surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily. Daily
spot-cleaning will decrease the disease hazards for the dogs.
3.3(e)(1)(2)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Sec. 3.3 Sheltered housing facilities. (e) Surfaces. (1) (ii).
* The outside enclosures attached the large dog kennel with concrete flooring are stained brown from urine and
waste. This indicates that the concrete surface is not impervious to moisture. This does not allow the concrete
surface to be properly cleaned and sanitized. Improper cleaning and sanitization can increase the disease hazards
for the 12 adult dogs. The concrete flooring must be repaired or treated. All shelter housing areas must be
impervious to moisture. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitization decreasing the disease potential for thedogs.

3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Sec. 3.4 Outdoor housing facilities. (c) Construction.
* The outdoor enclosures, housing four adult dogs, have approximately three to six feet long by ¼ inch wide cracks
in the concrete flooring. These large cracks prevent required cleaning and sanitization. The cracks can harbor
waste. The disease potential can be increased as a result of improper cleaning and sanitization. The cracks must
be repaired. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. This will allow for proper cleaning and
sanitization, thus decreasing the disease hazards for the dogs.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sec. 3.11 Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. (a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
* The area underneath the raised enclosures, on the east side of medium kennel, has an accumulation of waste and
dog hair. There is an odor present. This indicates the underneath areas are not being cleaned as often as
necessary. This can increase the disease hazards for the 13 adult dogs; attract insects and pests and cause odors.
The area underneath the east raised enclosures needs to be cleaned more often. More frequent cleaning will
reduce disease hazards for the dogs, insects, pests and odors.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sec. 3.11 Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. (c) Housekeeping for premises.
* Three heat lamps in the whelping, hung over the top of enclosures, have an accumulation of dust and dog hair
dander. The food prep and husbandry area in the whelping building has an open bag of milk replacer, five towelson top of boxes and trash cans, empty dog food bags, plastic bags storing items, syringes, humidifier and excessive
accumulation of brown dust on top of the tables and items stored. This can create a living and breeding area for
rodents and other pests and vermin. This clutter does not protect the health and well-being for the 23 adult and 31
puppies. Premises must be kept clean and free of accumulations of trash, junk and discarded matter. This will help
prevent living and breeding areas for rodents and other pests and vermin. Premises kept clean will protect the
health and well-being of the dogs and puppies.
