3.101(a)(3) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The following areas are in need of repair:

• Holding pools 1 & 2 have numerous areas of peeling paint on the interior walls as well as the vertical gate posts. Mortar
is missing in several areas of both holding pool walls.

• Dry areas 3 & 4 have peeling paint present and part of the mortar is missing in several areas of the walls.

• In Dry area 4, there is a large metal support post that has rusted at the base.

• On the “beach” side of the outdoor exhibit, there is crumbling cement near one of the drains. The sea lions could injure
themselves on the jagged edges of the crumbling edges of cement on this “beach” floor.

• The exterior wall has rust present beneath the rock facade, adjacent to the door leading out to the haul out deck.


Peeling paint and rusted surfaces leave the facility in disrepair. Peeling paint, missing mortar and rusted surfaces cannot
be adequately cleaned and sanitized for the health of the sea lions housed therein.
All surfaces must be constructed of durable, nontoxic materials that facilitate cleaning and disinfection as appropriate,
sufficient to maintain water quality parameters as designated in Section 3.106.

All surfaces must be maintained in good repair as part of a regular, ongoing maintenance program. All facilities must
implement a written protocol on cleaning so that surfaces do not constitute a health hazard to animals.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The bases of the metal, exterior walls of the barn housing goats, pigs, and Jacobs sheep are severely rusted due to
pooling water that accumulates against the walls during rainstorms. Pooling and standing water cause the rusting of the
metal thus leaving the walls structurally unsound and in disrepair. Animals could injure themselves on sharp rusted
edges. Housing facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Wolf building
The three exterior and three interior metal doors of the wolf building have severely rusted bases on each side of the
jambs. These jambs are completely rusted through, leaving the doors in disrepair. One of the interior doors is the
entrance of the room that is used to hold a wolf when necessary. The licensee must ensure that housing facilities are
structurally sound and kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

Facilities, general.
WALK-IN REFRIGERATOR

A portion of the seal beneath the walk-in refrigerator door, is missing and allowing air to enter the refrigerator. This
opening is creating a buildup of ice on the floor just inside of the refrigerator. This damaged seal can affect the efficiency
of the refrigerator. The licensee must ensure that supplies of food and bedding are stored in facilities that adequately
protect against deterioration and molding.

Facilities, general.
BIG CAT BUILDING

There is an approximately 9-inch round hole in the base of the cement drain that exposes the earth below. This same
drain is not flush with the pipe that sends water out of the building. It is several inches below the pipe, causing urine and
other organic materials to pool in the drain. The APHIS official could smell the waste accumulated in the drain. Foul
odors could affect the health and well-being of the jaguars and cougars housed in this building. The facility must
implement a method for the removal of animal and food wastes as to minimize odors and disease hazards.

Facilities, outdoor.

GIRAFFE-ELAND-BONTEBOKS

The APHIS official observed the giraffes standing in the pouring rain on 7-8-21, in front of their closed housing structure,
without access to a shelter to protect them from the inclement weather. Additionally, the elands and bonteboks were also
exposed to the rain and getting wet. The facility must ensure that all animals kept outdoors are provided shelter to afford
them protection and to prevent discomfort during inclement weather.

3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
The APHIS official observed water pooling against the left side of the housing structure for the goats, pigs, and Jacobs
sheep. The water was also pooling across half of these same enclosures, and in the front corners of the exhibit stalls on
the right side of the housing structure. The animals are subject to water encroaching inside the stalls causing the animals
discomfort due to wet bedding. The facility must establish and implement a suitable method to rapidly eliminate excess
water.

3.131(c)

Sanitation.
Tamandua holding-

The bases of the walls inside of the Tamanduas’ housing structure have rotted due to water damage and humidity. This

damage leaves the walls in disrepair and does not allow for adequate cleaning. The licensee must ensure that premises
are kept clean and in good repair to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices for the health of the animals housed
therein.
