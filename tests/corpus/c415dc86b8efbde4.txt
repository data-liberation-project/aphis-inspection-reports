2.31(d)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There is no formal, written notification from the IACUC to the Principal Investigator (PI) outlining the status of a
protocol after formal IACUC review. Without clear, documented communication, determination of a potential start
date of the proposed activity can be difficult. Per this section, the IACUC shall notify principal investigators and the
research facility in writing of its decision to approve or withhold approval of those activities related to the care and
use of animals. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
