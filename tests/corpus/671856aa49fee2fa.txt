INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Procedure records for the three resident rabbits indicated that they had been used to teach nasogastric (NG)
intubation. The facility has an IACUC approved protocol for NG intubation but it was approved for cats. The IACUC
must: Review and approve proposed activities related to the care and use of animals. In this case NG intubation of
Rabbits was not reviewed and approved by the IACUC and alternatives were therefor not addressed that would
possibly led to less pain or distress to the animals. Correct for all procedures and species prior to conducting that
procedure.
An exit interview was conducted with facility Attending Veterinarian.
