**** Two dogloo type dog houses, affecting 4 dogs, tunnels have been chewed back. The amount of damage done
to the tunnel allows the rain, snow, and or wind to impact the dogs while inside and hinder their ability to stay warm.
Dog houses must be maintained to protect the dogs from wind, rain, snow and allow the dog to stay warm when
inclement weather is in the forecast.

and deterioration. Once the food is contaminated its nutritional value, palatability, and wholesome is compromised.
Feeders must be maintained to ensure the food is protected from molding, deterioration and caking.
