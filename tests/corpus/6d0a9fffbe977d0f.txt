ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30am on
06-JUN-19.
An employee of the facility was present at the time of arrival. They stated that the licensee was not present, they
were not sure where the licensee was, and they were not authorized to conduct the inspection. The employee
suggested the licensee might be at site 001. I called the licensee, left a message, and waited 30 minutes before
proceeding to site 001. I received a return call later that day stating that the licensee was not available for
inspection for the remainder of the day.
