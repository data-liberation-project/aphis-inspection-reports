NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
At the previous attempted inspection of the facility dated September 11, 2017, a household member stated that the
licensee and the regulated dogs were no longer at the facility. The inspector called the licensee and left a message
requesting the location of the dogs and the licensee returned the call and left a message confirming that the dogs
were no longer located at the facility.
The inspector then returned the call and left a message requesting the licensee to call back or to call the Field
Office and provide the location of the dogs. An Animal Care Compliance Specialist also attempted to contact the
licensee in order to locate the dogs, but as of the date of this inspection the licensee has failed to provide the
location of the dogs to any Animal Care official.
Failure to provide the location of the animals does not allow for the enforcement of the regulations and standards of
the Animal Welfare Act, therefore, the health, well-being and living conditions of these dogs could suffer.
A licensee shall promptly notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of any change in the name, address,
management, or substantial control or ownership of his business or operation, or of any additional sites, within 10
days of any change.
By December 21, 2017, the licensee must send the change of location to the Regional Director by certified mail.
The inspector left a message on the licensee's cell phone stating that the location(s) of the dogs must be sent to the
Field Office (Regional Director) by December 21, 2017.
