Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During the inspection the inspectors noticed a white Maltese, microchip #019537584. This Maltese is a female named
Snowball that has been recently groomed. She was seen by the veterinarian in October of 2020 for her skin issues, they
believed her to be pregnant so only treated her with Bravecto for four months and then nothing since. She has two sores,
one on each of her front legs on the outside of each on the lower joint. Both sores appear pink in color and wet in
appearance and are approximately the size of a dime. Her tail is almost completely hairless and is also pink with areas
that are slightly darker in color. Both ears near where they connect to her head are missing hair but the right ear is worse.
Snowball has poor dental health. The surface of the upper right canine tooth is almost completely covered in dark brown
material. The check teeth in the upper right are completely covered as well as having a grey material along the gum line.
Her upper left front teeth and canine are almost completely covered in dark brown material. The upper cheek teeth are
completely covered in the dark brown material with a whitish grey material between two teeth. The gum on the left upper
side is reddened and receding away from the teeth.
Skin conditions could lead to pain and discomfort and can lead to other issues. Teeth issues that are not properly taken
care of can lead to pain, stress, illness and other disease. Each licensee must follow an appropriate program of veterinary
care for dogs that includes preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy skin and teeth. This dog must be evaluated

by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan.

Housing facilities, general.
Throughout the facility the inspectors saw several sharp points. In the Adult sheltered building, there are two enclosures
containing approximately 4 dogs that have sharp points at the level of the animals. One of the effected enclosures had a
significant large screw protruding from a piece of wood. The other effected enclosure has sharp points created by wire
woven through the fencing.
The second whelping building had at least three enclosures, containing approximately 5 dogs, with sharp points at the
level of the dogs. The first effected enclosure had the extra wiring from the end of the fence protruding inward. The
second effected enclosure had two nail heads protruding out of the wooden post inward toward the dog run. The third
effected enclosure had two nail heads and the sharp end of a nail protruding into the interior of the sheltered box.
The licensee must ensure that the surfaces of the housing facilities be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might
injure the animals.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In the sheltered facility housing approximately 30 adult dogs the inspectors noticed significant buildup of dirt and grim on
the dog doors that lead from in the shelter to the outside. When asked the licensee about sanitization schedule they said
they wash the doors two to three times a year. Build up of dirt and grim can lead to a build up of bacteria, pests and other
disease hazards. The licensee needs to ensure that any used primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every

two weeks.
