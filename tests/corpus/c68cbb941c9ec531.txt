FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence needs repair where a tree limb has fallen down and pushed down the fence to where it is less than three
foot in height. In addition, the storm brought down a metal shed structure to where the metal might cause injury if
the camels were to rub against it. The enclosure fencing and structures shall be repaired and or removed so that
they do not cause injury or allow escape of the animals. Correct by June 15, 2016.
