2.4
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
The inspector arrived at the kennel at approximately 2:10 pm on Friday, September 23, 2016. Upon arrival at the
facility the inspector notified the employee who was outside feeding the dogs that she was there for a routine
inspection. The employee indicated the owner was not on the premises but he would contact him. The inspector
told the employee she would wait in the outside seating area. As the licensee drove towards the inspector on his
ATV he began yelling and waving his arms in a hostile manner “Get out of here, you are not supposed to be here,
get off my property!” The inspector replied "Excuse me?" and the license yelled they were no longer conducting any
regulated activity. The inspector tried to explain to the licensee the site is still listed as active in the USDA database
and subject to inspection until the Regional Official has been notified to cancel the site. The licensee yelled that "it
is cancelled and you were told that in Fairbanks and you shouldn’t be here!" The inspector explained that had not
been the conversation in Fairbanks and again explained this site was still active. The licensee again yelled at the
inspector in a hostile manner, “You need to leave!” The inspector asked the licensee if he was refusing to have the
inspection and he replied “Yes!” The inspector replied “Okay, you have a good day”, walked back to the car and
left the property. The inspector left the property at approximately 2:20 pm.
Interfering with the inspection process prevents the Secretary from fulfilling his obligation to enforce the Animal
Welfare Act. The licensee shall not interfere with, threaten, abuse (including verbally abuse), or harass any APHIS
official in the course of carrying out his or her duties.
To be corrected from this day forward.
