ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:50 pm on
15-MAR-19.
Upon arrival, I was informed that the licensee was not home. I was able to make contact with licensee via cell
phone and was told that they would not be able to return for the inspection process in a timely manner. New optimal
hours of availability were discussed.
