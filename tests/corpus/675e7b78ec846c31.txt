TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
In the outdoor kennel facility there are four adult Basset Hounds and two litters of weaned Cocker Spaniel puppies
that do not have any form of identification. All class ``A'' dealers (breeders) shall identify all live dogs on the
premises with an approved form of identification at all times. An approved form of identification for all animals is
required to insure accountability.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The kennel facility consists of two outdoor housing areas. On the western side of the outdoor building there are
three wooden doorways that are excessively chewed and worn. The doorways need to be repaired or replaced
and maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of outdoor housing facilities--including houses, dens, etc.--that cannot
be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled to facilitate husbandry pratices, prevent the
spread of disease and protect the animals from injury.
