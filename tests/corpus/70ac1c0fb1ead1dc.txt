Facilities, general.
Item 3.125 a
At the time of inspection it was noticed that the bottom area of metal fencing that separates the two goat exhibits was bent
and bowed inward so that there were sharp broken areas of fencing pointing inward.
Bent areas of fencing are not structurally sound and sharp edges have the potential to injure the animals.
Facility needs to repair/replace the areas so they are structurally sound and cannot injure the animals.

Facilities, outdoor.
Item 3.127 d Perimeter fence
At the time of inspection it was noticed that the perimeter fence for the facility around the bear exhibit has in certain areas
a height of only 6 ft and an additional top rail kick back of about a foot. There are other areas of the perimeter fence that
are in excess of 8 ft in height, as well as the primary enclosure fence for the bear exhibit is about 12 ft in height.
Areas of the perimeter fence under 8 ft in height do not adequately protect the animals from escape or prevent the
entrance of unauthorized persons.


Facility needs to insure all areas of the perimeter fence meet the requirements of 8 ft in height or apply to the USDA for a
variance .
