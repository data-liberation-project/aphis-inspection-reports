ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1425 on
27-Feb-19. I went to the licensee's house. I knocked on the door. No one answered. I honked my car horn and
then called the licensee. I left a message and then waited 30 minutes. No one came home and I received no
phone call back during that time. About a half hour after I left the licensee called me back and informed me he
wasn't currently available to do an inspection. He gave me his optimal hours and I told him someone would be back
to do the inspection on another day.
End of report.
