Primary enclosures.
In January of 2020 ,one adult macaque was found deceased on the first morning room check. The animal was trapped
between the squeeze panel and the front of the enclosure. A facility investigation of the incident revealed that this animal
was pair housed and one of the two animals was able to reach around the protective plate for the latch and disengage it.
This allowed the squeeze panel to move forward, entrapping the animal resulting in it’s death. Corrective action taken by
the facility included instructing caretakers to note any animal able to manipulate the squeeze latch and adding Zip Ties to
prevent latch manipulation by the non human primate. Primary enclosures for non human primates must protect the non
human primate from injury.
CORRECTED AT TIME OF THE INSPECTION

The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the attending veterinarian and facility employees.
