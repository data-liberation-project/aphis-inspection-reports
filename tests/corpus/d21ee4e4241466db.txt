3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a 16 year old black bear that has been moved into a larger enclosure approximately 3/4 acre surrounded
by a 12 ft high diamond mesh primary fence. There is no perimeter fence around 3 sides of the primary enclosure,
except for a one strand electric fence.
A perimeter fence is required around the primary enclosure of all dangerous animals in order to prevent other
animals or people from getting into or having direct contact with the animal through the primary fence. The
additional perimeter fence also provides extra protection to keep the regulated animal in the area if it breaks through
the primary fence of the enclosure.
The licensee must provide an adequate perimeter fence at least 8 ft in height around the primary enclosure, or has
the right to apply for a variance through the USDA/APHIS/AC office.
To be corrected by: November 30, 2016
The licensee advised he will be applying for a variance.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
