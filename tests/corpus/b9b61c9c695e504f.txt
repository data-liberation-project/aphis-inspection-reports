FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The two guinea pigs are being housed outdoors in the bird feed and supply storage area. Guinea pigs may not be
housed outdoors due to their limited acceptable temperature range. Since outdoor temperatures cannot be
regulated, this could affect the well-being and health of the guinea pigs and may result in illness, heat or cold stress
or even death of the animal. The guinea pigs must be moved indoors. This was corrected during the inspection by
the owner.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength.
An equipment gate by the shelter area for the deer, alpaca, and llama has about a one foot gap between the gate
post and gate. A small panel that is about waist-high has been put in the gap to help deter animals but the panel in
place is not secure and the remaining area above waist-height has a gap that the hoof-stock could potentially reach
over. The equipment gate was also loose and was being held to the post by four strings of baling twine. The
enclosure must not contain large gaps and gates must be secure to contain and ensure the safety of the animals
inside of it.

SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures.
*The front third of the camel's enclosure had an excessive buildup of soiled bedding and feces throughout the
concrete floor. When asked the owner stated that it had been cleaned last about one month ago. The water
receptacle is located in the front of the enclosure so the camel must walk through the buildup to access its water.*The Capybara enclosure had an excessive buildup of excreta in the back left corner of the enclosure.
Inadequate cleaning can increase disease hazards, pests and odors. The waste must be removed and a regular
cleaning schedule developed to prevent contamination of the animals and to minimize disease hazards and reduce
odors.
