ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Several dogs had inter digital cysts that had not been observed and no treatment was started. These dogs
included "Holly" id # 045, "Barbi" id # 054, and "Riley" id # 041. Their condition should be conveyed to the AV as
these cysts can be painful and a treatment plan started based on recommendations of the veterinarian.
*** Two dogs had hair loss on the sides of their bodies including "Jewel" id #048, and "Barbi" id # 054. This
condition was observed by the license but not communicated to the veterinarian for further consult and examination.
Daily observation not only includes the observation of health and well being, but the frequent communication to the
vet to assure health care concerns are addressed in a timely manner.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** Upon entering the kennel area, there was a strong ammonia odor in the building and in the whelping boxes when
they were opened. By the end of the inspection, the inspector had a headache from the odor. There is a fan in the
building but there is a concern of running it too much due to drafts and cold temperatures. Nonetheless, ventilation
must be addressed to reduce the strong odors in the building for the health of the dogs.
