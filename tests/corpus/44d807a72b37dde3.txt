The male serval, Sunshine, has an area on its tail that is missing its fur and appears brown and wrinkled. This area
is approximately the last 4 inches of the tail. The cat was noted aggressively chewing on the affected area of the tail
during this inspection. Based on conversation with Attending Veterinarian, no veterinary care has been requested
or provided. Failure to provide adequate veterinary care for injuries can significantly impact the health of the animal.
