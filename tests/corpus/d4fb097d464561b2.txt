2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The existing public barrier on the last row of large cat cages in the front section of the park is approximately 3 feet
high, and approximately 3 feet from the enclosed animals. The low height of this barrier would allow members of
the public to lean over the barrier and make contact with the enclosed large cats (lions/tigers). The licensee must
make this barrier a more effective structure to help ensure that the public cannot physically touch the enclosed
animals. During the inspection, the licensee began the process of welding additional pipes onto the existing barrier.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the indoor portion of the medical building, the north east enclosure housing the baboons has a metal siding
surface. Close to the ground this metal surface has an area of rust which had worn through the surface and created
a hole with sharp edges. This creates a risk of injury from sharp edges for the enclosed animals. The facility must
repair or replace this section, and must maintain metal surfaces throughout the facility to protect the welfare of the
animals.

3.80(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- In the indoor portion of the medical building housing non-human primates there are three large, elevated, wooden
resting platforms in poor condition. The wood on these platforms is chipped, splintered, chewed and in need of
repair. Wood platforms in this condition are a potential source of injury to the enclosed animals and cannot be
properly cleaned and sanitized. The facility must repair or replace these surfaces to help ensure the health of the
animals.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- An enclosure in the front part of tha park containing tigers has a roofed den with four wooden posts holding up the
roof. One wooden post had been scratched and chewed by the tigers to a point where it has decreased to half of its
original diameter. There was another wooden upright pole of this same structure that had been scratched and had
decreased in diameter by approximately 25%. This is a threat of injury to any animals in the enclosure. The
licensee must repair or replace these compromised poles.
- In the front section of the park two of the metal fence poles for the arena enclosure had broken welds and
significant rust present, to a degree that may affect the structural strength of the pole. Licensee welded the broken,
rusted weld on the arena enclosure during the inspection. The other broken weld on the arena needs more
extensive repair. This pole must be straightened and welded to ensure the animals are safely contained and
protected from injury, and to ensure the animals are securely contained.
- In the front section of the park a tiger enclosure had a large natural tree log connecting the tops of two log houses
for the enclosed animals. This large, cut tree could act as a bridge for the enclosed animals. This cut tree had
deteriorated and appeared weak in areas. The structural intergrity of the cut tree exposed the enclosed animals to
risk of injury if it were to break suddenly. This log bridge was cut in the center and secured during the inspection.
- In the rear of the park, a house contained 3 free roaming tiger cubs with no one present to monitor the animals.
One cub was 7 weeks of age and the other two were 12 weeks of age. These unsupervised cubs had free access to
household furniture,appliances, and fixtures which exposed them to a variety of potential injuries. The cubs could
pull or knock items off of the counter tops and other surfaces. These items could fall onto the cubs and possibly
injure the cubs. All animals need a dedicated enclosure which is secure and safe. Licensee needs to maintan the
animals in a safe enclosure to ensure the animals are safely contained and protected from potential injury.
-The fence of the primary enclosures of some of the large cats in the back section of the park is a verticle fence
approximately 10.5 feet high without a kick-in or a top. This fence height is inadequate to sufficiently contain the
enclosed animals at all times. The licensee must modify these enclosures or move the large cats to enclosures that
are constructed of such material that is appropriate for the animals, of such strength that is structurally sound, and
are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and securely contain the animals.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- Two portions of the perimeter fence do not meet requirements. In the back section of the park, an enclosure
housing a cougar is directly against the rear corner of the perimeter fence. All enclosures must be a minimum of
three feet from the actual perimeter fence.
- In the area of the park next to the commissary, a portion of the perimeter fence is approximately 5 feet in height.
The perimeter fence for a facility housing dangerous animals must be a minimum of 8 feet in height.
The licensee must ensure the perimeter fence meets all requirements.
