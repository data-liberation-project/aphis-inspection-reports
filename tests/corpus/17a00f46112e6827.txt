3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) did not have sampling directions for heartworm and for internal parasites. The
treatment plan for internal parasites was incomplete for adults and puppies. Incomplete directions on the PVC can result
in a miscommunication between the attending veterinarian and the licensee resulting in inappropriate care of the animals.
The licensee must have an appropriate and complete Program of Veterinary Care that is developed, documented in
writing, and signed by the attending veterinarian.

This is a 1st Relicense Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
Applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections by February 08, 2022, or the Applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply.

Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
