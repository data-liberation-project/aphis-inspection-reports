3.127(d) Critical Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence in the back southwest corner has been repaired; however, the licensee did not have a plan with
timelines to address the remaining perimeter fence issues at the facility.
The perimeter fence at the facility has numerous issues. A fencing pole on the western side of the facility is rotted at the
base and leaning inward, and pulls the perimeter fence below the 6 foot requirement. Vegetation is also pressing down
on top of the perimeter fence in several areas of the facility, reducing the height below 6 feet. In addition, there is a
portion of the perimeter fence on both the southern and northern sides of the facility that are inaccessible due to heavy
vegetation, and cannot be viewed. Finally, the northwestern corner of the enclosure adjacent to the house does not have
a perimeter fence present. This section extends for approximately 15 feet in length.
Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. A perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the
facility. The perimeter fence must be at least 6 feet in height.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
