2.40(b)(1) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a male longhorn steer named, “Geronimo,” with overgrown, chipped, and curling hooves. The animal often drags
the tips of the hooves on the ground as it walks, and a slight stumble is seen intermittently. The brisket appears to have
decreased volume and loose skin; there are prominent depressions around the tailhead. The backbone and individual
vertebrae are visible, and some muscle depletion is noted through the hindquarters. The facility representative stated that
the veterinarian requested that the facility provide a chute onsite so that work on the longhorn cattle could be facilitated
without the need for anesthesia. At the time of the inspection, there was no chute available for this purpose and no plans
proposed for alternate solutions. Failure to provide the necessary equipment requested by the veterinarian to facilitate
proper care delays the delivery of the care and can contribute to worsening health and wellbeing of the animal.
The licensee must make available any appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services to facilitate proper
veterinary care and hoof trimming. The animal must be evaluated, and the hooves trimmed as deemed appropriate by
the veterinarian.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.


The licensee does not have acquisition records for two black bears and one mountain lion transferred from the City of
Alamogordo on 6/27/2021. Records containing the required information for animals acquired for use in regulated
activities, including those offspring born on premise, are necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their humane
care and use. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition and disposition of all animals that fully
and correctly disclose the required information.

Exercise for dogs.
At the time of inspection, there is no written documentation of an exercise plan approved by the attending veterinarian for
one wolf-hybrid dog. A documented and approved exercise plan helps ensure that dogs' space requirements and
exercise needs have been considered and will be provided. The facility must develop, document, and follow an
appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. In addition, the plan must be approved by the attending
veterinarian. The plan must include written standard procedures to be followed in providing the opportunity for exercise.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
At the time of inspection, there is no written documentation of the environment enhancement plan to promote the
psychological well-being of the three lemurs. The plan, at a minimum, must address social grouping, environmental
enrichment, special considerations, if applicable, and restraint devices and their use. The plan and environmental
enrichment must be approved by the attending veterinarian (AV) and documented when provided to the animals on the
environmental enhancement plan. Nonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs that need to be
addressed when in captivity. A written plan that is directed by the AV, guided by current professional standards, and


available for review by APHIS officials is required to ensure that the psychological well-being of these animals is being
appropriately addressed. Licensee must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environmental
enhancement of nonhuman primates that is in accordance with currently accepted professional standards and as directed
by the AV.

3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
CRITICAL: On Thursday, 07/08/2021, the Curator of the facility sent an email regarding an escape incident involving a
female black bear named, “Winnie,” that was being held there temporarily for the City of Alamogordo. This occurred the
day prior at approximately 3:00pm. The bear escaped by pulling aside a layer of chain link material on the roof of the
enclosure, resulting in an opening large enough for her to exit onto the top of the enclosure, where the bear was spotted
by keeper staff. A team consisting of zoo staff, the veterinarian and members of the New Mexico Game and Fish
Department carried out the full sedation and movement of the bear down from the top of the enclosure. The veterinarian
examined the bear and the bear was secured into holding by 4:05pm. New enclosure modifications to include metal
reinforcement and an electric hot wire that is tested daily were in place at the time of inspection. The former design and
construction of the enclosure was inadequate to contain the bear, which could have resulted in harm to the animal, other
animals or even people. Corrected before time of inspection.

CRITICAL: One beaver named “Timber,” escaped from its primary enclosure after 4:00pm on 10/10/2020. The morning
of 10/11/2020 the keeper noticed the beaver was missing. Two weeks prior to the incident the beaver arrived at the
facility and was being temporarily housed in the old crane exhibit while the permanent exhibit was being completed. The
temporary crane exhibit did not have dig barriers in place and the escaped beaver dug under two chain link fences and


one picket fence. Members of the public did report seeing a beaver along the nearby river. The zoo staff responded to all
sightings; however, the exact location of the beaver was not known, and the facility has been unable to recover the
animal. The other beaver in the enclosure was moved to another location that prevents digging. Animals escaping from
primary enclosures are more vulnerable to harm from surrounding predatory animals and further injury when they are not
safely contained. Corrected before time of inspection.

NON-CRITICAL: On the rear side of the elk and deer holding area, there is an ~15’ section of chain link fencing that is
loose and curled upward and inward, creating an ~8-10” gap underneath and causing the fencing material to protrude into
the interior of that holding enclosure by several inches. Loose and protruding wire and gaps in fences pose a trip and/or
entrapment hazard for the animals.
Housing facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved; they
must be sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
