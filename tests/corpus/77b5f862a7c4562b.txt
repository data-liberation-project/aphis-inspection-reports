Cage space requirements ensure that the dogs have enough room to move about freely within their cages. It also
minimizes the dogs from stepping or sitting in their feces or urine and also minimizes the spread of disease. The
licensee must ensure that all cages containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet the minimum
floor space requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that cage. Correct immediately.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Approximately ten outdoor enclosures had an excessive amount of feces in the pens. The enclosures were free ofsnow and ice. The feces could have been easily removed and the enclosures could have been easily cleaned and
disinfected. It was evident that the the amount of feces that had accumulated was from at least a few days worth.
The excessive amount of feces in the enclosures made it difficult for the dogs to walk in their outdoor enclosures
without getting fecal matter on their paws. The buildup of excreta in the enclosures can contribute to the spread of
disease. Excreta must be removed from the primary enclosures on a daily basis. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
