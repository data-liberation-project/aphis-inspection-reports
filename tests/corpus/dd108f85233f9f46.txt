2.131(b)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*During observation of the moving of the llamas and alpacas from their pens to the auction ring on Thursday 5/7/15
it was noted that several of the llamas became stressed and agitated. They were noted spinning around and
jumping about in their pen instead of calmly moving out of the pen. One adult male employee dressed in a brown T
shirt was noted lifting his right leg completely off the ground and kicking one of the llamas repeatedly in the right
side and ventral abdomen and yelling at it. Other llamas also received kicks to speed along their movement.
*Also during observation of the moving of the llamas and alpacas for auction, one young boy in a blue and white
checkered woven shirt was noted carrying a white plastic guide pole. Randomly every now and then he was noted
jabbing a llama or alpaca through the enclosure bars with the pole. He and a couple of other boys then came up to
a llama in the aisle. He hit the llama on the head with the pole and then when the llama tried to run away he chased
it hitting it on its back and rump with the pole.
Kicking, jabbing and hitting of animals results in behavioral stress, discomfort and possible injury to the animals. All
animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. Correct from this day forward.
2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
One young dromedary camel was housed in an enclosure in the arena barn near the snackbar where young
animals are typically housed for auction attendees to view. During a ten minute span of observation by the inspector
on Friday 5/8/15, every person/member of the public who walked by the camel stopped and petted it. One young
man even lifted up a Mayfield container of ice cream and let the camel lick the container. No readily identifiable
employee was noted in the vicinity. No employee came to tell the young man to remove the ice cream container
from the camel(cid:25)s reach. The licensee must provide readily identifiable, responsible and knowledgeable attendants
during all periods of public contact to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals. Failure to provide this
oversight during public contact may lead to injury to the animals or the public. Correct from this day forward. 3.127(a) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Numerous outdoor pens/enclosures have been added to the area in back of the covered pens/enclosures. These
pens are open to the elements with no sides or overhead protection from direct sunlight. During the inspection,
these pens contained large hoofstock including bison, water buffalo, exotic cattle and watusi. The high temperatures
during the day ranged from 87 to 90 Degrees F. The temperatures measured by Kestrel measured from 87 to 91.
Some of the animals were noted in the same pen on both Thursday and Friday. On Friday one very young brown
exotic bovine calf (#4038) was noted with rapid respiration. It tried to find some shade where the bars created
striped shadows. The calf(cid:25)'s respiratory rate was 122 breaths per minute in the early afternoon. The attending
veterinarian was asked and also considered this rate above normal. Elevated respiratory rates can be an indication
of early heat stress. When sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort, sufficient shade shall be provided to
protect the live animals from the direct rays of the sun. Correct from this day forward.
3.128 DIRECT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Several pens in the arena barn were noted containing so many sheep that the sheep could not turn around freely or
lie down without being trampled by the other sheep. For example, one 3.75ftx4ft pens contained 5 adult sheep.
Another pen approximately 6ftx10ft contained 21 sheep. One sheep was noted lying down in the very back of the
pen underneath the others and was getting stepped on. Some of the sheep had long thick coats and were noted
breathing heavier and fasting that the short haired ones. Overcrowding can lead to stress, discomfort, injury and
overheating. Enclosures/pens used to house animals shall be large enough to ensure that each animal contained
therein has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make normal postural adjustments (stand, sit and lie down).
Correct from this day forward.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The arena barn has sheets of insulation covering the walls and ceiling. Some areas are covered by plastic but in
others the plastic has been ripped and loose insulation is visible and falling down into the pens. Freshly fallen
insulation was noted in some enclosures housing goats and pigs. In addition, one pen housing two goats had a
piece of wood forming the back wall moved to the side and a large segment of exposed insulation was present at
goat height on the back wall. Insulation can be an irritant and may cause problems if ingested. The exposed
insulation needs to be removed or covered to prevent the insulation from coming in contact with or in reach of the
animals. Correct by Sept. 1, 2015.
Inspection conducted over two days 5/7/15-5/8/15. Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
