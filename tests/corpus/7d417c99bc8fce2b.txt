Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
In the goat, sheep and alpaca enclosure, there is a tan and white female goat with severely overgrown hooves. All of the
hooves are curling upward and causing the goat to stand and walk in an abnormal position. Failure to properly maintain
hoof care can result in abnormal growth of the hoof and cause additional disease conditions which can be painful to the
animal. Correct by trimming the goat's hooves in accordance with appropriate methods and frequencies recommended by
your attending veterinarian.

Facilities, general.
The enclosure on the Nature Trail containing twelve goats has two areas in need of maintenance. The corner of the fence
closest to the feed storage area has a large gap between the top bar and the chain link fence which is approximately 4
inches by 8 feet in size. At this corner, there is also an accumulation of bedding that is approximately 2 to 3 feet high
which allows the animals to easily reach over the top of the fence. In the same enclosure, one of the sliding doors,
attached to the larger shelter, has partially slide off the track and is hanging by one set of wheels. Failure to maintain
enclosures can allow for gaps or unstable structures which can result in injury, entrapment, or escape of the animals.


Facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them.
