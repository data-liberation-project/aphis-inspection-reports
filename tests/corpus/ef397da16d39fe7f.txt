***The outdoor enclosures containing 22 adult dogs, have no shade other than the shelter structure. Shade provides
comfort for animals during periods of direct sunlight and provides shelter from inclement weather. The licensee must
provide shade for all of the animals in the outdoor enclosures and assure that shade is provided as required.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Sec. 3.6 Primary enclosures. (c) Additional requirements for dogs--(1) Space.
***In the whelping area there was an adult female Cocker Spaniel identified as Callie that was housed with three
puppies. The floor space that was available to these animals was 2.83 square feet. The floor space that is required
for each of these animals is 6.67 square feet for the adult female and .33 square feet for each puppy. The total
space required for these animals is 7.67 square feet.
There was also an adult female Cocker Spaniel identified as Pillerie that was housed in an area where the available
floor space was 4.08 square feet. The required floor space for this animal is 6.67 square feet. Inadequate space for
each animal causes discomfort and increases the risk of incompatibility and injury to the animals. The licensee must
provide the appropriate space for these animals and assure that each animal is provided with space as required.
