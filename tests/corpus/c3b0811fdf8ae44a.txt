FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**In May of 2015 two grey foxes escaped from their enclosure while staff members were not present. The animals
had been living in this enclosure for years without issue.The facility conducted an investigation and found that
decking screws had deteriorated, allowing the animals to escape from small area on the underside of the enclosure.
Numerous attempts were made to recapture the animals, but the foxes have not been recovered. There are
currently no animals housed within the enclosure. No other animals have escaped.
Outdoor housing must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to contain the animals. Animals that are
able to escape their enclosure may be harmed or injured.
Efforts have been made to ensure installment of appropriate decking screws to secure other applicable enclosures.
This issue had been addressed at time of inspection.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Superintendent.
