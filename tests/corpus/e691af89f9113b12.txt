2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility does not have a written program of veterinary care. Although the facility employs a part-time veterinarian to
provide veterinary care for any animals that are sick or ill, there is no written formal agreement or regularly scheduled
visits from the veterinarian. A formal, written program of veterinary care from an attending veterinarian is to required to
ensure the health of animals. Correct by 10 May 2022 by implementing a written program of veterinary care and regularly
scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer with the attending veterinarian.

Facilities, general.
Two of the enclosures housing Degus are in need of repair to protect the animals from injury or illness. The front
enclosure housing Degus has a front edge of the enclosure comprised of plastic and metal near the sliding glass door.
The Degus have chewed both metal and plastic, leaving sharp areas in the enclosure. In the back Degu enclosure, the
metal sides and bottom corners have rust that easily comes off on your hand. Sharp edges can pose a danger to the
animals inside and lead to oral or extremity lacerations and wounds. Rusting of metal causes pitting in the metal surface
and prevents adequate cleaning of the enclosure to minimize biological hazards to the animals. Correct by 3 May 2022 by
ensuring that all enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals.

Watering.
The water bottle attached to the back Degu enclosure has a build-up of algae around the top rim and is not being kept
clean and sanitary. The algae is green in color and covers the majority of the upper surface of the water bottle. Water
contaminated with algae and other potential disease risks can lead to illness among the animals. Correct by 27 April 2022
by ensuring all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary.
