ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A number of guinea pigs were identified with a variety of health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with
the Program of Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. These include:
1. A adult guinea pig (mostly brown with some white spots) had an area of wet fur over the left side of its face and
neck. The affected area is approximately 1.5 x 2.5". The underlying skin is moist, exudative, and irregular in
appearance. This condition had not been identified by the licensee prior to inspection. The lesion may represent an
infectious disease or injury, and a veterinarian must be consulted to provide appropriate veterinary
recommendations and care.
2. Two animals, one tricolor young adult located in the top enclosure of the last row and one adult brown and white
sow in pen 38, were identified with crusting around their left eyes. These animals had not been identified by the
licensee prior to inspection. The Program of Veterinary Care outlines a treatment plan for this condition. Treatment
must be initiated according to the Program of Veterinary Care or the veterinarian must be consulted.
3. A total of 24 animals were identified with swellings under their chins. These animals had been identified by the
licensee prior to inspection. A treatment plan for this condition is described in the facility's Program of Veterinary
Care, but this plan had not been initiated by the licensee. A description of a representative sample of these animals
is presented below. When problems of animal health are identified, the licensee must initiate treatment according to
the guidance in the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the veterinarian for guidance.
(a) In Pen 3, a brown and black adult guinea pig has a swelling approximately 1" in diameter under its chin.
(b) In Pen 3, a tricolor adult guinea pig has a swelling approximately 1.5" in diameter under its chin
(c) In Pen 7, an adult sow, mostly grey with a white blaze, has a firm swelling approximately 2" in diameter under
its chin. There is some regions of hair loss over the swelling and there is a red area of disrupted skin approximately
1/4" in diameter, consistent with a wound or draining tract, over the swelling.
(d) In Pen 7, an adult sow, mostly brown with a white blaze, has a swelling approximately 1.5" in diameter under
its chin.
(e) In Pen 14, a brown and white adult guinea pig has a swelling approximately 1" in diameter under its chin.
(f) In Pen 15, an adult guinea pig, mostly white with grey, has a swelling approximately 1.5" in diameter under itschin.
(g) In Pen 16, an adult guinea pig, mostly white with brown, has a swelling approximately 2" in diameter under its
chin. This swelling is asymmetrical and larger on the right side of the animal.
(h) In Pen 19, a tricolor adult guinea pig has a swelling approximately 2" in diameter under its chin. This swelling
extends almost to the floor of the enclosure.
(i) In Pen 22, a white adult guinea pig has a firm swelling approximately 3" in diameter under its chin. This
swelling extends up behind the jaw bilaterally.
(j) In Pen 45, a tricolor adult guinea pig has a swelling approximately 2" in diameter under its chin. There is
patchy hair loss over the swelling.

Daily observation to assess the health and well being of the animals must be conducted to identify health issues.
Any health problems that are identified must be treated according to the guidance in the Program of Veterinary Care
or the veterinarian must be contacted to provide guidance. Direct and frequent communication with the attending
veterinarian is required to convey problems of animal health and to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary
care.

3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
1. In approximately 25% of the enclosures, the metal feeders are corroded on the edges that are accessible to the
guinea pigs. This corrosion and rust has resulted in rough surfaces that are difficult to sanitize and sharp, jagged
metal edges that present a risk of injury to the animals.
2. In Pen 42, a row of wires on the wire mesh front panel has broken. The sharp, broken ends of the wires are bent
such that they protrude into the enclosure. These wire ends present a risk of injury to the animals in this enclosure.
3. The bottom pen in the first rack of the last row is missing a piece that secures the door panels of the enclosure.
These front panels therefore are not held closed, leaving a 2-3" gap between the panels. Furthermore, one of the
panels, which holds the feeder, is freely movable by the animals in the enclosure. It was seen to be pushed further
open by the guinea pigs at the time of inspection, which increased the distance between the enclosure floor and the
available food. This may prevent smaller animals from accessing food, while the unsecured panel presents a risk of
crushing injury or entrapment to the guinea pigs in the enclosure.
Primary enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. The
feeders should be evaluated for safety and repaired or replaced as needed. Broken wire mesh should be repaired,
modified, or replaced to prevent the guinea pigs having access to sharp wire ends. The broken enclosure door
panels should be repaired or replaced to protect the animals. To be corrected by June 30, 2019.

WATERING.
Eight water bottles have an accumulation of green and/or black material in spots and rings both above and below
the water line on the inside of the bottles. This accumulated material could represent algal or bacterial growth, and
may reduce the potability of the water or present a health risk to the animals in the affected enclosures. All watering
receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty, and otherwise must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
To be corrected by June 7, 2019.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The solid and wire mesh walls of the primary enclosures have a brown build up evident on their surfaces. The floors
of the enclosures also show an accumulation of wet bedding and other brown debris. The licensee scrapes the
soiled bedding and applies a disinfectant prior to replacing the bedding, but does not wash the enclosures to
remove organic material and other debris. The accumulation of such debris and organic material prevents the
disinfectant from adequately sanitizing the enclosures and presents a health risk to the animals. Primary enclosures
shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and other debris, and enclosures
must be effectively sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
