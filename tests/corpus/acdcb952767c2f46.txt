2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
It was reported in the March 2016 IACUC minutes that a post-approval review of a protocol that month revealed that
three bighorn sheep were administered 50 times the approved dosage of a non-pharmaceutical grade drug (a
glucocorticoid) for three days in a row.
There were reportedly no ill effects to the animals. The project is now over; the Primary Investigator is retiring, and
the grad student involved is no longer at the institution.
Correction date: The IACUC is investigating and is in process of preparing a response. This subject will be
discussed at the next IACUC meeting, which is scheduled for a day in the week of May 2, 2016.
2.33(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
An internal investigation of practices at the bear center that precluded the Attending Veterinarian's (AV) ability to
ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee other aspects of animal care.
Examples cited in the report include: failure to maintain medical records, including anesthesia records; and failure to
notify the AV of a treatment prescribed by the Primary Investigator (a DVM) that was not part of a protocol or SOP.
The AV must be made aware of any treatments the animals receive, and must be able to review animal medical
records in order to fulfill their responsibilities under the Regulations.
This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by adopting an updated SOP for routine care, and ensuring that
the required record keeping was being done.
2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
** The University's internal review of the Bear Center found that in 2010, two compatible yearling bears were placedin a culvert trap to hibernate. They never entered into full hibernation and had to be removed from the trap. By that
time, their health had deteriorated to the point that they had to be euthanized. A camera set-up was in place to
record activity, but resolution was not sufficient to adequately monitor activity, and real-time surveillance was not
possible. The camera had to be physically accessed to retrieve the recording to be reviewed.
Daily observation of all animals is required to assess their health and well-being. Monitoring animals in hibernation
presents unique challenges which must be addressed to meet this requirement.
This was corrected prior to the time of inspection by updating the SOP to outline in detail adequate hibernation
routine and monitoring. The IACUC has reviewed and approved the new SOP.
** A female pygmy rabbit, Prim, was noted at the inspection to have a healed injury on her face. An injury to her
nose made a flap of skin that healed as a tag. The facility worker stated that it had happened a few months earlier.
When asked if the AV had been notified, the answer was no.
Timely and accurate communication to the AV regarding injuries is necessary to so the AV can appropriately assess
and treat them, if indicated, to ensure optimal health of the animals.
This was corrected at the time of inspection; a veterinarian examined the animal, and the animal was moved to an
enclosure with less foot traffic near her that would cause her stress and further injury by causing her to run into the
sides of the enclosure.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The third kennel from the right in the occupied large dog runs had an area of bent-up chain link in a lower corner of
the door. This resulted in an opening large enough for the Rottweiler dog in the kennel to put his nose or a leg out.
This poses a risk for injury or entrapment of the animal in the damaged area.
All animal holding facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals
and personnel.
Correct within 30 days, by May 31, 2016.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
A metal feeder in bighorn sheep pen #4 has a bent down, rusty lip on it. The manner in which it is bent leaves it with
sharp edges which pose a risk of injury to the four animals in the enclosure. Rusty surfaces are difficult to clean,and the rough surface can harbor pathogens.
All animal facilities must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to allow proper
husbandry practices.
Correct within 30 days, by May 31, 2016.
The inspection was conducted on April 26-28, accompanied by facility personnel.
The exit briefing was conducted on April 28 with facility personnel.
