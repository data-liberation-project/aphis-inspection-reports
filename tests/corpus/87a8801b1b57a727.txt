Facilities, general.
One lamb crawled under and out of its enclosure gate. The ability for animals to escape their primary enclosure could lead
to injury. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. The applicant must ensure the enclosure structure is
appropriate for the size of the animal.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “B” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.
All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 13-JUN-2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection.
Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
