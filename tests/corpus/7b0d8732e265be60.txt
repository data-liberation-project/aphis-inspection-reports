2.31(d)(1)(9)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC determined on a recent semiannual inspection that an ongoing study involving sheep was using a
facility that did not meet their criteria for compliance with established veterinary practices. Inadequate prep area,
surgeon scrub area, and lack of positive air pressure in the surgery area were mentioned.
Surgeries on animals covered by the Animal Welfare Act must be conducted in appropriate facilities to minimize the
risk of complications and, therefore, pain and distress to the animals.
The situation was corrected prior to the time of inspection by the IACUC mandating that only minor procedures may
be performed in that space as it was, and any major operative procedures must be conducted in either one of two
available compliant surgical areas. Any improvements to the area must be approved by the IACUC before covered
surgeries can be conducted there.
2.33(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The IACUC discovered on a recent semiannual inspection that an expired drug had been used on a covered animal
in surgery.
Expired medications may not be as potent as expected, or, in some cases, may even become toxic after expiration.
Therefore, they must not be used.
The IACUC corrected this at the time of their inspection by removing the expired medication from the area.
Corrected prior to this inspection.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility personnel.
