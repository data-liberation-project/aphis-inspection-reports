ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has a Program of Veterinary Care but the section for intestinal parasites is not complete. The puppy
deworming schedule is not documented on the Program of Veterinary Care. The licensee stated that she deworms
the puppies every three weeks, but there is no documentation from the attending veterinarian approving this
schedule. The deworming schedule must be documented on the Program of Veterinary Care and approved by the
attending veterinarian to ensure that the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Male Maltese (microchip #4964067354) was observed holding his left front foot off the flooring. The dog was mostly
non-weight bearing on this foot when he moved around the enclosure. Closer inspection of the dog revealed that
the toenails on all four feet are extremely overgrown and all the toenails have developed a severe curve. While
examining the left front foot, the inspector noticed that the toenails were growing under the foot towards the paw
pads. There is also a large ball of matted hair on the bottom of both front feet. This dog has a large clump of
brown tartar covering the top half of the surface of the left upper canine tooth and nearly the entire surface of the
upper right canine tooth is also coated in a thick buildup of brown tartar.
Male Chihuahua (“Earl”, microchip #033-793-272) is observed holding his tongue out the right side of his mouth.
Examination of the dog’s mouth revealed that the upper right canine tooth is heavily coated in a thick buildup of grey
and brown colored tartar. This tooth is also loose and moved easily when touched by the inspector.
(cid:9)
Female Yorkshire terrier (microchip #4826410972) has a very thick buildup of dark brown tartar covering nearly the
entire surface of the upper left and right canine teeth. The gums have become slightly reddened. This dog also has
excessive matting of the hair coat on the right side of her body. The matted hair is beginning to become tightlyadhered to the body. The license stated that she grooms all the dogs once a year.
(cid:9)
Male Maltese (No ID found) has a very thick buildup of dark brown tartar covering the entire surface of the cheek
teeth on both sides of the mouth. Nearly the entire surface of both upper and lower canine teeth and all the front
teeth are coated in the dark brown tartar. The gums have become moderately reddened. This dog also has
multiple sections of matted hair along the front and inside of both hind legs. The matted areas have entrapped dirt
and grime and are nearly black in color. Clumps of matted hair are also found on the bottom of the feet and the
toenails on all four feet are overgrown and developing a severe curve. The inspector observed the toenails laid out
sideways from the foot when the dog was standing on the flooring.
Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog and could lead to further health issues. The above
mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective
treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector
upon request.
Matted hair coats could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Female Yorkshire terrier (#4826410972), male
Maltese (No ID found), and male Maltese (#4964067354) must also receive hair coat maintenance to remove the
matted hair from their coats and the bottom of their feet. The licensee must establish an effective hair coat
maintenance plan that will keep the hair coats free of matting at all times.
Male Shih tzu (microchip #48315C7D26) has excessively long toenails on all four feet. The toenails have
developed a severe curve and are beginning to grown towards the bottom of the dog’s foot. Overgrown toenails
could also cause pain and discomfort, as well as, affect the dog’s natural gait. This dog, as well as, male Maltese
(No ID found), and male Maltese (#4964067354) must have their toenails trimmed to an acceptable length. The
licensee must develop a plan to maintain the toenails of all the dogs at a proper length at all times.

There is no official USDA identification tag, tattoo, or microchip number for each dog listed on APHIS form 7005

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the “Adult” building there are at least five enclosures whose access doors have a thick buildup of dark colored dirt
and grime on their surfaces. There are seven dogs housed in these affected enclosures.
At least seven of the lower enclosures have a buildup of dirt, grime, old food and hair on the plastic tubes directly
beneath and next to the gates and on some of the gates. There are at least ten dogs housed in these enclosures.
Two plastic feeders are excessively chewed around the front edge of the feed cup. Dark colored dirt and food
waste has penetrated into these damaged areas and caked feed is also located along the inside of the front of the
cup of both feeders. Four dogs have access to these feeders.
There is a drain that runs along the back wall of the “Adult” building and there is a buildup of dirt, grime, old food
and hair in the drain and on the floor around the drain. Some items stored on the floor in front of the drain are also
coated with dirt, hair and grime.
A buildup of dirt, grime, hair and food waste could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs and the health of
the dogs could suffer. All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that
cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must remove the
buildup of dirt, grime, hair and food waste from all surfaces within the housing facility, as well as, replace, repair, or
alter the damaged self-feeders in a manner that allows them to be properly cleaned and sanitized. The licensee
must ensure that all surfaces within the housing facility remain free of dirt, grime, food waste, and hair and remain in
good repair at all times.
