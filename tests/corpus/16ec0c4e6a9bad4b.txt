Recordkeeping requirements.
Some of the required IACUC records are missing or lacking important elements.
The December 05th 2019 IACUC meeting minutes were incomplete and did not document attendance or committee
deliberations. The facility shall maintain minutes of IACUC meetings, including records of attendance, activities of the
Committee, and Committee deliberations.
There were no current record of proposed activity involving the animals being used for teaching at the Veterinary
Technician School. The facility shall maintain records of proposed activities involving animals and proposed significant
changes in activities, and whether IACUC approval was given or withheld.
The two 2019 semi-annual evaluations did not indicate a program review was conducted. The reports submitted to the
Institutional Official did not contain a description of the nature and extent of the facility’s adherence to the Animal Welfare
Act and Regulations. Both reports were signed by 3 out of the 6 IACUC members and therefore were not signed by the
majority. The facility shall maintain records of the semiannual IACUC reports and recommendations (including minority
views), prepared in accordance with the requirements of § 2.31(c)(3), and forwarded to the Institutional Official.
Failure to appropriately maintain these records inhibits the IACUC’s ability to provide proper oversight of animal use and


activities, which can negatively impact the health and welfare of animals being used.

2.35(b)(8)

Recordkeeping requirements.
For this inspection, the facility provided 11 dog acquisition records and 9 cat acquisition records. Most of the animals were
surrendered to the university and three were documented as being found on the university grounds such as the parking
lot or curb. One cat was documented as being a stray found by a student. These dogs and cats from non-USDA-licensed
individuals, were acquired without a certificate stating that the animal was “born and raised” on the seller’s premise and
that “fewer than 25 dogs and/or cats” were sold that year. Without this certification, there is no definite guarantee of the
animals’ origins and therefore the adequacy of utilizing these animals for teaching cannot be determined. If dogs or cats
are acquired from any person not licensed or registered under the Act and not a pound or shelter, the research facility
must obtain a certification that the animals were born and raised on the person’s premises and that the person has sold
fewer than 25 dogs and/or cats that year.
To be corrected by November 16th, 2020.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
