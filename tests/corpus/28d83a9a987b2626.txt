2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Inspectors observed two dogs to be in need of veterinary care:
1) Identification # TAK-28, a male, blue merle Dachshund, had an accumulation of brown-tan material firmly
adhered to and obscuring three-quarters of the exposed canine and cheek teeth. The gums appeared reddened
and inflamed.
2)Identification # 0A02053615, a male tan and white Chihuahua, had areas of patchy hair-loss on both front legs.
Dental issues can cause pain and lead to systemic infections. Lack of adequate dental care can lead to the inability
to eat without pain, which can cause inadequate caloric intake. Hair-loss can be a result of a systemic condition, or
can be due to parasitism or infection. The licensee must have the aforementioned dogs examined by a veterinarian
and ensure that they receive appropriate treatment, and provide inspector with documentation of the visit and
treatment. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian to develop and implement a dental care plan for all animals
at the facility.
***
Inspectors also observed a bottle of Cerenia with an expiration date of January 2014 that was in a drawer with
medications ready for use in the animals. Expired medications may be contaminated, may not work as expected,
and could harm the animals if used. All medications used on the animals must not be expired. Licensee must
ensure that all medications maintained for and used on the animals are not expired.

2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
One hundred and sixty eight adult dogs were counted during the inspection. The inventory (APHIS 7005) lists eighty
six adult dogs. The licensee informed inspectors that she had purchased animals within the last month and had not
updated her records. Proper recordkeeping is required in order to ensure that animal movement to and from the
facility can be accurately traced. The licensee must develop a plan to maintain an accurate inventory which
discloses all dogs purchased or acquired, owned, held or otherwise in possession or under his control, or which is
transported, euthanized, sold or otherwise disposed of by the licensee.***

3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inspectors observed two areas in need of cleaning and sanitization. The majority of indoor enclosures in the middle
sheltered building, which houses thirty-eight adult dogs, had a buildup of hair and dust on the front sections and
underneath the enclosures. Also, in a sheltered building behind the house, all indoor enclosures had a buildup of
dirt, grime, and cobwebs. This building houses fifteen adult dogs. In order to protect the dogs from disease hazards,
to prevent the dogs from becoming soiled, and to facilitate good husbandry practices, hard surfaces which the dogs
have contact with must be spot cleaned and sanitized as needed. The licensee must spot clean, sanitize and
maintain surfaces as needed to satisfy generally acceptable husbandry standards.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inspectors observed an accumulation of gravel and fecal material present on the ground directly adjacent to the
outdoor portion of the second building behind the house. The waste pile was approximately four feet from the
primary enclosures which house six dogs. In the same area, inspectors observed an enclosure containing two dogs
to have a large puddle of water in the center of the enclosure, which covered at least one third of the outdoor portion
of the enclosure. Waste and standing water must be removed on a regular basis in order to prevent contamination,
reduce odors, reduce breeding grounds for pests, and in order to minimize disease risk. The licensee must develop
a program to provide for regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding,
debris, garbage, water, other fluids and wastes in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks.

3.3(c)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the first sheltered building behind the house,which houses 15 adult dogs, inspectors observed that the overhead
lighting was not functional. There was a small window in the back of the building, but it did not provide inspectors
with enough light to observe the animals and enclosures. Appropriate natural or artificial lighting is necessary in
order to ensure that the animals can be observed and in order to provide for routine inspection and cleaning to
occur. The licensee must ensure that appropriate illumination is uniformly dispersed throughout this and all
buildings, and that animals are provided with a regular diurnal light cycle.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Inspectors observed an outdoor enclosure containing three adult dogs which had an igloo type shelter structure
which was not large enough to allow all three of the animals to make normal postural adjustments. There was
another dog house inside the enclosure, but it was broken, and thus was not an appropriate shelter from the
elements. Animals must be afforded protection from the elements and from the direct rays of the sun in order to
protect their health and wellbeing. The licensee must add an additional shelter structure, or replace the current
shelter structure in order for all animals to have comfortable access to shelter. Shelter structures must be large
enough to allow each animal to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, as well as turn about freely.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In two outdoor enclosures housing four dogs, inspectors observed rusted and jagged areas of tin along the bottom
of the enclosures. Inspectors also observed an area of broken wire along the bottom portion of a divider panel
between two enclosures which contained three dogs. Inspectors also observed broken wires protruding into an
enclosure containing three dogs on the outdoor portion of the second sheltered building. These areas contained
sharp points which were in easy reach of the animals, and could therefore injure the animals contained in the
enclosures. The licensee must remove, repair or replace the aforementioned areas, and develop a maintenance
plan to ensure that all enclosures are free of sharp points at all times.

3.6(a)(2)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Inspectors observed an enclosure with an open gate in the third sheltered building at the secondary location. This
enclosure contained one female Dachshund, and was on the second level of the building. This enclosure did not
securely contain the animal. The dog could have jumped out of the gate and become injured or escaped. The
licensee must ensure that all gates are securely latched, and ensure that the animals in all enclosures are securely
contained at all times.
***
This item was corrected during the inspection by latching the gate.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In all three of the sheltered buildings at the secondary location, inspectors observed several enclosures in need ofrepair. There were approximately four enclosures containing six dogs which had sections of broken wires on the
coated metal flooring. There were approximately four enclosures containing seven dogs that had areas on the
coated metal flooring where the coating was missing, exposing bare wire. In the interior portion of the whelping
building, there were approximately five enclosures containing twenty adult dogs and puppies that had areas of the
coated, expanded metal flooring where the coating was missing, exposing bare metal. In the same building, one
enclosure containing three adult dogs had areas along the front and back corners where the metal flooring was
broken, creating holes in the flooring large enough for the animals'(cid:25) feet to pass through the holes. These areas of
exposed metal and broken flooring could cause injury to the dogs(cid:25)' feet and legs. The licensee must repair or
replace the aforementioned flooring areas and develop and implement a maintenance plan to ensure that all flooring
protects the animals from injury at all times.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Inspectors observed two areas, housing 21 adult dogs, in need of cleaning and de-cluttering. In the second building
behind the house there was an accumulation of clutter, chemicals, and materials not for use in dogs along the tops
of the enclosures and stacked in the corners of the building. There were also dirt and debris in the corners and
along the walls of the building. In the first building behind the house the walls, floor and ceiling were covered in dust
and cobwebs. Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings, and surrounding grounds, must be
kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury, to facilitate the husbandry practices and to
reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin.
