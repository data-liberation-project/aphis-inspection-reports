2.31(c)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
During the review of the semi-annual reports to the Institutional Official, it was noted that the IACUC updated the Semi-
annual Report on 2/8/22 and the next update to the report was on 10/4/22, an interval of 8 months between reports
instead of at least once every 6 months.

Per this Section, one of the functions of the IACUC is to prepare reports of the Committee’s semi-annual evaluations of
the program for animal use and its inspection of the facilities; the semi-annual reports to the Institutional Official shall be
updated at least once every six months upon completion of the required semiannual evaluations. This process ensures
that the Institutional Official is kept informed of the status of both the animal use program and the research facilities.
Correct from this date 10/14/22 for all future semi-annual reports to the Institutional Official.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
