INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The last report of the facility semi-annual program review and inspection was submitted to the Institutional Official
(IO) in February 2014. No report has been created or submitted for the inspection and program review that occurred
in August 2014. Reports of the IACUC semi annual evaluations must be prepared and submitted to the IO every six
months. These reports must be signed and reviewed by a majority of the IACUC members.
Timely submission of the evaluation reports is necessary to ensure adequate communication is maintained with the
IO regarding facility adherence to the regulations and standards under the Animal Welfare Act.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A change in personnel occurred under approved and active protocol #2011 approximately one year ago. The
personnel change involved an individual responsible for pre and intra operative monitoring and administration of
drugs used for anesthesia and relief of pain/distress. No modification to the protocol has been submitted
documenting this significant change. Although this type of modification can be handled administratively, it must be
documented and sufficiently reviewed to ensure personnel are appropriately identified, adequately trained and
qualified and that any other criteria required by the IACUC is met.
Significant changes to the care and use of animals must be identified, documented and reviewed prior to
implementation.

The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Institutional Official.
