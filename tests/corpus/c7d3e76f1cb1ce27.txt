2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The protocol "Dentistry-Dog and/or Cat" approved 11/2/15 states that "appropriate teeth are extracted with
permission of and under the supervision of the veterinarian". There is no further explanation or reference to
post-extraction care of the dog and cat to include care such as relief of pain and discomfort and cessation of
potential hemorrhage in the protocol. Extraction of teeth may lead to pain or discomfort and the protocol should
include a description of the procedures to be followed to assure that any discomfort and pain will be minimized
including any provision for the use of analgesic drugs where indicated and appropriate. Correct prior to the use of
any animals on this protocol.
3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal legs of the raised dog beds in the three indoor dog runs have lost their protective end caps and the
bottom 1/2 inch of the legs which sit on the kennel floor have become rusty. These rusty surfaces are difficult to
clean and sanitize. They may also lead to structural integrity loss of the metal over time. The surfaces of housing
facilities including furniture type fixtures must be free of rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization of
the surfaces. Correct by 8/12/16.
Exit conducted with Attending Veterinarian.
