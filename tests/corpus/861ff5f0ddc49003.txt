2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 0112B1-004 failed to include the description of the procedures the facility is using to minimize the distress
of approximately 5 sheep and 10 goats assigned to this protocol. The absence of the tranquilizing drug information
does not allow oversight by the IACUC. Update this protocol and ensure all protocols submitted to the IACUC
describe all procedures that minimize discomfort and pain to animals. Correct by: April 7, 2014.
Inspection conducted with farm representative.
Exit briefing conducted with IACUC Chair.
End of report.
