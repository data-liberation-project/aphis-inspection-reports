There is a female Boxer #89 that had an injury to her left eye resulting in pinkish/red tissue protruding from the
center of the eyeball. This tissue was approximately a 1/4 inch in diameter and looked like a rupture or a growth
coming out of the eye with some weeping. The dog appeared healthy and jumping around, however the injury or
growth needs to be seen by a veterinarian. The issue had not been noticed by the licensee until during the
inspection and the veterinarian was contacted after the inspection was complete.
There was a male Boxer #134 that had multiple lumps or growths on the outside of his right and left rear feet, and
on the top and sides of his toes on his front feet. The lump on his right rear foot located on the outside toe was
approximately 2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide and deep, was very red and raw in appearance with some fluid
around the sore . The other fleshy lumps were healed over, or older in appearance.
It is imperative that any injuries or growths are identified as soon as they occur and a veterinarian is contacted in
order to decrease the time an issue can cause pain or discomfort for the animal, and in order to decrease the
chances of a treatable injury from becoming a chronic or incurable health issue.
The licensee needs to contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment as necessary as soon as health
issues are identified.

There is a female Boxer #89 that had an injury to her left eye resulting in pinkish/red tissue protruding from the
center of the eyeball. The issue had not been noticed by the licensee until during the inspection and it is unclear if
this is a new injury or if it is a growth that has been on the eye for some time.

There was a male Boxer #134 that had multiple lumps or growths on the outside of his right and left rear feet, andon the top and sides of his toes on his front feet. The lump on his right rear foot located on the outside toe was
approximately 2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide and deep, was very red and raw in appearance with some fluid
around the sore . The other fleshy lumps were healed over, or older in appearance. The licensee had not observed
these lumps on the dog until during the inspection.The veterinarian was contacted in regards to both issues after
the inspection was complete.
It is important that the regulated animals are observed daily for any signs of illness or injury in order to prevent a
treatable issue from becoming chronic or causing any pain or discomfort for any longer time period than necessary.
The licensee needs to observe the animals daily to assess their health and well-being and that the veterinarian is
contacted when issues are identified for proper diagnosis and treatment.
