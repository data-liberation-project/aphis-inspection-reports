2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On 9/25/19 seven ring-tail lemurs that ranged in ages from 7 months to 5 years were inappropriately handled that
resulted in the death of one adult male lemur. The licensee's employee moved the lemurs from their primary
enclosures and loaded the animals into plastic crates where they stayed for 1.5 to 3 hours awaiting pick up by the
buyer. According to the ranch manager and the primary caretaker, one adult male lemur was discovered in serious
condition at the time when the animal was removed from the facility’s holding plastic crate and transferred to the
buyers crate. He was suffering from multiple fight/bite wounds. Large wounds were present on the thigh, forearm,
inguinal area, testicle and the skull was described as exposed with a wound that extended down the neck. The tail
was also broken.
Multiple lemurs were placed in single crates. The 3 crates each measured 24"L x 20”W x 23”H for a total of 3.33
square feet per crate. This is an inadequate amount of space for multiple lemurs (Group 2 species) to be housed or
transported together. Furthermore, the primary caretaker who captured and moved the lemurs on 9/25/19 said he
was unaware of the genders or ages of the lemurs and did not know what genders were placed with the injured
male. The ranch manager and animal caretaker stated the animals were checked on several times after being
placed in the crates and appeared to be calm.
The injured lemur died a few days later as a result of the trauma. Immediate veterinary care was provided by the
licensee’s veterinarian and a few days later the wounds required additional surgical repair by the buyer’s
veterinarian.
These lemurs were handled in a manner that was not as expeditiously or as carefully as possible to prevent trauma
or unnecessary discomfort. Disrupting the social group and housing animals of mix ages and unknown genders is
likely to cause aggression between primates. Compounding this by housing them in crowded confinement for
several hours further increased the behavioral stress (increasing the likelihood of serious injury). As a result of this
inappropriate handling, this male lemur experienced significant pain and distress later dying as a result of the
trauma. Animals must be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible that does not cause trauma or
unnecessary discomfort.
