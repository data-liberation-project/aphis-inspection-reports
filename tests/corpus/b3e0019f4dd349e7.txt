Care in transit.


Around June 2021, an adult male dog named ‘Kobe’ was picked up in Chicago. While switching the dog over, he
attempted to bite and attack the registrant, got loose and ran into the neighborhood. The owners of the dog flew to the
area and along with the registrant, ‘Kobe’ was eventually recovered.

In early July 2021, ‘Oso’, an adult male Great Pyrenees mix dog, approx. 5.5 years old, was being transported from
Missouri to Washington. In El Paso, TX, ‘Oso’ got loose during a potty/walk break at a gas station around 4:30 AM. The
registrant looked for and tried to recover the dog for approx. 12 hours before leaving the area. The local animal control
was also notified of the loose dog. The owner nor the registrant have been able to recover the dog.

Removal during transportation in commerce prohibited. Except during the cleaning of primary enclosures, as required in
3.15(b), during transportation in commerce a dog or cat must not be removed from its primary enclosure, unless it is

This inspection was conducted with facility representative and the exit interview was conducted with registrant.
