3.13(c)(3)
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
A cat traveling on a United flight from Ontario to Kansas City, with a stop in San Francisco was inspected at the
United Cargo office managed by Swissport. The waybill number was 016-51451396. On inspection it was
discovered that the Owner(cid:25)s Feeding and Watering Instructions attached to the crate had not been completed.
There was no documentation as to when the animal was last offered food and water, nor as to the feeding and
watering instructions for the next 24 hours. Intermediate handlers should not accept a dog or cat for transport in
commerce unless the consignor certifies in writing to the carrier and intermediate handler that the animal was
offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery for transport. This ensures that the animal receives
adequate care during transport. The intermediate handler should take steps to ensure that the carriers for which
they handle animal cargo abide by these requirements.
To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with a company representative.
