ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1430 on
25-Jan-18. I went to the licensee's house. The licensee was on her way out to run some errands and would not be
back for a while to do the inspection. I informed her I would try back another time.
End of report.
