3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
The plastic feed and water bowls, attached to ten of the dog enclosures, have chew damage in the front corners.
Enclosure surfaces that are chewed and have irregular edges cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized which can
expose the dogs to potential disease hazards.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis to ensure that they can be cleaned and sanitized
or replaced when worn or soiled.
