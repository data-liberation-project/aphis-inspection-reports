RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Disposition records were not readily available during inspection to indicate transport, euthanasia, sale or other
disposition by the exhibitor for all animals. For example, records available stated: 1 red kangaroo was listed as
"returned with Billy to Texas", with no further information provided, and 1 porcupine record indicated "Fred passed
on".

Kangaroo enclosure: New kangaroo enclosure is across from the house and has no perimeter fence. There must
