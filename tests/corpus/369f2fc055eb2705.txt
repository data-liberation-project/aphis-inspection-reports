ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A crème female wheaten terrier, # 569, was observed hunched over in her kennel. Further observations revealed
she had a softball sized vaginal prolapse. Approximately 2-3 inches of the vagina were extending outward from the
vulvar opening. Treatment log records indicated that the prolapse was observed by the licensee on May 23rd, 2019.
A discussion with the attending veterinarian, after completing the kennel inspection, revealed that she was unaware
of the prolapsed vagina. A prolapse is a painful condition which left untreated can cause additional suffering,
infection and/or death.
The licensee is responsible for timely and accurate communication with the attending veterinarian to discuss issues
within the kennel. Communication with the attending veterinarian is crucial to animal welfare and preventing animal
suffering. Before the exit interview was conducted, the licensee had contacted the veterinarian and has scheduled
surgery to spay #569.
Ensure timely and accurate communication with your attending veterinarian for all animal health issues. To be
corrected immediately.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The whelping building consists of raised kennels over a concrete wash-down. The wash-down gutter was full of
feces, old food, and maggots. A strong ammonia odor was observed upon walking up to the facility. Additionally,
there were a significant amount of flies. Strong odors can be harmful to the animals breathing and can lead to
respiratory diseases. Pests can make animals uncomfortable and transmit disease. Feces and food waste must be
removed from under primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation to reduce
disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
