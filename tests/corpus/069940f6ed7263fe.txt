2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1600 on
06/01/2016.
Upon arrival I called the licensee and was informed that she had just left the facility and could not come back in a
reasonable amount of time for the inspection process. We discussed hours of operation at that time.
This was the first attempted inspection.
