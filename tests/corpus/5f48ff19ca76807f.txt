Refrigeration shall be provided for supplies of perishable food. In the food prep room there is a silver refrigerator
which has several metal racks which are rusty and flaking. Rusting metal can not be cleaned and sanitized. New

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make
normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. There is one sugar glider which is
being housed in a small bird cage at time of this inspection. This enclosure does not allow for normal gliding
behavior. A larger enclosure needs to be provided for the animal's well being.
