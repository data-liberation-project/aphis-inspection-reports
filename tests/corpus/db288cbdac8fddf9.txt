PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
A report from the Animal Control Warden in Illinois indicated that "several cages had 4 to 6 pups in them leaving no
room." These enclosures measure 20in by 24in (3.3sq ft). "One cage had 8 pups with one pup buried under the
other, it was weak and unresponsive when found." This enclosure also measured 20in by 24in (3.3sq feet).
The report went on to indicate "a bulldog pup that could not turn around (in the enclosure due to lack of space). The
Illinois ACO advised that this dog was housed in an enclosures approximately 12in by 9in.
Lastly the report indicated " pups with freshly cropped ears crowded in with other bigger pups, 5 in that cage."
The ACO of Illinois observed transportation enclosures housing more than 4 live dogs and enclosures that did not
allow the animals to turn about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a natural posture.
Overcrowding in a transportation primary enclosure may result in injury to the animal(s) housed or other adverse
well-being issues. The registrant shall ensure that all animals transported have adequate room to meet these
requirements.

FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
A report from the Animal Control Warden in Illinois indicated that several of the food and water receptacles were
empty. The photographs provided showed food and water receptacles were lying in the bottom of the enclosure
flipped upside down. Food and water receptacles must be securely attached inside of the primary enclosure.
Unsecured receptacles may result in food and water to readily spill. Registrant shall implement a system to secure
the food and water receptacles in the primary enclosures.
