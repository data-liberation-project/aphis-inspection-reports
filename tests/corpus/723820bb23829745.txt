2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female, adult, white-colored, white-tailed deer named 'Snowflake', is thin in appearance. When viewed from the
back and side, the ribs and backbone are visible. The deer also has areas of patchy hair loss throughout its body. A
facility representative stated they started noticing the abnormal condition a couple months ago. The facility
representative also stated the deer has had normal stools and is eating normally. However, a veterinarian has not
been consulted and an appropriate treatment plan has not been administered.
Body condition that shows lost weight to the point that the backbone or ribs are visible is a sign of potential health
problems. Poor body condition could be an indication the deer is not receiving adequate nutrition or it could be
internal problems. This can affect the ability of the deer to gain or maintain its body weight. Abnormal hair loss can
also be an indication of a health problem. The deer must be examined by a veterinarian and appropriate diagnosis
and treatment administered. Documentation must be maintained on all problems, diagnosis and treatments. The
licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Exit briefing conducted with the licensee.
