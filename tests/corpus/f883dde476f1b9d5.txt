3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
There are at least two sections of perimeter fence that are less than six feet in height. The fence is bent downward and
outward in some places from the camels reaching over and pressing on the fence, which resulted in decreasing the height
(measuring ~63 inches from the ground to the fence topline). In one place dirt was mounded near the fence, also
contributing to a decrease in perimeter fence height.
The licensee must repair the existing fence and make any other modifications as needed to bring all of the perimeter
fence line to a minimum height of six feet, or install a different perimeter fence or fences of at least 6 feet in height, a
minimum of three feet from the primary enclosure and constructed so that the fence(s) protect(s) the animals by fully
containing them while restricting entry of outside animals and unauthorized persons to prevent contact with the animals in
the facility.

3.131(c)

Sanitation.
Within the areas of the premises accessible to the two adult male camels, there are stacks of metal pipe and rolls and
sheets of wire paneling on the ground, as well as stacked metal ladders. These objects present a potential hazard, since


the animals can come into contact with them and they could cause injury or entrapment.
The licensee needs to ensure that premises are kept clean and free of debris in order to protect the animals from injury.
