2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A tan colored, female Welsh corgi with no ID located in the second pen from the west end of the north row of
elevated pens in the kennel building was found with an open wound on the left side of her neck about midway
between the base of the ear and the point of the shoulder. The affected area was in the shape of an irregular
triangle approximately one inch wide and two inches long. The top layer of skin was seperated from the tissue
underneath. The exposed flesh was pink, had a somewhat roughened texture and appeared moist. Hair surrounding
this area was moist and matted by a brown crusty material. The licensee stated that the fight took place "about two
weeks ago." The licensee had a bottle of veticare topical wound spray that she stated she had been applying to the
wound daily but there was no documentation from the veterinarian regarding diagnosis or treatment.
This dog needs to be seen by a veterinarian and a diagnosis and treatment plan prescribed by the end of the day
May 15, 2014. Documentation of the diagnosis and treatment must be obtained and available for inspection upon
next inspection.
2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are sixteen adult dogs that are not officially identified. The licensee stated that the tags are in the house and
the collars had been ordered. Official identification is needed to ensure that each animal(cid:25)'s identity can be known
with certainty and to facilitate the inspection process.The licensee must ensure that all dogs are officially identified
by collar, tattoo or microchip. If the licensee uses microchips, then a microchip reader must be made available to
the inspector during facility inspections.
2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are eight puppies less than sixteen weeks of age that are not properly identified. Official identification is
needed to ensure that each animal(cid:25)'s identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the inspection process.
To be corrected by May 15, 2014.3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a cardboard box in the enclosure (housing one adult dog and three puppies) that has been chewed and
shredded. The box has a number of holes in it and there are pieces of cardboard lying on the floor within the
enclosure. Surfaces of housing facilities - including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects
within the facility--must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and
sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.
The box needs to be removed or replaced to prevent injury to the dogs.
To be corrected by May 15, 2014.
3.1(c)(3) DIRECT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures throughout the kennel had several days accumulation of feces (affecting sixteen adult dogs and 7
puppies). At least four of the enclosures had a brown material smeared on the enclosure walls. The feces was
embedded within the grated flooring. At least two of the enclosures had feces covering most of the floor such that
the Welsh Corgis within the enclosure were not able to move about in the enclosure without stepping in the feces.
The licensee stated that it had been "about a week" since she last cleaned the enclosures. Hard surfaces with
which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this
subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. A cleaning program needs to be
implemented and followed to promote the health and well-being of the animals within the housing facility.
To be corrected by May 15, 2014 and maintained from this day forward.
3.1(f) DIRECT REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the northwest corner of the kennel underneath the enclosures and the wash down, brown to black water, hair,
and other debris are pooled (affecting 16 adult dogs and 8 puppies). There was a strong ammonia odor throughout
the kennel. This area of pooled water and debris increases the risks of vermin and pest infestation, disease
hazards, and odors within the kennel. A disposal and drainage system must be properly constructed, installed and
maintained in the kennel building so that waste and water are rapidly eliminated.
3.6(a)(2)(11)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are two puppies with no identification being housed in a small dog crate on the floor on the north side of thekennel buidling. The puppies do not have enough room within the crate to be able to turn about freely, to stand, sit,
and lie in a comfortable, normal position. There is no room in the enclosure for the puppies to walk in a normal
manner.
Housing facilities need to provide dogs with sufficient space to be able to make normal postural movements to
promote their health and well-being.
To be corrected immediately.
3.7 DIRECT
COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
There are two female, adult Welsh Corgi's being housed in an enclosure with another dog that got into a fight where
one of the two dogs injured the other. The one dog had an open wound to the left side of her neck where the skin
was seperated from the tissue underneath. The two dogs are still in the same enclosure together. Dogs being
housed together must be compatible. These dogs need to be seperated to prevent further injury to the dogs.
To be corrected immediately.
The non-compliant item documented under 3.2(d) from the inspection report dated August 7th, 2013 has not been
corrected, but the correction date has not passed due to an extension being granted until June 1, 2014.
A preliminary exit interview was conducted with the licensee on May 12, 2014.
On May 12, 2014 at 7:32p.m. the licensee was called to reiterate that documentation from the veterinarian for the
dog with the wound needed to be provided by noon on May 13, 2014. A message was left on the licensee's
voicemail.
On May 13, 2014 at 1:19p.m. the licensee was called and a message was left to arrange a time to drop off the
inspection report. At 2:45p.m. inspectors arrived at the facility to deliver the inspection report. A message was left
on the licensee's voicemail at 2:52p.m. and 3:09p.m. regarding the inspection report. The licensee was unable to be
reached.
