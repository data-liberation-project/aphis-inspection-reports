2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:45 PM on
21-SEP-16.
The inspector arrived at 2:45 PM on 9/21/16 to conduct an inspection but the Licensee was not on the premises. A
volunteer at the facility contacted the Licensee by phone and learned that she was at a distant off-site location and
would not return for several hours.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other authorized facility
representative available to accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility and animals.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of this Licensee. Report delivered by e-mail 9/22/16.
