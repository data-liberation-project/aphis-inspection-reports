2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol involving covered species does not adequately justify the numbers of animals
requested. The justification states that each test strain requires a separate animal, but does not justify the number
of test strains required to account for all animals requested.
An inadequate rationale for animal numbers requested for use could result in unnecessary use of animals. The
IACUC should ensure that the investigator has provided a clear, adequate rationale for the number of animals
requested.
