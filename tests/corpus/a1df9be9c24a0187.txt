ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following animals are in need of veterinary consultation:
*In the drive-thru portion of the facility one female mouflon was noted from a distance to be limping. She exhibited a
slower and irregular gait compared to the other mouflon with her and had a head bob. In addition, there appeared to
be an irregularly shaped dark area of her haircoat, possibly including a wound, on her left side mid body about 6in
long and 2 in wide. The facility representatives stated this was a new issue to them.
*One highly pregnant female camel appeared to be having difficulty breathing. Her breathing was highly audible and
labored. She kept her neck and head fully extended during the inspection. Severe swelling was noted in her
facial/head area along with swelling of her lower limbs especially her feet. The white area of her left eye showed
some reddened enlarged blood vessels.The only veterinary documentation for this camel was a notation from a vet
visit on 12-2-14 that she was doing well with nutritional management and was pregnant.
*One female camel who gave birth approximately one week ago has been seperated from her calf due to swelling of
her udder. The facility representative stated when asked that the vet has not seen her or been contacted about her
but that the swelling has gone down considerably since they seperated them. The cria appeared healthy.
*One black and white llama was noted to have a whitish light bluish colored eyeball on its right side. The facility
represenative stated this was an old injury that has healed. No veterinary documentation was available to review.
The facility representatives stated that the attending veterinarian was due out at the facility on 3/18/15 for a routine
visit. A veterinarian needs to be consulted for all abnormalities noted regarding the animals to ensure proper
diagnosis and treatment. Even though this is a repeat non-compliant item, these animals need to be seen by a
veterinarian by COB on 3/18/15. This is a Direct citation.
The following drugs were noted to be expired in the refrigerator, the drug cabinet and the drug/treatment box:
*Two bottles of Succinylcholine 100mg/ml injectable expired 5/6/14.
*One bottle of Selenium Vitamin E (B-D-SE) injectable expired 5/2014.
*One bottle of Oxytocin injectable expired Mar. 2014.
*One bottle of High Level Vitamin B Complex 250 ml injectable expired 12/14.
*One bottle of Agrimectin expired 6/14.
*One bottle of Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim tablets expired 10/14.
The use of expired drugs is not considered appropriate veterinary care as the drugs may no longer be effective. Allmedications used must be in date and effective. Expired medications should be disposed of or stored seperately
from in date medications.This is an indirect citation.
2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) indicates that xylazine and / or succinyl -choline will be used for the capture
and chemical restraint of hoofstock. When asked to describe how the facility is currently capturing and restraining
hoofstock, the facility representative stated that they were using succinyl-choline injections. No xylazine was present
at the facility. The current method of administering chemical restraint does not include the monitoring of vital
functions and supportive care in the event the animal experiences respiratory distress. It is unclear in the PVC if the
use of succinyl-choline should be used in combination with xylazine. However, the use of paralytics such as
succinyl-choline without anesthesia or analgesia is not within the established standards of veterinary care.
The licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the availability of appropriate
guidance to personnel involved in the care and use of animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia,
analgesia, and tranquilization. Providing the authority to use paralytic drugs for immobilization without
administration of anesthetic drugs, additional supportive care, and the equipment to provide for ventilation in the
event of respiratory paralysis is not considered adequate veterinary care. This lack of adequate care can
compromise the health of these animals and is likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and /
or death. Correct by working with your attending veterinarian to ensure that there is appropriate guidance on the use
of succinyl-choline for restraint. This guidance must be incorporated into the written program of veterinary care to
include the equipment and methods for monitoring and providing emergency care to ensure animals under such
chemical restrain do not experience unnecessary pain or distress. Correct by 3/31/15.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The disposition records were incomplete. The records indicated the dates of death and the dates animals were
sold for various species. However in most instances the name, address, and USDA license number, or vehicle and
driver(cid:25)'s license number and State, is not indicated in the disposition records. Complete records must be maintained
in accordance with the standards of the Animal Welfare Act. Currents records must be updated to include all
required information. Additionally, a system to ensure all required information is noted in disposition records must be
established and maintained to facilitate animal tracking in accordance with the standards of the Animal Welfare Act.
3.81(c)(4) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The previous inspection report included a citation for lack of enrichement for the ringtail lemurs. Seven of the lemurs
are currently in their exhibit and have environmental enrichment. However, during this inspection one male ringtaillemur is noted to be singly housed in a small building by himself. He cannot see or hear any other lemurs or any
other animals. His enclosure contained perch shelves along two wall and two wet-looking towels on the ground. No
toys or other enrichment items were present in the enclosure. He vocalized several times. The current written
program of veterinary care is ten years old and was approved by the attending veterinarian for the facility at that
time but has not been updated or approved by the current attending veterinarian. It states that isolated individuals
would be given toys for stimulation. Non-human primates that are individually housed and unable to see and hear
nonhuman primates of their own or compatible species must be provided with special attention regarding
enhancement of their environment to ensure their psychological well-being. The plan for environmental
enhancement shall be in accordance with currently accepted professional standards. The facility shall ensure that
this ringtail lemur receives special enhancement of his environment if he cannot be socially housed to meet his
needs and the instructions to meet his needs shall come from the current attending veterinarian.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several shelter structures have sustained damage and have openings/gaps.
*The shelter structure in the front pasture enclosure comprising the entrance to the facility (houses llama and zebu)
has a loose panel at the lower portion of the back wall of the structure creating an open gap that extends from the
ground to over 1/3 of the height of the shelter and is at least 6 inches wide.
*Both shelter structures in the sheep/goat pen have damaged or missing portions. The larger of the two shelters has
a damaged section of the lower back wall with an opening over a foot wide and about 2 ft high along with a smaller
section on one side wall with a long narrow opening about 6-8 in wide with a height of about 1/3 of the the height of
the shelter wall. The smaller shelter has a large window size opening approximately 2ftx3ft on the upper half of the
back wall.
The openings/gaps in the shelter structures may lead to injury of the animals and may fail to provide adequate
shelter from the elements. The facilities including the shelter structures shall be maintained in good repair.
Correct by 4/18/15.
3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation
***A strong urine odor was present in the 2nd stall of the giraffe barn. The stalls are currently not currenlty cleaned
on a regular schedule but as needed. There are no windows in the stall. However there are two ceiling fans
generally used to push warm air towards the floor doing cooler months, according to the caretaker. Indoor housing
facilities must be provided with fresh air or ventilated in a manner to minimize odors. Appropriate measures must be
taken to provide adequate ventilation in the giraffe stall at all time for the respiratory health of the animals and to
prevent discomfort. Correct by March 31, 2015.Inspection and exit conducted by Susanne Brunkhorst, VMO, Gloria McFaddin, VMO and two facility
representatives.
