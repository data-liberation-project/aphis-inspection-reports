ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care (PVC) for the three Ring-tailed Lemurs calls for tetanus vaccination every 10 years
with the first vaccine given at 6 months of age. The licensee has not had these animals vaccinated for tetanus.
Additionally, the PVC states that Ivomec and Pyrantel will be used on the Lemurs. The dosage, route of
administration and length of treatment are not noted on the plan for the extra label usage of these products. The
written program of veterinary care exists to ensure that there is accurate communication between the licensee and
the attending veterinarian and ensure that all routine medications and vaccines provided to the animals by the
licensee are done with the direction and knowledge of the attending veterinarian. The licensee must ensure that the
program of veterinary care is followed per the direction of the attending veterinarian.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male red kangaroo's forearms had some scabbed areas and some areas that had open sore-like areas on the
upper sides of them. The areas between its front digits also had some dry crusting on them. He was seen to
occasionally lightly pick at these areas on his arms during inspection. The facility had not noticed these lesions in
their daily observations and so the problem has not been evaluated by the attending veterinarian for treatment.
These open lesions are a sign of an active health problem that needs further evaluation by the attending
veterinarian. If not treated, this problem could cause discomfort to the red kangaroo and if contagious, could spread
to other animals in the same enclosure. Ensure that the attending veterinarian evaluates this kangaroo's condition
and follow the recommended treatment. Correct by 3/24/18.
3.75(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal surfaces in the enclosure housing three Ring-tailed Lemurs still has excessive rust to the point that the
surface was no longer smooth. The rough surface may prevent the required cleaning and sanitization, which may
lead to increased disease hazards. These surfaces need to be addressed so that excessive rust is not present and
to allow for the required cleaning and sanitization. The licensee had product on-hand at the time of inspection to
address the rust.3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility reported that on 3/7/18 two dingoes were able to unlatch a gate and escaped from their enclosure into
the same building that was housing capybara and chinchillas. The incident resulted in the death of 4 capybaras and
caused a chinchilla to be able to escape from its enclosure when the enclosure was knocked over. The facility
reports the chinchilla was later recovered and the chinchilla reportedly involved was seen to be healthy today on
inspection. In order to prevent further incidence, the licensee must ensure enclosures are adequately secured to
prevent escape, injury or death of an animal. Maintain secure enclosures from this date forward.
Note: The facility reported this incident to the USDA on 3/15/18 and has added an additional latching chain on the
enclosure door to keep the gate secure as a secondary in case they open the original latch.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The AstroTurf carpet along the front of the fox enclosure has not been removed of the excessive feces collected on
this carpet. In some areas it coats the AstroTurf so it cannot be seen. Excessive feces and excreta in enclosures
can play a role in disease transmission, lead to odors, and make conditions unpleasant for the animals if they
cannot avoid contact with the feces. The licensee must ensure that excreta and feces are removed from primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, to minimize disease hazards, and to
reduce odors.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
