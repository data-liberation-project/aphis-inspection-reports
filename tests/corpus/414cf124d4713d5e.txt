ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:35 to 5:05
PM on 11/06/2014.
I knocked on both doors and no one answered so I left a message at the phone number on file. After I had left the
facility the licensee returned my call and informed me he was still at work for the day.
