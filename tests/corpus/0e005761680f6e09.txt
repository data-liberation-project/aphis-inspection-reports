ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During inspection, three male Gottingen miniature pigs which were individually housed were determined to be in
need of medical care, but had not been seen by a veterinarian or received any form of treatment. The pigs had
circular lesions that were various color shades of brown to red and had a crusty appearance like seen with scabs.
The pig with ID number 5400644 had dime size lesions mostly around the eyes, mouth, and head. The pig with ID
number 5399123 had an approximate 1 to 2 inch lesion on the right side of the neck along with several smaller red
lesions on the inside of the left leg. The pig with ID number 5401772 had a cluster of approximately 1mm size
lesions on the outside surface of the right hip. All three pigs were bright, alert, and responsive with no signs of
systemic disease. Other than occasionally scratching, the pigs did not appear to be in distress. The lesions were not
expected adverse reactions from any procedure. According to staff in charge of the pig's care, lesions were noticed
on 9/2/2014, but thought to be healing sores. At the time of inspection, the animals had not been seen by a
veterinarian and were not being treated for any medical condition. The daily observation records were marked (cid:28)N(cid:29)
for normal for all three pigs the entire time the pigs were present at the facility. Delays in providing necessary
veterinary care negatively impacts the welfare of the animal and can lead to the worsening of the original condition
in addition to the development of secondary infections of the skin. It is the responsibility of the facility to ensure all
animals are provided veterinary care in a timely manner. Correct by ensuring all animals are adequately evaluated
and treated in a timely manner. At the time of inspection, multiple veterinarians were notified in a timely manner of
the lesions. All three pigs were evaluated by a veterinarian and are being treated as of 9/4/2014.

2.38(f)(1) DIRECT REPEATMISCELLANEOUS.
On June 17th 2014, a group of three guinea pigs were found dead in a cage from preassumed drowning. The night
before a staff member correctly recognized a leak in the cage(cid:25)'s watering system. The staff member thought she
had repaired the leak; however, the leak continued overnight and flooded the cage. On July 18th 2014, a guinea pig
cage flooded overnight resulting in the death of one guinea pig. A similar incident was cited on the previous
inspection report dated 19 August 2013. The facility must ensure the handling of all animals is done as carefully as
possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. Proper training and functional
watering mechanisms must be in place to protect all animals from injury, discomfort, and death. Since the two
adverse events, the facility identified both adverse events and reported it to OLAW while implementing changes to
prevent similar occurrences. All animal care staff have been reminded the importance of inspecting the watering
system daily and are now trained to immediately call cage wash staff, who are instructed that all cage repairs are
top priority, if there is a cage watering system malfunction. Also, the facility has contacted and hosted a cage vendor
about obtaining a more leak-resistant watering system along with contacting a vendor that designs acrylic blocks
that can be used by the animals to stand on to be out of the water should a cage flood. Furthermore, the facility is
starting nightly inspections of all guinea pig enclosures to prevent any water leaking from accumulating that could
result in a drowning. Although the IACUC is currently taking steps to minimize the chance of reoccurrence, the
current cage watering system is still a risk to the animals at this time.
The facility inspection was conducted on 9/3/2014 and the exit interview was conducted on 9/5/2014 with facility
representatives that includes the IO, AV, clinical veterinarians, IACUC members, and other animal care staff.
