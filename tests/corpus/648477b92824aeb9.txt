2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility is allowing the public to interact with an Asian Small-Claw otter without a restraint on the otter or a
barrier between the otter and the public. There have been 2 minor wounds to visitors in the one month that the otter
has been on exhibit.
During public exhibition animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of injury to the animals and the public.
Some of the ways this can be achieved are by a barrier between the public and the animal, a harness on the
animal, or training that requires the animal to respond immediately to commands.
Otters can be aggressive and have strong teeth and a powerful bite. They have the potential to cause serious injury
to a person.
