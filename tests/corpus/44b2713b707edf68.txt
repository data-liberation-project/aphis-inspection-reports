ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:15 a.m. on
17-Dec-18.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 11:15 a.m. and was not able to locate anyone. I called and left a voicemail
message and waited for 30 minutes before leaving.
