OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is one outdoor enclosure, containing two adult Shetland Sheepdogs, which has no areas of shade. The
temperature at the time of the inspection was 68 degrees F according to Weather.com and was partly sunny. Lack
of shade does not allow the dogs protection from the direct rays of the sun which may cause them discomfort and
their well-being may suffer.
Outdoor housing facilities must have one or more separate areas of shade and all shaded areas must be large
enough to contain all the animals at one time. The licensee must provide these dogs with shaded areas within their
enclosure in order to offer them protection from direct sunlight and to promote their well-being. The licensee must
ensure that all dogs housed in outdoor enclosures have access to shade at all times of the day.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
