ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Inspection of the onsite hospital medication room found several bottles of outdated medications. A complete review
needs to be done and all outdated medications removed. Outdated medications are not considered adequate
veterinary care and should not be used in animal treatments. A regular schedule of review and removal of outdated
medications needs to be in place and followed.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The temporary housing for the two red ruffed lemurs has heat lamps supplied by extension cords. The use of
extension cords for a temporary issue is acceptable but the cords are running along the side of the main enclosure
in such a manner that the lemurs could reach the cords. This presents a possible safety hazard for the lemurs and
these cords need to be relocated so the lemurs cannot reach them.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The hardware cloth covering the door on the inside of the ring-tailed lemur enclosure is pulled away from the frame
along the upper right hand corner. These results in a ragged and potentially sharp spot in the enclosure that the
lemurs could get a limb caught or receive a cut. This wire needs to be repaired or replaced and a regular schedule
of maintenance be in place and followed.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The floor of the interior enclosure on the red ruffed lemur island has peeling paint and exposed wood surfaces. This
condition does not allow for the proper cleaning and sanitizing required by USDA regulations. All surfaces must be
maintained in good repair on a regular maintenance schedule.
