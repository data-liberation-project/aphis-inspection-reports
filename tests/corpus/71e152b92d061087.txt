INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
No reports of any evaluations conducted to review the facility's program for humane care and use of the animals or

order that facility compliance with the Animal Welfare Act may be evaluated.

2.31(e)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility did not have a written protocol that contained required information pertaining to animal use. The requiredinformation should have included; the rationale for the species and number of animals to be used, a complete
description of the proposed use of the animals, a description of procedures designed to assure that discomfort and
pain to animals will be limited to that which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research, and a
description of any euthanasia method to be used.
The IACUC should ensure that a proposal to conduct activities involving animals includes the appropriate
information prior to approving the proposal. Additionally, any significant changes to activities should have IACUC
approval prior to their implementation.
Correct by: No further animal activities should take place until the IACUC approves that activity.
2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The facility had no written program of veterinary care. A part-time veterinarian is employed and had visited the
facility to care for sick animals but had not provided a written program of veterinary care.
A written program of veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility staff understands the expectations of the
attending veterinarian in regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that a written
program of veterinary care is completed by the attending veterinarian and is available for review during APHIS
inspections.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A strand of barbed wire fencing placed along the top of a section of wire fence had broken. Inside the barn bare
wires and uncovered electrical outlets were present at a level that could be accessed by the animals. A gate with a
large gap was being held together with baling twine at the bottom so that animals could not escape.
Animal housing should be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from harm and
contain them. Exposed electrical wires and uncovered outlets pose a fire risk and could also cause injury to animals
if chewed . Barbed wire may cause injuries and should be replaced with more suitable fencing. Correct by September 24, 2014.

3.129(a)
FEEDING.
A gasoline powered leaf blower was being stored on the floor next to the hay. A bag and a block of unknown
substances were found on top of a stack of hay. Machinery can leak gasoline or oil that could contaminate food and
should not be stored in close proximity to animal food. Items that could contaminate animal food should not be
placed on or above food or food containers. Partially used bags or containers of food or supplements should be kept
closed or covered to keep vermin and dirt from contaminating the contents.
Contaminated food may adversely affect animal health. Food should be stored in such a manner that it remains
wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination.

SANITATION.
A pasture and barn housing 65 animals contained debris that could cause injury to the animals. A nail and strand of
barbed wire were protruding from what appeared to be a portion of an old wooden fence on the ground in the
pasture. A golf ball and a long piece of plastic pipe were also noted in the pasture. Pieces of boards with protruding
nails and a broken shovel were found on the ground in an aisle connecting the pasture with the barn. Shelves
containing tools, a glass bottle, and a gasoline container were present in the barn at a level that could be accessed
by the animals. A fire extinguisher was mounted on a wall at a level that could be accessed by the animals. Several
fence panels and wheelbarrows were being stored against a wall inside the barn. The fence panels could be
knocked over on animals and hooves or legs could be become caught in the wheelbarrows or fence panels.
Debris and inappropriate objects in animal housing areas could harm the animals. Animal housing should be
inspected on a regular basis and any trash or debris should be promptly removed. Equipment and supplies should
be stored in an area that is not accessed by the animals.
