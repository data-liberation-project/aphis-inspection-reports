FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Leopard enclosure: A wood panel at the front entrance of an elevated den box was warping, splitting, and coming
loose from the rest of the structure. Also, a side panel of this den box has separated from a bottom corner creating
an approximately 2 inch gap and exposing a nail head. All parts of an enclosure must be kept in good repair or
replaced to protect the animals from injury. A system of maintenance and repair must be in place.
