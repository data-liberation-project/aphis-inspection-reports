RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection on 09 February 2015, most of the sale records did not include the name and/or
address of the buyer of the guinea pigs. Records must be kept on animals for animal tracking, assessment of the
animal care program and to comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that records on
animal sales are completed, kept and maintained.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Barn swallows were observed nesting in the establishment directly above the housing of weaned guinea pigs as
well as the hay storage. The establishment has an open doorway that allows for these birds to enter freely. The
presence of these birds may cause undue stress to the animals in the enclosures as well as promoting conditions
which may lead to disease. The licensee also mentioned that cats had been present in the facility and that he was
having a hard time keeping them out of the guinea pig enclosure area. The presence of cats in this area directly
subjects these animals to predation and injury or death. Licensee must ensure that the facility is structurally sound
and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals and to restrict the entrance
of other animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two of the rack pens housing the adults and pre-weaned guinea pigs were found to be in disrepair. The second
rack pen from the top and the bottom rack pen had the wire siding detached and protruding from the frame near the
waterers. The primary enclosure must be kept in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury and to containthem securely. Licensee must ensure that enclosures are kept in good repair.

3.28(c)(1)(3) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were 148 weanling guinea pigs housed in an enclosure measuring 54" x 85" or 4590 square inches. The
maximum number of guinea pigs allowed in that enclosure would be 76 based on the size of the enclosure and the
weight of the weaned guinea pigs.
There were two enclosures housing 58 weanling female guinea pigs and 70 weanling male guinea pigs respectively,
measuring 24" x 54" or 1296 square inches each. In this size enclosure can house a maximum of 21 weanling
guinea pigs.
Insufficient space can lead to aggression, undue stress and creates conditions in which promotes the spread of
disease. Weanlings weighing up to 360 grams require 60 square inches of floor space. Licensee must ensure that
adequate space is provided for the animals. The space provided must be sufficient for each guinea pig contained to
make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. The sufficient space will decrease
likelihood of aggression, stress and promotion of disease amongst the animals.

SANITATION.
There were barn swallows nesting in the facility housing the guinea pig enclosures. The open doors to the exterior
allow the birds to freely enter the facility. The presence of these pests creates conditions which promotes undue
stress for the animals and creates conditions that promote the spread of disease within the facility. An effective
program needs to be established and maintained for the control of avian species.
