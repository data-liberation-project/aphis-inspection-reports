FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the meerkat enclosure, the bottom portion of a tree trunk is covered by metal fencing material which is not
completely secured down. As a result, one section with sharp edges was noted curling back into the enclosure
which could injure an animal.
Indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury. A system should be in place to ensure areas of disrepair in animal enclosures are identified
and repaired in a timely manner.
