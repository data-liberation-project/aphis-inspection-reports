2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* Official USDA dog on hand sheets (7005's) had 44 dogs recorded, but there were 48 dogs counted by the
inspector. When the records and dogs at the facility do not match it makes the records incomplete. Complete and
accurate records are needed to ensure each animal(cid:25)s identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability
to trace dogs. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all dogs at all times at their facility.
Correct by 12/13/14.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The entrance edges to three fiberglass shelter structures are chewed exposing a jagged, roughened surface.
The shelter structures used by six dogs are located in outdoor housing. Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis
cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. A chewed, roughened surface could harbor disease causing agents
which affects the health and well-being of the dogs. The potential exists for dogs to ingest chewed plastic which
could cause potential digestion problems. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces can be readily cleaned and
sanitized or be replaced when worn. Correct by 11/27/14.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta on four fiberglass wall boards. Eight dogs are in contact with
the affected wall boards located in outdoor housing. The affected area covers approximately 25 to 30 percent of
the wall surface. Sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease
hazards. It indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or health risks. The
licensee must ensure that all surfaces are spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more
often if needed in accordance with section 3.11 B. Correct by 11/17/14.
* Facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 11/13/14 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
