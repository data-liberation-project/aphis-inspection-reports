2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** Before inspecting the giraffes outdoor pen we noticed there were two attendants, one at the giraffe stand and one
in the barn. When we returned from the back of the giraffes pen the attendant for the barn and goats was in the feed
room. This allowed public contact in the barn and by the goats without any attendant supervising the interactions.
Once we had returned while the public attendant was feeding the goats, when he should have been monitoring the
interactions of the public, the Director had to correct the public to not put a selfie stick inside of the enclosure. This
public attendant should have been there the entire time of public interaction. A readily identifiable employee or
attendant shall be present at all times during periods of public contact so that they can monitor and visualize public
contact and, intercede when necessary.There also needs to be enough attendants available to effectively monitor
all of the areas where there is public contact with the animals. This was corrected when the Director told the public
attendant to return to his area before we left the area.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the diana guenon's outdoor enclosure there is a perch off of the side of their building that had pitted sheet
metal and degraded wood. This perch is in disrepair and the structural strength could be compromised. This is not
safe for the animals and could cause injury. The perches must be sturdily constructed and must be strong enough
to provide for the safe activity and welfare of nonhuman primates. Correct by May 31, 2016.** In the red ruffed and white and black ruffed lemur encounter enclosure the night house on the right has moisture
damage to the wood inside. The surfaces den box must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that
allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. Correct by May 31,
2016.
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the outdoor enclosure for a ringtail lemur and a white and black ruffed lemur there was feces from previous
days that had not been cleaned up. The facility stated that the ringtail lemur refused to shift and therefore the
enclosure could not be cleaned. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards. Corrected by exit interview.
** The squirrel monkey's and white faced capuchin's enclosure have several natural branch perches that have been
soiled over time and need to be cleaned and/or replaced. All surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and
sanitized when necessary and if they can't be cleaned or sanitized then they need to be replaced. If the species
scent mark, the surfaces must be sanitized or replaced at regular intervals as determined by the attending
veterinarian. Correct by May 31, 2016.
3.84(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
** In the black handed spider monkeys night house outside of there enclosure there was pest feces and debris
falling out of the corner of the ceiling on to the floor around the bleach bottle. It either had not been cleaned
recently or the feces and debris was falling at a fast rate. Buildings must be kept clean and in good repair in order
to protect the nonhuman primates from disease and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for pests, and
vermin. Correct by May 14, 2016.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the black bears outdoor enclosure there was part of a black tarp surfacing out of the ground. This tarp needs to
be remove to prevent the animals from ingesting it. The enclosure shall be maintained to keep the animals from
injury. Correct by April 20, 2016.
** In the porcupine's enclosure the buried fencing in the ground was surfacing and the portion in the center of the
enclosure had a couple of pointy ends that need to be repaired. The enclosure shall be maintained to keep the
animals from injury. Corrected by exit interview.** In the outdoor giraffe pen on the northwest corner of the enclosure there was fencing that had been in disrepair
due to the animals stepping into it. It created holes in the fencing in which the giraffe could potentially catch an a leg
and injure himself. Also there were a few strands of pointy wire from the attempts to repair that were sticking out.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury. Corrected by exit interview.
3.131(c)

** The wolves indoor enclosure was located inside the supply shed. There was clutter and old vermin feces in the
pens access area for the wolves. It also seemed as if it had not been cleaned in a while because the benches in the

and well-being of the animals. Correct by May 31, 2016
