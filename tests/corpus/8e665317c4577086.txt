2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white, male Maltese, born on 8/18/11 and identified by tag #103, has an upper left canine tooth that is loose to the
touch. The dog is also constantly licking at the left side of its mouth. The licensee stated that he was unaware of the
condition and the dog has not been evaluated by a veterinarian.
Loose teeth can be an indication of dental problems and can be painful.
The dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administered. Documentation
should be available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment must be part of their
documentation. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian to develop and establish a dental plan.
The licensee stated that vaccinations are administered to puppies at five and seven weeks of age. However, the
written guidance in the facility's program of veterinary care, states that vaccinations for puppies should be
administered at six and eight weeks of age. The licensee stated that he has been administering vaccinations at
different time intervals because of requests from the broker he sells puppies to.
Failure to follow the attending veterinarian's recommendations does not ensure the dogs are receiving adequate
veterinary care. The licensee shall consult with the attending veterinarian to establish and follow the written program
of veterinary care.
The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(f) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an excessive accumulation of feces present in the waste collection trays under the outdoor runs on both
buildings. The licensee stated that the collection trays are washed out every Monday. However, the excessive
buildup of old and fresh feces is attracting numerous flies. There's also a shallow pit with stagnant waste water
under the outdoor runs on the east side of the East Building. This can provide a breeding ground for pests and
create disease hazards for the dogs.
The licensee must provide for regular and frequent collection, removal and disposal of animal waste and fluids. 3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
All of the red plastic food receptacles being used have not been regularly cleaned and sanitized. Approximately 24
food receptacles have a buildup of grime and cobwebs on the interior surfaces. The licensee stated that the food
receptacles have not been sanitized since spring. There are three dog doors on the West Building that have a layer
of dirt and grime on the surfaces and seven on the East Building, affecting 20 adult dogs. The licensee also stated
that the primary enclosures have not been sanitized since spring.
Failure to properly clean and sanitize the surfaces in the primary enclosures can potentially lead to disease hazards
for the dogs.
The licensee must ensure that the primary enclosures, food and water receptacles are sanitized at least once every
two weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other
disease hazards.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outdoor runs have an excessive number of flies on and near the surfaces. Most of the flies are present in the
waste collection tray directly under the enclosures. The licensee does not have an effective pest control program in
place to control the excessive numbers of flies around the outdoor runs.
Not having an adequate pest control program can increase disease hazards which can affect the health and
well-being of the dogs.
The licensee must consult the attending veterinarian to establish and follow an effective pest control program.
