SANITATION.
The rabbit enclosure, housing 22 rabbits, has a solid floor with straw litter. There is a large accumulation of rabbit
fecal pellets mixed within the straw throughout the entire enclosure. The facility representative stated that the litter is
due for changing as they do it about once a month. Soiled litter can lead to odors, attract pests, spread disease and
lead to contamination of haircoat/feet of the rabbits. Soiled litter shall be removed and replaced with clean litter at

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing one pot belly pig needs repairs.
*There is a piece of rebar material present along the ground across the width of the area the pig inhabits with metal
prongs about 1/2 in circumference protruding 4 to 8 inches into the air. The pig may injure itself crossing this piece
of material while walking down the length of the enclosure.
* There is an opening under the fenceline where erosion has occurred and the fence is not secured at ground level.The opening is about 4-6 inches high and extends about 18 to 24 inches. Unwanted animals may enter the
enclosure causing harm or stress to the pig.
*There is an area of rocks that have cascaded down the hill into the bottom portion of the enclosure where the
retaining wall has not held its place. Further erosion can occur leading to possible injury.
Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury, to contain the animals and to prevent unwanted animals from entering.
