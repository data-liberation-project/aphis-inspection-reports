Facilities, outdoor.
Two outside enclosures were observed without adequate shelters against climatic conditions. One contained two brown
coatimundis with raised platforms, shade structures and partial wind breaks. Additional sheltered space should be
provided to this enclosure to reasonably expect adequate protection from the elements. Another enclosure contained 6
ring tail lemurs. Shade, wind breaks were provided as well as a small "hut" type enclosure. This enclosure is not of
sufficient size to allow entry of all 6 lemurs simultaneously and provide adequate shelter without overcrowding issues.
Additional sheltered space should be provided to this enclosure that would allow use by all enclosed animals without
overcrowding issues to allow for protection from the elements and prevent discomfort to the animals. To be corrected by:
