FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Goat enclosure:
- Several areas of the wire fencing in this enclosure were in disrepair, creating gaps and some sharp, protruding
points within contact of the animals which could cause injury.
- Along a bottom section (approximately 4 feet long) of fencing, soil erosion has created a gap or opening large
enough that the animals may potentially become trapped or injured.
Sheep enclosure:
- There was a section of thin, wire fencing in disrepair which covered a green metal gate and created loose,
detached areas with openings/gaps. Additionally, there were sharp pointed wire ends of fencing material in some
sections of this enclosure which were also in areas of potential contact with the animals and could lead to injury.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and
maintenance must be in place.
