2.134(a)

Contingency planning.
The licensee did not have a written contingency plan. Not having a contingency plan could result in losses or harm to
animals in an emergent event that may have been preventable. Licensees must develop, document and follow an
appropriate plan for humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of animals in the event of emergency
or disaster. Correct by 2/22/2023.
3.6(b)(1)(i)

Primary enclosures.
All of the primary enclosures housing cats were shorter than the required 24 inches in height. The queening enclosures
had heights of 22 inches and all the other enclosures were 23 inches high. Inadequate vertical space may not allow cats
to display species-specific behavior. The minimum vertical space for housing cats to meet welfare needs is 24 inches.
Correct by 3/31/2023 by housing cats in enclosures that meet space and height requirements.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Primary enclosures are not being sanitized at an appropriate frequency. The licensee stated that the surfaces in the
primary enclosures for cats are cleaned daily with a vinegar/water mixture and as needed with a sanitizing product, at a
frequency greater than every 2 weeks. Not sanitizing surfaces in a cat’s primary enclosure at least every 2 weeks can


increase the risk of a disease hazard. The licensee must sanitize surfaces the cats come into contact with in their primary
enclosures, including food and water receptacles, at least every 2 weeks. Correct by 2/8/2023.
