2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 7 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A brown and tan weanling in Pen 41, brown and black
weanling in Pen 39, brown and tan weanling in Pen 36, tan and white and 2 brown and white weanlings in Pen 35, and
brown and white weanling in Pen 69 had circular areas of hair loss and flaky skin or scabs around the nose, eyes, and
forehead. The licensee had observed the skin problems but had not contacted the attending veterinarian and was not
administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the condition and provided treatment
options.
Skin conditions with hair loss and scabs can cause discomfort, spread to other animals if infectious in nature, and worsen
if not treated.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending veterinarian to
determine an appropriate plan of diagnosis and treatment.
