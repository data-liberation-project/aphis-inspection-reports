CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In a building housing multiple indoor exhibits, there were five live roaches observed on the rocks and floor in the
enclosure housing two white-fronted marmosets and one southern tamandua. Pest control measures must be
maintained to prevent the harborage of pests, i.e. insects. Effective pest control measures must be identified and
implemented to eliminate breeding and living areas for the roaches to minimize exposure to pathogens that may
cause illness. An effective program for control of insects must be established and maintained so as to promote the
health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
