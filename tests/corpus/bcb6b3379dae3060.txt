Personnel qualifications.
In a drawer in the room where the hamsters were housed, there was a clear plastic bottle containing diluted Buprenex
with a needle hub left piercing the rubber stopper of the bottle. Faculty at the facility confirmed it was actively being used
on the hamsters for post-operative pain management. With the needle hub being affixed to the rubber stopper of the
bottle, without a syringe, this allows air and other particulates to contaminate the drug contained therein. Furthermore,
storage of diluted Buprenex in a plastic bottle could potentially diminish the efficacy of the drug. Training and instruction of
personnel must include guidance in the proper use of analgesics for any species of animals used by the facility. The bottle
was removed at the time of the inspection.

2.33(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
During the inspection, there were several expired drugs found – all of which were being used, or intended to be used, on
the animals. An expired bottle of Ketoprofen, a bottle of Cetacaine Topical Anesthetic Spray, and a small vial of Lidocaine
HCl, were identified among the actively used drugs. There were no precautions or labels to indicate these medications


were not to be used. Usage of expired drugs can cause injury to the animals, as well as be ineffective for their intended
use. The facility must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that use appropriate methods to
prevent, control, and treat diseases and injuries. The drugs were all pulled and set aside to prevent future use at the time
of the inspection.
