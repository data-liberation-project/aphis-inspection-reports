2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs was not available during this inspection. Approximately 284 adult guinea pigs, weanlings,
and newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records maintained since the last inspection
report. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by identifying animal
losses by decreased number of guinea pigs born or raised. The licensee must maintain records containing the required
information for animals which discloses the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired, or disposed of including births
and deaths. Correct by August 30, 2022.
3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
Space. Insufficient space was being provided to two enclosures housing weanlings. Weanling enclosures measure 40
inches by 30 inches or 1200 square inches of floor space. Maximum number of weanling guinea pigs in this size
enclosure is 20. One enclosure had 29 weanlings and the second enclosure had 35 weanlings.

Inadequate space can cause stress, overcrowding, and increased aggression in animals which can result in fights, bites,
and injuries. Weanling guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams require at least 60 square inches of floor space. Licensee

must ensure that guinea pigs are provided with at least the minimum amount of floor space per animal to prevent
unnecessary stress, discomfort, and/or aggression. Correct by August 30, 2022.
3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
There were 8 enclosures housing a total of 207 guinea pigs on the left side of the building with accumulations of excreta,
soiled bedding, and debris covering the floors. Enclosures were last cleaned over a week ago. The cleaning process
(method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this accumulation. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation can
expose the guinea pigs to disease hazards and health risks. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent
accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, and debris. In addition, enclosures must be sanitized at least every two weeks.
Remains uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
