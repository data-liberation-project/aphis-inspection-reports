RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the inspection on August 24, 2015, records of animal births and deaths were not maintained for the guinea
pigs. Records must be kept on animals for animal tracking, assessment of the animal care program, and to comply
with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that records on animal births and deaths are kept
and maintained. Correct from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
