3.53(a)(1) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The rabbit enclosure was empty and the facility reported there had been 3 rabbits that had gone missing in the last
few days. At the base of the enclosure, the chain link fence was pushed outward where the fence meets the
ground. There was also a hole in the tarp on the top of the enclosure which could serve as an entry point for
predators. The enclosure is not sufficient to contain the rabbits and protect them from predators. The facility must
provide enclosures for rabbits that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from
injury, to contain them, and to keep predators out.
CORRECT BY: 8-22-19
Note: The facility stated they would no longer house rabbits.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the President and Vice President.
