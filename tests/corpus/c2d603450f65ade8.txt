3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
(a) Structural strength. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the
animals involved.

The following item is still in need of repair:

The ceiling of the Brocket deer shelter has been partially repaired. However, peeling paint is still present along the front
wall as well as in the center of the stall. Brown water stains are also still present on the ceiling adjacent to the repair.
Peeling paint could fall to the floor and be ingested by the deer. The damaged ceilings should be repaired to eliminate
peeling paint and to maintain the facility in good repair.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
