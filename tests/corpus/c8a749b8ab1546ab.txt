3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
There was one guinea pig pen (Pen 80 housing 8 guinea pigs) in which the wire sides of the pen were broken resulting in
a gap approximately 2 x 3 inches in size with sharp exposed wire points.
Sharp points can cause injury to guinea pigs and gaps can lead to animal escape and injury.
Enclosures for guinea pigs must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
