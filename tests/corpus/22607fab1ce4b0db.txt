Facilities, general.
The enclosure housing three Angora goats has a damaged area of the fence large enough for an animal to get potentially
trapped. The back fence line of the sheep enclosure is created with large panels of wood running vertically like a privacy
fence. On the back right fence line there is one full piece of wood missing along with a large section of wood missing from
the adjacent panel. The widest part of the opening measures 10" in diameter. In combination, these two holes are large
enough for one of the sheep to stick their head through and either become caught by their horns or rip off more boards of
the back fence, allowing them to escape the pasture.

Failure to maintain enclosures can allow for gaps which can result in injury, entrapment or escape of animals.

Correct by ensuring all facilities are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
