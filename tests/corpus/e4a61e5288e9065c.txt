HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
There was no health certificate for a light brown puppy approximately 8 weeks of age shipped from Ohio to
Pennsylvania (see air waybill # 001 CVG 11921140) on October 12, 2017. No carrier to whom a dog or puppy is
delivered for transportation shall receive a live dog, cat, or nonhuman primate for transportation, in commerce,
unless it is accompanied by a health certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian. Failure to obtain a health
certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian may result in a sick or ill animal being transported in commerce.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
There were no markings on top of the transport enclosure for a light brown puppy with the words "Live Animals"
shipped from Ohio to Pennsylvania on October 12, 2017 (see air waybill # 001 CVG 11921140). Primary enclosures
must be clearly marked on top and on more or more sides with the word "Live Animals" in letters at least one inch
high and with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the enclosure. Carriers and
intermediate handlers must not transport any dog or cat in commerce unless the primary enclosure is clearly
marked on top with the words "Live Animals" in letters at least one inch high to prevent the enclosure from being
transported incorrectly.
3.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
There were no food and water receptacles attached inside the transport enclosure for a light brown puppy
approximately 8 weeks of age shipped from Ohio to Pennsylvania on October 12, 2017 (see air waybill # 001 CVG
11921140). Carriers and intermediate handles must not accept any dog or cat for transport without having food and
water receptacles attached inside the primary enclosure so that the receptacles can be filled from outside the
enclosure without opening the door to prevent escape during transport.
