3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The shift door on the cotton-top tamarin and the emperor tamarin enclosure is rusted in several areas on the
surface of the door frame. Excessive rust can prevent effective sanitization of the surface, which may affect the
health of the animals through buildup of pathogens.
***In the chimpanzee enclosure there was rust on the metal brackets holding the elevated platforms. There was
also peeling paint in several areas on the back wall of the enclosure. Excessive rust and peeling paint can prevent
effective sanitization of the surface, which may affect the health of the animals through buildup of pathogens.
Surfaces which come into contact with nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust and constructed in such a
manner to promote effective cleaning and sanitization of the surface and preserve structural strength.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** In the petting zoo containing sheep, potbellied pigs and goats there was a shade structure that had a wooden 2
x 6 that had come loose and could fall causing injury.
*** In the red panda enclosure there was an area of the ceiling that was rotten. This rotten area could have pieces
of material that could fall into the enclosure and cause injury or be harmful if ingested.
The facilities should be structurally sound and maintained to protect the animals from injury. Correct by November

3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. *** The smaller outdoor enclosure containing 2 tigers had an area of water and mud that encompassed about
one-third of the enclosure. An area that doesn'(cid:25)t drain and allows water and mud to accumulate has the potential to
cause sanitation related diseases. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. Correct
