3.10(a) Direct Repeat

Watering
There is nothing being done to protect the drinking water from freezing. The facility representative acknowledged that
when the ambient temperatures falls below freezing, the drinking water is freezing over night when they are not out to
attend to it. When searching noaa.gov for the licensee's zip code, the lowest overnight temperatures within the last three
days ranged from 21 to 26 degrees F. Dogs that do not have continuous access to water can become dehydrated and
inadequate water consumption can exacerbate some medical problems. The licensee must ensure that potable water is
continuously available to the dogs. Frozen water is not potable water as it cannot be consumed.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
