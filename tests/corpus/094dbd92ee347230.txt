ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two brown goats were noted to be underweight. One goat was very thin with prominent hips, ribs and spinal
structure. This goat was noted to be thin by the CEO of the facility and given a dewormer a couple of weeks ago
according to the CEO. The inspectors were provided with an unopened bag of this pelleted dewormer. There were
no records of administration of this dewormer and when asked about the amount used the CEO said he guessed.
This goat is dangerously thin and with winter coming is at real risk that its condition will lead to suffering and
possible death. Consultation with the facility attending veterinarian is needed regarding the condition of this goat.
Testing results, diagnosis and treatment recommendations and records must be available to APHIS inspectors at
the next inspection. Consult the veterinarian and have records available by 10:30 AM on September 30, 2016.
The lemur known as Peanut has died since the time of the last inspection. Records shown to the inspectors
indicate that Peanut had an initial veterinary exam showing some partial paralysis on 7/26/2016 and subsequent to
that there was a necropsy report that was dated 9/26/16. There are no additional records of exams, treatments and
whether or not the animal was euthanized or died of its own accord. This lack of records gives APHIS inspectors no
indication if the animal received appropriate care and treatment for its condition. Veterinary records are critical part
of veterinary medical care. Veterinary records must be created and maintained for all animals requiring veterinary
care. Create and maintain and have available to APHIS inspectors veterinary medical records for animals requiring
treatment.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility has not yet updated its record of animals on hand to reflect its current inventory. The facility has also
disposed of two goats since the time of the last inspection and there is no address information recorded for the
person acquiring these goats. This information must be maintained accurately and made available to APHIS
inspectors when requested. This information is needed to properly evaluate the facilities compliance with the AWA
standards.
Correct by: Update animal inventory by 10-7-16. Record all animal acquisition and disposition information from thistime forward.
2.131(a)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The alpaca noted as needing to be sheared on the inspection of 7-27-16 was never sheared. None of the three
alpacas at the facility were sheared this year. It is now to late in the season to shear them as cold weather is
coming soon. Shearing is important as an animal welfare issue as alpacas do not shed their fleece. They have an
exceptionally thermal fleece, and will overheat in summer if their fleece is not regularly removed. Shear your
alpacas each year in the spring. This schedule allows them to have short wool in the summer heat and long wool
through the winter. The CEO of the facility claims that alpacas need not be sheared. The inspectors confirmed that
this is not the case by consulting multiple online resources available to any member of the public. The CEO has no
knowledge of the basic husbandry needs of these alpacas. Licensees must demonstrate adequate knowledge of
the species they maintain. The licensee must learn about these alpacas so that they can be kept according to basic
husbandry standards. Keep records of books or online sources consulted for APHIS inspector review.
Correct by: 10-29-16.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
While inspecting the facility, the inspectors noticed a cage located just outside the perimeter fence but on the
property of the sanctuary. Mewing could be heard coming from the enclosure. When asked what was in the
enclosure the CEO responded cats. He stated that these cats were not inspected by us as they were outside the
perimeter fence. We informed him that all covered species on the property were subject to our inspection. As we
approached the cage, four cats within the enclosure began frantically mewing and climbing up the wire sides of the
enclosure. This enclosure contained no food, water or litter box. The cats in this enclosure must be provided with
access to clean litter for body waste material. Cats are a species which desire to excrete body waste into a
substrate which can then be used to cover the waste material. They will hesitate to urinate and defecate in the
absence of clean litter material. This can lead to unnecessary discomfort to these cats. Provide a litter box with
clean litter for these cats.

property of the sanctuary. Mewing could be heard coming from the enclosure. When asked what was in the
enclosure the CEO responded cats. He stated that these cats were not inspected by us as they were outside theperimeter fence. We informed him that all covered species on the property were subject to our inspection. As we
approached the cage, four cats within the enclosure began frantically mewing and climbing up the wire sides of the
enclosure. This enclosure contained no food, water or litter box. We requested that the cats be given water. When
water was placed in the receptacle, all four cats jumped off the fence and rushed to the water and began drinking.
All cats drank continuously for three minutes while the inspector watched. The inspector then requested that the
cats be given food. Despite the fact that all the cats had just been drinking water for three straight minutes, two of
the four immediately began eating. These were all juvenile cats of approximately 16 weeks of age. They should be
allowed access to food ad lib while in this growing stage. Have food continuously available to these cats as this is
appropriate for their age.
Correct by: Correct immediately.

water was placed in the receptacle, all four cats jumped off the fence and rushed to the water and began drinking.
All cats drank continuously for three minutes while the inspector watched. This is way too long. These cats had
obviously not been given water for quite some time. These cats were suffering due to a lack of water. These cats
must be provided water as often is as needed but at least twice daily for one hour each time. Provide appropriate
water for these cats.
Correct by: Correct immediately.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The llama enclosure fence has a post that has broken off at its base. A metal fence post was driven in to support it
but has become loose. The fence is sagging in this area and sways when pushed. This enclosure is no longer
adequate to contain this llama and protect it from possible injury. Repair this enclosure fence.
The enclosure housing one brown alpaca has an area where the wire fence attaches to the shelter building. This
fence has become loose and multiple wire points are protruding. Any of these wire points could cause a serious
eye or facial injury to the alpaca housed in this enclosure. Repair this fence.The enclosure housing two Syrian Brown bears has a corner of the enclosure where the bears have been digging.
The underground fence wire has been exposed and with continued digging the animals may weaken the enclosure
and escape. These animals are dangerous and an escape from the enclosure could lead to injury of volunteer
employees or death of one of the bears. This enclosure needs to be repaired.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The produce cooler contains spoiled produce. Deteriorating and liquefying bags and heads of lettuce were present
in the cooler. Spoiled produce must be removed promptly to prevent contamination of food intended to be fed to the
animals. Sort and remove spoiled produce promptly. This cooler needs to be cleaned and have spoiled and
deteriorating items removed in order to prevent contamination of food items that will be fed to the animals.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was excessive feces and food waste in the enclosure for the Syrian Brown bears. This enclosure needs to be
cleaned on a more frequent basis. This rotting material and feces can lead to pest control issues. The rotting
material present in these animals'(cid:25) enclosure can contaminate these animals as they lay in their enclosure. The
animals can ingest this material when they groom themselves. Not removing old food waste promptly can lead to
contamination of new food. Ingesting this rotten material can lead to potential health problems. Clean this
enclosure more frequently to prevent a buildup of food and fecal waste to minimize odors and prevent potential
health problems.
3.132 DIRECT REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of properly trained employees can
result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Of special concern on this
inspection was the conditions under which four juvenile cats were held on facility property. To keep these cats in an
enclosure with no food, water or litter box demonstrates a very indifferent attitude towards animal welfare at the
facility. These cats were suffering. This is animal cruelty. It is this culture of indifference to basic needs of animals
that puts all animals at the facility in danger. Animal numbers must be reduced or more properly trained workers
need to be added. A facility schedule needs to be developed that allows for adequate employee coverage in order
to address all animal husbandry needs. For the most part, the facility CEO is the only one authorized to work with
the dangerous animals at the facility as the other authorized party has very limited availability. All animal work mustbe done with the dangerous animals under his direct supervision. This limits the amount of time that is available to
service the dangerous animal enclosures as the facility CEO is often offsite. This leads to poor sanitation in the
dangerous animal enclosures. The facility CEO needs to find a way to be onsite more or hire trained staff to help
run the facility.
This inspection was conducted with the CEO and a new member of the sanctuary board. An exit interview was
conducted with APHIS representatives Kurt Hammel and Carrie Bongard , the CEO and board member at the
conclusion of the inspection. The non-compliant items were discussed and clear expectations for the direct
non-compliant items were communicated to the CEO and board member.
A formal exit interview was conducted with the CEO and APHIS representative Kurt Hammel on 9-30-16.
Also discussed at the exit interview was the delay at the facility between the arrival of the inspectors and the
beginning of the facility inspection. APHIS inspectors arrived at the facility at 11:15 AM. The CEO greeted them
and said he had something to do for a few minutes. About 10 to 15 minutes later he came back and said that he
had to shut off water somewhere. The CEO then stated that he had a new board member that he wanted to have
present for the inspection and that he would now call him. The CEO wished to wait for an inspection of paperwork
and the facility until this board member was present. APHIS inspectors agreed to wait. The board member arrived
at about 12:30 PM. Paperwork was reviewed and the facility inspection began at about 1:00 PM. This was
approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes after APHIS had arrived at the facility. We stated that our expectation is that
the facility inspection will begin within 15 minutes of our arrival at the facility from this time forward.
