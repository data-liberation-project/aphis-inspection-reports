CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
A four month old dog arrived at SFO on an AeroMexico flight from Guanajuato, having traveled in baggage, with
baggage tag number AM 8139499381. The primary enclosure did not have any feeding and watering instructions in
writing attached.

instructions are attached to the enclosure, could be detrimental to the well-being of the animal, as feeding and
watering may be required in transit.
This requirement should be met for all animals traveling on AeroMexico flights from this time forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
A four month old dog arrived at SFO on an AeroMexico flight from Guanajuato, having traveled in baggage, with
baggage tag number AM 8139499381. The primary enclosure did not have the words "Live Animal" in letters at
least one inch high on the top and one or more sides, nor did it have the arrows to denote the upright position of the
enclosure.
Failure to ensure that the words "Live Animal", and arrows to denote the upright position, appear on the enclosure
could be detrimental to the well-being of the animal, as they could result in improper handling of the animal in
transit.
This requirement should be met for all animals traveling on AeroMexico flights from this time forward.

FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
A four month old dog arrived at SFO on an AeroMexico flight from Guanajuato, having traveled in baggage, with
baggage tag number AM 8139499381. The primary enclosure did not have food and water receptacles in theenclosure.
Failure to ensure that there are food and water receptacles securely attached inside the enclosure could be
detrimental to the well-being of the animal, as it makes it difficult to offer food and water during transit, as required
according to animal welfare act regulations.
This requirement should be met for all animals traveling on AeroMexico flights from this time forward.
The inspection took place in the customs area, and an exit interview was conducted at the ticket counter with an
AeroMexico representative.
