2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female lemur had a wound on the 4th digit of her left hand and the digit was swollen about twice its normal
size. The wound was red and hairless and did not appear fresh because there was no bleeding and the wound did
not have open or raw edges. Neither the licensee or her staff were aware of the lesion and the lemur was not
receiving veterinary care for the wound. Untreated skin lesions can be painful and can become infected. The
licensee must have this lemur examined by a veterinarian, must follow treatment recommendations, and must keep
a medical record to be presented to the inspector upon request.
3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(d) Pest Control.
The licensee does not have an effective rodent control program in the primate facility. Two mouse traps were set in
the building, but there were large amounts of rodent feces in the feed receptacles of two empty enclosures, on the
floor, and under the steam cleaner. A plastic bag with moldy residue of vegetables and/or fruit and a cardboard box
that had contained treats were laying in the feces inside the building. Rodents can carry and spread organisms that
can cause disease in primates. The licensee must ensure that the facility has an effective rodent control program,
must ensure that rodent waste is removed on a regular basis, and must ensure that used food containers are
disposed of properly so that they don't attract pests.
TO BE CORRECTED BY APRIL 8, 2014.
3.85
EMPLOYEES.
The facility had fewer employees during the past winter and has had a recent change in staff. The condition of the
primate facility and the lack of awareness of the wounded lemur indicate that the facility is understaffed and/or hasemployees who are not adequately trained in the husbandry and care of primates. Inadequate staff or
inadequately-trained staff can result in below standard housing conditions, failure to recognize injured or sick
animals, and improper care of the animals. The licensee must ensure that the facility is adequately staffed and
must ensure that staff are sufficiently trained in the care and husbandry of primates.
TO BE CORRECTED BY APRIL 30, 2014.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
