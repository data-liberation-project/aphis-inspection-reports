FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The south holding gates in section 5 have a large gap where they meet. The support posts have been hit and this
has caused the gates to separate so they no longer fit together properly These posts and gates need to be repaired
or replaced so the gates function properly and to protect the animals from possible injury.
The gates to the service chute in the back holding area for the rhinos in Pen 3 are rusting excessively. The rusted
areas are bubbling and flaking. These gates are in need of repair or replacement.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence for Sections 5 and 6 on the north side is in disrepair. The top four feet of chain mesh is bent
over and mangled in several areas. These sections need to be repaired or replaced to achieve the required eight
feet in height, to be structurally sound and to function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the
facility.

SANITATION.
In the hay storage area several miscellaneous items were scattered about which included drink bottles, food
wrappers and baling twine. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to
protect the feed area from contamination and to discourage vermin.
The hay storage semis had a buildup of hay and dirt at the base of the doors which made opening and closing the
doors difficult. This buildup needs to be cleaned up and the area kept free of it to facilitate the proper function of the
doors.In the petting zoo feed room there was excess hay and dirt under and around the pallets and the fan and light
switches. The ventilation fan in this room was covered in dirt and in need of cleaning. Buildup of dirt and debris in
an electrical fan can cause a fire. The plastic cover for the fluorescent light fixture in this room is broken and needs
to be replaced.
In the camel feed room, loose feed was found on the floor and an open bag of feed was setting outside of the feed
bins. The feed room needs to be cleaned of feed spillage and open bags kept in the covered containers. One of
the feed bins has a broken cover. A new cover is needed so it fits properly and protects the feed from possible
contamination.

SANITATION.
In the sheltered area for "Buck" the male rhino there were a lot of biting flies. Two fly traps were hung in the area
but were empty of any bait. This area needs increased pest control for flies.
In the same enclosure, in the night quarters, the bull pen gates were covered with bird droppings. These droppings
need to be cleaned off the gates and an effective program for the control of avian pests shall be established and
maintained.
On the back side of the enclosure there is a drain for water run off which has old debris built up on the cover. This
wet waste material is a haven for pests and needs to be cleaned up and disposed of properly.
