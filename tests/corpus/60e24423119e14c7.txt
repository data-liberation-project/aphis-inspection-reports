Housing facilities, general.
* The wire strands of two welded wire outside enclosure gates are bent and breaking apart. In addition the wire strands
have become detached allowing the dogs to stick their heads through the fencing. Five dogs are in contact with the
affected enclosure gates. The ability to contain the animals securely is greatly affected and could lead to potential injury,
if the enclosure fencing is not kept in good repair. Containment of animals is necessary from potential escape or injury
which could have a negative impact on the well-being of the animals. * The wire strands of two welded wire enclosure

that they are structurally sound. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain
the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. Correct by 8/3/22.
3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
* Five outdoor enclosures housing nine adult dogs have an accumulation of excreta on 10 to 20 percent of the enclosure
flooring. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, excreta and other disease hazards. It

indicates unsanitary living conditions exist that could increase the risks of disease transmission, which negatively affects
the health of the dogs. Accumulations of excreta can potentially create odors, serve as an attractant for flies, insects and
other pests. In addition, an accumulation of excreta reduces the clean surface area available for the dogs to walk on.
Adequate cleaning is a crucial aspect of animal husbandry and helps to reduce disease hazards, odors and pests.
Excreta could potentially cause soiling on the body of the dog in contact with the affected area. The licensee must
remove excreta and food waste from the primary enclosure daily and from under the primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs contained in the
primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. Correct by 7/28/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
