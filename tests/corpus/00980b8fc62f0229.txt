Facilities, outdoor.
The two Patagonian cavy currently have two shelter structures set on damp ground in their enclosure. One has open
sides and is not insulated. The other is an insulated igloo type structure without a flap at the opening. Neither shelter
structure contained any bedding or heat source at the time of inspection. The temperature at time of inspection was 43
degrees with a low overnight of 37 degrees (weather.com). Cavy are hardy animals but do need some sources for warmth
in colder temperatures (such as bedding materials and/or supplemental heat) to prevent discomfort and hypothermia.
The cavy kept outdoors shall be provided with shelter appropriate to the colder weather conditions. Corrected during the
inspection.

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility representative stated she has mailed a variance request to Animal Care regarding the current perimeter fence
about 3-4 weeks ago (not yet received). No changes to the perimeter or enclosure fencing have been made since the last
inspection. The facility exhibits the following species outdoors: prairie dogs, cavy and an African Crested porcupine. The
outdoor housing facilities for the prairie dogs and African Crested porcupine are enclosed by fencing acting as a perimeter
fence but it is not six feet high at all times (ranges from 2 feet high on one side to 4-5 feet high on the rest of the sides).


The cavy are not fully enclosed within a complete perimeter fence as required (two sides of the enclosure also act as the
perimeter fence).
A perimeter fence protects the animals by restricting unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or
under it and having contact with the animals in the facility and also functions as a secondary containment system for the
animals. The facility shall ensure that the outdoor housing facilities are enclosed by a perimeter fence at least six feet high
and more than three feet in distance from the primary enclosures or receive written approval for fencing that does not
meet those requirements.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
