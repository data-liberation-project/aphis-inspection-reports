There were three bottles of expired medications (1 vial of rabies vaccine exp.9-30-15 & 2 bottles gentocin injectable

2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The puma and lion exhibit had public barriers that were deficient.
The puma barrier had a gap that the public could easily walk towards the enclosure and reach the animals. The lion
exhibit barrier on the right side does not extend downwards sufficiently, which allows the public to reach under this
barrier and put fingers through this enclosure that contains dangerous animals.
These areas do not have an employee to monitor the public at all times.
There shall be adequate distance or barriers to prevent the public from injury.
Correct by February 28, 2016.
3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The floor of the baboon overhang shelter structure has worn down exposing rough rock from the concrete mix in 2
areas near the food receptacles. The current condition of the concrete is now porous. There was a odor emanating
from this area which may be due to the porous nature of the concrete and its inability to be completely cleanable
&/or sanitizable.
The surfaces of housing facilities within the facility--must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that
allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
To be corrected by February 28, 2016.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There has been no correction to the sugar glider den box since the last inspection. The sugar glider den box
continues to have chewed edges with splinters which may cause injury to the animals.
The lion den area has a metal chute where the weighting scale is kept. The lower horizontal metal bars of this chute
are completely deteriorated with rust in various areas that no longer makes it structurally sound.
Facilities must be constructed of such materials and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved to
prevent injury and contain the animals.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wall near the freezer door, the ceiling, hanging down from the blower fans, and on the boxes of food near this
area had large buildups ice condensate on them. There was a greater amount of condensate observed since the
last inspection, and there appears that there has not been any corrective action. The freezer gasket was in disrepair
which might be contributing to the greater amount of ice condensate observed. Ice condensate may contaminate
the food contained in the boxes stored in the freezer.
A hole was observed in the roof of the hay storage container which allows rain water, leaves, insects, vermin, etc.,
to contaminate &/or wet the hay. The hay underneath the hole has debris which had fallen from the hole in the roof.
Supplies of food shall be stored in facilities, and in a manner, which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration or contamination. Consult with a refrigeration technician to determine the cause of the condensate
and repair accordingly. Repair or replace the roof in the hay storage container.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The drinking water for the tigers continues to be dirty.
Dirty water may increase the possibility of bacterial contamination and may decrease palatability.
All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary to protect the health of the animal.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
In the camel and sable barn when the pallets were lifted, dirt, caked feed & cockroaches were observed around the
area.The areas adjacent to the hay storage container structure still has long standing accumulations of hay in front of the
entry door. Pallets scattered on the side were located around the area of this storage container. There was large
accumulation of pelleted feed scattered in front of the door of the feed container.
These areas can attract & harbor pests and facilitate vermin reproduction if not removed in a timely manner.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this
subpart.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cockroaches were observed under the pallets in the camel barn and sable barn.
A rat and mouse were also observed in these areas. The mouse was observed inside a bait box that contained no
bait.
A new pest control company has begun to provide service to the licensee. Out of 20 random rodent bait boxes that
were inspected, 14 didn't have any bait inside (70 %). There was no visible roach control devices and/or treatments
in these areas.
The bait boxes should be inspected more frequently to ensure that there is bait inside.
In order to prevent food contamination or diseases transmitted by pest or vermin, a more effective program to
control pest shall be established and maintained.
An exit interview was conducted by Dr. Robert Brandes and Dr. Luis Navarro with the attending veterinarian.
