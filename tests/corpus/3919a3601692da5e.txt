ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One of the sheep in the back sheep and goat pen had multiple, non inflamed, large areas of hairloss covering at
least 40% of its body. It was explained that this is not a new occurance, and this sheep normally rubs its wool along
the fence panels, with goats contributing to the problem by chewing at the wool of this sheep. This sheep had not
yet been evlauated by the attending veterinarian for this problem.
Large areas of hairloss in sheep and other animals are abnormal, and may signify underlying illness. This can
include parasitic, viral, and some systemic diseases. As certain types of illness causing hairloss and/or itching can
be transmitted to other animals, it is important to have animals with patches of hairloss or evidence of excessive
rubbing evaluated by a veterinarian. Itching can also cause the animal discomfort.
Prompt and appropriate diagnosis, treatment and control of the disease is necessary and, in this case, can prevent
the problem from potentially spreading to the other sheep and goats. Treatment should also make the animal more
comfortable.
