INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol #1501002 involves peroneal nerve injury in sheep that is expected to result in hoof knuckling on the injured
side. The protocol states that rubber mats and shavings will be placed on the floor of the enclosure to minimize
pressure on the hind limb incision and soft bedding will be used to prevent ulceration of the skin from knuckling.
At the time of the inspection at least 4 of 5 sheep were observed with bandaged fetlocks because they had
developed ulcers/pressure wounds as a result of knuckling. Although rubber mats were observed in the enclosures,
no shavings or soft bedding were provided. The clinical veterinarian stated no shavings or special beddings had
been used for these sheep.
Failure to provide soft bedding as outlined in this IACUC approved protocol may have contributed to the
development of pressure wounds on these four sheep. Any significant protocol changes must be reviewed and
approved prior to implementation.
Correct by: All research studies must be conducted in accordance with IACUC approved guidelines.
