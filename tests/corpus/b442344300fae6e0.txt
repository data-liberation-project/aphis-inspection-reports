Facilities, general.
The largest goat and sheep enclosure fence has multiple areas of disrepair. The enclosure fence is constructed of wood
posts and 1in x 1in wire panels. At least three areas of the 1in x 1in wire panel are partially detached from the wood
posts. This has resulted in exposed wire points that are accessible to the animals. Additionally, two sections of the fence
are leaning inward towards the animals. Finally, the standalone shelter structure is in disrepair. The shelter roof is
constructed of shingled plywood. One section of the roof, approximately 3ft x 3ft, has excessive water damage with a
hole and warped plywood. The facility has placed some new plywood on the underside of the shelter, but the warped
plywood and part of the hole are still present/visible from below. The wire points can potentially injure the animals. The
leaning fence and damaged section of the shelter roof, if left unrepaired, could collapse. Repair or replace the affected
areas of fence and the shelter.
