2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current written program of veterinary care (PVC) on file is not complete. The following information is lacking on
the PVC:
1) There is no information listed for internal and external parasite control for the guinea pigs.
2) The method of euthanasia and who will carry out euthanasia is not listed.
3) Ivermectin and Blue Kote were present in animal building, but there is no information on the type, dosage, route,
frequency, and instructions for use for these medications.
Failure to provide a written program of veterinary care with sufficient detail will lead to lack of delivery of adequate
veterinary care to the animals. The program of veterinary care must be complete to provide adequate guidance to
the licensee to maintain the health and well-being of the animals. Correct by March 8, 2018.
