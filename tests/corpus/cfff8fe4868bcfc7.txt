2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
On April 18th 2021, Paula, a 16 year old male Bobcat, was found dead after falling from a tall sweet gum tree in the
center of his enclosure. Upon closer examination, he was found to have wounds under both front armpits with many
maggots inside. There were also maggots and fly eggs down his chest. Daily observations done that day and during the
week did not reveal any abnormalities with Paula. An animal caretaker explained that for approximately 6 months prior,
Paula would not come down consistently for his morning training preferring instead to stay on a branch in the tall sweet
gum tree. This behavior was expected and attributed to the onset of colder temperatures. On the many days that he did
not come down, daily observations consisted of glancing parts of him while up in the tree, sometimes 20 feet above
ground. This method did not allow for a complete assessment of Paula’s health and the facility did not identify the
condition that was affecting him. Failure to promptly identify injuries delays treatment and causes undue pain and distress
in animals with such conditions. A rigorous daily observation of all animals must be done in order to properly assess their
health and well-being.

Facilities, outdoor.


In an outdoor enclosure housing 2 elands, the flooring leading to the waterer was significantly muddy with a honeycomb
appearance and some standing water. The animals had to walk through the mud in order to access their drinking water.
Enclosures that do not drain effectively and in which the ground is largely muddy with no dry path to the water source, can
cause animals to develop hoof or skin issues due to excessive moisture and mud exposure. Correct by ensuring that a
suitable method is provided to rapidly eliminate excessive water within animal enclosures and ensure that animals can
access their drinking water without walking through mud.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
During inspection, the following areas in need of cleaning were found:
- The ceiling of the Rhinoceros indoor barn had an excessive amount of spider webs. A large amount of dust and debris
was interspersed within the webs.
- The front wall on either side of the fridge door, as well as parts of the side walls behind the food shelf racks in the fridge,
were coated with multiple small fuzzy brown materials.
- The vent above the enclosure in one of the holding rooms of the hospital area was significantly coated with dust and
debris. On the ceiling in a circle around the vent, a gray layer of dust and debris could be seen.
These areas are not being maintained in a manner that protects animal health and welfare. Facilities must be kept clean
in order to protect the animals from injury, to facilitate the required husbandry practices and to reduce or eliminate
breeding and living areas for rodents, pests and vermin.
