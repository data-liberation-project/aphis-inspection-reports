2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Licensee is not properly keeping disposition records for red foxes leaving the property. The record of animals on-
hand indicates a young female red fox was sold in 2021. However, there is no record of who the fox was sold to. Failure
to maintain required records prevents trace back of animals during a disease outbreak and does not allow for proper
accountability or identification of the animals during inspection.
Correct by ensuring that records are maintained which fully and correctly disclose all information concerning each animal
for which has been purchased, or otherwise acquired, owned, held or otherwise disposed of, in your possession or under
your control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed. Correct by 7 March 2022.
3.1(c)(3) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
Surfaces and housing facilities for the domestic cats are not being cleaned or sanitized often enough. The room housing
the indoor enclosures with queens and their kittens has a thick layer of dust coating the windowsills and blinds.
Additionally, the metal enclosure support bars and pans have an accumulation of dirt, debris, and litter dust that is
adhered to the surface. There is an area on the floor adjacent to the enclosure housing a female queen and her 1 week-
old kitten which has dried on greyish/brown material and covered with old litter. Infrequent cleaning and sanitation of


housing facilities exposes the animals to unnecessary disease hazards, odors, insects and pests.
Correct by cleaning and sanitizing hard surfaces and housing facilities as necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards and practices.
3.4(c) Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two of the three outdoor enclosures, housing five adult domestic cats, are still constructed with wood permeable to
moisture and cannot be properly cleaned or sanitized. One of the enclosures is constructed and framed with unsealed
wood. The enclosed shelter box and wooden ramp are also constructed out of unsealed wood. The second enclosure with
a corresponding shelter box and resting platform is constructed with a mixture of painted and unsealed wood. Surfaces
permeable to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and/or sanitized to meet the requirements set for by 3.11 of the AWA
regulations. In addition, these structures and items are not designed or constructed in a way that they can be easily
removed once they become worn or soiled. Having surfaces in contact with the animals that cannot be properly cleaned
and sanitized can expose the cats to unnecessary disease hazards.
The Licensee must ensure that all enclosures, den boxes and furniture type fixtures are designed and constructed of
materials that are impervious to moisture and able to be properly cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced once they
become worn or soiled.
3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Enclosures for domestic cats are not being cleaned with excreta removed daily. Two of the outdoor enclosures housing
five domestic cats have large volume of feces on the floors. In one enclosure, the feces are primarily located in the back
left corner while the other enclosure has them more dispersed throughout. The floors also have some straw, dried leaves,
and mulch mixed with the fecal matter. The floor of these enclosures is comprised of dirt and although there is a litterbox


present, the male cats continue to urinate and defecate in the soil. Excreta and food waste must be removed from
domestic cat enclosures daily and as often as necessary to prevent the excessive accumulation of feces and food waste
to reduce disease hazards, odors, and pests.
Correct by removing excreta and food waste daily from primary enclosures. Correct by 7 March 2022.
3.11(b)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Enclosures for domestic cats are not being sanitized often enough. Two of the outdoor enclosures housing five domestic
cats have a build-up of organic material on multiple surfaces. The surfaces in the enclosure with primarily sealed wood
are discolored and have accumulation of brown debris. The surfaces in the unsealed wood enclosure have dirt covering
portions of the platforms and walls in the shelter box. The ceilings in both enclosures and shelter boxes have large
collections of dust mixed with fur that can hang as low as 4 inches. According to the licensee, the enclosures are only
cleaned with water and no detergent or disinfectant is used. Infrequent and improper sanitation of primary enclosures
exposes the animals to unnecessary disease hazards, odors, insects and pests.
Correct by sealing all wood surfaces and sanitizing primary enclosures at least once every 2 weeks and using one of the
approved methods listed in 3.11(b)(3). Correct by 14 March 2022.
3.126(b)

Facilities, indoor.
The enclosure housing the Patagonian cavy does not have adequate ventilation. The cavy is being housed in the indoor
portion of a dog house, approximately 4’x4’ in size with an elevated shelf for the past month. According to the licensee,
she moved the Cavy into this temporary housing situation until she could find a better location. The door entrance into the
dog house has been blocked since there is no fencing around the structure other than the facility’s perimeter fence. There
is a window on one side with a plexiglass covering. This window is only opened for a brief period in the evening while the


licensee is standing next to the enclosure. The roof is a corrugated tile that sits directly upon the four wood sides of the
indoor enclosure. The only ventilation to the enclosure is through cracks along the door and window, and at the roof when
the corrugated material doesn’t come in direct contact with the wood sides. The enclosure also had a build up of waste
material in the corner which can lead to a build-up of ammonia and noxious odors. Indoor enclosures without adequate
ventilation build-up odors and fumes which can have a negative effect on an animal’s health. Additionally, they can lead to
discomfort and irritation in the respiratory tract.
Correct by ensuring indoor enclosures are provided with fresh air either by means of windows, doors, vents, fans, or air-
conditioning and are ventilated to minimize drafts, odors and moisture condensation. Correct by 4 March 2022. The
licensee corrected at the time of inspection by moving the cavy to a compliant enclosure.
3.126(c) Direct

Facilities, indoor.
The enclosure housing the Patagonian cavy does not have adequate lighting. The cavy is being housed in the indoor
portion of a doghouse, approximately 4’x4’ in size. According to the licensee, she moved the Cavy into this temporary
housing situation until she could find a better location. The door entrance into the doghouse has been blocked, essentially
creating an indoor enclosure. There is a window (approximately 2’x2’) on one side with a plexiglass covering. This window
is the only source of light in the enclosure. There is another enclosure directly adjacent to the cavy’s, a few feet away, that
is taller and blocks direct sunlight during the day. Additionally, the enclosure appears to be situated with the window
facing North which limits the amount of direct sunlight shining in through the window. At a distance, the sunlight appears
to minimally light up the upper half of the enclosure when the window is open but doesn’t penetrate down to the floor of
the enclosure where the animal is present. The enclosure does not provide enough lighting, distribution or duration.
Animals without proper lighting can suffer from secondary medical conditions. Patagonian cavies are diurnal and require
consistent, natural light cycles.


Correct by ensuring indoor enclosures have ample lighting (either natural or artificial) of good quality, distribution, and
duration as appropriate for the species they house. Correct by 4 March 2022. The licensee corrected at the time of
inspection by moving the cavy to a compliant enclosure.
3.131(a) Direct Repeat

Sanitation.
Three out of six outdoor enclosures contain an excessive amount of excreta present throughout. One red fox enclosure
housing two adult female silver foxes has feces, hair, and debris mixed with old hay and mulch throughout the enclosure.
The Patagonian cavy has a large pile of fecal matter mixed in with bedding and covering approximately ½ of the floor
space in his small indoor enclosure and ½ of the floor space that doesn’t have a shelf overtop. The pile of feces is
approximately 4” deep in some areas. The adult pig has piles of excreta in the back 2/3 of the enclosure mixed with raked
up earth and old straw bedding. The front third of the enclosure has moist dirt around the food and water feeder. The only
clean and dry location for the pig is inside the igloo. Indoors, the kinkajou is housed in a two-level enclosure. The bottom
level of the enclosure contains wood shavings to absorb urine. The majority of the wood shavings are darker in color and
damp. According to the licensee, the feces and urine piles are removed daily with a cat-litter type scoop and the bedding
is replaced once every 2 weeks. Animals that come into contact with their own waste can develop a range of diseases
that are detrimental to their health.
Correct by ensuring that all enclosures are being cleaned and excreta removed on a routine basis and as often as
necessary to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.

This inspection was conducted on Feb 28, 2022 and the exit interview was conducted on March 1, 2022 with the licensee.
