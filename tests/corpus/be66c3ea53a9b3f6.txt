A male red and white English bulldog (ID #941000019269872, DOB 12/11/15) has a cloudy left eye that is blue in
color. The white of the eye is slightly reddened and a small amount of discharge was observed in the hair along the

could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.

plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request.
The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor enclosure housing two adult dogs, there are unused materials lying on the flooring near the gate and
water source. The materials include wooden boards, a metal pipe, and at least two pieces of sheet metal. The
corners and edges of the sheet metal create sharp points and edges that could injure the dogs. The storage of
unused materials in the dog enclosure could also attract pests such as mice which could increase the disease risk
to the dogs.
Animal areas within housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter including equipment, furniture, and stored
materials. The licensee must remove the unused materials from the dog enclosure. The licensee must ensure that
all used dog enclosures remain free of clutter in order to promote the health and well-being of the dogs.
