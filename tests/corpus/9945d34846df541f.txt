2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
While waiting for the facility representative, the inspector observed several families arrived to see the bison and elk.
There were no readily identifiable employees or attendants at that time. The inspector had concerns about the
potential of public contact. The facility representative arrived and the inspector had a conversation with them in
reference to public contact. The facility representative said they are aware of the public having contact with the
animals. The facility representative asked if they would be required to have an attendant present if they wanted the
contacts to continue. During the inspection in the park vehicle in the elk enclosure a distance away, the inspector
witnessed a group of about 10 people visiting the park at the approximately 8' tall chain-link enclosure fence and 24
head of elk running towards the fence. When the elk were at the fence, the visitors had contact with the animals by
reaching through the fence. There were still no employees or attendant(s) present with the visitors at the time of the
public contact.
Public contact without an attendant does not ensure the safety of the animals or the public. A responsible,
knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public
contact.
