2.40(b)(3) Critical Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At approximately 1pm on Thursday 9/8/22, the inspector found a dead male black llama (auction tag 5930) in an
enclosure in the alpaca/llama annex. No auction staff or public were in the area. The inspector went into the office to find
the licensee but was told she was not on site. The inspector returned to the annex and found a young male staff member
looking at the llama. When asked about the llama, he stated that the llama had spent the morning constantly sitting down
and that whenever anyone asked him to get up he would sit down again. He stated they were able to get the llama into
the sale ring but that “he must have finally died” after being returned to the enclosure. When asked if he had reported any
of these observations to a supervisor or the auction owners he stated that he assumed they already knew. The inspector
later learned from the licensee that the llama had sold at 11:41 am. The licensee was not aware that the auction staff had
noted the abnormal behavior of the llama prior to the sale and thus the attending veterinarian was not notified. Any
abnormalities observed related to animal health, behavior and well-being should be conveyed in a timely and accurate
manner to the attending veterinarian to allow for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The observation of animals may be
accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian such as staff members but there must be a mechanism in
place to pass the information on to the attending veterinarian. Daily observation of all animals is necessary to assess their


health and well-being; if any problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are noted, they must be conveyed to the
attending veterinarian in a timely and accurate manner.
2.131(b)(1) Repeat

Handling of animals.
Handling of multiple animals at the auction was not done as expeditiously and carefully as possible.
*A young male employee was standing just inside the gate in an enclosure in the goat/sheep annex housing goats. He
consulted a clipboard he was holding and attempted to separate and remove a particular goat from the group in the
enclosure. Another goat attempted to sneak out the partially open gate behind the employee. The employee kicked this
goat away from the gate to keep it from escaping the enclosure. When the employee noticed the inspector present in the
area, he stopped the behavior.
*Numerous dogs were noted running off lead on the auction facility grounds including in the aisles of the barn where the
large species were run out of the ring, in the aisles of the barn housing the larger hoofstock species and in the warm room
housing the smaller exotic/wild species. One of the dogs who apparently belonged to a worker (black and grey heeler)
was seen nipping at the heels of a zebra that was exiting the auction ring and returning to its enclosure/stall. Another dog
(white with tan markings lab size mixed breed dog) belonging to a family looking at animals in the barn was running
around sniffing at/looking into all the stalls. Two dogs were noted in the warm room. One small black and grey dog sat
next to crates housing foxes being auctioned. The larger white with light brown spots dog was sniffing at and using his
nose to push on enclosures housing animals that were set on the floor in the warm room. Dogs should not have access to
the consigned animals. The dogs may cause discomfort and stress to the consigned animals, may injure the consigned
animals and depending on the species may transmit diseases/parasites to the auction animals.
*A pen/enclosure housing sheep and goats was overcrowded. There were so many sheep being confined and held in the
enclosure that the sheep had no room to turn around or lie down. The animals took up all the floor space from side to side


and back to front with the exception of the corner with the water bucket. It was difficult to see all the animals as some
were hidden underneath/behind each other. Overcrowding can lead to stress, discomfort and overheating of the animals.
*A loose goat was noted in the aisles in the goat/sheep annex. The goat attempted to crawl under an enclosure fence that
it did not fit under when it saw the inspector. It almost got stuck but was able to get loose. Another enclosure was noted to
have an unlatched gate that someone left open. This allowed the goat to escape the enclosure and possibly come to
physical harm or escape the building.
All animals shall be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.
2.132(d) Repeat

Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
The inspector returned from lunch on Friday 9/9/22 to find that an individual (MS) had consigned two Virginia opossums,
two bobcats and two grey squirrels for auction and that the animals had all already been sold during that short period of
time. The auction staff member checking in the animals stated that she knew that the owner did not have a valid USDA
license but that someone else in the office told her that it was ok to accept the consignment. The sale of wild and exotic
mammals requires a USDA Animal Welfare Act license or a one-time exemption neither of which were in place at the time
of the consignment. The auction may not consign any animal from a person required to be licensed but who does not hold
a current, valid and unsuspended license.
3.87(a)(3)

Primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates.
Two red-handed tamarins were housed in a black metal bird cage type enclosure. The enclosure consisted of black
horizontal wires spaced about 1 inch apart. The corner bars and central bars spaced about 6 inches apart made up the
vertical surfaces. Thus the openings were 1inx6in. The tamarins were able to and did extend their hands through the bars


to grab the bars. One of the tamarins extended its hand and almost its entire arm through the opening to try to reach out
to the inspector. Openings large enough for the non-human primates to extend parts of its body through can lead to injury
to the non-human primates or to other animals/people nearby. The nonhuman primate shall at all times be securely
contained within the enclosure such that it cannot put any part of its body outside the enclosure. Correct by 10/31/22.
3.127(c) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
Many wet enclosures were still noted throughout the auction grounds on both days. The enclosures were both covered
(under roof) and open. There was improvement noted in that the roofed enclosures in the barn that were wet during the
March 2022 auction were dry. However several of the outdoor open enclosures were still very wet and muddy especially
those near the roofed barn. In addition, several enclosures in the covered arena area were completely wet and soaked
on both Thursday and Friday. The affected animals included bison, water buffalo, sheep and goats. The enclosures were
wet and slippery with wet dirt/hay/bedding and mud. Animals were noted with mud/dirt caked on their feet, legs and sides
from lying down in the wet enclosures. Drainage issues can lead to multiple problems including contamination of feed/hay
fed on the ground, contaminated haircoats/skin of the animals, odors, fly/pest issues and unstable slippery footing for the
animals. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
Two housekeeping issues need to be addressed.
*Trash and other non-animal related items were noted in enclosures housing animals. One bison was noted eating a
piece of twine. Ingestion of inedible foreign objects can lead to gastrointestinal obstructions. The floor of one enclosure
(triangular shaped) housing five goats was littered with pieces of lumber, two plastic bottles and a bent piece of scrap
metal. One of the goats (auction tag 1447) had one hoof caught in between the piece of metal and a piece of lumber. The


goats may injure themselves on the items.
*The insulation on the ceiling and walls of the arena holding many enclosures housing sheep, goats, pigs and young
exotic species such as camel, nilgai and addax during this inspection is coming loose from the ceiling/walls. The yellow
insulation material appears dirty, discolored and contaminated. Strips of it are hanging down over the animal enclosures
and may fall into the enclosures. Ingestion or contact with the material may lead to injury or irritation of the animals.
Buildings and grounds must be kept clean with all trash placed in designated areas and in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to facilitate the required husbandry practices.
3.137(a)(1)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
Two enclosures housing hedgehogs (auction tags 1225 and 1226) were not of sufficient structural strength and
construction. The enclosures were small plastic baskets made without a top. A top had been constructed by placing a
piece of chicken wire over the top of the basket and fastening it with zip ties. The chicken wire was loose and easily
moved when touched. One of the tops had sunken into the enclosure and was touching the back of the hedgehog (1225).
The lack of structural strength means that the animals could come to physical harm if the baskets were to be kicked or
knocked over accidentally or if someone placed something on top of the baskets. The structural strength of the enclosures
housing animals shall be sufficient to contain the live animals and to withstand the rigors of transportation. Correct by
10/31/22.
3.137(a)(6) Repeat

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
During this inspection several transport/auction enclosures did not have handles. Two enclosures each housing one paca
had no handles (auction tags 354 and 355). One enclosure housing ten prairie dogs had no handles. The prairie dogs
could touch all sides and the top of the enclosure (auction tag 478). These enclosures had no handholds for the auction


staff to use to safely carry the enclosures without coming into contact with the animals and potentially getting bitten or
scratched or potentially tilting/dropping the enclosure. Adequate handholds or other devices for lifting shall be provided for
all enclosures.
3.137(d) Repeat

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
During this inspection several transport/auction enclosures housing animals that did not contain any litter or suitable
absorbent material to absorb and cover excreta. One enclosure housing three cavy (auction tag 061) contained litter but it
was completely soaked and wet all day Thursday 9/8/22. The animals had no dry place to sit the entire day and their feet
appeared wet. Multiple ferret enclosures did not contain any litter or absorbent material (auction tags 371, 402, 403).
Fecal material was noted in the corner of one of the enclosures (402) and one of the enclosures was wet and the spilled
food had absorbed some of the moisture (371). Lack of absorbent material/litter to cover excreta and wastes can cause
skin/coat contamination, distress and increased risk of disease. Animals must be provided clean litter of a suitable
absorbent material that can absorb and cover excreta.
3.137(e) Repeat

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
Multiple animal enclosures were not clearly marked on top and on one side with the words Live Animal or Wild Animal.
Once the warm room attendant was made aware of the requirement, she started attaching the markings to enclosures not
so marked. Affected animal enclosures included a coatimundi (auction tag 254), African Crested porcupines (253, 354),
caracals (143), and five ferrets (247-251). Accurate markings are necessary to ensure that everyone who comes near the
enclosure has knowledge of what may be in the enclosure and how to properly orient it. Enclosures shall be clearly
marked on top and on one or more sides with the words ‘Live Animal’ or ‘Wild Animal’ in letters not less than 1 inch in
height and with arrows or other markings to indicate the upright position.


3.140(b)

Care in transit.
During this inspection live animals were observed being removed from their enclosure and not being placed into another
suitable enclosure/facility. Three people (not identified as staff) were noted removing two young nilgai and another young
animal from their auction enclosures. They set the animals on the cement floor of the auction building just in front of the
auction ring in a very crowded area with lots of people standing shoulder to shoulder watching the auction and others
sitting in the bleachers adjacent to the ring. The inspector was told they were anticipating the sale of their animals but
other animals were still being auctioned and it was not yet time for their animals to be sold. This area is a high traffic area
with people entering/leaving the ring, entering/leaving the warm room and exiting the auction area into the large barn. It is
noisy and crowded. The animals startled and tried to move away and started to kick out. One of the people picked up and
held the startled nilgai. The animals were showing signs of discomfort and stress. By not being in a suitable enclosure the
animals could have been injured, people could have been injured or the animals could have escaped. Live animals shall
not be removed from their primary enclosures unless placed in other primary enclosures or facilities conforming to the
requirements in the Animal Welfare Act standards. Correct by 10/31/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives and the licensees.
