DURATION OF LICENSE AND TERMINATION OF LICENSE.
- The drive through area of the park is currently open for visitors, but is not an approved site. Site 002 (drive
through site) is not a valid site and must be in complete compliance with all aspects of the Animal Welfare Act prior
to being used for regulated activity.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- The current facility deworming practices are not adequate. In general, deworming is being performed with feed
additives and mineral block additives. There is no regular frequency, and really no way to ensure that all animals in
the park ingest an adequate amount of these additives by eating. Also, there is currently no real schedule or plan
for testing fecal exams to assess the efficacy of the parasite controls. This has resulted in documented cases of
facility animals being negatively impacted by a heavy parasite load.
Internal parasites can affect all animals, but are particularly dangerous to high risk individuals such as elderly,
pregnant or sick animals.
The facility must consult their attending veterinarian and create a written plan for parasite control. This must include
routine deworming schedules, routine fecal sampling, and special considerations for high risk animals. The facility
must maintain a copy of this plan, and must document their efforts to comply with the plan. The plan and supporting
documentation must be available for official review as needed.

2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- According to veterinary records dated 23 May 2015, a female Oryx was found dead by facility personnel. The
record states that the animal was pregnant and approximately 2 weeks away from delivery. When questioned about
this animal, facility employees stated that no one knew the female was even pregnant.
The female is described as being in thin body condition with diarrhea stains on the hind limbs. A fecal examination
revealed three types of intestinal parasites present. The veterinary record states that the female (cid:28)was eating lots of
fresh green grass which was going right through her(cid:29). The veterinarian indicates that this animal(cid:25)s metabolic needsalong with her parasite burden required (cid:28)a higher carb diet(cid:29). A second report dated 31 May 2015 describes the
animal as carrying a (cid:28)tremendous worm load(cid:29).
The death of this animal was a management failure on several levels. There was a failure to provide proper
nutrition and a parasite control failure. However, the most serious failure was that no facility employees noted the
condition of this animal. Not only was her late term pregnancy missed, no one spotted her poor body condition or
the presence of diarrhea stains on her legs. This Oryx was an older, thin, pregnant animal with a heavy internal
parasite burden. She was in an extremely high risk situation, and would have needed dedicated attention and care
to survive and carry her calf to term. The facility(cid:25)'s failure to notice her condition put this animal in a position where
she could not survive the physical demands placed on her.
Animals must be observed on a daily basis by individuals with sufficient training and knowledge to properly assess
the health and condition of the animal. There must also be a mechanism of direct communication with the attending
veterinarian to report any problems noted by facility personnel. The facility must take steps to ensure all animals
are observed daily and assessed properly.
Correct from this point forward.
2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The information for "Handling Dangerous Animals" has not been completed and sent to the regional office. The
qualifications of the employees and addressing the other issues listed on the form are of utmost importance. The
drive through section of the park contains potentially dangerous animals, such as a rhinoceros and a tiger, which
were not on the original license. Individuals lacking knowledge and experience with dangerous animals might
negatively impact the health and welfare of the animal through improper husbandry. The licensee must provide the
regional office written documentation regarding the experience and knowledge of the individuals who handle these
animals. This information must be submitted and approved by the Western Regional Office before this site can be
approved for regulated activity.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- At the rhinoceros barn there is a gate near where the hay is placed. The gate was closed, but there was no lock
present. This offers access to the rhinoceros and is not an adequate means of separation from the public. All gates
into animal enclosures must be locked when not in use by facility personnel.
Correct from this point forward.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- At the time of inspection the drive through area of the park had members of the public driving their cars throughand feeding animal feed from paper Pepsi cups that are available for purchase at the gift shop. There were no park
employees present during this public/ animal interaction. Empty Pepsi cups were noted scattered on the ground
throughout the park.
A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during
periods of public contact.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The border fence for the drive through area is leaning sharply in several areas. Fencing in this condition is not
secure, nor is it safe for the enclosed animals.
- The low shelters in front of the rhino barn has an area on the corner where the tin roof is peeling up, leaving
exposed edges and providing insufficient protection to any animals within the shelter. The roof needs to be
repaired to help protect the animals.
- The indoor enclosure for the tiger has an open drain in the middle of the floor. This is a potential injury risk, and
needs to have a proper drain cover in place.
- The outdoor water receptacle for the rhino has a long loose wire protruding from the nearby fence and out over the
bucket. This is a potential source of injury any time the rhino attempts to drink from this bucket. The facility must
secure or remove this wire.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- The east side of the giraffe enclosure did not have any perimeter fencing or barrier outside of the enclosure fenceitself. There is a house and other buildings in this area, very close to the giraffe enclosure. The facility
representative stated it was not their property. Without a proper perimeter fence, unauthorized members of the
public could freely reach the giraffe enclosure fencing. A perimeter fence must be constructed here and kept intact,
both to prevent unauthorized access and to serve as a secondary containment for the animals.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
- There was no hay present in the entire Serengeti area of the drive through park. The written feeding plan from the
attending veterinarian requires 6 round bales to be placed every other day, or as often as needed. On a phone call
to the attending veterinarian, she confirmed that she had verbally amended the required number of round bales
during the summer months. She stated that she had not given a specific number of bales that must be present.
However, the facility has in the past been directed to provide, at a minimum, constant access to fresh, quality hay
for all grazing animals. The complete absence of any hay is not acceptable, and is a potential risk to the health and
welfare of the enclosed animals. The facility must consult the attending veterinarian to create a written amendment
to the original feeding plan which specifically details the feeding requirements. The facility must, at a minimum,
provide free access to good quality hay for all grazing animals throughout the park.

3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
- At least two water containers in the drive through portion of the park had a heavy accumulation of dirt and debris
concentrated on the sides and bottom of the container. This is an indication that these containers are not being
cleaned frequently enough. Water receptacles must be clean and contain potable water for the health and
well-being of the enclosed animals. More frequent cleaning and sanitizing is needed.
- The hyena enclosure has a hollow concrete stand beneath the water bowl. This hollow stand was filled with dirt,
debris, and brackish water - the hyena is forced to stand in this area to reach the water bowl. Animals must have
easy access to clean, fresh water at all times. This hollow concrete area must be removed or filled.
- In the rhino barn, there are several large concrete feeding tanks built into the barn. Per facility employees, these
tanks are intended to be used for winter feeding only. At least two of these tanks contained dark, standing water
and an accumulation of dirt and debris. If used to hold water, these tanks must be properly cleaned and sanitized
as needed to keep them clean.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION. - Numerous mats of spiders were present on the entry wall to the indoor portion of the tiger enclosure as well as in
the fence posts on the indoor portion of the enclosure. Spiders can bite and cause injury to the enclosed animal.
They can also contaminate food, water, and living areas. A more effective method of pest control needs to be
established and maintained.
