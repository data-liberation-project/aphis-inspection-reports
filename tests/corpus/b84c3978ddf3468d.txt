FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An area by the northeastern corner of the southeast pen containing 3 deer had a section of damaged fence that
was bent and pushed up off the ground leaving a hole about 16 in. wide and 1 foot off the ground. The facility
reports that a mower damaged this part of the fence last Thursday (6/6/19). Damaged sections of fence with holes
or gaps can no longer be relied on to safely contain the animals. To protect the animals contained, ensure that
damaged fences are repaired promptly.
Correct by 6/14/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
