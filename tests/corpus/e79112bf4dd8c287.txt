3.11(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Several of the indoor enclosures do not have dogs, but have feeders with food in them, old food on the floor and excess
cobwebs, dust, and debris around the area. Excess food that is accessible can become an attractant to pests and
cobwebs can trap urine and debris leading to stronger odors in the main kennel area. These empty enclosures should be
cleaned to keep the area clean and promote good housekeeping practices for the health of the dogs.
