3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The bear enclosure which is now used as a lock out has a stepping area for the pool made of poles which have
several bolts protruding outward. These bolts could could cause injury if the bears during lockout climb onto the
stepping poles. The licensee stated the bears are at this lock out area only during cleaning and are monitored.
There are a few metal lock out gilliotine doors that are rusted at the bottom and need replaced at several lion and
tiger enclosures. Although these rusted areas do not cause any threat of entering the other side or injuries at this
time, they need to be replaced and kept in good repair for no future problems.
Enclosures must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.
