Sanitation.
There was an excessive number of flies present in the food preparation area and in the refrigerator. In the refrigerator,
many flies were seen on the uncovered produce and one was in a closed bin containing mammal pelleted feed. Also,
some dead flies were found on the shelves where the mammal pelleted feed and produce were stored.

There was a large bug zapper present above the food preparation table, however it was not on at the time of inspection.
The presence of flies can increase disease transmission and can contaminate feed and water.

Effective pest control measures must be identified and implemented to eliminate breeding and living areas for the flies to
minimize exposure to pathogens that may cause illness. Pest control measures must be maintained to prevent the
harborage of pests, i.e. insects, so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals.
