MISCELLANEOUS.
In file for IACUC protocol numbered 15-004, there is a preliminary pathology case report for a rabbit that died during
a surgical procedure. The history described on this report states that the animal "became dyspneic, extubated by
accident." Reintubation was attempted and the animal died. The anesthesia monitoring log found in the rabbit's
medical record confirms this event.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma or physical harm.
Correct by: This day forward.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
