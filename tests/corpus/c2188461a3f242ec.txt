2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
In the meeting minutes for the IACUC meeting held on April 23, 2019, the "attending veterinarian report" section
mentions that an "unexpected event" occurred involving bats. The attending veterinarian explained to the APHIS
inspector what happened to the bats. The bats were members of a breeding colony maintained by the facility. To
provide environmental enrichment for the animals, shade cloth is hung on the walls of the room that houses the
breeding colony. For the health and well-being of the bats, the shade cloth is taken down on a routine schedule to
be cleaned and sanitized. During this incident, after being taken down and folded, the shade cloth was taken to the
cage wash room and left overnight to be washed the next day. When the shade cloth was unfolded the next
morning to be cleaned, three perished bats were found inside the cloth. The bats are presumed to have perished
due to being trapped in the folded shade cloth. Facility staff immediately reported the incident to the attending
veterinarian.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
The attending veterinarian investigated the incident. As a result, the facility developed new procedures and
retrained husbandry staff to ensure no bats are trapped in the shade cloth when it is taken down for the necessary
cleaning and sanitation. No more bats have been harmed during subsequent shade cloth cleanings.
This item has been corrected by the registrant.
This inspection focused on records and was conducted with facility personnel on January 28 - 29, 2020. The exit
interview was conducted with facility personnel on January 30, 2020.
