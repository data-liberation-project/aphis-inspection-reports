Sanitation.
There are four metal enclosures containing a total of five, adult rabbits of unknown sex, which have an accumulation of
dried fecal material and debris on the metal sides and grated flooring in several places. Fecal accumulation increases the
possibility of disease transmission and attracts pests. An effective method of rabbit caging sanitation must be established
and maintained to assure the health and well-being of the animals.

Facilities, general.
The fencing for the pig enclosure, accessible to six adult, domestic pigs of unknown sex, is not structurally sound or in
good repair. The pipe fencing is covered with 4X4 wire field fence and metal flashing with broken wire twisted around it in
some places. The 4X4 wire field fence is sagging in some areas from animals leaning on it over time.

The large, main enclosure, accessible to 16 goats, 11 cattle, two llamas and six pigs of unknown sex, has a rusted piece
of metal flashing with a sharp out-turned edge, measuring approximately 1 foot by 2 foot, attached at ground level on one
of the fences.



Sagging wire, sharp metal edges and broken wires can injure animals. The licensee must ensure that facilities are
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Feeding.
In the pig enclosure, accessible to six adult, domestic pigs of unknown sex, there is a food receptacle with an excessive
accumulation of dry, old food, dirt and other debris on the interior surface. Dirty feeding receptacles can contaminate
fresh food and cause illness. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective method for cleaning and sanitization
of food receptacles so that food receptacles are kept clean and sanitary.
