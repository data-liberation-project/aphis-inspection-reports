FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outside area of Snowball's enclosure housing 9 sheep and 1 llama is sharp edges of metal bent outward from
the shelters. These sharp edges can potentially cause an injury to the animals.
Inside the shelter of Cinnamon's enclosure there are several nail heads and screws protruding outward that could
injure the animals.
In the enclosure housing 1 camel named "Boo" along the north side the bottom of the fence is not attached to the
bottom pole leaving a large gap. The animal can get a foot caught and it is no longer structurally sound and in
good repair. Inside the shelter are 2 broken boards with splintered ends which at one time covered the now
exposed ends of the screw. These exposed screws can cause an injury to the animal and the broken boards are
not in good repair.
Maintain all indoor and outdoor facilities so that they are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals
from injuries.
