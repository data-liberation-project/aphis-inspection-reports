PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
An 8 month old labrador retriever was accepted for transport without the words "Live Animals" marked on top of the
primary enclosure (see air waybill # 001PHL77761003). Primary enclosures must be clearly marked on top and on
one or more sides with the words ``Live Animals,'' in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high, and with arrows or other
markings to indicate the correct upright position of the primary enclosure. Carriers and intermediate handlers must
not tranport any dog or cat in commerce unless the primary enclosure is clearly marked on top with the words "Live
Animals" in letters at least 1 inch in height.
3.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
There were no food and water receptacles attached inside the primary enclosures for an 8 month old labrador
retriever (see air waybill # 001PHL 77761003). There was no safe way for the carrier or intermediate handler to
offer water or place food without receptacles being attached inside the front door of the enclosure. Food and water
receptacles must be securely attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that the receptacles can be filled
from outside the enclosure without opening the door.
An exit briefing was conducted with the supervisor/manager.
