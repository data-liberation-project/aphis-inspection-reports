PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are 8 enclosures with chewed front walls which have unsealed wooden surfaces in the breeder room. Primary
enclosures must be kept in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury, contain the animals securely, and
constructed of smooth material that is impervious to liquids and moisture. The 8 chewed front walls must be
replaced to prevent injury to the animals and constructed with an impervious surface which can be repeatedly
cleaned and disinfected.
