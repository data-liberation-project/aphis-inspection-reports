2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A gallon of Bio-Med (Tar-Sulfur) Shampoo has an expiration date of 01/04 and a gallon of Iodine Shampoo has
an expiration date of 04/04. The shampoos were intermingled with other products that are currently being used at
the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of expired materials on regulated animals is not considered
to be an acceptable veterinary practice. The effectiveness of the contents in the container and expected results
may not work as anticipated. The licensee disposed the contents of both containers during the inspection. The
licensee must ensure that any products used on the dogs have not gone past the recorded expiration date.
3.9(a)
FEEDING.
* The food receptacle in one enclosure housing one dog contains food which has gotten wet and has clumped in
the bowl area of the receptacle. The wet, clumped food has started to deteriorate and mold. Deteriorated and
contaminated food can cause a decrease in the nutritive value and may discourage the animals from eating. The
licensee must ensure that the food is uncontaminated, wholesome, palatable, and of sufficient quantity and nutritive
value to maintain the normal condition and weight of the animal. To be corrected by 1/25/16.
3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
* The front edge of one metal food receptacle has rusted, resulting in a hole in the metal. The resulting hole shows
a decrease in the durability and makes it difficult to sanitize. When surfaces are not sanitized they can play a role in
disease transmission. When food receptacles become worn, rusted or otherwise damaged to the point that they
cannot be sanitized, they must be replaced. The licensee must provide durable food receptacles without worn or
rusted surfaces that can be cleaned and sanitized in accordance with 3.11b of this subpart.
3.11(a)CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Eight enclosures housing 14 dogs have excreta and dried fecal residue accumulating on 50 to 60 percent of the
cement flooring. The affected flooring is located in outdoor housing. Daily removal of all excreta is necessary to
prevent an excessive accumulation of feces. This will help to reduce any disease hazards, insects, pests and
odors. Unsanitary living conditions exist that could lead to potential contamination, soiling or caking of the hair coat.
The licensee must ensure that excreta and food waste must be removed from the primary enclosure on a daily
basis. Correct by 1/14/16.
* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 1/11/16 were conducted with the licensee, Shawnee
County Law Enforcement, Dr. Margaret Shaver VMO and Robert Bacon ACI.
* Copy of inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
