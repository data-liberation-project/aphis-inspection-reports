2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
*** On May 13, 2015, this licensee did not have a person available so an animal welfare inspection could be
conducted. This is in violation of Section 2.126. This lack of availability makes it impossible to determine if this
facility is in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. The licensee's daughter was at the facility during this
inspection and stated that both parents would be away for most the day.
Correct for all future unannounced inspections
