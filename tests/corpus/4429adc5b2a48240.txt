INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Review of the IACUC semi-annual inspection checklists and the evaluation report to the Institutional Official for the
Dec. 16, 2015 inspection shows that the animal buildings were inspected but that the surgery and surgery prep
areas were not inspected by at least two IACUC members during the inspection. An active protocol involving ferret
surgery was ongoing at the time. The IACUC must inspect all animal facilities including surgery related areas to
ensure the facilities meet regulations in title 9, chapter I, subchapter A Animal Welfare. The IACUC shall include all
surgery related areas in inspections of the research facility's animal facilities to be conducted at least once every six
months. Correct with the next inspection.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
