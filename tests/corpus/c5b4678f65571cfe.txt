3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Portions of the outdoor wooden wall is missing near the ground of the marmoset building. This is exposing the
material underneath as well as creating a rough edge. Also the paint is missing from sections of this wall. Surfaces
that are not sealed cannot be cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces must be constructed in a manner that allow them
to be readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 27 April 2017.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two wooden pallets are being used as a resting surface in the shelter for the two goats. At the time of the
inspection the rubber mat used to cover these was pulled off exposing the gaps between the pallet boards. One of
the pallet boards was broken and splintered. The leg of one of these goats was observed to slip between the gaps
as it walked across these pallets. These exposed pallet boards could cause injury to these goats. A better method
must be developed to protect the goats from the wooden pallets. Correct by 3 April 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
