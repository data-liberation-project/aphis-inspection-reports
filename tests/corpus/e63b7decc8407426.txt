HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
In the west outdoor enclosures, there are three enclosures that have a severely chewed and or worn piece of wood
attached to the front, bottom of the shelter. The front plastic surfaces of the shelters have been chewed also. There
is a small amount of dirt and hair stuck on the chewed surfaces. There are three dogs in the affected enclosures.
Chewed and worn surfaces cannot be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized, which can lead to disease hazards for the
dogs. All chewed and worn surfaces must be repaired or replaced so they can be readily cleaned and sanitized.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the west outdoor enclosures there is overgrown vegetation in and along the fence line. Overgrown vegetation can
harbor pests and can lead to disease hazards for the animals. Premises where housing facilities are located must
be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals, from injury, to facilitate the husbandry practices required in
this subpart and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin. Premises
around the outdoor enclosures must be free of overgrown vegetation.
