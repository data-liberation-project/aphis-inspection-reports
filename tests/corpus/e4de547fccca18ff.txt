INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A pig used under protocol 2012-176 in June 2014 was administered 10 mg of a chemotherapeutic agent
intravenously. The maximum dose approved by the IACUC was 6 mg. This animal subsequently died and it is not
definitively known if the unapproved amount of drug administered was related to the death. The change in dosage
of this drug under this particular protocol represented a significant change which was not approved by the IACUC.
All proposed significant changes to animal use activities must be approved by the IACUC prior to implementation.
Approval is required so that the IACUC can assure that the proposed change in activities is in accordance with the
standards and regulations as required under the Animal Welfare Act. CORRECT BY: The incident was identified,
reported and corrective action taken by the IACUC prior to this inspection.
This inspection included IACUC related documents and records.
The exit interview was conducted with the IACUC chair and the attending veterinarian.
