2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two female Poodles (Molly # 7B00002867 and Dolly #7B00001021) had very matted hair. There were thick mats
on both of their chests, with twisted hair on their legs and face. Dolly had a thick mat of hair along her back that
was about 6 inches long and 4 inches wide. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris and
moisture. It can foster skin infections and affect the animal's mobility. Matted hair does not maintain the same
insulating qualities of normally groomed hair. The licensee must remove all matted hair and establish an effective
program for coat maintenance for the health and well- being of the dog.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
