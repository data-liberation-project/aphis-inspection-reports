2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A black and white weanling guinea pig in the first row of pens, last
stack in the 3rd pen from the bottom had a mass under the chin. The mass was approximately 1 inch in size, firm and
movable, with an area of skin missing hair and reddish in color. The animal was in good body condition and did not
appear lethargic. The licensee had not observed the health condition in the guinea pig, had not contacted the attending
veterinarian, and was not administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the condition
and provided treatment options.
Masses under the chin can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being of
the animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and
treatment for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional
animals if the condition is contagious.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or communicate with the attending
veterinarian to evaluate this animal and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
