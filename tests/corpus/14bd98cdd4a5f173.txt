3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
There is a build-up of old and fresh feces within all of the outdoor portions of the sheltered enclosures. The feces is
mainly in the corners and along the walls of the enclosures. The facility representative confirms that it has been
more than a day since he cleaned the feces. There are varying degrees of brown to black grime on the dog doors
and walls within all of the enclosures. There are ten dogs in the affected enclosures. Failure to properly clean and
sanitize primary enclosures can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in
contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks in order to prevent an accumulation
of excreta and reduce disease hazards.
The non-compliant veterinary care items listed under 2.40 (b)(2) on the August 6, 2013 inspection report have been
corrected.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with a facility representative.
