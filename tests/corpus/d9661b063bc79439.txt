3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates
did not accurately reflect the current facility. The animals were observed to have toys and items to manipulate. The
plan indicated that the animals would be brought inside at night, which reflected what was happening at the
previous facility (including the old name, address & licensee) but not this facility. The plan must accurately reflect
where and how the animals are currently being cared for and be approved by the attending veterinarian.
