2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On November 23, 2020 there was a hamster that was found lethargic and thin. The animal had water but no food. It was
after 2 days that the staff noticed the animal didn't have food and its health condition. The staff is required to do
observations twice daily. Both the attending veterinarian and study director were called. It was determined that the animal
could no longer be used for the study due to his condition and was euthanized. The lack of daily observations contributed
to the animal not being fed and receiving adequate veterinary care in a timely manner. Daily observations are essential to
assess the health and well-being of the animals and must be conducted. The staff involved was reprimanded and put on
probation. Also the husbandry and technical staff were retrained on observing the animals along with routine husbandry
and behavioral characteristics to detect sick or distressed hamsters. Correct from this day forward.
3.28(a) Critical

Primary enclosures.
On November 15, 2020 there was a hamster that got his teeth stuck in the metal screen that lined the top of its cage. After
the animal was removed it sustained severe injuries. The attending veterinarian was contacted immediately and the
animal was euthanized. The primary enclosures shall be constructed of a material appropriate for the animal and protects


the animal from injury or harm. The facility has removed and replaced the metal screens with wider-spaced plastic grids to
prevent any issues in the future. Correct from this day forward.
3.80(a)(2)(ii) Critical

Primary enclosures.
On September 16, 2020 there was a cynomolgus monkey (#16883) that had injured its mouth on a faulty c-clamp hanging
enrichment on the outside of the enclosure. The c-clamp got stuck on the monkeys mouth and when the animal became
distressed it caused significant damage to his lip and mouth. The attending veterinarian had been contacted immediately
and had provided the animal with adequate care. The animals primary enclosure should prevent injury and harm to the
animals housed. The cage feature that had caused the animal trauma had been removed and replaced. Correct from this
day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.
