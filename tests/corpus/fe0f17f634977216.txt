3.15(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
At the time of inspection, none of the dog crates had the words "LIVE ANIMALS" on the top or sides in letters at least one
inch in height, as required. Additionally, there were no arrows to denote the upright position of the crate during transport.

Failure to properly label crates used to transfer live animals could result in injury to the animals, along with mishandling by
transport personnel.

Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it should be clearly marked on top and on one or more
sides with the words ``LIVE ANIMALS", in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high, and with arrows or other markings to
indicate the correct upright position of the primary enclosure, in order to help ensure proper handling by transportation
personnel.

Food and water requirements.


Upon inspection, none of the dogs in transport had statements attesting they were offered food and water four hours prior
to transport. Although the registrant incorporates this statement in the reservation process when clients book their
services, the statement on the form is selected days prior to transport, omitting a time-stamped date.

It is imperative that dogs and cats are offered food and potable water within four hours prior to transport to aid in their
comfort, wellbeing, and needs during transit.

Consignors must certify that each dog and cat was offered food and potable water within four hours preceeding delivery of
the dog or cat to a carrier or intermediate handler for transportation in commerce, and must certify the date and time the
food and potable water was offered.

3.17(b)

Food and water requirements.
During transport, the intermediate handler did not have written instructions for in-transit food and water requirements for
any of the dogs. Failure to include written instructions for animals in transit prevents transporters from being aware of the
dietary requirements, restrictions, and requests for each individual animal.

Any dog or cat offered to a carrier to intermediate handler for transportation in commerce must securely attach to the
outside of the primary enclosure used for transporting the dog or cat, written instructions for the in-transit food and water
requirements for a 24-hour period for the dogs and cats contained in the enclosure. The instructions must be attached in a
manner that makes them easily noticed and read.
