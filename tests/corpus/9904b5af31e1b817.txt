FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Within the enclosure housing two adult foxes, there is an approximately one foot long section of dirt that has been
dug out under the access door to the enclosure. There were large rocks placed next to this hole to fill in an adjacent
area that had been dug in the ground previously and also along a small section of the north end of the enclosure's
fence-line. Wire material that had been buried under the animals' enclosure did not extend far enough under the
access door to prevent the animals from digging. This space between the support pole of the access door and the
ground may not allow for the safe containment of the animals and could increase the risk of injury to the animals.
The licensee must ensure that all housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury and to contain the animals at all times. To be corrected by: September 13, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
