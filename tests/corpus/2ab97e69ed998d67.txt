2.126(a)(1) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility had a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection at 12:10 P.M. on
06/16/2016. The facility refused to allow APHIS inspectors to conduct the Animal Welfare Inspection.
When the inspectors arrived at 12:10 PM, the entrance to the facility was closed by a locked gate and no entry was
made onto the property. A telephone call was made and the licensee returned our call at 12:20 PM, and spoke to
Megan Adams, ACI. The licensee stated to Inspector Adams that she could do the animal welfare inspection, but
Dr. Brandes was not allowed on the property. She also informed Inspector Adams that she would call the police
and have trespass charged filed against Dr. Brandes.
You may not refuse any APHIS officials to enter your place of business and inspect the facilities, property and
animals as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the regulations and standards of the Animal Welfare
act. Refusal to allow inspection is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
Additional Inspectors
