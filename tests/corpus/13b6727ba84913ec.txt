ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult, brown, black and white, female Sheltie identified by microchip (#7E10047904) has a problem with its left
front foot. The toe on the right side and the immediate area around it, appears swollen, reddened and hairless. The
sore is approximately the size of a grape. The toe nail on the affected toe is difficult to visualize due to the swelling.
The dog is also placing little to no weight on its left front foot when it is sitting and walking in the enclosure. The
licensee stated that he did not notice the problem earlier in the day. The dog has not been evaluated by a
veterinarian or is currently being treated.
Foot problems can be painful causing discomfort when the dog has to place weight on the affected foot. It can affect
the mobility and daily activity of the dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and
appropriate treatment plan administered. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
