2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult male mini Brahman named "Bob" has a penetrating wound, approximately four inches long, in the lower
abdominal area in front of his right rear leg. This wound appears to have been caused by one of the longhorns
housed in this enclosure due to the presence of several skin gashes in the same general area as the penetrating
wound. Numerous flies were seen at the margins of this wound. There was a thick, yellowish discharge at the
bottom edge of the wound. This injury may cause pain and discomfort in the affected area. The attending
veterinarian (AV) must be consulted in order to diagnosis and treat this injury. To be corrected by: Sept 16, 2016.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Nineteen goats, one lamb, and two alpaca are housed together in one outdoor enclosure. The single shelter in this
enclosure is not large enough to comfortably house all of the animals during inclement weather. Additional shelter
must be added to this pen to provide protection and prevent discomfort for all animals housed outdoors. To be
corrected by: Oct 14, 2016.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
In the outdoor enclosure housing 9 bovine, 1 bison, and 2 camels, there was one food receptacle (tire feeder)
containing food at the time of inspection. One adult longhorn was observed dominating the feeder and swinging its
head at the other animals that came close to the feeder. There were also two metal horse hay feeders in this
enclosure, but both were empty and laying on the ground. A second tire feeder was located at the opposite end of
the pen, but it did not contain any feed. Food receptacles must be in sufficient quantity and located so as to be
accessible to all animals in the enclosure and shall be placed so as to minimize contamination. Sufficient numbers
of food receptacles, appropriate for use by the animals housed in this enclosure, must be provided in order to
assure that all animals have access to food. To be corrected by: Sept 16, 2016.
3.131(d)SANITATION.
Excessive numbers of flies were observed around the heads of both camels. Both camels were observed closing
their eyes and shaking their heads frequently in an effort to rid themselves of the flies. Flies can transmit diseases
and cause discomfort/distress to the animals. A safe and effective program for the control of flies and other pests
must be established and maintained at this facility. To be corrected by: Sept 16, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
