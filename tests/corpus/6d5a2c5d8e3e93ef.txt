signature from the veterinarian and exhibitor. The program also needed to included the goats, pigs and rabbits.The
program needs to be updated and signed to ensure that the plan has been reviewed and animals have been seen
at least once a year. Also the exhibitor has to arrange a formal written agreement with a veterinarian to provide
adequate veterinary care to the animals in the event veterinary care needs to be provided for the betterment of the
animals. The plan didn't include any euthanasia and emergency procedure. The program should inlcude these
components to ensure there is a plan in place if an animal must be euthanized or if there is an emergency. The
program needs to be complete so that appropriate measures can be taken and promptly addressed. Corrected by
the end of the day.

***There was a brown rabbit housed with a white rabbit that had a quarter-sized gash in the left hind quarters. The
rabbit seemed lethargic and weak. The owner stated that he did not notice the wound. The owner contacted the
attending veterinarian to get the animal examined that afternoon. The attending veterinarian stated that the wound
was not new and it had already begun healing. The attending veterinarian instructed the owner to spray the wound
with prescribed medication twice a day. The rabbit was treated immediately after the examination. There should be
a daily observation made of all animals to assess their health and well-being. There should be a direct and frequent
communication of timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being to the
attending veterinarian. Corrected immediately.
