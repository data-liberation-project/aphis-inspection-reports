2.38(f) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
During a routine study-related procedure on a non-human primate, a heat lamp was erroneously used to illuminate
the animal’s head. The lamp caused a significant thermal injury to the face around the left eye and ear, and the
lesions progressed over time, and was classified by veterinary staff as second degree burns. The veterinary staff
was notified immediately when the incident occurred. Thorough and prompt veterinary care, notably including
appropriate pain-relief treatment, was initiated and appropriate care has continued to date.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. The improper
use of handling techniques, including inappropriate equipment and its proximity to the animal directly caused this
injury.
The facility took measures to prevent recurrence throughout the facility, and will continue to ensure that any heat
lamps are clearly labelled and staff are made aware of this risk.
Corrected prior to the inspection.
This inspection was a focused one to reinspect for non-compliant items from the previous inspection and to inspect
the facilities for non-human primate and the new species obtained since the last inspection. The inspection and exit
interview were conducted with facility representatives.
