FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing the farm animals (llama, steer, goats, pig and sheep) is in need of some repairs.
*At the corner near the horse stalls there is an area of enclosure fencing that has an opening underneath it large
enough to allow unwanted animals to squeeze under the fence and enter the enclosure.
*Within the enclosure is a section of fencing material that was used as a sectioned off area for birds. It is now loose
and has fallen down in places. The animals may become injured by the material.
All housing facilities must be structurally sound and in good repair to protect animals from injury and to contain the
animals. Correct by 5/10/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
