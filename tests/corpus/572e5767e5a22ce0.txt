2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
This situation has been documented on previous inspections in March and November of 2017. The river otter exhibit
is constructed of a cement wall that varies in height due to the topography of the land that it is on. There is an
approximately 2' tall chain link fence secured to the top of the wall. There are areas of the barrier that are of
insufficient height to ensure the safety of the animal. There are no additional barriers or personnel present to keep
the public from gaining access into the exhibit.
A correction date of October 1, 2017 was given. This item remains uncorrected. The situation remains the same.
The height of the exhibit wall is not a sufficient barrier between the animal and the general viewing public to assure
the safety of the animal and the public. This will need to be addressed.
