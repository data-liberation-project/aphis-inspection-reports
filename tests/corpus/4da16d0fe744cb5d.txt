3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Primary Enclosures
2 raised rabbit enclosures housing approximately 12 adult and juvenile rabbits had an excessive build up of rabbit
waste and crushed excreta covering the floors of the enclosed portions inside the enclosures. This made it difficult
or impossible for all rabbits to enter the covered portions of the enclosures without coming in contact with soiled
material. Improper or inadequate sanitation in primary enclosures can contaminate feed, attract insects or vermin,
or cause ammonia levels to rise and pose a health hazard to the animals within. The licensee must ensure that
animals are provided with litter which shall be removed and replaced at least once a week, and/or ensure that the
primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized so that the rabbits have a clean area of shade inside the enclosures.
