2.33(b)(4) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***In September 2016 the facility self-reported an incident to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW) and
USDA. The facility suspended a protocol as a result of inadequate intraoperative monitoring, as approved in the
study protocol, and subsequent failure to identify a malfunctioning heating pad that may have contributed to the
unexpected death of a rabbit undergoing a non-survival surgical procedure. According to anesthesia records, there
was a period of approximately 4 hours in which no temperature was recorded while the animal was under
anesthesia for this procedure. This is contrary to the approved protocol which states that a rectal temperature will be
monitored and recorded every 15 minutes. Written records indicate that the animal died while under anesthesia and
it is recorded that the animal’s blood pressure dropped due to hypothermia and hemodilution. It was also noted in
the records that the water-heated mat under the animal had turned off, leading to hypothermia.The veterinary staff
was not immediately notified of intraoperative problems or of the animal’s death. A necropsy was not performed on
the rabbit. By monitoring the temperature at more frequent intervals, changes in temperature may be identified and
addressed sooner. The facility identified that proper steps to ensure the health and welfare of the animal may not
have been taken because records to substantiate those efforts were inadequately maintained. The facility must
ensure that proper guidance is provided to principal investigators and their personnel involved in the care and use of
animals regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization and euthanasia at all times. The
research facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to
OLAW and USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent future occurrences. Corrective
actions taken include, but are not limited to, retraining of all personnel involved, a submitted plan to ensure
adequate expertise of the research team performing procedures and amending the protocol to include contacting
veterinary staff immediately if complications occur. This item has been corrected by the facility.
The inspection was conducted on March 7-9, 2017 and an exit interview was conducted on March 9, 2017 with
facility representatives.
