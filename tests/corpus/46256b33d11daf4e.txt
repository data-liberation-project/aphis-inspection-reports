FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
* The ground floor between the food and hay receptacle and sheltered housing is covered with mud and standing
water. One zebra donkey and one cow are in contact with the affected area located in outdoor housing. The
affected area is estimated to be 40 ft. by 20 ft. In addition, the enclosure located just west of the above described
enclosure housing two red deer also has mud and standing water in the ground floor. The affected area in this
outdoor enclosure is estimated to be 20 ft. by 20 ft. These animals cannot approach the food or hay receptacle
without walking through the mud and standing water. Mud was observed to be an estimated one ft. high on all four
legs of the zebra donkey. Standing water and mud can attract pests, lead to hoof or foot problems and increase the
risks of disease transmission and create a reluctance to enter the feed area. The licensee must provide a suitable
method for the rapid elimination of excess water. The method of drainage shall comply with applicable Federal,
State and local laws and regulations relating to pollution control or the protection of the environment. Correct by
