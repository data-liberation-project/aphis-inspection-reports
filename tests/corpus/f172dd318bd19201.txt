3.53(c)(2)

Primary enclosures.
Eleven young domestic rabbits (weighing approximately two pounds each) were being housed in three 17” by 28”
enclosures. Two of the enclosures housed four rabbits each, providing approximately 0.83 square ft floor space per rabbit.
The third enclosure housed three rabbits, providing approximately 1.1 square ft floor space per rabbit. The other rabbits at
the facility were receiving adequate space.

Inadequate housing space for rabbits can create stress and potentially lead to disease hazards.

Each rabbit weighing less than 4 pounds requires at least 1.5 square ft floor space, exclusive of the space taken up by
food and water receptacles.

At the time of the inspection, the rabbit housing was modified and augmented, providing adequate space for all of the
rabbits at the facility.
