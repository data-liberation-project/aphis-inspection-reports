ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 p.m. on
18-Jun-18.
Upon arrival at the facility I called the contact number provided and spoke with the licensee. The licensee stated
that she was away from her facility and would not be able to return at that time.
End of report.
