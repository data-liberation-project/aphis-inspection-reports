SANITATION.
There are large accumulations of rodent feces on all of the elevated resting/feeding surfaces in cage # 16 (coati).
Numerous biting and non biting flies were on and around most of the big cats.
Rodents can carry diseases & parasites which can be transmitted to the animals as well as contaminate the food.
Rodents can also potentially bite the animals, Flies can cause discomfort & irritations to the animals and can
potentially cause biting injuries with resultant infections & pain to their ears and bodies.
The licensee has a fly control program in place, but the existing program does not appear to be entirely effective in
controlling the number of flies that were observed. A more effective fly control program shall be established which
would better control the number of flies that will only increase as the warmer weather approaches in the area.
A safe and effective rodent control program shall also be established to reduce the number of rodents in and around
the animal enclosures.
