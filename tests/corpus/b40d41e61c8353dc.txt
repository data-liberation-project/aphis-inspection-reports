2.131(e) DIRECT REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The Raccoon Building has a high ambient temperature and humidity. The building is constructed of metal and is
only partially insulated. There are eighteen fans running throughout the building and there are windows that are
open along the sides. The temperature as taken by the Kestrel at the beginning of the inspection upon first entering
the building is 93.5 degrees F with a heat index 100.7 degrees F. Multiple readings of the temperature and heat
index were taken during the inspection in different areas of the building. The temperatures taken were 93.7
degrees, 94.1 degrees F, 94.2 degrees F, 94.1 degrees F, 95.7 degrees F, 95.2 degrees F, 95.4 degrees F, 95.0
degrees F, 95.2 degrees F. The heat indices in the building are 101.1 degrees F, 101.7 degrees F, 104.9 degrees
F, 106.0 degrees F, 105.1 degrees F, 106.3 degrees F, 108.0 degrees F, 107.4 degrees F, 107.6 degrees F, 106.8
degrees F, 103.6 degrees F, 104.5 degrees F. Nine raccoons are in serious heat distress (too hot) and are
suffering from the temperatures inside the building.
The behaviors observed in these nine raccoons include panting, open mouthed breathng, and increased respiratory
rate (fast breathing). The raccoons are lying on their sides, backs, and abdomens with their legs splayed out
demonstrating they are uncomfortable with the temperature and are trying to cool off. These nine raccoons are also
reluctant to move, lethargic, and not alert to activity in the building around them. These signs are indicative of the
elevated temperature inside the building not allowing the animals to regulate their core body temperature properly.
The inability of these nine raccoons to cool off has caused them to suffer. There are approximately 290 raccoons
housed in this building. The high temperature and humidity is having a negative impact on the health and well-being
of the animals.
When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health and well-being, appropriate measures must be
taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of
temperature, humidity and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must reduce the
temperature and humidity inside this building to a level that is comfortable for the raccoons in order to support their
health and well-being.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with VMO Scott Welch, SACS Heather Cole, ACI Kelly Maxwell, a
safety officer, an IES investigator, the attending veterinarian, local law enforcement, an Iowa Trooper and the facilityrepresentative.
This is a focused inspection concerning the non-compliant item listed on the previous inspection report dated July
21, 2017.
