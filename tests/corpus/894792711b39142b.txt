PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Twenty-six enclosures have unsecured openings on their ends. The openings were created after extra feeder bins
were no longer in use and were removed. The openings are large enough for the dogs to poke their heads or legs
out. The open areas are a potential injury hazard in that the dogs could possibly fall from or get caught in the
openings. Close the openings at the end of the enclosures. Correct by June 30th, 2015.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
