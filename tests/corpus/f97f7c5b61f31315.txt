ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1318 on
25-Oct-17. I went to the deer park and called the licensee. The licensee informed me that no one was currently
available to do the inspection. I told him I would try back another time.
End of report.
