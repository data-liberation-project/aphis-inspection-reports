MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling. The facility allows the public to feed many of the animals - deer, goats, sheep, alpaca, bears, bison, and
pigs - with food that is sold on site. At the time of inspection, there was not a uniformed employee present to
monitor the public and ensure that no foods or items are given to the animals that could cause physical harm.
All of the sheep except one had been shorn and that sheep had an overgrown wool coat. The weather in this area
for the past several months has been hot with the highs in the 90-100 degree F range. The facility must ensure that
unnecessary discomfort is prevented in the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Housekeeping. The fenced in "off exhibit area" is very cluttered. There is equipment, building materials, crates,
pallets, old housing structures, trailers, trash, etc. creating clutter. Although this area is being worked on and in a
better condition than on previous reports, there is still a large amount of debris to be removed.
In the enclosure containing 2 Alpaca, there is a, no longer in use, small pool area. There was netting, rope, and a
bottle cap within this area. The animals could ingest these types of materials creating a health hazard for the
animal.
The enclosure containing 3 Bobcats has housing that is dusty, has cob webs, and is in need of cleaning and
sanitizing. This could result in a disease hazard for the animals.
There was a large amount of bagged bread sitting on the ground within the animal exhibit area. A few of the bags
were shredded open and torn. Some of the bread had mold, and was not suitable for consumption. This creates a
health hazard for any animals that are running free in the facility and may ingest the bread. This is creating anattraction for vermin and rodents.
Extreme clutter encourages the presence and nesting of vermin and rodents thereby increasing disease hazard.
The area shall be cleaned and organized to minimize the presence of vermin and protect feed and animals from
exposure to contaminants.
3.126(c)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There is no lighting in the food trailer. It is difficult to see the food within the food barrels as you walk further into the
trailer and away from the open door. The circumstance of no lighting creates a situation of not being able to
sufficiently inspect the food for cleanliness, contamination, and quality.
The enclosed section of the quarantine area is set up for small animals. There were two rabbits being housed in this
area. The building has no lighting. There is a tarp being used for the rear wall and can be lifted, however, in bad
weather conditions the tarp cannot be lifted leaving no way to observe the animals housed in this area.
Indoor facilities shall have ample lighting, by natural or artificial means, or both, of good quality, distribution, and
duration as appropriate. Such lighting shall be uniformly distributed and of sufficient intensity to permit routine
inspection and cleaning. To be corrected by August 15, 2016.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
A red fox was pacing on her elevated platform within her enclosure. The USDA inspectors observed her for several
minutes and this repetitive motion was continuous. The enclosure in which this animal is housed contains only the
elevated platform and one shelter as furnishings. The furnishing provided may not be suitable for this species. The
facility must ensure that each animal is allowed to make normal postural and social adjustments for the health and
well-being of the animals.

FEEDING.
The USDA inspectors were on site observing the animals between approximately 10-12:30 and noted that the
goats, sheep, and bison did not yet have fresh hay available. None of these animals have access to grass or other
food except that provided by the public which is inconsistent. One of the bison was lactating for her 1 month old
calf. The employee explained that the animals receive hay as needed and will be provided hay later after the
majority of the public had left. There was a small amount of older hay in one of the goat enclosures that did not appear to be palatable.
The facility must ensure that the ruminants have appropriate forage available in a timely manner for the health and
well-being of the animals. To be corrected by August 2nd, 2016.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
Within the feeding trailer there is a hay baler on the wall. This Baler is still being used for the hay for the animals at
the facility. The baler is rusted to the point of pitting, has chipped paint, and is not in its present condition suitable to
be used for baling hay to be used for the animals. Contaminates from the corrosion, and chipped paint could easily
be transferred into the hay creating health risks for the animals involved.

SANITATION.

were shredded open and torn. Some of the bread had mold, and was not suitable for consumption. This creates a
health hazard for any animals that are running free in the facility and may ingest the bread. This is creating an
attraction for vermin and rodents.
Extreme clutter encourages the presence and nesting of vermin and rodents thereby increasing disease hazard.
The area shall be cleaned and organized to minimize the presence of vermin and protect feed and animals from
exposure to contaminants.
3.132
EMPLOYEES. The USDA inspectors noted that vegetables and fruit provided the previous day were still present in the enclosures.
The left-over food was attracting flies. There is not an adequate number of employees to perform daily husbandry
duties, such as cleaning enclosures, in order to provide fresh food to the animals in a timely manner. Adequate
employees must be utilized to maintain the prescribed husbandry practices of the AWA.
