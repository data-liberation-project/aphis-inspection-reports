Perimeter fences must be of an appropriate height and be maintained in good repair to prevent entry by
unauthorized person and animals and to serve as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
The licensee must ensure that the facility is enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height and
construction to keep animals and unauthorized people out and is not less than 8 feet in height for potentially
dangerous animals.
