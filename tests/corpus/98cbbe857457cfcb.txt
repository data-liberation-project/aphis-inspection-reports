ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
This facility was discovered exhibiting as a petting zoo at the Vance County, NC fair. No itinerary had been
submitted to the office. The ability to locate the facility's animals is important for disease monitoring. Per the
regulations, any person who is subject to the Animal Welfare regulations and who intends to exhibit any animal at
any location other than the person's approved site (including, but not limited to, circuses, traveling educational
exhibits, animal acts, and petting zoos), except for travel that does not extend overnight, shall submit a written
itinerary to the AC Regional Director. The itinerary shall be received by the AC Regional Director no fewer than 2
days in advance of any travel and shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of
any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. If the exhibitor accepts an
engagement for which travel will begin with less than 48 hours notice, the exhibitor shall immediately contact the AC
Regional Director in writing with the required information. APHIS expects such situations to occur infrequently, and
exhibitors who repeatedly provide less than 48 hours notice will, after notice by APHIS, be subject to increased
scrutiny under the Act. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
