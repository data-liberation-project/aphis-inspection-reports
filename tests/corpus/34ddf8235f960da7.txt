3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
Space. Insufficient floor space was being provided in two weanling enclosures (plastic tubs). Enclosures measure 26
inches by 40 inches or 1040 square inches of floor space. The top weanling enclosure had 22 guinea pigs and the bottom
weanling enclosure had 29 guinea pigs. Weaned guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams require at least 60 square inches
of floor space each.

Inadequate space can cause stress, crowding, aggression in animals, and increase disease risks. Licensee must ensure
that the guinea pigs are provided with at least the minimum amount of floor space. Can not house more than 17
weanlings in the plastic tubs. Correct by May 7, 2021.

This inspection was conducted with the licensee and the exit interview was conducted with a family member.
