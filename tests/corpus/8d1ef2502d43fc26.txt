2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A facility employee transported by air from Florida to Oregon, via Chicago, two 3-week-old bobcats in-cabin with
him. He is experienced in the care of young animals, including non-domestic felids. The CVI issued 5/19/2016
documented their age at 3 weeks. They were transported in a crate with blankets and a Snuggle Safe disc
(warmer), and were fed every three hours for the duration. At the time of this focused inspection, the bobcats were
about 4 weeks old, and held in a transport-type crate with blankets and a Snuggle Safe disc. Surface temperature of
the bedding in the crate was 76.5 degrees. The cubs were bright and alert and moving around normally.
It has been determined that transporting neonatal (<4 weeks old) nondomestic cats is not consistent with safe
handling and protecting them from harm. The moving of the enclosure and the noise of the planes and the crowds
can cause behavioral stress and discomfort. In addition, neonatal animals are not considered to have competent
immune systems until they have had a series of vaccinations. They were potentially exposed to pathogens from
other animals and people on the planes and in the airports.
Correct by no longer transporting neonatal animals, from this point on.
This focused inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensees and facility personnel.
A revised exit briefing was conducted by telephone.
