FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following items are in need of removal, replacement or repair:
* There is a deteriorated support plank over the holding area for the elk/bison. The wood has rotted and the plank is
no longer structurally sound. This damaged wood could collapse and cause injury to the animals as well as the
keepers while they are in this area. This plank must be replaced to maintain structural strength and to protect the
animals and keepers from injury for their health and well-being.
* There is a hole in one plank of the wooden bison chute. This damaged plank is located at the lower portion of this
chute. The damaged plank must be replaced to maintain the structural strength of the chute in order to
appropriately contain the bison while they are present in this chute.

SANITATION.
Raccoons are gaining entrance into the rafter area of the bison/elk building. There is an opening in the building
wall, adjacent to the outdoor catwalk, that is large enough for raccoons to enter. This opening must be closed off to
prevent the raccoons from gaining entrance into the building. Additionally, a method to prevent them from
congregating on the catwalk in front of this opening should be established. A safe and effective program for the
control of mammalian pests shall be established and maintained to deter raccoons from defecating in these areas to
eliminate disease hazards.
