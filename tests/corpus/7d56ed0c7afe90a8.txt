2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On protocol 19-109, amendment B, dated October 24, 2019, it is stipulated that a board certified veterinary pathologist will
be directly involved with necropsies on moribund or found dead animals. On 31 October 2019, a monkey on this protocol
was found dead, and no board certified pathologist was involved with the necropsy, although a trained facility technician
did perform a gross necropsy. Per the IACUC meeting minutes from November 2019, the technician did not notify a
board certified pathologist to be involved in the necropsy. The IACUC must review and approve any modifications to
ongoing activities on the approved protocol. The registrant shall ensure that changes to activities conducted on the
protocol are approved.
Correct from this date forward.
3.77(f)

Sheltered housing facilities.
Sheltered housing facilities for non-human primates have a perimeter fence that is less than three feet away from the
ends of outdoor portion of animal enclosures. The runs at the end of each row contact the perimeter fence, creating an
area where non-human primates and wildlife could potentially have contact though an approximately 16 inch gap at the
corners.


Outdoor sheltered housing for non-human primates must be enclosed by a fence that is constructed and maintained so as
to prevent the entry of unauthorized people or animals and is of sufficient distance from the animals’ primary enclosures
to prevent close contact between animals inside the enclosure and outside the perimeter fence. Failure to meet these
requirements could result in contact with wildlife, which could transmit disease or otherwise harm the non-human
primates. The facility shall ensure that the perimeter fence adequately protects the animals.
To be corrected by 9/10/2021.

This inspection was conducted on site on 8/3, 8/4, and 8/5/2021, with a final exit interview conducted remotely with facility
representatives on 8/10/2021.
