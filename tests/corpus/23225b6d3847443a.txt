2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
An adult male wallaby died after running into a fence post in its enclosure. The wallaby had been obtained (along with an
adult female) approximately 2 months before and kept in a horse stall while acclimatizing to the facility. The licensee
reported that the wallabies were not tame. The licensee let the wallabies out into a small pasture adjacent to the barn and
right away the male wallaby ran into a fence post and immediately died. Some animals, including wallabies, may frighten
easily and can be injured or die as a result of collision with objects in their environment. Correct by 4/5/22 by handling
animals carefully and expediently, in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral
stress, physical harm, of unnecessary discomfort.
3.58(a)

Classification and separation.
An adult lop-eared rabbit was housed in the same primary enclosure as an adult red kangaroo. The enclosure consisted
of a barn stall and adjacent pasture. Rabbits may be injured or stressed by the presence of other animal species. Correct
by 4/8/22 by housing rabbits in enclosures that do not include any other species of animal.
3.80(a)(2)(ii)

Primary enclosures.


The facility has three primary enclosures for nonhuman primates, and all three enclosures were not secured to prevent
accidental opening of the enclosure. An outdoor chain link enclosure housing two adult ring-tailed lemurs had a door that
was held shut with a simple latch. An indoor welded wire enclosure housing two adult ring-tailed lemurs was held shut
with a simple U-shaped latch. An indoor welded-wire enclosure housing a juvenile squirrel monkey was held closed with a
simple latch. Nonhuman primates may manipulate latches on the doors to their enclosures causing the doors to open and
the animals to escape. Escape of a non-human primate may result in stress, injury, or loss of the animal. Correct by
4/8/22 by ensuring that primary enclosures housing nonhuman primates contain the animals security and prevent
accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal. This issue was corrected on 4/1/22.

This inspection was conducted with a facility representative, and the exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
