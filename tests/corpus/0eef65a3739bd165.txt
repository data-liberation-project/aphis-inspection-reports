3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces of housing facilities must be structurally sound and be able to be cleaned and sanitized properly. The
main kennel has a pipe frame that is rusty, with parts of the pipe frame missing. This bottom pipe section of the
enclosure fencing is very pitted and with the moisture from the rain the rust is swelled up and breaking off. This
heavy rust does not allow good cleaning and sanitizing procedures to take place. Also, the pipe frame has rusted to
the point, leaving gaps in the pipe. This can affect the structural strength of this enclosure. Enclosures must be
structurally sound to contain animals in a safe environment. The owner must repair or replace this area of the pipe
frame in order to maintain a structural sound enclosure and that required cleaning and sanitization can be done
properly. This will help in the good care of a structurally sound enclosure and help maintain a disease free area for
dogs to reside. Correct by 06-28-2015
