2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Bongo is doing better after treatment but it is still favoring the right rear leg due to a possible chronic arthritis
according to radiographs as interpreted by the AV.
The zoo still doesn't have an efficient mechanism to procure goods and services when it is required in order to
diagnose and treat animals. The procurement delay is due to the fact that the zoo must go through an approval
system for purchases of supplies, equipment & services which can frequently be a lengthy process. This current
ordering process does not facilitate any animal getting the necessary veterinary care (&/or diagnostic workups) to
relieve pain and suffering in a timely manner if the zoo does not have prior approval for the supplies, equipment or
services in place or already has it at the zoo.
The zoo must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care to include the appropriate equipment,
supplies and services to comply with the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act regulations and standards. A system
of quickly obtaining the necessary supplies, equipment, & diagnostic services to relieve animal pain & suffering
must be in place so that future delays do not occur.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
