Housing facilities, general.
The wooden framing/trim around the windows in the primary enclosure holding four spider monkeys have exposed wood
in multiple areas due to the animals chewing on them. The frames are not solid or complete with several areas being
chewed and wood missing. The wooden framing needs to be replaced or repaired.

The surfaces in the primary enclosure must be kept in good repair in order to protect the animals from any possible
hazards or injury and to hold them in that enclosure securely. The chewing of the wood could be cause a potential health
issue or damage to the mouth of the animals, or the lack of sturdiness of the window trim could be a security risk.

The licensee must repair or replace the wooden window framing/trim on all windows in the primary enclosure.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The indoor primary enclosure with four spider monkeys has not been cleaned on a daily basis for four days. There is a
buildup of urine and feces on the floor in the main play area inside the building. While the primates can get away from the

contaminated area on the upper level loft area, the buildup on the floor should be removed on a daily basis.

The buildup of feces and urine can cause strong odors and be a possible source of health or disease issues, pests and
insects.

The primary enclosures of the primates must have excreta and food waste removed daily to prevent the buildup of
contamination that they will come in contact with.

Sanitation.
The indoor goat enclosure has an excessive accumulation of feces pellets on the floor (wall to wall), approximately two
inches thick. There are 11 goats that can utilize this indoor shed area. The licensee has not cleaned out the enclosure
area often enough to prevent the buildup of excreta as often as necessary to prevent the moderate/excessive buildup of
pellet feces.

A buildup of excreta in the indoor enclosure prevents the animals from being able to lie down or get shelter in an area
away from contamination which can lead to possible health or disease issues and strong odors.

The indoor enclosure must be cleaned often enough to prevent the buildup of excreta so the regulated animals can get
shelter in an area free of excessive contamination.


To be corrected by: The licensee cleaned out the enclosure before the end of the final exit interview.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
