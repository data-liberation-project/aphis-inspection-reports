SANITATION.
Hedgehog primary enclosures (Teasel, Elsa, Amos, Elvira, Snowdrop, Chinchincheree) had exercise wheels with an
excessive accumulation of feces and wet, bedding material. The buildup of feces and waste material may increase
the risk of disease hazards and soiling of the animals. All enclosures, including the exercise wheels, must be
cleaned frequently enough to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein, to minimize disease hazards
and to reduce odors. A timely and effective cleaning schedule for all animal enclosures must be in place to ensure
the health and well-being of the animals.
