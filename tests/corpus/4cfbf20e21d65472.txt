FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The container intended for food storage was being used for empty feed bags at the time of inspection and the food
was in an open bag on the floor. Hay and bags of bedding were also stored in the building in contact with the floor
and not on pallets. These methods of storage do not adequately protect such supplies against spoilage or
deterioration and infestation or contamination by vermin. Food and bedding needs to be elevated and protected to
assure that it remains wholesome and nutritious for the animals. Correct by 19 January 2015
