2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee was unable to provide documentation showing an attending veterinarian had visited the facility since
2014. The most recent written program of veterinary care (Form 7002), provided by the licensee and dated
06-15-2014, also lacked detail on ectoparasite control (none listed), intestinal parasite control (drug names and ccs
per lb listed but no frequency, duration or routes of administration) and euthansia ( drug name only listed, no
dosage or route of administration).
Failure to maintain an adequate program of veterinary care, including regular visits by an attending veterinarian, can
directly impact all animals in the kennel by leading to a delay in the proper diagnosis and timely treatment of
disease or health issues.
The licensee must maintain and be able to document an adequate program of veterinary care including a written
description of ectoparasite control, routinely administered drugs ( i.e. deworming agents) including their dosing
frequency, routes of administration and duration of treatment.. Regular visitation (at least yearly) by an attending
veterinarian, who is employed under formal arrangements by the facility, must also be maintained and
documented.

1) A nine year old male dark grey Weimaraner, identified as "Fritz" (USDA tag # J-03, 46-A0306) was observed to
have a small amount thick yellow-green discharge from both eyes. There was also crusting of dried green material
on the lower eyelid areas. The licensee stated that Fritz had suffered from chronic allergies and was periodically
on allergy medication for the eye discharge. No medical documentation was available to show that the dog had
been evaluated for the eye conditions by a licensed veterinarian. Abnormal eye discharge and crusting on theeyelids may be an indication of irritation, inflammation or disease. Misdiagnosed or improperly treated eye
conditions may lead to development of chronic eye conditions, blindness and/discomfort for the affected animals.
Fritz needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to establish a diagnosis and proper plan of treatment. Licensee
needs to provide written documentation of evaluation of the eye conditions/allergies by a licensed veterinarian and
the corresponding follow up treatment. Documentation needs to include all treatment and evaluations received by
Fritz until the eye conditions are remedied or controlled.

2) One 10 year old male yellow Labrador Retriever, identified as "Shane" (USDA tag # J-02, 46-A-0306), was
found to have thickened, darkly pigmented and partially ulcerated areas of skin over the distal right rear leg and left
rear leg. The licensee stated that the skin lesions observed were old, had been unresponsive to antibiotics and
other treatments, but seemed to be better lately. No medical documentation was available to show that the dog had
been recently evaluated for the skin conditions by a licensed veterinarian.
Thickened and ulcerated areas of skin may be an indication of skin disease and may lead to chronic infection and/or
discomfort for affected animals. Shane needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to establish a diagnosis and
proper plan of treatment. Licensee needs to provide written documentation for the examination of Shane's skin
conditions by a licensed veterinarian and the corresponding treatment. Documentation needs to include all
treatment and evaluations received by Shane until the conditions are remedied or controlled.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A section of plywood located in front of the interior gate of a west kennel/pen housing two chocolate Laborador
Retriever puppies was found to be heavily chewed and damaged along its top edge.
Chewed, worn, damaged and unsealed wood surfaces are porous to water and difficult to sanitize. Damaged
plywood edges may also become a splinter hazard for dogs within the pen.
Repair, seal or remove and replace damaged plywood.
