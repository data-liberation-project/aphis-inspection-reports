2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:00-4:30 on
05/25/2016.
The inspector attempted to contact the licensee at home and by phone with no success. After waiting
approximately 25 minutes, two gentlemen arrived at the property. When inquired as to the licensee's expected
availability, they indicated the licensee and his family were out of town for a wedding that day. Lack of availability
for APHIS Officials to conduct an inspection completely prevents any regulatory oversight. Correct by ensuring that
a designated, knowledgeable representative is available to accompany APHIS Officials on inspection during regular
business hours (7am-7pm Monday-Friday).
