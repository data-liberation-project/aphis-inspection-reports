2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female hedgehog (87) was observed to have dark red sores on her skin underneath both of her ears. The
sores appeared to include both ear canals. The skin lesions are approximately 3/4 inch long and 1/4 inch wide. The
wounds appeared moist with some of the hairs adjacent to the wounds stained with a moist light brown material.
The owner reports he has been gone for the past four days but had treated her for skin mites before he left. While
he was gone, someone else came in to feed the hedgehogs but no health observations were made or reported to
the attending veterinarian. All animals must be observed daily and the facility must establish a mechanism of direct
and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that all problems of animal health. behavior and
well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. In addition to setting up a mechanism for
observation and communication going forward, the attending veterinarian needs to be contacted regarding this
hedgehog's health problem to ensure appropriate treatment. Correct by 3/27/18.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Several housekeeping items still need attention in the hedgehog room. The owner stated he had been gone the
past four days and had just started cleaning hedgehog cages shortly before the inspection.
*There is a large build up of cobwebs, dust and grime on the the walls, the ceiling components directly over the
enclosures and the fans.
*Insulation is loose and peeling in areas especially in the back left corner of the room.
*There is an ammonia odor present in the room.
*The stacked/stored materials in the room including the feed and bedding containers are dirty and dusty on the
outside. The shelves/racks holding the hedgehog enclosures are dusty/dirty.
*There are bird cages in the same room and a large amount of bird food debris and other debris has built up on the
floor under, around and on the bird cages.
*Several dead mice were noted on the floor (plan for killing mice appears to be working) that need to be removed.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room and may contribute to spread
of disease. Ammonia odors can lead to respiratory issues for the animals.
The hedgehog room shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the hedgehogs from injury and tofacilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
The three hedgehogs cited on the previous inspection report for veterinary care have been seen by the attending
veterinarian and treated.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned owner.
