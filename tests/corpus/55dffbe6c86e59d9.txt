PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
It was noted on inspection that several puppies' feet in one enclosure were passing through the holes in the wire
floor. One puppy was seen with multiple feet through the floor simultaneously, so that the puppy's weight was only
supported by its belly. This "dangling" position may be distressful for a puppy, in addition to posing a risk of injury if
the feet were to get stuck. Floors must be constructed in a manner that protect dogs' feet from injury, and that do
not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any openings. Correct by ensuring that floors of primary enclosures do not
allow dogs' feet to pass through and are constructed to protect them from injury.

This item was corrected during the inspection by the wife of licensee placing a solid panel on the floor so the
puppies' feet did not pass through the holes in the wire.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the wife of the licensee by the undersigned VMO.
