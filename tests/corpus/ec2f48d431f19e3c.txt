Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian.
A tri-color adult guinea pig in Pen J was laying flat on its belly with all four legs extended and was unable to support its
weight or walk. The guinea pig appeared lethargic with its head down and occasionally kicked its legs in an apparent
attempt to move. There were red areas of the skin on the bottom of both back feet. The licensee had not observed the
health condition in this animal, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, and was not administering any treatments.
The Program of Veterinary Care on file did not address the condition.
A tri-color adult guinea pig in Pen 4 had an abnormal right eye. The surface of the eye appeared cloudy, the tissues
around the eye were red and swollen, there was a clear discharge, and the eye was held partially closed. The licensee
had not observed the health condition in this animal, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, and was not
administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the condition and provided treatment
options.
Eye abnormalities can affect the vision, can be indicative of disease or injury, can be painful, and affect the overall health
and well-being of the animal. Lameness with lethargy and an inability to walk can cause pain and distress and lead to a


worsening of the condition if not addressed quickly.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate
plan for diagnosis and treatment.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
