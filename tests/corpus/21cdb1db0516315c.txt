2.4(d)
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
During the inspection process the licensee became belligerent with the APHIS officials. The licensee became
argumentative when questioned about official methods of identification for dogs at the facility. A direct verbal threat
of sticking a needle and syringe into the neck of an APHIS official was made by the licensee. It was also stated by
the licensee that if he was put on a (cid:28)list(cid:29) of supposedly bad dog breeders the APHIS official would have to bring a
gun back when returning to the facility. The licensee continuously tried to rush the APHIS officials through the
inspection process and used vulgar language. When an APHIS official tried to photograph a non-compliant item the
licensee initially interfered with the process. Activities that interfere with APHIS officials can hinder their ability to
properly inspect the facility and enforce the provisions of the Animal Welfare Act. The licensee shall not interfere
with, threaten, verbally abuse or harass any APHIS official in the course of carrying out his or her duties.

2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Most of the dogs at the facility, with the exception of the Golden Retrievers, did not have any form of identication.
Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition,
transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must properly identify each animal that is 16 weeks of age
or older with a microchip, tatoo, or collar and tag.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A wood wall of an enclosure housing a Golden Retriever had a hole in it that was about 12 inches in diameter. The
hole had jagged and splintered edges. The licensee stated that the dog had chewed the hole in the wall. This
chewing behavior can result in injury to the dog and if it continues the dog could make the hole large enough to
escape from the enclosure. The licensee must ensure that housing facilities are structurally sound and in good
repair so that they protect the animals from injury and contain the animals securely.3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The far northwest red and white housing facility has outdoor pens constructed of metal panels. On these panels
there are areas that have rusted to the point that they have rough and pitted surfaces.
***The southwest housing facility has outdoor chain link kennels. On the bottom right of one of the gates there is an
area that has rusted completely through the metal pipe frame.
Rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces to the point that the metal surfaces can no longer be readily
cleaned and sanitized because a smooth surface no longer exists. Excessive rust affects the structural strength of
all metal surfaces. Licensee must ensure that this and all other surfaces are free of rust and are of good structural
strength.
.
3.1(c)(1)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Within the southeast outdoor housing area there is an enclosure containing two adult Golden Retrievers. The
outdoor runs are constructed out of welded wire type panels. Near the entrance gate on the east side panels there
are two sharp metal points approximately one inch long. The entrance gate is loose and allows the dogs to stick
their heads through and make contact with thse sharp points. The potiential for injury exists if the dogs come into
contact with the sharp points. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained in a manner so there are
no sharp points.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The majority of the housing facilities have an excessive accumulation of excreta on the floor where the dogs are in
contact with it. The licensee stated that it had been two days since he had removed feces from the enclosures.
Cleaning and sanitation of surfaces that are in contact with the dogs is necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt,
debris, excreta and other disease hazards. Unsanitary living conditions and potential transmission of diseases exist
when surfaces are not cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must remove excreta and food waste from enclosures
on a daily basis.The poodle named Peanut, the Cocker Spaniel named Sassy, and the Cocker Spaniel named Roxy cited for
2.40(b)(2) veterinary care issues on the March 10, 2015 inspection report were inspected. The licensee provided
written documentation from a veterinarian that stated all 3 dogs had been examined and were determined to have
chronic eye conditions that did not require treatment.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, Corbin Ranslem-ACI, and a state trooper.
