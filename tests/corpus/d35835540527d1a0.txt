3.53(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
In an enclosure that should be housing two guinea pigs and three rabbits, one rabbit was observed to be outside its
enclosure. It is speculated by the facility representative that the housing structure positioned next to the edge of the
enclosure provided additional height the rabbit used to escape from its enclosure. In another rabbit enclosure housing 15
rabbits, one juvenile rabbit was observed to be outside the main enclosure. There was a gap between the enclosure gate
and the chicken wire that lines the bottom of the enclosure, which is where the rabbit possibly escaped through. Rabbits
are susceptible to injury and predators when not appropriately housed in a protected environment. Primary enclosures
must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect rabbits from injury, contain them, and to keep
predators out.

Classification and separation.
One enclosure was housing two guinea pigs and three rabbits together. Rabbits should not be housed with other species
unless for scientific reasons. Housing rabbits with other animals may have a negative impact on the health and well-being
of either animal, due to the potential spread of disease or bacterial infections.
