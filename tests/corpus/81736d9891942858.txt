ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** The facility has a feline diet plan that states that at every feeding the big cats would receive Oasis feline
supplement. The curator stated that she ran out of the supplement two weeks ago. For two weeks the felines have
not gotten their Oasis feline supplement prescribed by the attending veterinarian. The facility must provide the
animals with the proper feeding requirements set forth by their attending veterinarian to ensure good health of the
animals. Correct by the close of business.
** The facility fed the lion and four tigers marlin fish. The feline diet plan states that the big cats would receive 70%
chicken parts and 30% red meat with Oasis feline supplement. Fish in the feline's diet was not approved by the
attending veterinarian. The facility must provide the animals with the proper feeding requirements set forth by their
attending veterinarian to ensure good health of the animals. Correct by the close of the day.
** In the licensee's consultation logs, there is one incident in which the Tiger Misha was noted as having noticeable
weight loss and which the Veterinarian treatment plan stated the licensee should keep the animal under
observation. That last log was dated 2-1-15 and the animal was observed during the current inspection to still be
noticeably underweight with a visible hip bone protruding through the fur. There has been no follow up in over 3
months. Follow up with the attending veterinarian and ensure any further treatment is followed. Correct by May 25,

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** Misha the tiger had several flying insects biting her ears. No treatment has been implemented to rid the animals
of insect bites. The attending veterinarian was not consulted about the bites and treatment options. The facility
needs to consult the attending veterinarian on possible treatments to prevent the condition from worsening. Correct
by May 23, 2015.
** In the bears den there was vomit and diarrhea on the floor. The facility had not observed the animals' clinical
signs and had not consulted the attending veterinarian about their condition. The facility must observe the animalsdaily to assess their health and well-being. The conditions of the animals should be conveyed to the attending
veterinarian in a timely manner so that adequate veterinary care can be administered promptly. Correct by May 23,
2015.
3.75(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The lemur enclosure had a metal support at the bottom of the enclosure in front of the den box that is rusted. The
metal post in the back upper left corner of the enclosure was also rusted. The rusted support can not be properly
cleaned and sanitized and may affect the structural strength of the enclosure. The metal support must be repaired.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be free of excessive rust that prevents required cleaning or affects the
structural strength of the surface.
3.78(d) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
** The rhesus and bonnet macaque and the lemur outdoor enclosures did not have a 6 foot perimeter fence around
the enclosures. The east side of the perimeter fence was measured at approximately four different points and the
average height was 70 inches which is at least 2 inches under the minimum height requirement. All outdoor
non-human primate enclosures must be enclosed by a 6 foot high perimeter fence. The fence must be constructed
in a manner so that it restricts unauthorized humans, and animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from
going through it or under it and having contact with the non-human primates. The facility must enclose the outdoor
non-human primates housing by a 6 foot perimeter fence to protect the non-human primates.
3.84(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
** In Joe the chimpanzee's indoor primary enclosure there was an excessive accumulation of cobwebs and debris
above him. In and around his enclosure there there is also an excessive amount of dust. The indoor primary
enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and as often as necessary to prevent an excessive
accumulation of dust, cobwebs, debris and/or disease hazard. Correct by May 27, 2015.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the enclosed coyote enclosure, there is dark metal construction material laying on the cyclone fence roof that is
causing the roof to bow down noticeably into the enclosure.
** In the bobcat enclosure housing 3 animals, there are sections of the fencing and fence base that have anaccumulation of rust covering the surface.
** An enclosure housing 4 deer has barbed wire around the inner fence at such a height as to be a direct hazard to
the animals housed within. The licensee closed the exhibit during the inspection.
** There are tortoises in the Cavy enclosure that are digging around the fence line. One large hole goes completely
under the fence and there is a risk that it could pose an escape hazard.
** Portions of the bear, tiger and lion enclosures could not be inspected due to the abundance of thick overgrown
bamboo in close proximity to the sides of the fencing and kick-ins. The licensee needs to control the growth of the
bamboo to allow the inspectors to observe the fencing for deterioration and disrepair.
There is a risk of injury, death, or escape if the construction of enclosures is in poor repair, or is not appropriate for
the types of animals housed within. Ensure that all materials and surfaces listed above are repaired or replaced.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** The red deer had an outdoor shelter that only had one side. The shelter doesn't adequately shelter the animals
from winds and inclement weather. The animals shall be provided protection and prevent discomfort when in
inclement weather such as heavy winds and rain which is prevalent in this area. This climatic conditions makes it
essential to provide this cover. Correct by June 1, 2015
** The patagonian cavy doesn't have adequate shelter and space within the shelter for approximately six cavies.
The cavies have a dog shelter that is not tall enough for the cavies to stand in and it is not large enough for all of the
cavies to fit in comfortably. In the event of the storm all of the cavies will not be able to get out of the inclement
weather. The animals shall be provided protection and prevent discomfort when in inclement weather such as heavy
winds and rain which is prevalent in this area. These climatic conditions make it essential to provide this cover.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** The perimeter fencing for Jack the leopard's enclosure was not properly closed allowing space for you to stick
your hand in between them. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside ofthe perimeter fence. Correct by May 27, 2015
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
** The food bowl in the raccoon enclosure was soiled to the point that the inside and outside of the bowl was
covered in a brown residue, this can be a disease hazard. The food bowl must be cleaned and sanitized. All food
receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary at all times.
** Four food receptacles that are bolted to the ground in the bear den were soiled and had a brownish film covering
the inside and outside of them.
** PVC piping used to transfer food items to enclosures containing 4 bears, 4 tigers, 1 lion, and 1 raccoon had a
noticeable brown and green organic film extending the length of the inside of the pipe so that it comes into direct
contact with the food items. Inadequate sanitation practices can contaminate food items or attract insects or
vermin. PVC piping used to transfer food items must be clean and sanitized on a regular basis.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
** The bobcats and bears enclosures had an accumulation old of feces in the enclosures that must be removed.
The feces in the bobcats enclosure was smashed into the platform. The bears had old feces on top of their platform
as well. The accumulation of feces can be a disease hazard and contribute to pest and odors. The enclosures must
be cleaned and maintained. The facility must establish a cleaning schedule to ensure that all enclosures are kept
clean to reduce disease hazards and reduce odors.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
** There was an over abundant accumulation of bamboo growth in one tiger enclosure and one coyote enclosure
that made it impossible to properly inspect the entire enclosure.
** The deer enclosure housing 4 animals contained a large pile of discarded bamboo and brush.
** The carcass of a large Marlin was found discarded between the bear enclosure and the tiger enclosures. This
carcass was infested with insects and emitting a foul rotting odor that was noticeable from several enclosures away.
** Between the perimeter fencing and the primary enclosures of the main primate exhibit, there was one pile of
discarded waste and two piles of partially burnt discarded waste that the care taker stated had not had time to
remove yet.** Inside the wooden bear hibernation den there is a large battery connected to the electric fence enclosing the
enclosure. On top of this live battery was a pile of twigs and brush that appeared to be a bird's nest. Adequate
housekeeping practices are essential to alleviate the risk of insects or pests, contamination to food or water. It also
limits unnecessary risk of fire or injury. Ensure that areas both in and around enclosures are clear of debris or
discarded materials and that no rubbish is burned in or around enclosures.
** In the preparation room the ceiling is covered in old insulation that is slowly deteriorating allowing particles to fall
sporadically all over the room. There is also an abundance of cobwebs throughout the prep room. The prep area
has not been sanitized and cleaned. This doesn't make for a sanitary environment to prepare food that is being fed
to the animals. The facility needs to sanitize, dust and clean, removing the access cobwebs from the preparation
area. Correct by May 27, 2015
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
** Throughout the inspection process, the ACI and VMO both noted an abundance of flying insects around them
and on them.
** Flying insects were also observed irritating one of the tigers to the extent that there were open wounds on the tips
of both ears and multiple insects on both ears.
** Discarded fish carcasses both inside and outside bear, tiger, and lion enclosures were attracting a multitude of
different sizes or flying insects.
** Though the curator states that sprays are used to control pests, it is evident by the extent of insects present
throughout the inspection process, that a better or more extensive pest control plan must be initiated. Insects
contaminate food and water stores, can bring about disease, or cause the animals discomfort. Consult the
attending veterinarian and initiate a pest control plan that is adequate and acceptable for the facility and animals
within. Correct by May 28, 2015
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
** Based on new and repeat non-compliant items cited during this inspection and previous inspections, as well as
statements made by the curator regarding the fact that it was not possible to keep up with some maintenance tasks,
it does not appear that the licensee has an adequate number of employees to carry out an acceptable level of
animal husbandry and maintenance for this facility. Without adequate personnel or time to properly perform the
required functions of a licensee, the facility can fall into further disrepair, waste and debris can accumulate, and theanimals may not receive adequate care causing negative health and sanitary issues to occur. The licensee must
have adequate labor to provide adequate husbandry for the animals no later than June 15, 2015
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the curator.
