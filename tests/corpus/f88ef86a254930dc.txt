ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female husky "snowdrop" (ID 105) was seen limping on her right front leg. Close observation revealed she had
an injury on her paw. The facility had noticed her favoring the leg this morning. The attending veterinarian has not
been contacted and the injury has not been treated. Injuries such as these must be treated promptly to avoid
infection and further pain in affected dogs. Ensure that the attending veterinarian is contacted and treatment
instructions are followed.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The areas under the outdoor portions of the enclosures and areas under the husky enclosures have a buildup of
soiled material that has a large amount of flies on it. The husky's enclosures had an excessive amount of flies that
would come off of this material and go up into their enclosures. This build-up of material attracts flies and flies can
cause animals to get sick and can spread sickness to other animals. The soiled material underneath enclosures
must be removed often enough to reduce flies and odors in around the enclosures.
