3.53(a) DIRECT REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Rabbit enclosures are still not structurally sound and maintained in good repair. Although some additional repairs
have been made, the wire floors continue to have holes up to 4 inches wide. The wire mesh on the walls and tops
has broken ends extending into enclosures, and holes and gaps. Solid walls have holes, are rusted and have
peeling paint. Failure to maintain primary enclosures in good repair can lead to injury to rabbits, including falling
through floors, puncture wounds from wires, and trapping limbs in holes and gaps. A system of maintenance and
repair must be in place.

3.55 REPEAT
WATERING.
Rabbits: water bottles hanging on cages still have a heavy buildup of algae, to the point that it was not possible to
see the condition of the water in the bottles. The level of buildup of algae indicated these bottles had not been
sanitized when dirty, or in the last two weeks. All watering receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty and at least
once every two weeks.
ORIGINAL CORRECTION DATE OF 5-2-14
3.56 REPEAT
SANITATION.
Rabbit enclosures still have a buildup of excreta, especially in corners and along edges. The cleaning schedule for
these enclosures is inadequate, as evidenced by the buildup present. A buildup of fecal material causes disease
hazards. Additionally, several enclosures have peeling paint and rusted surfaces that would prevent sanitation as
required every 30 days. A system of cleaning and sanitation must be in place.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- Lower level goat / sheep pen, housing mothers and kids: the amount of shade present still is not adequate for the
number of animals in the pen. All animals could not fit in the shade area, and the crowded conditions in the shade
area reduce the effectiveness of the shade cooling for those animals that are under the shade structure. When
sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort of the animals, sufficient shade by natural or artificial means
shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight.

SANITATION.
- Llama / Alpaca pen: Still has a heavy buildup of excreta, as first cited on April 28, 2014. The pen had been
cleaned and corrected by May 5, 2014, but is being noted again on August 27, 2013. The current cleaning schedule
is not adequate for the number of animals in the pen. A buildup of fecal material causes disease hazards. Excreta
shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained
therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
ORIGINAL CORRECTION DATE: 5-2-14
- Pygmy goat pen housing 2 goats identified as belonging to Cody Smith still has a buildup of excreta present. The
current cleaning schedule is not adequate for the number of animals in the pen. A buildup of fecal material causes
disease hazards. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
