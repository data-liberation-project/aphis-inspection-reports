HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The main building housing three species of non-human primates and a multitude of other species is overly
cluttered with crates, boxes, dirty dishes, brooms leaning up and hanging on enclosures etc. There is excess dust,
hair and debris throughout much of the enclosure mesh. The condition of this building does not facilitate good
housekeeping practices; the amount of clutter makes it difficult to effectively clean and sanitize the area and creates
an area for pests to thrive. This building needs to be addressed for the health of the animals.
3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The solitary lemur enclosure has a small two tier cat platform made of carpet as a structure. This structure is
stained and cannot be effectively cleaned. It should be replaced for the health of the animal.
*** The wood platform in the CTT enclosure is dirty and will need to be replaced soon because the wood cannnot be
cleaned and sanitized.
*** There is a wood door frame in the lemur enclosure that is not sealed. The wood is dirty and stained and because
it is not sealed it cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized. Per this regulation, the surfaces of housing facilities
must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or
removed or replaced when worn or soiled. This needs to be addressed to facilitate cleaning of the enclosure and for
the health of the animals.

3.84(a) REPEATCLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** There was an accumulation of food and feces in the cotton top enclosure that needs to be removed and cleaned.
This enclosure needs to be cleaned more frequently to prevent this accumulation of waste.
*** Currently the non-human primate enclosures are being cleaned every other day. Per this regulation and for the
health of the animals, they need to be spot cleaned daily with food and feces removed for the health of the animals.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Some of the fencing in the older bobcat enclosure is rusted and is beginning to flake off. These areas of rust
need to be addressed to keep the fencing in good repair and for the structural integrity of the enclosure.
*** The top railing on the gate for one goat pen has an area of rust that is pitted with a hole. This gate needs to be
replaced to keep the area in good repair.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** Two juvenile foxes are housed in the main building adjacent to each other, but not with each other. The fox on
the left had a small (cid:28)cat tree(cid:29) with a platform and a small hole it could go in as well as another platform. The fox on
the right had only bedding down and no structure or platform, consequently this fox was exhibiting abnormal
behavior patterns of spinning in circles and rolling and biting his legs and tail. There was nothing in the enclosure
that encouraged or allowed the animal to engage in species appropriate behaviors including hiding in a hole or den,
climbing or digging. This enclosure need to be addressed for the physical and mental health of the animal.

SANITATION.
***The bobcat enclosure needs to be cleaned, due to the buildup of hair in the corners of the enclosure. In addition,
there were several areas of excess hair and debris along the chain link outside enclosures for several species. *** The wood peg boards used as visual barriers between the cavy's and adult foxes is stained with urine and scent
marking and needs to be replaced with a barrier that can be cleaned. This needs to be addressed for the health of
the animals.

SANITATION.
*** The outside pig enclosure next to the goats has another structure in the middle of the enclosure. There is a
section of this structure a blue shelter box that looks like it could fall down into the pen. This structure needs to be
removed for the safety of the animals.
*** Two items a rabbit hutch and crate need to be removed from a goat enclosure. This is to keep the enclosure in
good repair for the safety of the animals.
*** Throughout the property there are excessive amounts of clutter, building materials, crates and items that need to
be cleaned and removed. The amount of clutter makes this an ideal area for pests to thrive and does not facilitate
cleaning and good housekeeping practices.

SANITATION.
*** There was still an abundance of fruit flies in the main building. Although there are fly strips up, they do not seem
to be effective on the amount of fruit flies in the area. A more effective method for controlling the fruit flies needs to
be maintained for the health of the animals.
*** In addition, the back wall of the building had an area of rodent droppings and a mouse was observed running
along the back wall. Rodents can carry multiple diseases that can negatively impact other animals. An effective
method of controlling mice needs to be maintained for the health of the animals.
An exit briefing was conducted with several facility representatives at the time of the inspection.
