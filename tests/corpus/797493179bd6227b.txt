2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were three dogs(#24,#16,#6) that had a moderate buildup of brown greasy material in one or both ears. A female
Frenchie (#24) black female had redness and irritation in both ears with a thickening of the inner ears and outer ear flaps.
A female Frenchie (#6) lilac/tan had additional redness and irritation in both ears with some thickening starting. The right
ear had some scabbing and inflammed areas within the ear and the inside of the ear flap. A female yorkie (#16) black/tan
had redness and inflamation in both ears. The dogs were not shaking their heads nor did they appear in any discomfort,
however the issues were found with random physicals during the inspection, and some of the dogs did appear to have
scratched at thier ears. The licensee had not noticed the issues since the last ear cleaning the month before so had not
contacted the veterinarian.

A buildup of dirt/grime in the ears can cause possible ear infections (yeast, bacterial or fungal) that could cause
pain/discomfort for the regulated animals.

The attending veterinarian must be contacted for proper diagnosis and treatment of the ears. All ears on the regulated
animals must be kept clean and free of dirt and monitored regularly and treated if there are any recurring issues.


This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by (3/19/23-60 days counted from 1st RL Inspection) or the
applicant will forfeit the license fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your
next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
