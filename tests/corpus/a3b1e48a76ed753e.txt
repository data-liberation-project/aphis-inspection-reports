FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Both shelters for the farm animals in pastures 4 and 5 have structure damage on the east side of both buildings.
Barn 4 has approximately 3' by 4' hole rotted away and the shingles at the east corner of the ceiling are damaged.
Barn 5 has an approximately 1 foot by 1 hole located in the upper area on the east side. These buildings must be
constructed of such material that protects the animals to avoid injury from an animal getting stuck in the hole or the
east sides of the wood from falling down from areas that are rotted. The licensee must repair or replace these
damaged areas to protect the animals.
