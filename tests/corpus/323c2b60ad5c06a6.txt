3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The enclosure containing 2 adult Asian soft clawed otters (1 male, 1 female) is outside of the facility’s main perimeter
fence. The otter enclosure is not enclosed by a perimeter fence.
On the west side of the property, there is a 6’ perimeter fence that is completely covered with a dense growth of weeds
and vines.
A perimeter fence protects captive animals from contact with unauthorized people, animals, and wildlife, who may injure,
kill, harass, or spread disease to animals at the facility. A perimeter fence also acts as a secondary containment system in
the event that an animal escapes from its primary enclosure.
Correct by March 12th, 2021 by installing and maintaining a perimeter fence that is at least 6’ tall and 3’ away from
primary enclosures and structures, and that is sufficient to prevent the entry of unauthorized people and animals.
Alternatively, a variance may be requested in writing from the Regional Office.
2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
Two young children were observed approaching an enclosure housing 4 adult red kangaroos. The children put their
hands completely through the fencing into the animal enclosure, up to the level of the wrist, trying to touch the kangaroos


and feed them carrots. There were no signs, barriers, or attendants around the enclosure.
Kangaroos can scratch, resulting in injury to children or adults. Kangaroos are powerful, and may crush or bend a child’s
hand or arm, resulting in serious injury. Small children may drop small objects into the animal enclosure which could be
harmful to the kangaroos if ingested.
Correct by February 18th, 2021, by housing animals in enclosures which provide adequate distance or barriers between
the animal and the public to assure the safety of animals and the public.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
