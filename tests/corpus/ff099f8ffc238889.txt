ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The white male llama 'Scooby' and white and brown female llama 'Susie' have overgrown hooves. The male's
hooves are overgrown and curved under so that weight is being placed on the hoof tips. The female's hooves are
curved to the side and the tip of two front hooves are broken. Overgrown hooves may affect gait, result in broken
hooves and/or lameness. The hooves must be trimmed to prevent these risks. The female is pregnant so the
licensee should involve the attending veterinarian in determining course of action for addressing the hooves.
