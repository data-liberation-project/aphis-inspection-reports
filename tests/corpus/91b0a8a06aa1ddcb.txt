ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The required written itineraries for traveling educational exhibits has never been received by the AC Regional
Director. A facility who is subject to the Animal Welfare regulations and who intends to exhibit any animal at any
location other than the person's approved site, except for travel that does not extend overnight, must submit a
written itinerary to the AC Regional Director. The itinerary shall be received by the AC Regional Director no fewer
than 2 days in advance of any travel and must contain complete and accurate information concerning the
whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. If an
engagement is accepted for which travel will begin with less than 48 hours notice, the facility must immediately
contact the AC Regional Director in writing with the required information. APHIS expects such situations to occur
infrequently, and facilities who repeatedly provide less than 48 hours notice will, after notice by APHIS, be subject to
increased scrutiny under the Act.
The itinerary shall include the following:
(1) The name of the person who intends to exhibit the animal and transport the animal for exhibition purposes,
including any business name and current Act license or registration number and, in the event that any animal is
borrowed/loaned, the name of the person who owns such animal.
(2) The name, identification number or identifying characteristics, species (common or scientific name), sex and
age of each animal.
(3) The names, dates, and locations (with addresses) where the animals will travel, be housed, and be exhibited,
including all anticipated dates and locations (with addresses) for any stops and layovers that allow or require
removal of the animals from the transport enclosures. Unanticipated delays of such length must be reported to the
AC Regional Director the next APHIS business day.
The facility must submit current written itineraries to the AC Regional Director immediately and then on a regular
basis as engagements are confirmed.
