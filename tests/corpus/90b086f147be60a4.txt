Facilities, general.
There were various areas of the facility in a state of disrepair.
Within the Boer goat pen, there was a broken wooden board and exposed nail heads on the fence between the goat
pens. Additionally, the rear fence had a gap approximately 8 inches wide by 10 inches long. There was also a large wire
hog panel that had become detached from the fencing and was lying on the ground in the zebu bull enclosure.
Failure to maintain enclosures can allow for gaps or sharp edges which can result in injury or entrapment of the animals.
Facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them.

Handling of animals.
On May 20, 2020, a male Katadin lamb, "Captain" escaped from its enclosure when the door was accidentally left open by
a staff member. The lamb was found injured in the adjacent horse field. The veterinarian was contacted immediately, but
the lamb died prior to the veterinarian's arrival. As a result of the staff member leaving the gate open, the lamb was able
to escape the safety of its enclosure and roam freely in areas with numerous hazards which lead to the death of the
animal. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause


trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Correct by handling
animals in a manner that ensures their health and safety. Correct by February 9, 2021.
2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were three goats with overgrown hooves at the facility. Spot, a red and white spotted goat, was observed with
overgrown hooves on both the right fore and hind limbs. Wally, a red headed goat, was observed with overgrown hooves
on the left hind limb. Lastly, Rex, a male angora goat, was observed with an overgrown hoof on the right forelimb which
was starting to crack. All the goats were in good body condition and did not display any signs of lameness or discomfort.
Failure to properly maintain hoof care can result in abnormal growth of the hoof and cause additional disease conditions
which can be painful to the animal. Correct by trimming the goats' hooves in accordance with appropriate methods and
frequencies recommended by your attending veterinarian.

2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There are four rabbits currently present at the facility, however, the inventory identified additional offspring that are no
longer owned by the facility. The birth of the zebu calf was also not included in the facility's animal records. Failure to
maintain accurate records of acquisitions and dispositions can make it difficult to account for animals under the facility's
care and ensure that animals are obtained from appropriate sources. The facility must keep and maintain up-to-date
records regarding acquisitions and dispositions.

Handling of animals.


During the inspection, there were periods of time where no readily identifiable attendant was present in the petting zoo
area. Within this area, members of the public were directly contacting numerous animals and offering feed provided by
the facility. With no attendant present to enforce and monitor the interactions in this area, there is an increased risk of
harm to both the public and regulated animals. Correct by ensuring that a knowledgeable and readily identifiable
attendant is present at all times during periods of public contact.
