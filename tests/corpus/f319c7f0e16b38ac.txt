Contingency planning.
The facility does not have a documented contingency plan.
If an emergency or natural disaster were to occur at the facility, the lack of a written contingency plan could impact animal
health if the staff are not prepared to respond to the situation appropriately.
Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate contingency plan to provide for the humane handling,
treatment, transportation, housing, and care of their animals in the the event of an emergency or disaster.

Facilities, general.
There were several areas of the facility in a state of disrepair.
In the large sheep and goat pasture, the right wall of the run-in shelter has detached from the support posts. This wall
separation caused an approximately 18" gap at the base of the building and exposed several sharp nails at the level of
the animals. There were also several pieces of plastic and other trash scattered throughout the pasture.
Additionally, a tree has fallen onto the rear fence of the Nature Trail enclosure housing seven goats and emus. The fence
integrity has been maintained, however, the tree is still suspended and could potentially fall on the animals. In the same


enclosure, another tree is in the process of falling onto the front fence. There is a large crack and break in the tree trunk
causing it to lean over the fence.
Failure to maintain enclosure fencing and shelters can allow for gaps, unstable structures, or sharp points which can
result in injury, entrapment, or escape of the animals.
Facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them.
3.130

Watering.
There was a buildup of algae and debris on the inside of the main automatic waterer in the the large sheep and goat
pasture. The water is clear and the health of the animals does not appear to be impacted by the condition of the waterer
at this point.
Failure to clean water receptacles on a regular basis can deter the sheep and goats from drinking and can introduce
disease hazards to the animals.
The licensee must clean the waterer at a frequency that will ensure potable water is provided to the regulated animals in a
sanitary receptacle.

3.131(d)

Sanitation.
There were a large number of flies in the petting area for the young hoofstock. Several flies were observed flying around
the bedding and side walls of the enclosure.
Failure to maintain an effective insect control program can allow for the introduction and spread of disease hazards to the
animals.


The licensee must ensure that a safe and effective pest control program is established and maintained at the facility.
