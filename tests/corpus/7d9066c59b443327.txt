FEEDING.
A plastic feed trough in the outdoor enclosure housing 3 female reindeer had food that had a foul-odor and was
covered with flies. One of the caretakers stated this was food for the reindeer that had become wet. Food that
becomes overly moistened may become contaminated with microorganisms causing it to spoil and deteriorate and
can attract pests such as the flies seen on this spoiled feed.
Food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times. If self-feeders are used, adequate measures shall be
taken to prevent molding, contamination, and deterioration or caking of food.
To be corrected by 6/6/2014.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
A large misting fan was lying on its side on the ground within the outdoor enclosure for 3 female reindeer. The
electrical cord for this fan had several areas where the rubber coating was frayed or chewed, exposing the
underlying wire. This fan and the frayed cord pose a risk of injury to these animals and should be removed from the
enclosure. If the fan is used for the animals during hot weather, it should be secured outside of the enclosure and
the wires should not be in reach of the animals or any potential source of electrical shock (water trough, standing
water, etc...).
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
Corrected during inspection.
