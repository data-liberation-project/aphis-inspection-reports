FEEDING.
Some the self-feeders in the main guinea pig building are pitted and severely rusted. Examples of pitted/rusted
self-feeders include enclosures numbered 27, 31, 32, 82, 134, 111, 113, and 114. These feeders are pitted/rusted
to the point they can no longer be adequately cleaned and sanitized properly. The rusty self-feeders must be
repaired or replaced so that they can be kept clean and sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by August
19, 2017.
