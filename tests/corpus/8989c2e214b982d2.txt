FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The drainage systems for the various stalls in the farm animal barn are clogged up as reported by an employee.
The employee stated that the stalls will not drain leaving the bedding wet with urine. If drains are used, they shall be
properly constructed and kept in good repair to avoid foul odors and to prevent backup of sewage. The facility must
unclog the drains and come with a method to keep them from backing up.
