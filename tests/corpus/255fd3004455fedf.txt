ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The kangaroo is ill. His head is tilted approximately 90 degrees (rotational torticollis). He appears weak and moves
slowly. He frequently falls over and has difficulty righting himself. The licensee stated that he seemed to start off
with vision problems and has been getting progressively worse over a couple of months, and that the Attending
Veterinarian (AV) had not yet been consulted.
The veterinarian must be promptly notified of problems of animal health in order to address them in a timely manner
to reduce animal discomfort and avoid suffering.
Corrected: The AV was called and assessed the animal on the day of inspection.

same day.
