ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Boston terrier, Identification number 4b17u7a34, is limping with her right rear leg. After a closer look the
right side of her mammary gland in the flank of the right rear leg is very red and moist. What looks like a scaly rash
also covers this area. This looks to be very painful and could be the reason why this dog is limping and holding this
leg up. The owner, must have this dog seen by a licensed veterinarian immediately, to determine what needs to be
done to insure that this dog is getting the appropriate medical attention needed. This dog also has a wound/sore on
her left leg by the knee. The breeder/owner must insure that this dog is properly cared for. Correct by 04-18-2015

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A section of the steel flooring in the New Kennel, inside enclosure on the north side, the coating has come off.
Where the coating is gone the steel flooring is rusted leaving the steel flooring less than 1/8 inch (9 gauge).
Flooring that is less than 9 gauge must be covered with a coating that protects dogs' feet. The owner/breeder must
repair or replace that area where dogs are to help insure that dogs' feet are comfortable and injury free. This will
help in the good health of dogs. Correct by 04-30-2015.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Owner.
