MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling. In July 2016, the animal care staff, upon routine daily observation, noted an injury to a rabbit and treated
the animal appropriately. The facility questioned the investigator, who then reported that one of the rabbits had
jumped out of it's 2nd level enclosure two days prior. The rabbit looked fine to him so he did not report the event to
the animal care staff at the facility. The rabbit could have become injured, therefore the animal care staff must be
notified of the incident so they can make the determination of the health of the animal, as well as, to allow the facility
to determine how to prevent a recurrence of the incident. Animals must be handled carefully and in a manner that
does not cause trauma and in response to this incident, the facility has implemented several measures to prevent
recurrence.
This item has been addressed by the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
