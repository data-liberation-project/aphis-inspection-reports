2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
A search for unlicensed regulated activity was conducted. The facility representative contacted stated that sales of
animals via wholesale were being conducted regularly. This is activity for which a USDA license is required.
Conducting regulated activity without a license does not allow the regulatory process, including routine inspections,
to ensure the welfare standards are being met for those animals. This is not in compliance with the Animal Welfare
Act. Correct by either applying for a USDA "A" license to conduct regulated sales via wholesale, or cease to
conduct these types of sales without a USDA license.
Correct from this time forward.
Note: after the search was completed, the facility representative stated that he plans to reduce his animal numbers
to below the 4 breeding female threshold which will exempt him from needing a USDA license under 2.1(a)(3)(iii).
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
