2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Two adult female basset hounds (id numbers 5 and 37) had reddened skin on the inside of all four legs and on their
abdomens. Neither dog exhibited any signs of discomfort or distress (such as chewing, licking, or scratching).
These two dogs were being monitored by the attending veterinarian who was present at the time of the inspection,
but no documentation of the attending veterinarian's diagnosis or treatment plan was recorded in the facility or
animal records. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication must be established, maintained, and
documented in order to communicate timely and accurate information regarding animal health and well-being
between the animal care staff and the attending veterinarian. To be corrected from this date forward.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
