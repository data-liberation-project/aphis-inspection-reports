FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** There were 7 Jacob sheep on the backside of Sugg facility in a temporary pen. Some of the sheep were
observed mildly panting and had been outside in this pen for over an hour in the direct sun with no shaded area.
When the animals are in a temporary enclosure they should still be provided with adequate shade to minimize direct
sunlight. Correct by June 3, 2017

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** During the inspection of the beef cattle and horses in the large turnout pasture there were two men that crossed
the perimeter fence to fish in the pond. The fence has hot wire on the top and is in good condition but it is suspected
that they gained access through a washed out area beneath the fence. The washed out areas beneath the fencing
need to be repaired to restrict animals and unauthorized persons from going under it and having contact with the
animals in the facility. Correct by June 14, 2017.

SANITATION.
** In the breeding room at the Pathogen-free swine facility there was an excessive amount of flies when walking
down the aisles. The walkway flooring was made of a flat concrete slab and the spilled feed accumulated in the
aisle attracting the flies. It was mentioned that the facility was washed down on Friday's weekly. Only in the
breeding room are the pigs fed where the feed spills on the a flat surface and not on a slatted floor. The standing
feed attracts flies and the frequency in which it is cleaned may need to be increased with an upgraded pest controlplan to help minimize the pests. A safe and effective program for the control of insects shall be established and
maintained. Correct by June 7, 2017
