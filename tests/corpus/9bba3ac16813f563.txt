3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
On today's inspection there are 3 raccoon and 1 fox in enclosures that are outside of the primary fence. In
addition, there were 4 cavy's identified on today's inspection that did not have an enclosure and a perimeter fence.
The perimeter fence was part of their primary enclosure. These animals do not currently have a secondary means
of containment in the event that they are able to escape from their primary enclosure. In addition, there is nothing to
prevent other animals or people from being able to make contact with these animals.All outdoor housing facilities
must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out.
The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
