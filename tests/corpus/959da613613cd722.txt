3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structure; construction. Housing facilities for dogs and cats must be designed and constructed so that they are
structurally sound.
***** At time of inspection the housing structures located in pen number two and three on the first row of pens
closed to the residence have plywood sides which have become structurally unsound do to age and weather. These
side walls need to be repaired or replaced with material which will make these housing units structurally sound and
in good repair.
There are currently pens not in use that the animals could be moved into. This would allow for needed repair,
replacement or removal of the housing units in need of attention. All other housing units should be looked at closely
and if any repairs are needed they should be carried out at the same time.
