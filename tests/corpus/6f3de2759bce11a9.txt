Watering.
There was no potable water available for two wolves at time of inspection. The stainless-steel container used to provide
potable water for them was empty and dry. There was a thin coating of dry dirt on the inside of the bottom of the
container.

Potable water is necessary for the health and comfort of animals. In warmer weather it is important to increase the
frequency of watering to keep up with animal's increased metabolic requirements.

If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and
comfort of the animal. Frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. All
water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
