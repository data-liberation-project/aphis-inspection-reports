FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-The chain link fence of the primary enclosure cage 85, housing a lion named Jax, and two tigers named Gemme
and Terra is approximately 12 feet in height straight up. There is nothing else at the top of this fencing. The current
requirements for enclosure heights containing adult big cats are a fence height of 16 feet straight up, or a fence that
is 12 feet high with a 3 foot kick-in at the top. The fence height for the current enclosure is inadequate to sufficiently
contain the enclosed animals at all times. The licensee has started welding another enclosure area that is
approximately 24 feet in height, which when complete would be of sufficient height to meet current requirements.
The licensee must modify the current enclosure or move the large cats to enclosures that are constructed of such
material that is appropriate for the animals, of such strength that is structurally sound, and are maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and securely contain the animals.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
