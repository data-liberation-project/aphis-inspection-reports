3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The following enclosures must be repaired.
1) The enclosure housing four deer (to the right of the house) has three fence post by the three sided shelter that
are leaning outward away from the enclosure. This section of fencing is no longer standing upright but is leaning
outward away from the enclosure. The deer may be able to run down the hill and jump over this leaning section of
fencing and escape. The fence posts and fence must be repaired or replaced to ensure the fence is upright to
contain the deer.
2) The enclosure housing 5 deer (the back right enclosure) has a three sided shelter that has the right side no
longer secured to the right front post. The side of the shelter can move back and forth. The front of the lowest
wood board on the right side is no longer attached to the frame. The right side of the shelter must be secured to the
shelter frame to be structurally sound and to prevent injury to the deer. There are exposed points of nails from the
right front shelter post that may injure the deer. There are also multiple exposed points of nails in the upper area of
the shelter that may injure antlers in velvet if the deer rub their antlers against the inside of the shelter. The
exposed nail points must be removed or hammered back to prevent injury to the deer.
Correct both by June 10, 2014.
