REGISTRATION.
A new Institutional Official (IO) was appointed on August 1, 2016. The facility did not report this change until a letter
dated March 8, 2017 was sent to the Western Region Director.
While this change in operation was reported to the Animal Care Regional Director, the facility did not do so within 10
days as required. Prompt reporting of substantial changes in operations of a research facility allows for USDA
activities necessary to assure regulatory compliance for animal welfare, care and use by the facility.
Correct: From this point forward
2.31(d)(1)(ii)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), hamsters were classified
under Category E due to unrelieved painful or distressful effects of administration of a disease-causing bacterium.
Under the section addressing consideration of alternative procedures that may cause more than momentary or
slight pain or distress to the animals, the Principal Investigator (PI) listed “alternative oral gavage mouse less
stressful” as the key words searched. The search therefore targeted the wrong species and potential alternatives to
and the effects of experimental administration of a bacterium in hamsters were not considered in the search.
The PI must consider alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to
the animals to determine that alternatives were not available. The search must utilize appropriate methods,
including key words, in order to effectively make such a determination. Without such a search, animals may
undergo procedures that result in pain or distress and for which alternative procedures, refinements to the
procedures, replacement with non-animal models and the like were not considered or used.
The IACUC must review appropriate consideration of alternatives and approve only protocols for which the PI has
adequately determined that alternatives were not available. Correct: From this point forward
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The flooring of the primary enclosures for pigs had areas where portions of the grid were either missing due to being
cut off and/or missing flexible coating.
Flooring that is not effectively maintained can cause injury to the pig, such as the foot becoming trapped with
secondary injury (such as breaking a bone or damage to the skin). Missing flexible coating can make the flooring
more difficult to sanitize and may predispose animals to disease.
A system of maintenance and repair for the facility must be in place to assure that the structural strength and
integrity of the facility is structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with Facility Representatives.
