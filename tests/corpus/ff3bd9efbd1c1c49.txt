2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A Female Boston Terrier ( #114) had reddened inflamed tissue protruding from the rear end area of the dog.
This reddened inflamed tissue was between baseball and softball in size. The protruding tissue on the rear end of
the dog, was sticking out just below the tail and hanging down between the dogs legs. The licensee was not aware
of this dog's problem until it was pointed out by the inspector. The condition of this dog could indicate an injury,
illness or other veterinary medical condition which may be uncomfortable. The licensee must have this dog seen by
a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan
is developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
To be corrected by: December 9, 2015.
The veterinary care issue for the Boston Terrier (#114) was addressed by the attending veterinarian, the day of this
inspection.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and Chad Proctor ACI.
