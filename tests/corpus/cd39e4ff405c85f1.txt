2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A zebu bull housed in the petting area was observed to have overgrown hooves, A castrated white sheep was
observed to limp and when standing held his left front leg up. The inside ( medial ) claw of his right front hoof is very
long. The alpaca's nails and toe pads are overgrown and turning inward in an unnatural position. The lower jaw of
one barbado ewe is not aligned with the upper jaw and bulges on the left side. The caretaker stated to the inspector
that the ewe was injured as a lamb and despite veterinary care the jaw did not heal properly. The ewe is in good
body condition and was observed eating pellets, however there is concern that the back teeth ( molars ) may be mal
aligned as well and with time the ewe may have trouble eating. There is one barbado ewe that was housed
separately. She is alert and active but very thin ( ribs, spine and pelvic bones are visible ) . She has feces matted on
her tail. A sika doe was observed to have extremely overgrown hooves. She flipped her feet out as she walked and
her back was in a hunched position. Severely overgrown hooves may cause pain or distress to the animals as it
prevents normal movement. Animals need to receive routine hoof care before their hooves become excessively
long and overgrown, The above listed animals need to be examined by a veterinarian and receive proper treatment
for their conditions and sedation if needed for hoof care.
