Housing facilities, general.
The bags of bedding material is stored under the carport. Several bags had tears in the bags 4"-5" long, resulting in them
being open and providing access for pests, vermin and for the potential spoilage and contamination. Supplies of food and
bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The
supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. To
prevent spoilage and contamination of the bedding, all open supplies of food and bedding must be kept in leakproof
containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.
