FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Feed storage room:
There was a large bag of timothy hay pellets with about a 6-8 inch sized hole which allowed the pellets to spill out
onto about a 5 square foot section of floor space beneath the food rack. Several other large bags of feed for various
regulated animals had evidence of chewing or small tears in them. Additionally, a bag of sweet feed used for
non-regulated animals was opened and on the rack next to the other bags.
Open feed bags attract rodents and other pests which may transmit disease and lead to contamination/deterioration
of the feed. There was evidence of rodent feces located on the floor as well as on the outside of a few bags of feed
at the time of inspection.
Supplies of food must be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding or
contamination by pests to ensure the health and well-being of all animals. A system of food storage which
adequately protects the supplies of food for all animals must be in place.

SANITATION.
Kitchen/Food Preparation Building:
-There was a heavy accumulation of dust along the window sills in this room as well as inside a cabinet used to
store animal medications and supplements.
- The two refrigerator/freezers used to store food for regulated animals had several areas with a moderate buildup
of a sticky, brownish-red residue from leaked juices of meats and vegetables.

Premises used to store animal foods, medicines and other animal use areas must be kept clean to protect andensure the well-being of the animals and to facilitate good husbandry practices. A system of a more timely and
efficient cleaning schedule must be in place.
