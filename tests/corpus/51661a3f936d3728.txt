2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The Asiatic black bear's left bottom canine tooth has broken down further to the jaw line. There still appears to
be a visual hole with black in the middle of the tooth. The vet came out to look at the bear with instructions to keep
and eye on the animal. Since the tooth has broken down further, the vet has not been contacted for further
assessment. Broken canines can be very painful and lead to infections that are potentially life threatening. This bear
should be re-evaluated by the attending veterinarian to assess the condition of the tooth and jaw and determine a
course of treatment.
*** The bears are geriatric and obese with their front claws removed. The diet of these animals is not of nutritive
value to maintain them in a healthy body condition. In addition to dog food, the bears are given left over food from
the club restaurant (pasta, breads, fries, and cooked meat products) which contributes to their excessive weight.
Additionally, according to the caretaker the bears are not fed more food during fall which is a period of hyperplasia
for them and therefore do not go down into a period of winter lethargy. Dietary issues in bears can contribute to
multiple health care problems and this diet should be evaluated by the attending vet to assure their dietary needs
are being met and maintained in a manner that prevents injury and health issues.
*** The Asiatic black bear was sitting down by the front side of the enclosure and was moving in a repetitive rocking
motion for extended periods of time throughout the inspection. This is an abnormal behavior pattern and can be due
to the limited functionality of his enclosure, or potentially from pain from a broken tooth. This bear should be
evaluated by the attending vet with appropriate methods to diagnose and treat injuries for this animal.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The chicken wire above at the top of the raccoon enclosure is broken and the raccoons are climbing through the
mesh and walking and defecating on the top section of the wire. The mesh needs to be removed or maintained in
good repair for the safety of the animals.
3.125(d) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Currently when the bear enclosures are cleaned, the bear feces are moved out and still piled next to the
enclosure dens which are located in the deer pens. Some type of appropriate trash container with a lid should be
provided so the enclosures can be cleaned appropriately and feces not placed in other animal area. This needs to
be addressed for the health of the deer at the facility.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
*** There is a strong odor in the raccoon enclosure due to the accumulation of feces on top of the chicken wire
above their nest box and platform. This section of wire needs to be removed and the feces cleaned to prevent
contamination to the animals and reduce disease hazards and odors.
