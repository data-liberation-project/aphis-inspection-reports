3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the goat enclosure near the front gate, a layer of wire around a large tree had curled up along the bottom edge,
exposing sharp points and a risk of entanglement.
- In the deer enclosure, the top rail of the fence next to a gate had slipped loose and was dangling at one end. This
is not secure, and needs to be repaired.
- In the "Fort Dade" enclosures, the wooden center support pools in the middle enclosure and one end enclosure
have been chewed and scratched by the tigers to a point where they are too narrow and shredded to be adequate
support structures.
- In an enclosure housing 4 tigers in the tram tour section of the park, a wooden resting platform has been chewed
and scratched excessively, leaving a row of exposed nail heads along one border of the platform. This is a potential
injury risk to the enclosed animals.
All facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect and safely contain all regulated animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
