2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The required records for a puppy sold on 3 September 2018 are faulty. The date of birth listed on the APHIS 7006
(disposition form) does not match the date of birth on the inventory record presented to inspectors for this puppy
and litter. In addition, the ID number used for this puppy on the inventory record is not the same as on the APHIS
7006 form. The inventory form for this litter does not list a disposition date for the puppies. Correct record keeping
enables dogs to be tracked through the regulated activities and facilitates the inspection process. The licensee must
make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information in this section
concerning each dog or cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or
under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or
exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or
her control. To be corrected by close of business 26 Sept 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
