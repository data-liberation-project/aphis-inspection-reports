3.13(c) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
During this inspection one adult dog arrived to IAH from BZE via United on AWB 016-73643625. No certification
was attached to the transport enclosure documenting the last time food and water was offered and specific
instructions for the next feeding and watering for a 24 hour period.
To ensure dogs are fed and watered during transport according to the standards and regulations of section 3.16
under the AWA the required certifications for travel must be complete and securely attached to the outside of the
enclosure. A carrier must not accept a dog for travel without a certification signed by the consignor containing the
date and time of last watering and feeding and food and water instructions for the next 24 hours.The certification
must be securely attached to the outside of the enclosure and easily readable. In cases of extended travel and
unforeseen delays these instructions will provide information to those unfamiliar with the animals that may prevent
potential dehydration and nutritional compromise.
3.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
During this inspection one adult dog arrived to IAH from BZE via Untied on AWB 016-73643625. The plastic food
and water receptacle (one receptacle divided in two sections) was unattached and overturned on the floor of the
enclosure. Food and water receptacles must be securely attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that
the receptacle can be filled from outside the enclosure without opening the door.
Providing food and water to this dog using the receptacle would require opening the enclosure for access.
Unnecessary opening of the enclosure could increase risk of animal escape or may be complicated because of the
animal's demeanor. Receptacles must be securely attached to expedite provisions for feeding and watering when
necessary.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the SMC Office Supervisor and Untied Cargo SeniorSupervisor.
