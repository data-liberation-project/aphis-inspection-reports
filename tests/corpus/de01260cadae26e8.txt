ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the sheltered housing facility, there was a female Boston Terrier identified as Mouse #0A01564144 that had
intermittent limited weight bearing on the front left leg. The facility representative stated that Mouse was bitten by
another dog about four days ago. On closer observation there were puncture wounds high on the inside of the left
leg. The facility representative stated that veterinarian had not been contacted, yet they had separated this dog and
were treating the puncture wounds. Limited weight bearing or non-weight bearing limbs are an indication of
discomfort, pain, injury or disease and increase the risks of further deterioration if not properly treated or left if left
unattended.
There was also a female Boston Terrier identified as Dawnde 2 #0A01652831 that was consistently and repeatedly
blinking her eyes. The eyes were tearing. The facility representative stated that it was probably allergies, no
treatment was being given and a veterinarian had not been contacted. Eye tearing and repeated blinking can occur
due to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful. The licensee must
contact a licensed veterinarian concerning both of these dogs for proper treatment and assure that all of the animals
are provided with adequate veterinary care as required.
To be corrected by July 29, 2016
***On the (cid:28)hands on vet check(cid:29) there was a male Boston Terrier identified as Shadow #0A01540410 that was
marked not sound for breeding. Shadow was still intact and being housed with an intact female dog. Dogs that are
used for breeding that have been identified as not being sound for breeding by a veterinarian, can increase the risk
of harmful conditions to either adult or the puppies. The licensee separated Shadow into a single housing enclosure
during the inspection. The licensee must follow recommendations of a veterinarian and assure that all of the dogs
receive adequate veterinary care as required.
Corrected during inspection.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative, Bill Heine, ACI and Bev Hicks,
