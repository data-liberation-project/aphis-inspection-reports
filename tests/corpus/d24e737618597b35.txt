ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1100 on
23-DEC-16.
The Inspector arrived at the facility and spoke to an employee of another company. Called contact number and left
a message on the machine. Spoke to Onsite manager, who told me that due to the holidays, they were short
staffed and only taking care of the animals today so no one was available for inspection.
