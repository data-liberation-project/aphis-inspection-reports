FACILITIES, GENERAL.

There is a strip of tin attached to the left side of the barn. This side of the barn is enclosed and used to house the
sheep and one buck. The tin has begun to pull away from the wood siding. There is also a piece that has been
ripped down the middle and is rolled back. There are now jagged edges and screws present. To ensure that the

WATERING.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that the water buckets for all of the animals, and the kiddie pool in the
alpaca enclosure, were in need of attention. The water buckets had an accumulation of algae, dirt, and grain
present. One bucket was being used by the water fowl and had an accumulation of feathers present. The water in
the kiddie pool, within the alpaca enclosure, was black in color. All animals need to have access to potable water.
The water receptacles will need to be cleaned out on a more frequent basis in order to keep them clean and
sanitary.

2.(cid:9)The last 4 stalls that lead out to the horse / pony paddock have an accumulation of manure present. The walls of
these horse stalls on the right are constructed of at least 6 wood slats. However, the accumulation of manure is so
high that only 3 slats are visible. On the left side of the barn the stalls are constructed the same way. However, the
accumulation of manure is so high that only 4 slats are visible. Due to the fact that the sheep, camel, goats, and
llamas are housed adjacent to these stalls, this area of the barn will need to be cleaned out.

3.(cid:9)There are several goats being housed up on the deck behind the owner(cid:25)s house. This deck also has several
different types of caging present. According to the owners this deck is housed down on a daily basis. However, an
excess accumulation of manure, hay and dirt has collected under the metal kennel type cage unit. This
accumulation is approximately 3 inches deep and is under the entire 2ft x 3ft cage unit. There is also an
accumulation of manure and dirt along the edges of the deck and on the stairs heading into the primate area. Due to
the fact that the goats have access to this entire area, it will need to be cleaned more thoroughly and on a more
regular basis.
