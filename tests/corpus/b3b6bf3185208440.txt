INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility is currently using animals under protocol 15-013. The activities approved on this protocol were last
reviewed by the IACUC on 13 November 2015. Review of protocols approving animal activity ensures that the
IACUC is aware of, evaluates, and approves of the use of animals in the facility. The IACUC must conduct
continuing reviews of animal use activities at appropriate intervals as determined by the IACUC, but not less than
annually. To be corrected by 22 June 2017.
