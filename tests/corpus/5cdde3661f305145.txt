2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
On 3/6/17, owl monkey AI-5099 was found deceased in the nest box after the cage had been processed through
the cage wash. Earlier in the day, the animals had been handled for diagnostic testing and transferred to clean
enclosures. However, one owl monkey was missed and remained in the nest box while it was transferred to the
cage wash room , hosed down and processed through the cage wash. Failure to properly transfer the animal for
cleaning purposes according to the Owl Monkey Husbandry SOP caused the animal to go through the cage wash. It
is unknown if the animal was alive prior to the cage entering the cage wash. A necropsy diagnosis to determine
cause of death was not possible due to the condition of the remains.
The IACUC immediately investigated the incident and promptly notified the USDA inspector. Corrective actions
implemented include retraining employees on the SOP for sanitation and adding additional requirements to the SOP
which include additional ID on cages, opening cage doors during transport to cage wash, a closer check of the nest
box and a final check of the entire cage by the cage wash attendant. Animal observations will be made at a time of
day when the animals are more likely to be active allowing for an improved assessment of animal health.

Inappropriate handling of animals can lead to unnecessary pain or distress. Handling of all animals shall be done as
expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
CORRECT FROM THIS TIME FORWARD
The focused inspection was conducted with the facility director and employees.
