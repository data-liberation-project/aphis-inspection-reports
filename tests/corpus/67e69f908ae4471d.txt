2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care states that the facility will have the attending veterinarian visit the facility annually.
The facility has not had the attending veterinarian out since spring 2016. Regularly scheduled visits by the
attending veterinarian are required to ensure that the health and husbandry practices of the facility continue to be
overseen by a licensed veterinarian. The facility must ensure to schedule regular visits by the veterinarian to
evaluate the facility and its animals.
Correct by September 8, 2017.
2.78(a)
HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
On at least two occasions since the last inspection (July 2016), the facility transported non-human primates that
they purchased across state lines without having a health certificate. Lack of a valid health certificate when
transporting non-human primates increases risk of moving disease and does not ensure that the non-human
primate is fit to travel. The facility must ensure that non-human primates have a valid health certificate issued by a
licensed veterinarian within 10 days of traveling across state lines.
Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
