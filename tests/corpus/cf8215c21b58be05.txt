3.101(a)(3)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The dry resting area where the male sea lion is usually housed (and, according to the keeper staff, where he usually
sleeps) is covered with a layer of black buildup covering the floor and approximately 1 foot up the side of the wall in
one corner. The shape of this blackened area is consistent with the sea lion'(cid:25)s body shape as he would lie in the
corner supported by the wall. This buildup is of organic material and cannot be adequately removed and disinfected
using the current cleaning methods. Inadequate disinfection of enclosure surfaces creates a potential reservoir for
disease and poses a health risk to the animals housed therein. All surfaces in a primary enclosure must be
maintained to facilitate cleaning and disinfection as appropriate. Correct by maintaining all surfaces of primary
enclosures so that they are durable, nontoxic, and facilitate cleaning and disinfection, as part of a routine, ongoing
maintenance program.

3.103(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor exhibit area for the four California sea lions does not provide adequate shade. The outdoor area
consists of a large circular pool with a rock structure in the center and two dry resting areas that are utilized for
training sessions as well. The pool is painted a highly light-reflective, light blue color on the bottom and sides.
There are a small number of evergreen-type trees on one side of the pool which may cast some shadows at times
during the day. During times that the sun is directly overhead, there is no shelter (either natural or artificial) for the
animals in the exhibit. The animals are locked out from their indoor enclosure space on a rotating schedule during
the day leaving a portion of animals with no shelter from direct sunlight on a daily basis. All of the sea lions have a
history of intermittent disease of the eyes. Although these conditions have been continually treated by the attending
veterinarian to help reduce the incidence of these flare-ups, excessive exposure to UV light (sunlight) has been
linked to the development of eye abnormalities in captive sea lions. Veterinary records show worsening of these
conditions during the summer (when UV exposure is greatest) - (cid:19) on July 28 and August 2 of 2015, two of the sea
lions were examined and treated by the attending veterinarian for corneal discoloration and squinting reported bythe keeper staff. It is likely that the lack of adequate shade may be contributing to the eye abnormalities in these
animals. Additionally, exposure to bright light can be painful for animals experiencing eye problems. Shelter shall
be provided for all marine mammals kept outdoors to afford them protection from direct sunlight. Correct by
providing adequate shelter from direct sunlight to help alleviate these chronic eye issues and prevent future
flare-ups.

3.106(a) DIRECT REPEAT
WATER QUALITY.
The facility has an ongoing issue with controlling the levels of chlorine in the marine mammal pools, particularly with
the four sea lions. Upon inspection of water quality records from the past year, it was noted that the chlorine levels
(especially in the sea lion pools) have been elevated (<1.0PPM is considered acceptable for sea lions) on at least 6
occasions:
1. In January of 2015 levels of chlorine were measured over 1.0PPM for four consecutive days reaching as high as
4.44PPM. During this month there were a total of eight days above 1.0PPM.
2. In February of 2015 there were a total of four days above 1.0PPM, reaching as high as 5.86PPM.
3. In August of 2015 there were a total of nine days above 1.0PPM, reaching as high as 1.91PPM.
4. In September of 2015 levels of chlorine were measured over 1.0PPM for ten consecutive days reaching as high
as 4.56PPM. During this month there were a total of fourteen days above 1.0PPM.
5. In November of 2015 levels of chlorine were measured over 1.0PPM for four consecutive days.
6. In March of 2016 levels were measured over 2.55PPM on three consecutive days.
Excessive chemical additives like chlorine can cause ocular problems in these animals. There is one adult female
sea lion (Maggie) with significant blue discoloration affecting both eyes (indicating corneal injury). At the time of the
USDA inspection of the sea-lion area on 21 March 2016, the keeper staff and attending veterinarian were assessing
an ocular problem with Maggie. The current flare-up is suspected by staff to be linked to the increased Chlorine
levels. According to the keepers and the attending veterinarian, all of the sea lions have had a prolonged history of
intermittent flare-ups involving corneal discoloration and squinting of one or both eyes, which is an indication of
ocular pain. Levels of chlorine in marine mammal enclosures must be maintained so there is no detrimental effect
to the health of the animals contained therein. Correct by ensuring that the chemical additives are maintained within
safe levels for each animal.
The inspection was completed on 3/21/2016 and 3/22/2016 with animal management staff and Veterinary MedicalOfficers, Kathy Campitelli and Michael Neafsey.
The exit interview was completed on 3/23/2016 with animal management staff and Veterinary Medical Officers,
Kathy Campitelli and Michael Neafsey.
