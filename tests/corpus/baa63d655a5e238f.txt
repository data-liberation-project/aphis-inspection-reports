2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
The evening of 12/21/22 around 5pm a keeper was attacked by an escaped North American black bear during routine
feeding and care of the animals. The facility’s emergency team responded and euthanized the bear. Upon interviewing
facility staff, it appears the gate to the west holding area was left open, and this is likely how the black bear was able to
escape the exhibit area.

The gate being left open allowed the bear to escape its enclosure and put the public, employees and the bear at extreme
risk for injury and death.

Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

Corrective actions have been implemented at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
