3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
A section of mesh wire was exposed in the ground in the porcupine enclosure. The animal had dug a hole in the dirt,
exposing the wire that was underneath. Exposed wire can cause injury to the animal. Enclosures need to be kept in good
repair in order to protect the animals from injury. The facility must correct this issue.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
1. The back corners of the perimeter fence for the porcupine outdoor enclosure is not three feet away from the primary
enclosure. There are areas where the perimeter fencing is less than one foot away from the walls of the primary
enclosure.
2. The outdoor enclosure for the cavies did not have a complete perimeter fence. A perimeter fence protects the animals
in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it, thus allowing contact with
the animals in the facility. Additionally, it serves as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. The
perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact
between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Non-dangerous animals


housed in outdoor facilities require a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence around their enclosure and must be at least 3-feet away
from any enclosures or buildings.
