2.126(a)(2)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
Records of animal acquisitions and dispositions for two red kangaroos acquired since last inspection were not available
for review at the time of inspection. Failure to provide these documents hinders APHIS officials from assessing the
facility’s compliance with tracking animal movements. The licensee must allow APHIS officials to examine records
required to be kept by the AWA.

3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
In October of 2022 a rhinoceros was transported to the facility, and upon delivery was placed in a temporary enclosure.
According to the facility, the animal was initially calm but progressively became more determined to leave the temporary
enclosure. Approximately a half hour after arrival, the animal escaped into the adjoining primary enclosure. The primary
enclosure was composed of five strand reinforced wire gauge fencing and a hot wire. The following morning, the facility
had been installing additional barriers to reinforce the temporary enclosure to prepare to re-crate the animal to transport
off the facility. The animal fully left the enclosure area. The animal was euthanized due to public safety.
-In the holding area for the bobcats, there was an unprotected electrical cord extending from an external fan to the outlet
within the holding area. In two of the shift spaces for the sloths, there were unprotected electrical cords for electric
heaters.
-In an enclosure with two Patagonian cavy, 1 two-toed sloth, and 1 tamandua, there was a section of 1.5 feet by 1.5 feet
floor wire fencing exposed with sharp points protruding.
-In the petting zoo area of the left side of the enclosure closest to the retail food distribution center housing goats and
zebu, the livestock fencing had extended pieces of wire ranging from ½ inch to 3 inches in length.
Enclosures must be of adequate strength to prevent animal escape, injury, and death.
Unprotected electrical cords or sharp points can cause potential injury or death to the animals contained within the
enclosure. The facility must ensure all enclosures safely contain the animals and protect them from injury or harm.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
There was excessive accumulation of fecal material on the surface of the wooden viewing platform accessible to the
public in the petting zoo area. The licensee stated the fecal material was likely from the peacock, guinea fowl, or the


turkeys. Excessive accumulation of fecal material can pose disease hazards to the animals and have the capability of
attracting other pests and vermin. Excreta shall be removed as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and
reduce pests and vermin.
