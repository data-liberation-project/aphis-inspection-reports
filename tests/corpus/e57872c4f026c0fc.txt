3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Wet, matted, heavily soiled litter covered the floors of 4 of 8 enclosures of guinea pigs. The floors of the remaining 4
enclosures had heavy fecal build-up. Wet, soiled litter can result in foot and respiratory infections which
compromises the health of the animals. Per this section, primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often
enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris, provided, however, that such enclosures shall be sanitized
at least once every 2 weeks in the manner provided in paragraph (a) (4) of this section.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
