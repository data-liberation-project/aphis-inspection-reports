3.87(a)(3)

Primary enclosures used to transport nonhuman primates.
While taking inventory at the Madison, FL Auction four bird style cages with tag numbers 1861, 1862, 1864, and 1865
were noted with non-human primates. Cages with tag number 1861 and 1862 had a common marmoset each, cage 1864
had a red-handed tamarin, and cage 1865 had two common marmosets. All cages had gaps between bars of 0.5 inch,
where the non-human primates could stick their hands and arms through. Getting their hands and arms through could
lead to injury to the non-human primate, injury to the public, or to animals close by as different species were placed in the
same area. Primary enclosures used for transporting non-human primates must be constructed so that the non-human
primate is at all times securely contained within the enclosure, and cannot put any part of its body outside the enclosure in
a way that could result in injury to the animal, or to persons or animals nearby.
