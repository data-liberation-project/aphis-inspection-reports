Facilities, general.
In the feed room there was one opened bag of feed that was propped up against the far wall and door. This bag of feed
should have been emptied into a feed bin with a lid and not left open as found.

Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration,
molding, or contamination by vermin.

Corrected at time of inspection.
