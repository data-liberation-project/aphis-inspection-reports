Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence was less than 3 feet from the primary enclosure housing 2 pigs, 2 goats and 2 Patagonian cavy. The
current perimeter fence is less than 8 feet in height and the licensee currently cares for 2 wolves.

unauthorized persons out. A perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the
facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. Fences less than 8


feet high for potentially dangerous animals or less than 6 feet high for other animals must be approved in writing by the
Administrator. Additionally, the fence must be at least 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure or must be approved
in writing by the Administrator.
The facility must construct a perimeter fence of appropriate height and distance from the primary enclosures or must
obtain approval by the Administrator.
