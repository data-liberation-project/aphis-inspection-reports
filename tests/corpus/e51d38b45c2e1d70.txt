3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In two of the cat enclosures, the towels had frayed edges with string-like cloth hanging from them and some towels
had holes in them. These pieces of loose string-like cloth in the enclosures can present a risk of injury to the
animals from entrapment or ingestion. All enclosures shall be kept in good repair including the towels that are used
in the enclosure. Fixtures in the enclosures should be removed or replaced when worn in order to protect animals
from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
