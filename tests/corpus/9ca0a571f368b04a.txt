Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A squirrel monkey was observed moving in an abnormal behavior pattern. For several minutes the monkey would run
from top right of exhibit down a branch, perform a very specific head turn and run back up the branch to top of exhibit. The
animal had hair loss at the base of the tail and is thin with ribs and the pelvic bone visible.

The Licensee had noticed these issues and the veterinarian was aware of the of the concerns regarding the animal being
thin. However, the veterinarian was not aware of the abnormal behavior patterns. The animal had been treated for internal
parasites under direction of the veterinarian but the animal did not gain weight.

Repetitive abnormal behavior patterns can be an indicator of stress or illness and the condition of the monkey should be
conveyed to the vet for diagnosis and treatment options.

A lynx was observed to be thin with a concaved abdomen and prominent hip bones. The facility stated this was a normal
body condition for this individual but had done some dietary modifications and provided parasite treatment. The condition
of the lynx was not conveyed to the attending veterinarian.


Although abnormalities regarding the health and well-being are being recognized, the facility staff is not communicating
them to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. Failure to communicate issues pertaining to health and well-being
quickly, can delay necessary care or prevent appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

Correct by ensuring that there is a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate
information of problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The indoor shelter area of the primary enclosure containing Olive Baboons has metal perching platforms attached to the
wire fencing. The perching platforms and wire fencing have excessive accumulations of waste and rust.

The Snow Macaque and Ring Tail Lemur indoor housing areas have unsealed wood frame. According to the licensee, the
facility currently sanitizes the indoor holding areas for all primates as needed, or a few times a year.
Unsealed wood frames are not able to be properly cleaned and sanitized. Failure to clean and sanitize as often as
necessary increases the risk of disease transmission.

Indoor primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and as often as necessary to prevent an
excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, waste, food waste, or disease hazard.

Facilities, general.
The lynx enclosure contained a wooden perching platform that was in disrepair, a nail head was exposed that was used to
secure the platform. The wood on the corner of the platform was rotted out and missing.
The platform no longer being completely intact compromises the ability for it to safely hold the lynx.

The wooden den box used in the coyote enclosure is rotting from the elements. The den box is no longer structurally
sound or able to effectively provide sufficient shelter for the coyotes housed in the enclosure.
The structure rotting and having holes in it can lead to the den box collapsing and can lead to exposure of the hardware
used to build the den to the animals.

The goat barn had metal siding that had been broken and bent outward. The breaks in the metal siding is exposing the
animals to sharp edges.
The metal barn in muntjac enclosure had a small hole, approximately 2 feet from the entrance of the barn. The hole had
created sharp points in the metal that were protruding from the barn where the muntjac had access.

Platforms and den boxes that can no longer hold the weight of the animal can collapse and injure the animals. Sharp
metal points from holes in the barn can cause lacerations to the animals housed.

The enclosures and additional structures inside the enclosure must be maintained in good repair to ensure the enclosures
are structurally sound to protect the animals from injury.

Sanitation.
Multiple species enclosures (leopard, coyote, zebra) need to have their enclosures and den boxes cleaned out of excess
feces, bones, debris etc.

Enclosures should be cleaned as often as necessary to reduce an accumulation of bones fed and not consumed and
feces to minimize disease hazards and odors.
