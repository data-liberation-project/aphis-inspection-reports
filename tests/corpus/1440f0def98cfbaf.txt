Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On 19 April 2021, five animals were obtained from the animal control shelter for the purpose of a teaching lab to
demonstrate appropriate euthanasia, necropsy, and tissue sampling methods. These five animals were scheduled for
euthanasia that day at the shelter and were selected by animal control personnel for transportation to the veterinary
teaching facility. Upon arrival the animals were received by faculty and the laboratory was immediately conducted. All
animals were humanely euthanized in accordance with AVMA guidelines by veterinary faculty. However, the facility does
not have a protocol that covers this type of teaching lab. The facility must develop a protocol, approved by the IACUC,
that completely and accurately details all aspects of the proposed animal use. This includes but is not limited to: species
justification and approximate number of animals to be used, a thorough description of any procedure to be performed on
the animals, methods to reduce or eliminate discomfort or pain, and a description of euthanasia methods.
To be corrected prior to conducting this activity.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
