ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Jacob sheep's front right horn has grown and curled back toward's its right eye. The horn was pushing against
the upper eyelid, causing its third eyelid to move out slightly over the eyeball. The third eyelid moving out over the
eye is a sign that the horn is pushing against the eyeball. The licensee said they trim horns regularly to prevent this
but that it hasn't been completed on the herd this year. Allowing horns to curl back against the sheep's face/head
can cause pain and further health problems. The facility must have the attending veterinarian evaluate this sheep's
eye and follow the veterinarian's treatment plan. Documentation of the treatment plan needs to be available for
future inspections.
3.84(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
An excessive amount of black flies were present in the area where a vervet is housed. Excessive flies in areas
where animals are housed can cause disease and spread disease from one animal to another. Ensure that the
buildings are maintained in a manner so that there are not excessive flies and that adequate pest control measures
are in place.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The den area for three kodiak bears has a hole dug out from the the back southeast corner that is big enough that a
bear could stick its paw out. Holes underneath enclosure walls could cause animal injury by entrapment or if not
corrected promptly could create conditions for animals to escape. Ensure that the areas in and around enclosures
are maintained secure and safe at all times.
3.129(a)
FEEDING. In the education building, three food bins storing carrots, apples, oranges, and other various produce are stored for
animal feed. A mouse was observed in the middle produce bin after lifting the top bin. Rodents such as mice can
contaminate feed. Feeding contaminated produce can make animals ill.
Assure that the animals' food is free from contamination. Assure that food is stored in a manner that prevents
contamination from vermin.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Excessive feces are present in the outdoor enclosure containing four adult raccoons. Two large piles of feces have
accumulated in the corners of the enclosure. Feces can produce odors and cause disease hazards that affect
animals.
Clean and sanitize the affected areas of the enclosure and repeat often enough to prevent build up.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
An excessive amount of black flies were present in the area where the serval, African crested porcupine, and two
coatimundis are housed. (This is the same area where the vervet is housed). Excessive flies in areas where
animals are housed could cause disease and spread disease from one animal to another. Ensure that the buildings
are maintained in a manner so that there are not excessive flies and that adequate pest control measures are in
place.
