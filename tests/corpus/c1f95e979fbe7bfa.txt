Sanitation.
**Several enclosures are in need of cleaning:
** Four enclosures housing a total of 10 raccoons have excessive feces and spent bedding that requires cleaning. All 4 of
these enclosures have feces on the floors, in catch pans, and around the shelter boxes.
** The floor of the bobcat housed outside is dirty and covered with feces, dirt, and spent bedding.
** The floor of the enclosure housing 2 cougars has dried urine staining on it. The walls of this enclosure are covered with
a layer of dust/dirt/grime that requires cleaning.
** The floor of the indoor enclosure housing 2 bobcats has a build-up of feces, spent food, and bones in one corner under
a resting platform.

These enclosure require a thorough cleaning. The license stated that he has started to clean but is behind because of
weather and recent employee availability. Failure to maintain clean enclosures for the animals exposes them to
increased disease hazards and contributes to odors in the facility. Correct this by cleaning and maintaining all animal
enclosures.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The records of animals on-hand do not match the animals observed on today's inspection. The inventory provided was
dated 2019. This inventory differed from the animals inspected. Specifically:
1 river otter on hand, 2 river otters on the inventory
13 raccoons on hand, 14 raccoons on the inventory
0 coatimundi on hand, 2 coatimundi on the inventory
0 lynx on hand, 1 lynx on the inventory
2 skunks on hand, 4 skunks on the inventory
1 wolf on hand, 3 wolves on inventory

There are also no records of disposition/death for any of the above discrepancies in the records.

Incomplete or inaccurate records makes animal tracking difficult to impossible and is especially important in the event of a
disease outbreak. Correct this by creating and maintaining accurate records of acquisition and disposition for all animals.
