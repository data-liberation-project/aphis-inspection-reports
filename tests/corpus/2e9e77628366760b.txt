ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the "North Hog House" there was an approximately nine year old black and white Pomeranian named "Bingo"
(Microchip 069853343) that had dark gray build up on the right molar teeth and the largest molar appeared loose.
Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue, and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the
ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The licensee must provide adequate
veterinary care to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
