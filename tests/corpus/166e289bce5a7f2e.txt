ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two black four month old wolf dog hybrid (one female, one male) are in need of veterinary attention. Both appear
slightly thin with ribs and spine easily distinguished. Their haircoats appear dry with hair thinning on their rear legs.
In addition, one of them has some small spots of hairloss under the eyes. They are both very active and energetic.
The owner reports they are eating well and that they have been vaccinated and dewormed but the only
documentation available for review was their initial set of vaccinations and deworming completed prior to
acquisition. A veterinarian should examine both of these young wolf-dogs to ensure that they are healthy and to
determine how best to ensure their body condition remains optimal. Correct by 8/14/17.
