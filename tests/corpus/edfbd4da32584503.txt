ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:15AM on
18-Sep-17.The inspector knocked on the door of the house. A family member indicated that the Licensee was not
available until later in the afternoon.
Lack of availability for inspection prevents any oversight by APHIS Officials in enforcement of the Animal Welfare
Act. Correct by ensuring that a responsible adult is available during those times for inspection.
Correct from this time forward.
