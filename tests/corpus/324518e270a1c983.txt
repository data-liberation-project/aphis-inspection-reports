2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On June 23, 2020 a 9-month old canine was found dead two days following a surgical procedure to place a tracheostomy
tube. The necropsy findings reported a large mucous plug was found below the tracheostomy tube, which occluded the
airway and caused asphyxiation. Daily observations of the animal from the evening of June 21, 2020 show that mucous
was detected by a member of the research team and not reported to the attending veterinarian. This identification of
abnormal findings constitutes a problem of animal health that must be communicated to the Attending Veterinarian. The
registrant must develop and implement a plan for effective communication of abnormal findings to the attending
veterinarian.
