2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30 on
05/25/2016.
The licensee's daughter-in-law indicated that the licensee and his family were away for a wedding and would not
return until later that day. She was not able to accompany the inspector as she did not have adequate knowledge
of the kennel operations. Lack of access to conduct the inspection completely prevents regulatory oversight by
APHIS Officials. Correct by ensuring that a designated, knowledgeable representative is available to accompany
APHIS Officials on inspection during regular business hours. If needed, contact your home APHIS inspector to
establish Optimal Hours for Inspection, consisting of at least 3 hours a day, 3 days a week Monday-Friday
7am-7pm.
