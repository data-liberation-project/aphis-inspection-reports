Notification of change of operation.
On Thursday, July 28, 2022, at 11:53 am, I arrived at the address given by the registrant on his application. No one
answered when I knocked on the door. I tried calling the registrant but the phone number "is not a working number."
While waiting in my vehicle, a woman drove up and parked in front of the residence and then entered the residence.
When I knocked on the door she answered and said that the former tenant had moved and that she has lived there for
about 2 weeks. I asked her if she had a forwarding address for the previous tenant and she replied that she did not but
"knew that they had moved to Kansas."

The registrant moved and did not provide a new address as required for an inspection to be conducted under the Animal
Welfare Act. Current address and contact information are essential to enforcing the Animal Welfare Act efficiently and
cost-effectively.

The registrant shall notify the Deputy Administrator of Animal Care by certified mail of any change in the name, address,
or ownership, or other change in operations affecting its status as an exhibitor, carrier, or intermediate handler within 10
days after making such change. Send to APHIS Animal Care, 2150 Centre Avenue, Building B, Mailstop 3W11, Fort


Collins, CO 80526.

No exit briefing was given because the registrant was not able to be contacted.
