FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal siding on the outside of the enclosure housing two wallabies is loose at several locations. This results in
sharp edges and exposed screws that could result in injury to the animals in the enclosure. These loose siding
panels need to be safely secured to the wall eliminating sharp edges and exposed screws. A regular program of
maintenance at the facility needs to be in place and followed.

SANITATION.
There are various cleaning supplies, including bleach, stored above the animal feed bins. These supplies are
caustic and should be stored away from any animal feed areas. If one of the bottles were accidently knocked over
the result could be contaminated feed. All cleaning supplies and any other item other than feed should not be in the
feed storage area.
