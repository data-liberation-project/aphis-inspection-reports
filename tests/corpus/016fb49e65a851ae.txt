During this inspection it was noted that the Zebu's hooves were in need of attention. The back hooves are excessively
long. These hooves are approximately 2" - 3" overgrown. To ensure that these hooves do not impede on this zebu's gait
they will need to be addressed. A preventative measure will also need to be implemented to ensure that the hooves are
maintained appropriately.

Facilities, general.
1. There is a small enclosure that houses 2 goats. This pen has a small shelter adjacent to the pig enclosure. The top of
this shelter is approximately 3' off of the ground and has a tin roof. The tin roof material has begun to curl up along the
edges and has split. There are now jagged edges present. To ensure the safety of the goats this roofing material will
need to be addressed.

2. The pig enclosure has an area by the gate, that is adjacent to the larger pen, that is in disrepair. There are 3 panels of
fencing that are being held in place with baling twine. However, the pigs have been able to get between these 3 panels.

There are now gaps and jagged edges present. All fencing needs to be secured with appropriate fasteners so that the
animals can not gain access to the various sections of fence.
