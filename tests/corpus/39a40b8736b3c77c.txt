HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A 1.5 year old bobcat was found during morning checks, by keeper staff, tangled in her blankets. The medical report
states the cat appeared to self-mutilate her left hind foot with loss of phalanges, in an effort to free herself. Records
indicate the animal received immediate veterinary care and is healing well.

unnecessary discomfort. A system should be in place to ensure items in animal enclosures are appropriate for the
age and species of animal.

corrective actions to prevent future occurrences.
