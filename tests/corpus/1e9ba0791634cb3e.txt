No non-compliant items were identified during this Re-License inspection.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

This site is determined to be in compliance. All sites used for regulated activity must demonstrate full compliance with the
Animal Welfare Act prior to issuance of a license.

Regulated activity may continue at all regulated sites until expiration of the current license. At that time, conducting
regulated activity from any site without a valid USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
