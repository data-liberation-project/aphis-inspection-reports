2.40(a)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility has had 21 goat deaths since August 2021. According to the monthly veterinary invoices and records, fecals
were conducted and parasite caseloads were found to be high. Wormings were performed routinely without complete
success. Veterinary records from November 2021 through August 2022 indicated that the goats could have died from
pneumonia caused by chronic intestinal parasitism. According to veterinary notes, the attending veterinarian
recommended, in both March 2022 and August 2022, that a necropsy would be the best means to determine the source
of herd problem, but the owner declined.

Each exhibitor shall assure that the attending veterinarian has the appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.

2.40(b)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Due to the high number of goat deaths the attending veterinarian recommended completing a necropsy to determine,
definitively, the cause of death of these goats. According to the attending veterinarian, a necropsy has been

recommended for a year but the facility owner has declined the attending veterinarian's request and recommendation.
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include: the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend, and
holiday care.

Facilities, general.
The following items are in disrepair:

*The wooden and wire fence, which serves as the primary enclosure fence for the Boer goats and sheep, is in disrepair.
One wooden fence post has a horizontal split, completely through at the base, thus leaving the post insecure.

*The post, nearest the caretaker entrance, wobbles significantly when touched. This post serves as the support for the
metal gate and the other portion of the fence.

*The wire mesh on the metal gate is damaged and detached. Damaged wire is protruding into the Boer goat/sheep
enclosure.

*The horizontal plank of wood, at the base of this fence, has deteriorated and has jagged edges present. The jagged
edge of this plank is barely secured to the post that has the horizontal split at the base.


*Rubber mats cover a large indentation of the earth directly in the center of the steer shelter. These surfaces are no
longer level and could cause harm to the steer in their efforts to eat from the interior hay feeder. Additionally, due to the
unevenness of this area, the steer could possibly not rest comfortably in the urine filled, low area thus affecting their
comfort and well-being. (See Section 3.131 a).

The above-mentioned items could cause harm to the animals housed therein. Damaged fence posts, broken wire and
damaged wood should be repaired and/or replaced to maintain structural strength and to protect the animals from injury.
The low surfaces in the steer shelter should be addressed to ensure that surfaces are level in order to prevent injury to
the steer.

Sanitation.
Urine was observed to be accumulating the low area of the mats inside of the steer shelter. Accumulations of urine can
cause contamination, odors, and disease hazards. Such accumulations shall be removed as often as necessary to
prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and odors.
