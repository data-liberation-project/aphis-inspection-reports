Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:00 am on

A telephone call was made to the facility representative and I was informed that they didn't have any animals and
they were planning to move to Saint Thomas, VI. I told them that they needed to cancel the PR license and request
a new license in the new location because it was a different USA territory. They stated they would send an e mail to
the office in NC next Monday, November 23, 2015 and will notify their plans and request a new application package.
An exit interview was conducted over the phone call.
