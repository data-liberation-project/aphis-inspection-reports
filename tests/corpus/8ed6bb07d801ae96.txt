FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In several raccoon enclosures there were areas where the wood was chewed or broken that need to be replaced.
In the foxes, skunks and groundhogs enclosures' the fencing lining the ground was exposed and an animals foot
could possibly get caught or the animal could trip. The rain is washing the ground away and it needs to be
reinforced. These structural repairs need to occur to prevent the animals from injuring themselves or compromising
the structural strength of the enclosures or perches that the animals utilize. Correct by December 5, 2017.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the primary enclosures for the raccoons, foxes and coatimundi's there were many toys that were broken, torn
and soiled that need to be removed. The were pieces of broken wood, soiled blankets and pillows that were beyond
washing. In one raccoons enclosure there was a torn shade cloth that had been shredded and falling through the
top of the enclosure. In the coatimundi's enclosure there were old fruit cup containers that had not been removed.
Trash, bedding, debris, food waste and broken or soiled items must be removed and disposed of to minimize vermin
infestation, odors and disease hazards. Correct by November 5, 2017

SANITATION.
** In the coatimundi's enclosure that contained Taz and the enclosure for the skunks and groundhogs there were an
abundance of flies. It is assumed that the flies are attracted to the produce and eggs that are being given. A pest
management plan should be implemented to minimize the flies in these animals enclosures. The facility should look
at options to do so and increase the frequency in which the enclosures are cleaned to remove the inciting factors for
the good health and well-being of the animals. Correct by November 14, 2017
