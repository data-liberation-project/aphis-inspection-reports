Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
Two dogs had just arrived to the cargo office at SFO on a flight from Miami. The dogs were on waybill #s 001-57248236
and 001-60181785. Both dogs had displayed on top of their crates an incomplete consignor's certification regarding
feeding and watering. Whereas the time the animals were last offered food and water was filled in, the instructions
regarding feeding and watering during travel were left blank.

Failure to provide instructions on feeding and watering during travel could result in improper care of the animals. One of
these dogs, in particular, had traveled from Costa Rica and had a layover in Miami. There is always a risk of delays, and
the consignor's instructions are helpful to safeguard the well-being of the animals.
3.17(c)

Food and water requirements.
Two dogs had just arrived to the cargo office at SFO on a flight from Miami. The dogs were on waybill #s 001-57248236
and 001-60181785. The dogs were in two separate crates, and in each crate the food / water receptacles had become
dislodged from the door, and were resting inside the enclosures, making it nearly impossible for airport personnel to offer
the dogs food and water during transit.



The animals should not be accepted for transportation without ensuring that food and water receptacles are securely
fastened inside the enclosure, and placed so that they can be filled without opening the enclosure. Failure to ensure
proper placement of receptacles could result in improper care of the animals, which could be detrimental to their well-
being.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with airline representatives at the cargo office.
