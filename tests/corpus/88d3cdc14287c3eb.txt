FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is pooling of water at the entrance of the shelter in a camel enclosure containing two camels. There is also
excess mud by the gate of the nilgai enclosure, though the mud is avoidable unless the animal comes to the gate to
visit. Both areas need substrate work to ensure adequate drainage during the seasonal heavy rains. The camels
need to be able to avoid standing water, which they can't due to its location. Being wet and/or muddy can result in
skin or foot problems, as well as being generally uncomfortable.
Correct the camel enclosure situation within two weeks, by 12/10/2014.
Correct the nilgai enclosure situation by the end of December 2014.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
