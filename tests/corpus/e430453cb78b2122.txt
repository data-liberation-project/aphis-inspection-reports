Facilities, general.
1. In the drive-through safari area wire which is normally used to protect one of the apple trees had fallen to the ground
and was observed in a pile. This was observed inside the enclosure where the animals are housed. Piles of wire that the
animals have access to can potentially cause injury. Enclosures need to maintained and kept free of debris.
2. There were multiple areas in the drive-through safari where the enclosure fencing was sagging and unstable. In
addition, there was a tree leaning on a section of the enclosure fencing. Enclosure fencing needs to be stable and secure
in order to protect the animals from injury or escape and prevent unwanted animals from entering.
3. There was a lean-to serving as shelter in the drive-through safari which was observed to be unstable since the support
beams were collapsing. This could cause injury to the animals if it collapses while the animals are underneath.
4. The shelter in the sheep pasture was observed in disrepair. There was a broken 4x4 support beam on the ground as
well as a plywood section of the wall. This can cause injury to the animals. Shelter buildings need to be kept in good
repair.
5. In the wild boar pen there was scrap metal and a ladder on the ground. This could potentially cause injury to the
animals if they were to become trapped or get their feet stuck. Enclosures need to be maintained and free of clutter in
order to protect the animals from injury.

Watering.
Potable water was not available in the wild boar pen at the time of inspection. Potable water must be accessible or
provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. The boars did have access to a large mud
puddle in one corner of the enclosure and one of the boars was observed in this water.
