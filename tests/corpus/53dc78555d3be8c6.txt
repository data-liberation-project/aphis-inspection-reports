2.31(c)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC did not review the research facility's program for humane care and use of animals, inspect all of the
animal facilities, or prepare and submit reports of these evaluations to the Institutional Official (I.O.) at least once
every six months. The last program review and facility inspection occurred on December 17, 2015, while the
preceding program review and facility inspection occurred on April 20, 2015. An evaluation of the research facility's
animal use program and an inspection of all the animal facilities are necessary to ensure adherence to the Act and
improve animal welfare. The results of these evaluations must be reported to the I.O. to keep them informed of the
nature and extent of the facility's adherence to the Act. The IACUC shall review the facility's program for humane
care and use of animals, inspect all the animal facilities, and prepare and submit reports of these evaluations to the
I.O. at least once every six months.
Correct this day forward.
The inspection was conducted with the secretary on 1/27/16 and the exit was conducted with the AV on 1/28/16.
