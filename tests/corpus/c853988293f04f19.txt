SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two fixed exhibits, one housing tamarins, the other lemurs, does not have a barrier between their primary
enclosures and the public. The absence of a barrier may allow the viewing public to have direct contact with the
non-human primates and this could lead to injury to both the animals and the public.

public that restricts physical contact between the public and the non-human primates.
