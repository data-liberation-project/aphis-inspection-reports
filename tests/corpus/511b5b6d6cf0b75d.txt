ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-There is insufficient evidence to determine that the tiger named "Sarabi" received adequate veterinary care prior to
her death. On 7-4-2015 the AV observed Sarabi exhibiting a left head tilt and breathing heavier than usual. The AV
diagnosed otitis and an upper respiratory infection. There was no indication a physical examination was performed
and it appears that only a visual examination occurred. No treatment was administered for this neurological
condition until 7-6-15. Public concern with Sarabi exhibiting neurological symptoms was noted. On 7-6-2015 the
AV prescribed Cephalexin 1500 mg. po, q8h. An entry on 7-24-2015 by the AV states meds were given without
incident and on AV visual examination, the tiger did not have a head tilt and breathing was assessed to be back to
normal. There is no park treatment log or record that the prescribed medication was administered to Sarabi.
An entry record from the AV on 8-24-2015 states drooling was observed from the right side of the mouth and no
treatment, diagnosis, or plan was noted. Eight days later on the morning of 9-1-2015 the AV made an entry that the
tiger was (cid:28)down(cid:29) the previous evening; panting heavy and not eating. She described the tiger as depressed, still
drooling, clear nasal discharge and walking to water but not drinking. The AV diagnosis was abscessed tooth. The
AV plan included return later in evening to sedate the tiger and performed a physical examination, collect blood, and
perform a dental extraction. After sedation, her physical examination findings included (cid:28)sloppy heart sounds(cid:29), clear
nasal discharge, possible cloudy left eye, no wheezing or crackle, but lung sounds were (cid:28)not crisp(cid:29), teeth (cid:28)looked
great(cid:29), a tiny tear was noted in the upper gum line at left canine; a piece of bone was noted to be wedged in the
area and was removed. No obvious abdominal masses were palpated, no external parasites were observed, and
possible mild dehydration was noted. The tiger was awake and walking after anesthetic reversal administered. On
9-2-2015 an entry was made that in the AV medical notes that Sarabi was ambulatory and eating. On the morning
of 9-6-2015 Sarabi was found dead in her enclosure. From the records complied by the inspectors from the AV and
the facility it appears Sarabi has been unhealthy starting in July 2015 until her death September 6, 2015. During this
period of time she received one round of antibiotics and one physical examination. No other treatment was
administered or prescribed. The only diagnostic tested preformed on Sarabi were a CBC and chemistry profile two
days prior to her death. The chronological order of events and documentation were difficult to determine because
the AV facility walk through notes are the only records maintained by the facility. Multiple areas regarding this
animal's condition were missing, poorly recorded, or not provided to the inspectors in a reasonable time period after
the actual inspection. Sarabi had drooling and other medical issues including mild dehydration, clear nasal
discharge, "(cid:28)sloppy cardiac sounds(cid:29) ", and abnormal lung sounds. These issues were not immediately addressedand no other treatment was administered. Documentation of the examination, diagnostic testing performed,
treatment prescribed, and plan for continued evaluation and follow-up needs to be maintained by the facility and be
available for review by APHIS inspectors. All relevant medical records must be provided at the time of inspection,
or within a reasonable time period. Documentation must be maintained for any health related problems and it must
include the following information:
- Identity of the animal.
- Descriptions of the illness or injury.
- Dates, details, and results of examinations, tests, and other such procedures.
- Dates and other details of all treatments, including the name, dose, route, frequency, and duration of treatment
with drugs or other medications.
- Follow-up exams to determine resolution of problem.

2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The facility is currently not conducting guided tours. During the inspection a black and white ruffed lemur named
"Andro" walked through a set of bars placed against the wire panels in the enclosure walls. The animal was able to
reach an area that extended beyond the existing public barrier making it possible for public contact to occur with this
nonhuman primate.
In two enclosures at the back of the park the enclosure walls contain plexi-glass partitions to allow clear viewing of
the animals. There were 1/2 inch diameter holes in these partitions in front of the river otter as well as the other
black and white lemur named "Yin". These holes are large enough to allow a finger to pass through, which could
permit contact with the enclosed animals. This is a potential hazard to park guests, and could negatively impact the
animals as well.
In any area where the public is allowed to feed or is able to physically contact enclosed animals there must be either
an easily identifiable park employee, or a public barrier sufficient to keep the public at least 3 feet away from the
enclosure wall. The facility must provide public barriers in all areas of the park. In areas where the facility will allow
contact and/or feeding of the animals, there must be an easily identifiable park employee present to supervise the
interaction with the animals.3.81(b) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
- There were eight enclosures with singly housed nonhuman primates present in each: one black-handed spider
monkey, one white throated capuchin, two black and white ruffed lemurs, one vervet and three ring tail lemurs.
There was no documentation that addressed the enrichment needs of these individually housed nonhuman
primates. If there is a specific reason these animals are singly housed, that reason must be stated and justified by
the attending veterinarian.
The individually housed ring tailed lemurs can see other nonhuman primates and are separated by wire dividers.
The individually housed vervet and the two ruffed lemurs cannot see other nonhuman primates. The spider monkey
and capuchin monkey can see each other without any contact. Individually housed primates may experience
increased mental and emotional distress at being separated from other primates, and therefore require additional
enrichment to help ensure their needs are being met. The environmental enhancement plan must include specific
provisions to address the social needs of nonhuman primates of species known to exist in social groups in nature.
Such specific provisions must be in accordance with currently accepted professional standards, as cited in
appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative and 2 APHIS AC VMOs.
