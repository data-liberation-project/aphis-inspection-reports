2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A 12-year-old-female Dachshund named “Vashti” had not received veterinary care for her medical problems. The
licensee stated that she had been attacked by another dog about one month earlier, so he had moved her into an
enclosure by herself. However, he did not have her examined by a veterinarian even though the licensee stated that she
had not improved with time. At the time of the inspection, the dog was lethargic, moved about very little, and was
extremely thin with a wasp-waist and visibly prominent ribs, vertebra, and hip bones. She had multiple areas of missing
hair over her head, legs, body, and tail with dry, flaky skin. Many of these areas also had lesions with yellow crusty
material and/or open, reddened sores. Both elbows had missing hair with crusty yellow material and dried blood. Both
hips had quarter-sized lesions with missing hair, thickened skin, and open moist sores with a yellow discharge. Untreated
medical problems can worsen with time, can be painful, and can affect the overall well-being of the animal. The licensee
must have this dog examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis, must follow the veterinarian’s treatment plan, and must keep
medical records for inspection.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JANUARY 18, 2023. NOTE: The licensee called his veterinarian during the inspection to
schedule an appointment for the dog.
3.1(c)(3)



Housing facilities, general.
Four enclosures, housing a total of 7 dogs, had a buildup of dirt and grime on the walls and floors in the sheltered
building. Dirt and grime can attract pests and can harbor microorganisms that can cause disease in dogs. The licensee
must ensure that enclosures are cleaned and sanitized frequently enough to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JANUARY 24, 2023.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. Exit interviews were conducted on January 17 & 18,
2023.
