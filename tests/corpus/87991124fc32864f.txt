ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the sheltered facility, there was an adult female Bichon identified as #00-0723-CAB2. This dog was putting full
weight on all four limbs, yet the left hind paw had a dime size, reddish blue raised area in between the second and
third digits. Lumps can indicate a serious condition and can be painful or cause discomfort to the animal. The
licensee must have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian to obtain a diagnosis and appropriate treatment
plan. The treatment plan must be followed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary
care at all times.
