Facilities, general.
About two feet of the chain-link fence for the sheep and goats was sagging. In other areas of the fence there were pointy
ends sticking towards the inside of the enclosure. The fence is in disrepair and could possibly injure the animals or may
allow the animals to get out of their pen.

The sheep and goats have a shed in their enclosure made of tin with straight edges along the sides. The animals could
injure themselves while utilizing the shed. The housing should be made of materials that are safe for the animals to come
in contact with.

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.


The owner had a wildebeest, two camels and four zebras that requires a six foot perimeter fence completely enclosing
their primary enclosures. The current perimeter fence ends at the back end of the house but is not connected together.
The perimeter fence must be at least six-feet tall and constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting
animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and
so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance
from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals
or persons outside the perimeter fence.

Feeding.
In the sheep and goats enclosure there was a small mound of old moldy hay in the middle of the pen. The owner stated it
was for bedding and no longer used for feeding but a goat came up during the inspection and started eating from it. If hay
provided is no longer wholesome or palatable it should be removed to prevent the animals from ingesting it and to
maintain the health and well being of the animals.
