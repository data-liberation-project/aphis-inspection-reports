HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The whelping boxes need to be addressed. The wood boxes are lined with plastic to facilitate cleaning, however
several boxes have sections of plastic that are broken, chewed and peeled away from the wood. These whelping
boxes need to be re lined or in some cases replaced to assure the enclosures are maintained in good repair for the
safety of the dogs and to facilitate cleaning of the enclosures.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The plastic mesh floors of the whelping boxes are being wiped down but not sanitized in a manner that cleans
effectively. There is hair and fecal debris left between the floor and the support braces and wood frame of the
whelping enclosures. This excess debris is causing a stronger odor in the area. The entire enclosure area should be
sanitized to effectively remove this debris and prevent disease hazards. This needs to be addressed for the health
of the dogs.
