ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has a new part-time attending veterinarian. A written program of veterinary care has not yet been
completed. It is essential that this be done. Veterinary recommendations for the care of the rabbits should be
included in the program. APHIS inspectors then use this information when inspecting the animals in order to
determine if veterinary recommendations are being followed by the facility. This program is a valuable tool in order
to ensure the continuing health and comfort of these animals. Complete a written program of veterinary care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The inspector observed three rabbits in the euthanasia chamber. These rabbits had been euthanized that day. The
facility employee stated that one of the rabbits had appeared to have a seizure and he thought it was dead. He
stated that he had placed it in the chamber with the other two rabbits to be sure. The rabbits appeared to be a
rather tight fit in the box and so I directed that they be weighed. The rabbits weighed 6.4 pounds, 6.0 pounds and
6.6 pounds. The facility SOP states that only two rabbits over 5.5 pounds should be euthanized at one time.
Failure to follow the euthanasia SOP can lead to unnecessary distress and suffering by the rabbits during the
euthanasia procedure. Facility employees should be trained and should follow the euthanasia SOP.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The inspector observed a rabbit which was about 50 days old in a hunched posture with its nose pressed up against
the front of the cage. The rabbit appeared non-responsive. It was removed from the cage by the facility employee
for closer inspection. The rabbit was cold to the touch and its hindquarters were covered with diarrhea. It was
determined by the facility employee that the animal met the criteria for euthanasia. It was euthanized. All animals
must be observed daily to assess their health status. The time this rabbit was observed was between 11:30 AMand 12:00 PM. Facility employees arrive at about 7:00 AM. It is critical that animals in need of veterinary care be
identified in a timely manner in order to not subject these animals to unnecessary pain and distress. The condition
of animals in need of care must be relayed to the attending veterinarian for treatment or pre-determined treatment
must be done as dictated by the written program of veterinary care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. A lack of properly trained employees can result in facility and animal conditions that
result in unnecessary animal suffering. At a minimum workers need to be trained in the following areas: cleaning
and sanitization methods, observation of rabbits for abnormal conditions or behaviors and proper euthanasia
procedures. This training should be developed in conjunction with the facility attending veterinarian. A list of topics
covered and attendees must be documented for review by APHIS.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Almost every cage rack in use at the facility has casters which are heavily rusted. Multiple casters were bent at odd
angles and appeared to be broken. Broken heavily rusted caters must be replaced. Enclosure systems for these
rabbits must be maintained in good repair to prevent possible injury to the rabbits. These racks could unexpectedly
tip or even fall, causing animal distress or injury. Repair and replace these casters.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Multiple primary enclosure cages had areas of wire flooring in the corners that was sagging and becoming
deteriorated. This is very likely because of the excessive buildup of urine and feces that is allowed to accumulate in
the corners of the enclosures. This wire must be evaluated and repaired or replaced if needed in order to prevent
possible injury to the rabbits caused by failure of this wire. Urine guards were noticed loose on the floor of several
primary enclosures. These urine guards do not function properly to protect the rabbits when not in place. Two
rabbits were noticed loose on the floor of the facility. The facility employee stated that he was not sure how the
rabbits had escaped as they were larger than typical escapes. He also stated that smaller rabbits did escape at the
back of the cages where the water lixits entered the cages. He stated that all escaped rabbits were euthanized. This caging must be repaired or replaced in order to prevent possible animal injury leading to unnecessary suffering
or escape leading to unnecessary euthanasia of rabbits.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The lixits for the animal watering system were running continuously in many of the rabbit enclosures. The pans
beneath these enclosures were full with a mixture of water and feces. Some of the pans were so full that they were
overflowing and splashing down on the sides of the cages of the rabbits housed beneath them. These rabbits were
becoming contaminated with a mixture of water and feces from the rabbits above them. These rabbits are not able
to stay clean and dry. These rabbits must be able to stay clean and dry for their comfort and to limit possible
disease transmission by the contaminated fecal water. The lixit watering system for this facility needs to be
repaired.

3.54(a)
FEEDING.
At least 25 rabbit enclosures had empty feed containers. I noticed that these rabbits came forward in their
enclosures as we approached. This is typical behavior for hungry rabbits. The facility employee indicated to me
that the rabbits are fed two times per day and that the first feeding is usually at 9:00 AM and the last at about 2:30
PM to 3:00 PM. It was about 11:30 AM and the rabbits had not been fed. Employees arrive at the facility at about
7:00 AM and had already taken their lunch break. They were in the process of cleaning at the time of my
inspection. Daily feeding and health checks of the rabbits should be a priority for the employees. Ensure that daily
feeding and health checks occur in a timely manner each day in order to prevent unnecessary discomfort or distress
to these rabbits.
A water lixit that was continuously running had flooded the cage pan below the cage in which it was located. A
mixture of feces and water was draining down on the food for the rabbits housed in the enclosure below. This
presents a disease hazard for the animals ingesting this feed. This lixit needs to be repaired to prevent the rabbits
from consuming feed contaminated with fecal material.

3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION. Numerous primary rabbit enclosures contained an excessive buildup of feces and urine on the wire flooring in the
corners. This buildup needs to be removed more frequently to control disease and odors in the facility. Waste
material can harbor infections agents capable of causing disease. When the enclosures are not clean, animals can
contaminate themselves by lying in this material. Clean these enclosures. Clean them as often as needed to
prevent this buildup of urine and feces.
Correct by: 2-11-15.
3.56(b)(3)
SANITATION.
The nest boxes used in primary enclosures are washed with a solution of bleach and water. The facility employee
stated that he uses a capful of bleach to a gallon of water. The bleach label states that 1/2 to 3/4 cups of bleach per
gallon should be used depending on the purpose. At a minimum, these nest boxes must be cleaned with a
detergent followed by a disinfectant. No detergent is being used and the bleach is not being used at an effective
concentration. The primary enclosure cages are being sanitized every 30 days according to a facility employee.
The cages, cage racks and cage pans are power washed using cold water. This is not an effective cleaning and
disinfection process. At a minimum, these items need to be cleaned with a detergent followed by a disinfectant. In
addition to this, nearly all the cage racks and cage pans are covered with a heavy urine scale. The cage rack
casters are covered with very heavy rust and multiple urine guards are rusting below where the cage lixits are
located. The condition of these items makes it impossible to properly clean and sanitize them. Improper cleaning
and sanitization can cause disease problems as many viruses, bacteria and internal parasites are not removed or
destroyed by using only cold water or water containing improperly diluted bleach. These items must be cleaned and
repaired or replaced. A safe and effective cleaning and sanitization procedure must be developed and followed.
Employees must be trained in this procedure.
