2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
A 30 year old female chimpanzee, Cleopatra, was introduced with her chimpanzee group to another group of
chimpanzees.

On April 6th, she was observed to be favoring her left hind limb and was suspected to have a primary left knee injury. On
April 16th, the chimpanzees in her group experienced adverse weather and were moved into an indoor space which
caused a fight to break out. Multiple members of the group focused their aggression on Cleopatra and she sustained a
traumatic spinal injury that resulted in her no longer using either leg to support herself and exclusively using her arms to
ambulate. The animal was treated but the decision was ultimately made to euthanize on May 4th 2021.

Based on this incident, the facility is currently updating their introduction SOPs and evaluating criteria for separation of
social groups. Handling of all animals must be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.

Housing facilities, general.
On Wednesday, June 2, 2021, a young four year old female chimpanzee, Carlee, was involved in two escapes from her
primary enclosure. In both instances of her escape, she remained on the wall of this barrier and was safely reintroduced
to her group and contained without the need for sedation. No animals or humans were hurt during these events. Since the
incident, the facility has addressed the method of escape by cutting trees near the barrier and replacing the metal plates
with beams so that the chimpanzee can no longer use them to climb.

Animals may be injured or harmed when they access areas that are not maintained for their daily use. Gaining outside
access could have resulted in animal or human injury. Housing facilities for non human primates shall be structurally
sound and maintained to protect and contain the animals securely.
