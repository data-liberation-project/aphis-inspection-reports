PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Section 3.28(c)(1)(iii) Space requirements for primary enclosures: There were 15 weaned guinea pigs, each
weighing less than 350 grams, that were housed in an enclosure measuring 21.5 inches by 29 inches. This
enclosure provided a total of 623.5 square inches of floor space, giving each of the 15 guinea pigs 41.6 square
inches of floor space per animal. Guinea pigs weighing less than 350 grams are required to have at least 60 square
inches of floor space. The enclosure is only large enough to house 10 of the 15 guinea pigs. Once APHIS officials
identified the number of guinea pigs housed in the enclosure, the facility escort moved 5 of the guinea pigs to a new
enclosure. Guinea pigs must be housed in primary enclosures that provide at least the required floor space for their
comfort and well-being. Correct from this day forward.
3.28(c)(2)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Section 3.28(c)(2)(iv) Space requirements for primary enclosures: There were two enclosures housing a nursing
female golden hamster and her litter with other adult hamsters: one with a male hamster and the other with a male
and a female hamster. Once APHIS officials identified these enclosures, the facility escort removed the extra adult
hamsters, leaving the nursing female hamster and her litter. A nursing female hamster and her litter must be
housed in a primary enclosure that contains no other hamsters for the safety of the female hamster and her
offspring. Correct from this day forward.
