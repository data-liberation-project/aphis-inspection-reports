FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During the inspection, a gray hamster ran across the floor of the room containing the guinea pig, hamster, ferret,
and hedgehog enclosures. The hamster ran through an open doorway and entered another room before hiding
behind painting and construction materials. The facility representative caught the hamster with a fish net and placed
the animal in its own enclosure. He stated that these escapes sometimes happen and that the hamster would be
placed in quarantine for a week and would be observed to ensure it was eating normally.
Primary enclosures must contain the animals at all times. An animal escaping from its enclosure can have
disastrous consequences including injury or death of the animal or injury to a person.
The facility must ensure that indoor and outdoor housing facilities for guinea pigs or hamsters shall be structurally
sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to
restrict the entrance of other animals.
Noncompliance was corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Three enclosures containing six short-haired hamsters, five short-haired hamsters, and nine long-haired hamsters,
respectively, had an accumulation of feces. There was feces in the feed bowls and covering the bedding of the
entire enclosure. Due to the lack of clean bedding, the hamsters were unable to avoid contact with the excrement.
Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards, to
reduce disease transmission, and to prevent the animals from becoming contaminated or soiled.
Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris:
Provided, however, that such enclosures shall be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.Noncompliance was corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.31(b)(1)
SANITATION.
***An enclosure, containing twenty-five gerbils, had a buildup of dust and paper debris on the lid. The dust was
covering the wooden frame of the lid, as well as the wire mesh that was directly above the gerbils below.
*** An enclosure, containing three albino hamsters, had a buildup of dust and paper debris on the lid. A metal putty
knife lying on the wire mesh of the lid was also covered in a layer of dust.
Dust and other debris can fall through the wire mesh into the enclosures below housing regulated animals.
Accumulations of dust and debris can decrease air ventilation for the animals and affect their well-being.
The facility must ensure that the premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from
injury and to facilitate proper husbandry practices. Premises shall remain free of accumulations of trash.
Noncompliance was corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and APHIS student trainee.
