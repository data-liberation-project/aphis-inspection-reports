ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****There were 2 adult dogs that had very long toenails. Cassius (male red and white Corgi, 0A01614650) back
toenails were long and deviated to the side. Chrissy (sable and white female Corgi, 0A01627640) front and rear
toenails were excessively long. Excessively long toenails can be painful and affect the gait. The toenails must be
trimmed and maintained.
