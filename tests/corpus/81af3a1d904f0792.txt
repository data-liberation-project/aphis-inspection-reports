OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the "barn" housing one male golden retriever, the building surfaces were not impervious to moisture. The
surround of the outdoor portion of the enclosure, and the interior and exterior surfaces of the barn that were the
shelter were made of wood. The floor of the shelter was made of concrete. The surfaces were not treated or
covered with materials that were impervious to moisture.
The surfaces that are not impervious to moisture can not be properly cleaned and sanitized and by design can not
be replaced, which can lead to disease hazards. The licensee must make all building surfaces in contact with the
animals impervious to moisture.
