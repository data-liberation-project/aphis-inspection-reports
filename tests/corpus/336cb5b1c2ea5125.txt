2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Facility representatives stated that one of the ocelots, "Pharoah" was in declining health but was being evaluated by
staff daily, as he had times when he appeared to be improving. During a review of medical records for Pharoah, it
was found that he was taken to an emergency vet (not the Attending Veterinarian (AV)) on April 6th, 2018, who had
recommended euthanasia, for a presumptive diagnosis of cancer. The facility representatives declined and opted to
return Pharoah back to the facility, where they stated that he began to feel better. However, the daily observation
logs noted several instances of Pharoah not eating or taking his medications (antibiotics and pain medications).
The AV stated that he had not been informed of Pharoah's inappetance nor of the difficulty in ensuring he was
receiving his medications, but that he had previously recommended that euthanasia be considered for Pharoah, due
to a poor prognosis.
During observation of one of the servals, "Khonsu", it was noted that he had an abnormal gait, in which he seemed
stiff, slow, and reluctant to walk. and when he did he extended his front legs longer than normal. His mentation
appeared dazed, with his tongue protruding, and he had several areas of matted fur on his back, indicative of being
unable or unwilling to groom. The caretaker noted that this was unusual behavior for him but that he had episodes
like this before in the last week with periods where he did seem better. The AV stated that he had not been
contacted regarding Khonsu's condition.
Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being, as well as a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the AV regarding animal health concerns, is needed so as to address problems in a timely
manner. Animals that are failing in health need to be adequately assessed in order to determine their quality of life,
and avoid unnecessary pain and suffering. Failure to do this can negatively impact the animals health by potentially
delaying necessary medical care and prolonging animal pain and distress.

3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure for the goat contained elements that are potentially hazardous to the animals:
- The wire mesh panels that comprise the gate and fencing are sagging, and present a risk for entanglement or
escape. The facility representative stated that the goat already had a history of escape.
- There was also a sheet of corrugated metal inside the enclosure with sharp edges.
Some of the exotic feline enclosures were in need of repair:
- Some feline enclosures had wire mesh panels that were damaged, exposing pointed wire ends, and openings
that pose a risk of entanglement.
- In the enclosure for the serval named "Khonsu", the plastic panels lining the side and back of the enclosure are
cracked with chipped areas at the top.
- In the enclosure for the ocelot named "Pharoah", there are several areas of peeling paint on the wall above the
bedding area where he sleeps.
Enclosures should be maintained in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and / or escape. Sharp
objects could cause injury, and sagging or damaged wire panels could result in injury from entanglement, or
escape. Deteriorating surfaces present an ingestion risk, threaten structural strength, and impede cleaning.
Animal enclosures should be free of objects that could cause injury to the animals. Enclosures should be
maintained in good repair, so that they can be kept clean. Enclosures should be regularly repaired so as to maintain
their structural integrity and prevent escape or injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The hay was stored in a small shed that was in the process of being cleaned out during inspection. It was noted
that the pallet the hay was stacked on was filled with dusty, discolored hay, indicative of mold. Within the discolored
hay removed from the shed, there were chicken eggs and a rusty handsaw.
Food should be stored in a manner which adequately protects it against deterioration, molding, or contamination by
vermin. Failure to properly store animal food could be detrimental to the animals. Contaminated / deteriorated food
shall be discarded, and all food shall be stored properly from this time forward.

EMPLOYEES.
A review of the diet plans for the exotic cats revealed that the Mazuri Carnivore Meat Slab Supplement was only
being administered in doses of 1/2 teaspoon per day when it was supposed to be 1 tablespoon per pound of
boneless meat fed to the animal (the average animal was being fed 1-1.25lbs of meat per day). When discussingthis with facility representatives, they stated that they were unaware of the directions for the supplement. Also,
during the inspection, it was identified that the two alpacas were underweight, with hip bones and backbone
prominent, and the facility recently euthanized an elderly alpaca within the last three weeks that was significantly
underweight at the time of euthanasia. The facility representatives had not previously identified the animals as
being underweight and had not addressed the issue. Also, at the time of inspection, the director seemed surprised
that repairs and cleaning that she had instructed her staff to carry out had not yet been completed.
Facilities are to have a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professionally acceptable
level of husbandry practices and shall be under a supervisor who has a background in animal care. Not following
dietary guidelines or recognizing when animals are underweight can have a negative impact on the health of the
animals. Ensure that employees are adequately trained in acceptable husbandry practices and are adequately
supervised by someone with a background in animal care.
To be corrected by July 2, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Facility Director.
