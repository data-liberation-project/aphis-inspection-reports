FEEDING.
Two areas of the processed food storage building need to be cleaned and sanitized. The heavy plastic curtains
(freezer curtains) at the door of the building have excessive amounts of dried blood from the traffic of the processed
deer. The dried blood was concentrated on the top of the curtains where they are attached to the inside of the
building. Additionally, there were excessive fly specks located on all of the light fixtures and electrical conduit within
the building. Both of these areas could potentially contaminate the processed food.
Thoroughly clean and sanitize these areas and repeat as necessary to prevent build up.
