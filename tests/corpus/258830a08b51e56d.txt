**Question E in Protocols 137, 154, 146, 171 does not provide a complete explanation regarding the justification of
species utilized in the protocols. The justification simply states "volume desired requires goats". The justification
should provide more explanation regarding the appropriateness of the species to be utilized in the protocols. It is
the responsibility of the IACUC to review the proposal to conduct activities involving animals to ensure it contains
the rationale for the appropriateness of the species to be utilized as set forth by the Animal Welfare Act.
