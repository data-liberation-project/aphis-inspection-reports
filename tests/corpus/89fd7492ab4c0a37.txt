FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Approximately 20 goats were running loose inside the perimeter fence in the public area. They had escaped from
their paddock. New fence panels have been purchased to prevent future escapes, but had not been installed yet.
Need to ensure that all enclosures are constructed so that animals do not escape and have direct access to public
that is not monitored. Correct by September 30, 2014.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the new drive-thru animal area, there are some gaps under the perimeter fence large enough for dogs to go
under, especially near area where mobile homes are near fence. Need to ensure that there are no large gaps
under perimeter fence to prevent entrance of dogs, coyotes, etc.. Correct by September 30, 2014.
Perimeter fence next to newly-acquired hyenas is only 6 feet high. Since these are dangerous animals, need to
have an 8 foot perimeter fence around the hyenas to prevent escape or entrance of unauthorized persons. Correct
by October 10, 2014.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Two new capybaras had only a child's plastic pool with about 2 inches of water. These are aquatic animals that
require a pool that is large enough and deep enough to allow species typical behavior such as submersion. Need to
provide an adequate-sized pool. Correct by October 1, 2014.
