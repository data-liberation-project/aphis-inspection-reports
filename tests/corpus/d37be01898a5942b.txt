PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were two enclosures that provided 2304 square inches of floor space that did not provide the required floor
space for the animals they housed. One enclosure housed 40 animals each requiring 60 square inches, totaling
2400 square inches needed. The second enclosure housed 42 animals each requiring 60 inches, totaling 2520
square inches needed.
Lack of proper space can cause injury and health issues, and impact growth. The licensee shall provided a
minimum amount of floor space of 60 square inches for each guinea pig that is weaned to 350 grams in size, and
101 square inches for each guinea pig great than 350 grams and nursing females with litters.

enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris: Provided, however, That such enclosures shall be sanitized
at least once every 2 weeks in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
