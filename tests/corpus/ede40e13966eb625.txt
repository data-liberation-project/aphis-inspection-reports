HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was a plastic bucket of dog kibble in the puppy building that did not have a lid. All open supplies of food must
be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage. Open food containers
can also attract pests which may spread illness among or contribute to discomfort of the puppies.
Item was corrected within an hour of inspection.
3.6(a)(2)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There was a long piece of metal construction material along the bottom of the inside of the outdoor enclosure with
the beagle puppies. The angled gap between the fencing of the enclosure and the metal material appeared just
wide enough for one or more of the puppies to enter and potentially become entrapped. Entrapment could cause
injury and stress to the animal. Primary enclosures should be constructed and maintained in a manner that protects
the dogs from injury.
The item was corrected within an hour of inspection.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Owner on 11/25/2014.
