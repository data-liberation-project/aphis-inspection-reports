ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- A coatimundi had hair loss on the tip of it's tail. The skin was red and moist, and the hair next to the tail tip was
wet. Hair loss and red skin are indications of illness, infection, or injury. The licensee stated that he had noticed the
hair loss but had not initiated any treatment. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian, and
appropriate treatment instituted. The licensee must keep records of any tests, diagnosis, and treatment.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The primate house is a sheltered building housing ringtailed lemurs on one end, and black and white ruffed lemurs
on the other end. Each set of lemurs has its own shelter area inside the house. Both shelter spaces were dirty,
with excessive feces on the floor of the ruffed lemur's space and excessive dried waste on a ledge in the ringtailed
lemur enclosure. An unclean environment is unsanitary, and causes a risk of contamination to the enclosed
animals. Also, animals with excessively dirty shelter space may be reluctant to enter the shelter. All surfaces in
contact with the primates must be cleaned as necessary to prevent waste accumulation.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the camel enclosure with 2 camels, the fence at the public contact area has bent panels and is not structurally
sound.
In the same enclosure the south fence panels are also bent. At the entrance of this pen's shelter the top bar of the
gate is bent and broken, and the gate is hanging loosely from the hinges.
In the first jacob sheep enclosure on the east end of the zoo the shelter has nails protruding, is leaning sharply, and
does not appear structurally sound.
In the second jacob sheep enclosure across the lane, the shelter has numerous holes in the walls and is in poor
condition overall. There is a dividing fence in this pasture that separates the jacob sheep from an enclosure ofdonkeys. This dividing fence is bent in numerous areas and leaning sharply.
In the enclosure housing a llama and a goat, the shelter is rusted and damaged in several areas, and has at least
one exposed sharp point.
In the entrance to the back pasture there is a barbed wire fence in disrepair, with multiple loose strands of wire. The
gate at the interior fence line is down, and there is a collection of panels and fencing being stored on the ground
next to the pond.
In the west pygmy goat enclosure there is an orange colored shelter that is visibly leaning and not structurally
sound.
At the other end of this same enclosure there is a section of fence which was removed from the connecting post by
the licensee. The licensee had intended to build a gate here, but has not done so. The enclosed goats are using
this open section of fencing as a gate, but this area of fence is not secure or stable.
In the south side llama enclosure there is a section of chainlink wire with two connected posts flat on the ground.
There is also a broken wire and pipe gate with loose wires near a feeder ( this was removed during inspection).
In the wild pig and potbelly pig enclosure sheets of tin are used as barrier walls. One sheet of tin has fallen and is
flat on the ground. Another section of tin is loosely attached and has exposed sharp points.
Facility structures that are not properly maintained do not provide a safe, secure environment for the animals. The
licensee must repair all indicated structures, and must maintain the facility adequately.

FEEDING.
- In multiple areas throughout the facility, the hay being supplied to the animals does not appear to be of adequate
quality. The hay is dark and discolored, and is in poor condition overall. Parts of the hay in several enclosures
appeared visibly wet, which causes a risk of molding. Poor quality feed is a potential source of contamination to the
animals, and may discourage them from eating. The licensee must remove this contaminated hay and replace it
with adequate feed.

WATERING.
- In the pasture housing a llama and a single goat, the automatic waterer is heavily rusted. In the fainting goat pen,
the automatic waterer was full of black mud and debris. When it was dumped out, there was a green discolorationon the inner surface of the waterer. Waterers that are dirty or excessively rusty do not provide clean water, and are
a potential source of contamination to the animals. Potable water must be provided as necessary to maintain health
and well being. All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.

SANITATION.
- In the zebra enclosure, there was an excessive accumulation of feces in the shelter and the area around the hay
bale. In the rear camel enclosure, the shelter ground is a mixture of mud and feces with no dry space. Fecal
buildup increases the risk of contamination to the animals, and is also an attractant for flies and other pests. Feces
and waste must be removed as needed to prevent buildup and to maintain a clean environment for the enclosed
animals.
- In the coatimundi enclosure, the sheltered area had a buildup of hair, feces, and other waste. This area must be
cleaned, and kept clean as needed.

EMPLOYEES.
- There are currently two full time employees and one part time helper. Based on the size of the park, the number
of animals, and the general condition of the facility at the time of inspection, this is clearly not an adequate number
of employees. With the current staff levels it has not been possible to maintain the facility in adequate condition
and provide proper oversight and care of the animals. The facility must find more employees to ensure proper
facility maintenance and animal husbandry.
