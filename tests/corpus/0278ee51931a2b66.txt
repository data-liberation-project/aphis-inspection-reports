OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At time of inspection one large dog house housing two dogs has one side completely gone. Dog houses with holes
do not provide adequate shelter from the direct effects of the winds, rain or snow blowing on the dogs. The dogs
could experience difficulty conserving body heat. Failure to cover holes in outside dog housing does not restrict air
flow from entering the enclosure causing further discomfort for the dogs. Covering all holes is necessary to ensure
the health & well-being of all dogs. To be corrected by 02-10-15.
An exit interview was conducted by Cathy Niebruegge, ACI and facility representative.
