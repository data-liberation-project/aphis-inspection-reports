FACILITIES, INDOOR.
(b) Ventilation.
The outdoor temperature today is 88 degrees Fahrenheit. Upon arrival for inspection, the APHIS Official noticed
that the shop seemed overly hot and stuffy. The owner and employee indicated that the air conditioner had been
down since yesterday (8-3-17) and is not currently functioning.
The 12 guinea pigs appeared to be affected by the temperature as indicated by their lack of normal movements. At
least two guinea pigs were observed lying in their bedding in a lethargic state. Fresh water was provided and the
guinea pigs readily drank from the bowl. Measurement of the radiant heat given off of the interior walls and bedding
of this enclosure read 87 degrees Fahrenheit by the Raytek Mini Temp reader. The ambient temperature has risen
above the 85 degree maximum. Additionally, there were no other means of auxiliary ventilation provided to the
guinea pigs.
The air conditioner must be repaired to maintain it in good working order and to provide adequate ventilation for all
the animals involved. Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs or hamsters shall be adequately ventilated to provide
for the health and comfort of the animals at all times. The ambient temperature shall not be allowed to rise above 85
[deg]F.
THE AIR CONDITIONER REPAIRMAN CAME TO REPAIR THE AIR CONDITIONER DURING THIS INSPECTION.
Upon return to the shop, after an hour and a half, it was clear that the ambient temperature in the building had
dropped to a more comfortable range.

SANITATION. (c) Housekeeping. Premises (buildings and grounds)
THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ARE IN NEED OF CLEANING AND/OR REPAIR:
* The rubber trim on the base of the office wall has detached and the interior insulation is now protruding out from
the bottom. This opening can be a harborage area for escaped insects and other pests.
* There are 13 bags of reptile substrate stored directly on the floor. Unopened items must be stored up off of the
floor and away from walls.
* The floors of this same rear room is covered with dirt and grime. The floors must be kept clean.
The office wall must be repaired to maintain the structural strength of the wall and to eliminate harborage areas.
Additionally, the bags of substrate must be stored up off of the floor to ensure the ability to adequately clean the
floor beneath them in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: AUGUST 12, 2017
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
NOTE: The previously documented non-compliant items have been corrected.
