FEEDING.
- The food receptacles in three of the four wolf dog pens contained a foamy, soupy substance with numerous
floating insects, vegetation remnants and had a build up of debris on the sides. Food receptacles must be cleaned
and sanitized at least every two weeks to prevent accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other
disease hazards. The licensee must clean and sanitize food and water receptacles once every two weeks in
accordance with the AWA.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
- The sheltered nonhuman primate (NHP) house in the back of the park and the sheltered chimpanzee/lemur house
in the front of the park had ambient temperatures above 85 deg. F when the inspectors arrived the morning of the
inspection. The sheltered chimpanzee/lemur building did not have an adequate method to cool the building. The
sheltered NHP house in the back of the park had a window air conditioning unit present that was running at the time
of inspection, however, it was 87 deg F in the air stream blowing from the unit at a distance of 2 feet. The licensee
was given the duration of the inspection to decrease the ambient temperatures in the buildings. The licensee
purchased fans and had them in the building at the end of the inspection. However, the temperature in the building
was even higher several hours after the initial temperature was taken. Excessive heat can lead to severe health
problems for enclosed animals. The sheltered housing facilities must be sufficiently heated and cooled when
necessary to protect the nonhuman primates from temperature extremes, and to provide for their health and
well-being. The ambient temperature in the sheltered part of the facility must not be above 85 deg F for more than 4
consecutive hours when non human primates are present.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- Numerous flies were observed the on floor, on food receptacles, and flying in the indoor portion of the enclosuresin the non-human primate buildings. The flies are also present in the chimpanzee and lemur indoor facility. There
was no observable mechanism for fly control noted by inspectors at the time of the inspection and the facility
representative stated no mechanism was in place. Flies carry diseases and may cause illness to the enclosed
animals. They can also contaminate food, water and living areas. The licensee must have an adequate program to
control pests in the buildings and must ensure proper pest control throughout the facility.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-The fence for the pigs and deer enclosure is leaning sharply in the back by the wolf and tiger enclosures. Fencing
in this condition is not secure, nor is it safe for the enclosed animals. The licensee must maintain the fence to keep
the enclosed animals safe and prevent unwanted animals from entering the enclosure.
