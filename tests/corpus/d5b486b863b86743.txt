SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
**Capybaras at this facility are housed in an indoor barn during the winter months without access to water to
submerge themselves. Note: the animals do have drinking water, just not water to wallow in.
When these animals are on exhibit in the spring and summer they have access to man-made ponds. The animals
have been housed this way for many years, and the licensee does not report observing any ill effects.
Capybaras in their natural environment spend a significant amount of time in the water. The tendency to submerge
themselves in water can be considered a normal social adjustment or normal behavior pattern. Inability to access
water to submerge themselves for part of the year can cause stress or discomfort to the animals.They should have
both a dry and aquatic section of their primary enclosure. Each portion should provide, at minimum, sufficient space
to allow each animal to make normal social and postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.
