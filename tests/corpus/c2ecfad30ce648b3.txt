ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 on
22-Nov-16.
During that time, the inspector knocked on the door of the house on the property. The inspector called the phone
number on file and left a message asking for a return call to establish current optimal hours of availability. The
inspector then waited 30 minutes in the driveway of the property before leaving.
