Sanitation.
Most of the hedgehog enclosures have soiled bedding and excess fecal material present. The licensee stated it has been
about 2 weeks since the enclosures were cleaned. Excreta and soiled bedding must be removed from the animal
enclosures to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors.

The hedgehog enclosures must be cleaned, and a more frequent cleaning schedule established and maintained. The
facility was most recently cited under this regulation on 2/13/2020.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
Dust and debris are present on the walls and along the window ledges of the hedgehog room. Much of the excess
material and equipment that was present on the floor has been removed; however, some clutter remains on one side of
the room. In addition, several of the floor tiles are loose and debris is present on the floor along the walls. Accumulations
of debris and loose flooring tiles contribute to odor and make it difficult to maintain pest control. Clutter makes the room
difficult to clean and sanitize.



The walls and floor of the animal housing room must be cleaned, and clutter and debris removed from the room. Loose
flooring tiles must be repaired or removed. The licensee must also ensure that the animal housing room is kept clean and
organized. The facility was most recently cited under this regulation on 7/7/2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
