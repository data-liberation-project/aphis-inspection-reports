FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is no perimeter fence surrounding the outdoor enclosure for the tiger. A perimeter fence protects the tiger by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the tiger.
Additionally, it functions as a secondary containment system in the event that the tiger escapes. A perimeter fence
of sufficient structural strength must be constructed and it must be at least 8 feet in height, 3 feet from the primary
enclosure wall, and restrict unauthorized persons and animals from going through it or under it.
