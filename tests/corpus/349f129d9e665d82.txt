2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-Cindy, an 8 year old black bear, was observed pacing for some time in the trailer and in the temporary primary
enclosure provided while traveling. The veterinarian wrote a note stating that she had visited Cindy at the home site
and pacing was not observed. The veterinarian further stated that Cindy should be provided barriers or enclosure
furnishings and/or alone time. This has not been provided. Pacing can be indicative of physical or psychological
issues that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modification.
3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
-While in travel status for several months of the year, the primary enclosure for the three bears is a rectangular
cattle panel enclosure set up in a building with pine shavings on the floor. There are no visual barriers in the
enclosure that allow the animals to avoid each other or get out of view of the guests. There are no furniture items,
water tubs, straw or bedding that allow the animals to express normal postural or social adjustments. Black bears
normally engage in postural behaviors of swimming, climbing, digging and denning and socially need to be able to
have the choice to get away from each other.
-Cindy, the female bear, was observed pacing in the travel trailer for at least 10 minutes and was observed pacing
inside the exhibit along the front panel for a period of time. In both the travel trailer and the public exhibit Cindy
seemingly would only break from the pacing behavior if the younger bear Barney would grab at her legs. She would
then turn on him mouth open until he would submit and she would begin pacing again. Pacing in black bears is an
abnormal behavior pattern and can indicate stress, frustration, or an underlying medical condition.
-When Andy, the older male bear, was brought out of the travel trailer and placed in the public exhibit, and when
treats were provided his movements were stiff and slow. Andy has been diagnosed with arthritis by a veterinarian.
Several times Barney, the younger 4 year old black bear, would try and elicit a response from the older bear and
would get on top of him and Andy would tolerate it for a few moments before opening his mouth and the youngerbear would get off. Andy has no way to separate himself from the younger bear which can cause additional stress or
is potentially painful in his geriatric condition.
-This inspection occurred on the MSU campus in Bozeman, MT.
