ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One red and white adult female Siberian Husky (microchip number 956000009938023) was observed holding up
or placing limited weight on its left front leg. The dog was observed placing weigh about 50 percent of the time on
its left front leg over an estimated four to five minute period in the exercise pen and walked with a limp when it did
put weight on the leg. The attending veterinarian was consulted by phone on 2 May 2017, when the injury
happened, but the licensee had no documentation of the phone conservation with the attending veterinarian, the
recommended treatment, or documentation that the medication had been given as directed by the veterinarian. The
treatment the licensee reports she gave to the dog, while it did improve the condition, has not resolved the medical
problem and suggests evaluation by the veterinarian should have been pursued before the time of the inspection.
Ongoing medical problems that cause the healing process to be delayed causes unnecessary pain, discomfort, or
suffering, which can create a negative impact on the animal’s health and well-being. The licensee must ensure that
all animals showing signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated in a timely manner by a veterinarian as part
of the facility’s programs of adequate veterinary care and that the facility uses appropriate methods to prevent,
control, diagnose, and treat diseases, and injuries at all times. The outcome of this consultation including the
diagnosis, treatment plan and how the condition will be resolved must be documented and provided to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct by
5/29/17.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One red and white adult female Siberian Husky (microchip number 956000009938023) was observed holding up
or placing limited weight on its left front leg. The dog was observed placing weigh about 50 percent of the time on
its left front leg over an estimated four to five minute period in the exercise pen and walked with a limp when it did
put weight on the leg. In addition, an approximately 1/2 inch, round, hairless, moist, lesion exposing pink tissue was
observed on the left front foot pad. The licensee stated that on the 2nd of May 2017 the dog was injured by a piece
of barbed wire. The licensee stated that she removed the barbed wire from the exercise area. The licensee statedthat she contacted her attending veterinarian (AV) by phone and was told to treat the dog with an oral antibiotic
twice a day and to clean the lesion with peroxide. The licensee stated she ran out of the oral antibiotic on May 17th
and had not ordered any more. The licensee has not communicated with the AV regarding the dog’s ongoing limp
and wound since the initial phone consult on 2 May 2017. The AV has not evaluated this dog’s injury even though
the wound is still present and the dog continues to limp and occasionally not bear weight on the left front leg. Foot
problems can be painful causing discomfort when the dog has to place weight on the affected foot. It can affect the
mobility and daily activity of the dog. An untreated open wound can lead to further medical complications,
unnecessary pain and distress for the animal. Failure to communicate illness, whether it appears mild or serious,
to the attending veterinarian, could result in improper care of the animals. For example, this could lead to failure to
seek professional veterinary care in a timely manner or provision of care that may not be appropriate for the
animal's condition. The licensee must observe all animals daily to assess their health and well-being. Daily
observation of the animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian provided that a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal
health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Correct by 5/29/17.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee stated that the injury to the left front leg of one female Siberian husky (956000009938023) was caused
by a piece of barb wire she found and removed from the exercise pen located on the north side of the east sheltered
building. The licensee stated that the injury occurred on the 2nd of May 2017. Sharp points could injure the
animal. The licensee must ensure housing facilities for dogs must be designed, constructed and kept in good repair
to protect the animals from injury. Correct from this date forward.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on four metal entryway doors and on the interior
fiberglass wall of three enclosures. Ten dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in outdoor housing.
The affected area covers approximately 60 percent of the fiberglass wall area and 50 percent of the metal entryway
doors. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards. This
indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or health risks. Surfaces which
are not cleaned and sanitized properly or often enough, increase the risk of disease hazards for the dogs or
puppies. Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the animals. All surfaces of housing facilities must
be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. The
licensee must ensure that all surfaces which any dog comes in contact with must be spot cleaned on a daily basis
and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b). Correct by 5/24/17.* The facility inspection done on 5/22/17 and exit briefing done on 5/23/17 were conducted with the licensee.
