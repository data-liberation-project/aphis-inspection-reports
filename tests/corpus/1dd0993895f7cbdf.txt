SANITATION.
Eight guinea pigs were housed within an enclosure with a solid bottom attached to an open metal top. A thin layer of
brown grime could be seen coating approximately one quarter to a half of the surfaces of the bottom walls. At the
intersection of the solid bottom with the metal top, areas with an accumulation of wet shavings mixed in with some
feces could be seen along the length. When asked, the licensee stated that the enclosure had not been cleaned for
about a month. Inappropriate husbandry practices and insanitary conditions can create unpleasant odors, attract
pest, and overall increase the risks of animal disease as well as discomfort. Guinea pig primary enclosures must be
cleaned and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks in order to prevent an accumulation of excreta and debris.

3.56(b)(1)
SANITATION.
The indoor and outdoor enclosures housing rabbits are not being sanitized with sufficient frequency. When asked,
the licensee stated that both the indoor and outdoor rabbit enclosures are sanitized twice a year. Additionally, a
moderate amount of feces and rabbit fur could be seen attached to the floor of the wire enclosures housing two
separate outdoor rabbits. Inappropriate husbandry practices could lead to an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris,
and excreta as well as an increase in disease hazards. Primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 30
days to reduce these risks and provide for the overall well-being of the animals.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The main building is currently housing a squirrel monkey, a lemur and two marmosets, along with numerous other
species such as binturong's, rabbits, guinea pigs and foxes. Upon entering the building, a strong odor of ammoniawas noted by the inspectors. This odor remained strong throughout the entire time the inspectors were in the
building and had a physical impact on the inspector with headache. The ventilation at the time of inspection was
insufficient in removing the high level of ammonia odor. Prolonged exposure to excessive ammonia odors can lead
to respiratory, eye and mucus membrane problems for the animals. Indoor housing facilities must be sufficiently
ventilated at all times to provide for the health and well-being of the animals within and to minimize odors, drafts,
ammonia levels and moisture condensation. A fan, near the entrance to the facility, was turned on in response to
the inspectors’ concern.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Two marmosets were housed in a tall metal parrot enclosure. Dark brown to black thick oily build-up could be seen
coating the majority of the metal strands on the bottom right section of the enclosure. The same build-up could also
be seen coating all the corners of the two enclosure doors as well as other areas where wire strands intersected.
The licensee explained that this particular enclosure is more difficult to clean thus resulting in the build-up seen.
Such unsanitary conditions can cause unpleasant odors, attract pest and have negative impacts on the animal’s
welfare. The licensee must establish an effective method to clean and sanitize the marmosets’ primary enclosure at
least once every 2 weeks to prevent an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, waste, excreta, and prevent disease
hazards.

3.84(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were several areas within the premises where housing facilities were located in need of cleaning and
maintenance:
- A significant amount of clutter was seen in the main building housing approximately 55 animals including
non-human primates. The same building was also used for food preparation as well as for storage. Empty
enclosures, some dirty, could be seen stacked above freezers and in spaces between or below primary enclosures
in use. Many empty metal barrels were being stored near the entrance. Other items, such as toys and boxes, were
being stacked above the occupied enclosures.
- A moderate amount of spider webs and dust could be seen hanging from the ceiling, covering the top ofenclosures as well as clutter items stored there.
- A moderate amount of peeling paint could be seen on the ceiling in the area surrounding the skylights above the
animal enclosures.
- A large amount of brown streaks could be seen running down the wall located behind the sugar glider and squirrel
monkey enclosures. In some areas of the wall, there was an accumulation of thick dark brown to black grime. In the
lower area of the wall, along with the brown streaks, there was an accumulation of wet dirty shavings mixed in with
some brown dirt. Dirt and dirty shavings could be seen accumulating on the structures stored below the sugar glider
enclosure.
Insanitary conditions in the areas surrounding primary enclosures housing animals can also lead to unpleasant
odors, attract pest and negatively impact animal welfare. Premises where housing facilities are located, must be
kept clean and free of clutter in order to facilitate husbandry practices and to protect the animals from disease as
well as injury. A system should be established and maintained to ensure housekeeping in animal areas is being
completed.

3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several areas of disrepair were identified throughout the indoor and outdoor housing facilities:
- One of the sugar glider metal enclosures had an excessive amount of flaking rust covering the metal stands, the
frame and perches within. One of the metal stands was broken on one side and could easily be bent.
- There was a wire protruding from the door into the outdoor pig enclosure. The wire was a sharp point and located
at eye level for the pig.
- On one of the binturong enclosures, there was a broken piece of wire overlaid on the surface that could easily be
pulled into the enclosure by the animal.
Surfaces in disrepair such as these may present a safety hazard for the animals within. The indoor and outdoor
housing facilities must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury.

SANITATION.
The betttong wallaby enclosure is stacked on top of a pig enclosure with the two sharing a wall. On the pig side, the
wall is covered in a brown to black layer of grime. The area below an old shift door is completely covered with a
thick layer of that brown black grime. The rest of the wall on the pig side has a thin layer of that same grime
covering approximately one third of the surface. Additionally, a large amount of dirty wet straw mixed in with some
dark brown dirt could be seen falling along the side of that common wall from the top bettong wallaby enclosure into
the pig enclosure.
One of the enclosures housing 2 sugar gliders had a wheel with a moderately thick layer of dark brown to black oily
build-up covering the majority of the outer edge.
The licensee acknowledged that sanitization of the shared wall and sugar glider wheel were not being done.
It is necessary to maintain a clean enclosure, including the fixtures within, in order to reduce contamination and the
risk of disease as well as discomfort to the animals. Excreta should be removed from the primary enclosure as often
as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to
reduce odors.
