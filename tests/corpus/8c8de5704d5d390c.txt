OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At the time of the inspection three German Shepherds were housed in outdoor enclosures. According to the
Weather Channel (weather.com), the temperature was 27 degrees F. The shelters in the outdoor enclosures had
little to no bedding material. During times of cold ambient temperature a lack of sufficient bedding material may not
allow the dogs to adequately maintain their body temperature which could have a negative impact on their health
and well-being.
Outdoor housing facilities must include a shelter structure that contains clean, dry bedding material if the ambient
temperature is below 50 degrees F. Additional clean, dry bedding is required when temperature is 35 degrees F or
lower. The licensee must add a sufficient amount of clean, dry bedding to the shelter for each of the three dogs in
order to support their health and well-being.
Correction date: The licensee added sufficient bedding material to the shelters at the time of the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.(cid:9)
