2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***The facility staff did not convey the health status of a nonhuman primate to the clinical veterinarian in a timely
manner.
A nonhuman primate, ID #RA1950, experienced adverse complications which required consultation with the clinical
veterinarian. From 04/19/16 through 04/21/16, facility records indicate that the animal was not eating its biscuits and
the animal would intermittently consume its food enrichment (4/19 & 4/21 the animal did not eat biscuits or
enrichment). On 04/22/16, the animal was found dead in its enclosure. Verbal conversations with the Study Director
and attending veterinarian, confirmed these observations would be considered a loss of appetite. According to the
IACUC approved protocol and amendments, when an adverse complication of “loss of appetite” occurs, the study
director and clinical veterinarian must be contacted. Additionally, during the review and approval process for this
protocol, the attending veterinarian stated “If the animals are not coping well with the initial insult, please contact the
veterinary staff.”
Verbal conversations with the Study Director and attending veterinarian and the medical record for this animal
confirm that the clinical veterinarian was not consulted regarding the loss of appetite (last notation was on 4/18/16).
The facility could not supply any additional documents regarding this incident.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Failure to properly communicate health problems to the appropriate personnel, can result in prolonged pain
and suffering and increase the risk of development of serious medical conditions.
The facility must ensure that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being, is communicated to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate veterinary care can be provided and
pain and distress is minimized. The inspection was conducted from 10/12-10/13/16.
A thorough exit interview regarding the non-compliance was conducted with facility representatives on 10/13/16.
