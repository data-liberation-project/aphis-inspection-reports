OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Along the back row the outdoor enclosure housing one adult dog named "Juno" did not have a wind/rain break at
the entrance to the shelter. Near the road the 5 outdoor enclosures housing the malamute dogs did not have a
wind/rain break at the entrance to the shelters. Not providing a barrier from the elements in the form of a wind and
rain break can result in a dog becoming wet, uncomfortable and unable to maintain a safe body temperature.
All dogs must be provided with shelter from the elements which includes wind and rain breaks at the entrance to
shelters.
