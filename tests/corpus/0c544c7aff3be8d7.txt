***The facility is not always using appropriate and timely methods to control and treat infections. Review of records
for a dog named "Whipley" showed the following: On 4/2/15, physical exam records indicate abnormal eyes, stating:
(cid:28)discharge (White-green) OD(cid:29). On 4/8/15, the doctor(cid:25)s SOAP form states a plan (cid:28)to monitor eye condition(cid:29). On
4/12/15, physical exam records indicate abnormal eyes, stating: (cid:28)OU inflamed, erythema, conjunctivitis, yellow
mucoid discharge(cid:29). On 4/14/15, doctor(cid:25)s SOAP form prescribes treatment of the eye condition with dexamethasone
ophthalmic drops.
There were no records indicating monitoring or treatment of the eye condition from 4/3-4/7/15 and 4/9/15 to 4/14/15.
Although medical records on 4/12/15 indicated a conjunctivitis, which had progressed over time since 4/2/15,
treatment was not started until 4/14/15. Injuries and diseases that are not treated properly and in a timely manner,
may be painful and can lead to prolonged suffering, infection, and other veterinary care problems. The facility must
use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
To be corrected by 7/24/15.
