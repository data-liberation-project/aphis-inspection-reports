Housing facilities, general.
An accumulation of pest droppings was observed around the food storage containers in the breeder building. A hole
which allows for drainage of the wash downs was noted in this area without a cover. Vermin can contribute to the spread
of disease and can have a negative affect on the health of the dogs. The licensee does have a pest control system in
place, however it not sufficiently managing pests. Drainage systems must be constructed in a manner which minimizes
vermin and pest infestations. The licensee must correct this issue.
