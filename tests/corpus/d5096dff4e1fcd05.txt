CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the Yorkshire terrier building nearly all the access doors in the dog enclosures has an excessive buildup of dark
brown dirt and grime on their surfaces. There are at least sixty dogs housed in the affected enclosures. The
buildup of dirt and grime can increase the disease risk towards the dogs.
Used primary enclosures must be sanitized once every two weeks, or as often as necessary, to prevent the
accumulation of dirt, grime, food waste, and other disease hazards. The licensee must remove the dirt and grime
buildup from the access doors in order to eliminate the disease risk. The licensee must ensure that all used primary
enclosures remain free of dirt and grime buildup at all times.
