ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1400 on
26-Jul-17. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I went to the front door of
the licensee's on-site business and knocked on the door. I honked my car horn. I went next door where the
licensee sometimes works and knocked on the door of that business. No one answered. I went back to the
licensee's house, honked the horn again, and waited 30 minutes. No one came home.
End of report.
