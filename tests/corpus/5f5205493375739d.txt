2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The facility started a daily vet care log for the drivers and guides to record animal health concern issues but it
only notes when there is a concern. The log has no place to follow up on contacting the vet and what the resolution
of the health concern was. So there is no way to track how animals are progressing after treatment. Daily
observation and the method that the information is conveyed and tracked between the farm management and the
attending veterinarian needs to be addressed for the health of the animals in the park. Additionally daily
observations were not recorded after November 2015 and based on vet care invoices multiple animals were seen
and treated with no coinciding documentation. Daily observations lead to early detections of animal health issues
and can assist the vet with a thorough history to help with diagnosing problems. This documentation is important in
the overall health care of the animals and an ability to communicate issues to the attending veterinarian especially
for adequate post procedural care.
*** The large male red kangaroo in the digester building that is blind in one eye had his head tilted and was walking
in circles around the pen continuously for several minutes during the inspection process. This circling is an
abnormal behavior pattern that could indicate potential health care issues. The facility did not recognize that this is
an abnormal behavior pattern and therefore did not convey this information to the vet in a timely manner. The
attending vet needs to assess the animals behavior and assist the facility with a plan to encourage normal behavior
patterns for the animals health and well being.
2.75(b)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** The facility is not updating its records of animals on hand in a timely and accurate manner. The total animal
number count has not been updated since July 2015. The facility has had several animals die (kangaroo, elk, bison)
sold (50+ bison) and born (kangaroo) since then but is not recording that information for months at a time. Accurate
and timely recordkeeping needs to be done per this requirement and to track the movement of animals. Correct by: Jan 22, 2016

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** The rabbits have been moved into a barn off site in a large sectioned off pen. 10 of the 12 rabbits had jumped
out of the pen and were running around the barn which housed birds and had farm equipment, excess wood and
miscellaneous items and debris. The rabbits need to be housed in an enclosure that can contain them for their
safety and well being.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** At the time of the inspection the ambient temperature was 17 deg F. The shelter for the pigs and smaller animals
in the small animal adventure section of the park does not have adequate bedding to provide protection and prevent
discomfort. In addition it is questionable that the young small pigs were acclimated for these temperatures to be left
outdoors. This needs to be addressed and the animals heavily bedded down for their protection and comfort.

3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** The kangaroos have been moved into the digester building for the winter months. The pens created do not give
the animals adequate space to engage in species specific behaviors. During the inspection one female kangaroo
stood next to the wall and did not move during the inspection and the blind male housed with her walked around in
circles the entire time. Both of these are abnormal behavior patterns and could indicate stress or malnutrition.
Additionally there is a loud noise constant in the building and no heat lamps were provided for comfort. The space
for these animals needs to be addressed to allow for normal species appropriate movements considering these
animals are housed here for 5 or more months of the year.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
*** The current kangaroo diet is a combination of rabbit pellet, sweet feed, flake corn and hay. There was no
evidence of mineral blocks or vitamin E and selenium which can lead to a vitamin deficiency. Additionally kangaroosare prone to lumpy jaw which can also be due to the wrong diet. The diet of these animals need to be evaluated by
the vet to assure the animals are receiving a diet that meets their nutritional value for their health and well being.

3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** The digester building which is used as a warm room in the winter months is currently housing kangaroos. The
area around the animals is filled with farm equipment, open buckets of hay and grain, tarps and other miscellaneous
items. Premises housing animals should be designated animal space and other items kept elsewhere for the safety
of the animals and to facilitate cleaning in the area. This building was discussed last year for this same issue and
needs to be addressed and a permanent solution for winter months needs to be in place so animals that need a
warm space for 4-5 months of the year have it in an appropriate design that facilitates adequate space and
husbandry practices.
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
*** The facility has over several hundred exotic hoofstock and other mammals and birds at a drive through animal
park. There are only four employees including the owner who are dedicated to the animal side of the business
during the winter months. This is not enough animal care employees to maintain the professional level of husbandry
practices and care for this type of facility. There is lack of information in regards to records of animals, daily
observations and vet care for the animals. The winter holding areas are spread out over several miles and are not
cleaned and maintained with lack of housekeeping practices. The facility needs to address this issues and hire
employees who are adequately trained for the current professional standards of care for exotic animals in a drive
through park.
