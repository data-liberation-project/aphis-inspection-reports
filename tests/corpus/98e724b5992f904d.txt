2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On December 15th, 2021, the facility's two male Visayan Warty Pigs attacked each other. Staff attempted to separate
them with hand clapping, yelling and with a water hose; however, they were only able to separate them physically with
baffle boards. Physical inspection of both individuals identified superficial wounds that were immediately relayed to the
attending veterinarian. The AV prescribed pain medication for a period of 5 days with the option of continuing until 10
days if the animals still seemed painful. During this period, the pigs were held separately with a wooden slated wall
between them. Daily observations and conversations with the facility staff indicate that the animals were spending a lot of
time together at the slated wall.
On December 20th, 2021, the facility decided to reintroduce the male pigs. The staff fed the pigs in separate locations
and, per the facility, things were going well between the animals at first. As soon as the food was gone, the pigs began
fighting again. The staff were unable to separate the males this time with two large baffle boards and after 1.5hrs, the
males separated themselves with the help of two additional curators with smaller baffle boards. Staff identified that one of
the male pigs had bent his lower left tusk at a 90 degree angle. The attending veterinarian was contacted again and
returned the next day for radiographs of the jaw. Radiographs confirmed that the animal had sustained a fracture to his
jaw and canine tooth, and subsequently required surgery to remove a fragment of the affected bone.


During a conversation with the attending veterinarian, it was confirmed that the facility did not contact the AV for guidance
and/or approval prior to reintroducing the males. Although the AV did not specifically prohibit the facility from reuniting the
animals, he did suggest that fighting amongst this species is common. Furthermore, the facility did not have a
documented, trained and regularly exercised plan addressing how to reintroduce conspecifics after a physical altercation.
The absence of such a plan, including intervention procedures and gradual timeline for reintroductions, resulted in animal
injury. Currently, a verbal plan exists and was communicated to the USDA inspector by facility staff. The facility must have
better established plans in place to properly reintroduce and handle animals in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.
Correct prior to the next relicense inspection date.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
A metal shift gate in the ocelot enclosure had a substantial section that was rusted through. Sharp edges could be
appreciated on the rusted section and potentially posed a risk of injury to the animal contained therein. The indoor and
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
Correct prior to the next relicense inspection date.
