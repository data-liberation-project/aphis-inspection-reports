RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
*** There was no acquisition information for the short tailed opossum in the store at the time of the inspection.
*** Four Prairie dogs were sold but the disposition forms only indicate a name and phone number. There is no
address or other pertinent information recorded.
*** Several breeding sugar gliders have died or left the facility but there is no date of disposition on record for the
animals.
All this information is an important part of the record keeping process and needs to be maintained in a timely and
accurate manner for record keeping purposes

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The sugar glider enclosures in the back area of the store have areas at the base of the enclosures that are
rusted. These rusted areas are beginning to pit and cause the enclosures to be in disrepair. These enclosures need
to be maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals and to facilitate cleaning of the enclosures.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** Two fennec foxes are housed in a small plexi- glass enclosure with a small plastic hut. This enclosure does not
provide enough functional space to engage in normal postural behaviors. Fennec foxes are diggers and will create
large dens underground. These two foxes were running around the enclosure and leaping off the hut. When the
door to the top was opened, they both leaped out quickly to move around. These animals need to be moved to alarger enclosure that provides more room so the animals can engage in species appropriate movements.

SANITATION.
*** The sugar glider enclosures in the back room of the store need to be cleaned more frequently. There is a buildup
of grime and debris along the door frame and sides of the enclosures. These enclosures need to be cleaned as
often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

SEPARATION.
*** The fennec foxes are housed in a plexi glass enclosure adjacent to the ferrets. Several times during the
inspection the fennec foxes stalked the ferrets and ran into the plexi glass in an attempt to get to the ferrets.
Housing these two species adjacent to each other can cause stress and discomfort to the ferrets or injury to the
foxes. The two species should be separated visually from each other for the comfort of both species.
