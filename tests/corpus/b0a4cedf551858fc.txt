2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several sheep and goats are in need of veterinary attention regarding limping/lameness issues. The owner reports
that he has treated chronic foot rot issues with Coppertox in the past and that he was planning on treating the
animals again this week but that the foot rot issues keep recurring. The attending veterinarian has not yet been
contacted to evaluate these animals in order to make a diagnosis and recommend treatment options. The current
written program of veterinary care does not address treatment for limping/lameness or foot rot. The following
animals were noted as limping today:
*in the female young sheep pasture- a brown ewe (right front), a brown and white ewe (right front), a white ewe
(right front), and a black and white ewe (right front)
*in the male young sheep pasture- a white with brown spots sheep (right front) and a white sheep (left rear)
*in the Nubian goat pasture-a black and white goat (left front)
Foot problems can be painful or distressful to the animals as evidenced by the limping/lameness. The attending
veterinarian shall evaluate these animals to ensure a correct diagnosis is made and an appropriate
treatment/prevention plan is instituted.
3.78(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two ringtail lemurs were moved to an outdoor enclosure recently in order for some construction to be done in the
building. The enclosure itself is made of wire including the top. There is no solid top/roof to provide shelter from the
elements including the sun (shade) and rain/storms that are common in the summer. There is a plastic barrel shelter
structure in the enclosure but it has an opening at one end without any type of flap or protective area. Shelter is
necessary to provide comfort and protection to the lemurs. The outdoor housing for the lemurs must provide
adequate shelter from the elements at all times including protection from the sun, rain, wind and any weather
conditions that may occur. Correct by July 4, 2019.
3.81(b) REPEATENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Two ringtail lemurs have been recently moved to an outdoor enclosure. Their enclosure currently contains only a
plastic barrel shelter structure and food/water bowls. There are no environmental enrichment items in this
enclosure. The current written psychological enrichment program for the lemurs includes a statement that the
lemurs will be provided with swings, firehose, tree branches and rocks to play on. None of these items were noted in
the enclosure during the inspection. The physical environment in the enclosure must be enriched by providing
means of expressing non-injurious species typical activities in order to promote the psychological well-being of the
lemurs.

WATERING.
The water in the water receptacles for the camels is opaque and green brown in color. The bottom of the water
receptacles cannot be visualized through the water. The animals may choose not to drink the water if it is not
potable and the dirty water may also lead to spread of disease. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and
sanitary. Correct by July 3, 2019.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The bactrian camel was noted to be biting at its flank, jumping in place and rubbing itself against the enclosure
fencing. Large horse fly type flies were noted landing on and biting the camel. Large numbers of stable/house fly
type flies were also noted in the camel and several other animal enclosures. Flies can cause discomfort to the
animals and spread disease. The program of veterinary care states that fly spray/wipes should be used as needed
for flies. No evidence of fly prevention methods were noted being used. The facility shall establish and maintain a
safe and effective program for control of insects.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
