Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
In a recent amendment to the vole protocol, dexamethasone was added to the post-surgical procedures without a
complete description of how it would be used in the study. At the time of inspection, the lab stated that the
dexamethasone was only being used in half of the animals undergoing a specific surgical procedure in order to test if it
improved outcomes. The amendment that was approved does not describe this process or which animals would receive
the dexamethasone. The designated member that approved this amendment believed that dexamethasone was being
added for every vole undergoing the procedure. Additionally, the route of administration for the dexamethasone in the
protocol does not match the standard operating procedure (SOP) that the lab uses for post-operative care. This SOP is
not mentioned in the protocol.
A complete description of the use of the animals is necessary in a protocol to ensure that all research staff and IACUC
members are aware of the details regarding the study activities being conducted on the animals and the parameters in
place to assure the health and comfort of the animals. In addition, the IACUC members need a complete description to
understand the proposed use of the animals in order to approve the protocol and to assure compliance with regulatory
requirements. This protocol must be amended to give a complete and accurate description of intended animal use.

Personnel qualifications.
On July 23, 2021, one adult prairie vole was found dead following a surgical procedure outlined in an IACUC approved
protocol. The study protocol was recently amended to include the use of dexamethasone in post-surgical care for up to
seven days; however, the amount administered during two doses was above the dose specified. The volume given to the
vole was calculated based on a diluted solution of dexamethasone, but was drawn from a non-diluted source, resulting in
the administration of 100 times the approved dose.
It is the responsibility of the research facility to provide training and instruction to all personnel with sufficient frequency to
fulfill the research facility’s responsibility. The facility must devise a plan to ensure adequate training in the proper pre-
procedural and post-procedural care of animals for all employees.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
