3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Between the "East building" and the "East outdoor" enclosures, there is a drainage pipe coming from the East
building into a shallow trench which deposits runoff with feces, urine, food and other organic materials. This is
causing odors and attracting a significant number of flies. This shallow trench is located between 15 and 20 feet
away from and affecting 17 adult dogs. Also, around the edges of the East Outdoor enclosures, affecting 14 adult
dogs, there are feces, urine, food, bedding and other organic materials from hosing the enclosures the day prior. A
significant number of flies were around these piles. Flies can cause the spread of disease and affect the health and
well-being of the animals. The licensee must remove this material and ensure that the drainage runoff is far enough
away from the animals to prevent odors, diseases, pests, and vermin infestation.

3.6(a)(2)(9)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In an outdoor enclosure, housing one boxer, there are two wooden support beams which have been chewed.
These wooden beams are splintered and are no longer impervious to moisture. The inspectors instructed the
licensee to apply water to the chewed and splintered areas. When she did, the water did not bead up but soaked
into the wood. These surfaces can no longer be properly cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must repair or
replace these wooden beams and ensure that all surfaces in contact with the animals can be cleaned and sanitized
in accordance with 3.11 (b).

3.10 DIRECT
WATERING.
In two of the "South outdoor enclosures," affecting four dogs, the water receptacles were empty. The dogs were
panting and pacing back in forth in front of the empty water receptacle. When the inspectors questioned the
licensee about when the last time the dogs had been provided water, she replied, "Sometime between 2:00 and6:00 pm" the day prior. It was approximately 12:30 pm at the time of inspection of these enclosures. The licensee
was instructed to provide the dogs with water. When she did, the two Saint Bernards began drinking veraciously
and non-stop for over five minutes. When she provided the other two Saint Bernards with water, they also drank
veraciously for over 2 ½ minutes. Lack of water can cause dehydration or other medical conditions. The licensee
must ensure that all dogs be offered clean potable water as often as necessary, but not less than twice daily for at
least one hour for the health and well-being of the animals.
Corrected at time of inspection
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
