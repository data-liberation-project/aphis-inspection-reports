2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
During a review of facility records, the licensee made a record of skunk births and deaths in 2020. However, there were
no dates associated with the births and no dates associated with three of the deaths.

Dealers must make, keep, and maintain records that fully disclose information regarding animals acquired, including
births, and animals disposed of, including deaths or euthanasias. Failure to do so can inhibit animal tracking and
maintaining an accurate inventory.

Correct by keeping and maintaining records which include dates of birth and dates of death of all covered species.

Facilities, general.
In Pen 15, which houses four skunks, the plywood that serves as a cover to the doorway of the shelter within the
enclosure has several nails and screws protruding through it so that there is 1.5-2 inches of nail/screw exposed toward
the opening of the shelter. When these nails were pointed out, the licensee immediately removed the cover from the


enclosure.

Additionally, the roof of the shelter in Pen 15 is in a state of disrepair. The protective covering of the roof is missing on
one side and the material used to previously cover the roof has ragged edges and a flap that is folded over. The
underlying wood has several gaps and cracks with peeling paint on the outside of it.

In Pen 1, which also houses four skunks, there are several areas in the plywood flooring that has been worn through so
that the underlying wire is exposed. The plywood surrounding these holes is jagged and worn thin in some areas.

Housing facilities must be structurally maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Protruding
nails/screws, jagged edges of loose roofing material, peeling paint, cracks in wood, and holes with jagged edges in the
flooring can all lead to injury of the animals housed within these enclosures. Correct by ensuring that structures within
enclosures, including roofing of shelters and flooring, are repaired and maintained. Correct by May 14, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
