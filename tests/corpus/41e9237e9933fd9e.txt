****A white LaMancha goat five to six weeks of age has a thick greenish yellow wet discharge around both eyes
crusty in the fur below. On initial observation, the surface of the eyes was impossible to visualize due to the amount
of discharge and movement of the head. There is hair loss around both eyes especially in the corner of the eyes
and the eyelids appear red and swollen. When attempting to look at the eyes the goat would pull back and not let
the area around the eyes be touched. The licensee and the inspector noticed the animal walking into the enclosure
fence and bumping into the legs of the licensee and inspector. According to the licensee she notice the goat's
condition on Saturday April 15 and has been rinsing the eyes with warm water once a day in the morning for five
days; this had not been done on the day of the inspection approximately at 1:00 pm. The licensee had not
consulted with a veterinarian regarding this animal(cid:25)s condition. Eye conditions can be painful and failure to seek
medical attention can lead to unnecessary pain and discomfort or further complications including blindness. This
animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and
an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information must be documented and made available
to the inspector upon request.
