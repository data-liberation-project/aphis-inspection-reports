FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Interior surfaces. There is bare wood on walls, shelves, work bench, window sills and frames, and approximately 20
percent of the floor area near the guinea pig enclosures. Interior surfaces of indoor guinea pig rooms must be

walls, shelves, work bench, window sills and frames, and areas of the floor are covered with an impervious surface
or sealed to maintain it in a substantially impervious condition.
