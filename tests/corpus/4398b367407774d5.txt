Watering.
The rabbits' water container had dirty ice on top of the water but the rabbits were observed to have access and drink
water through a hole in the ice. Iced over water is not considered potable and the dirt could contaminate the water they
drink. Ensure the rabbits have sufficient potable water daily by cleaning the ice off daily and ensuring their water is clean
and accessible.

Facilities, general.
The elk's enclosure has a loose panel in the middle and loose panel wire by the watering area. For safety, the facility
reports maintenance is postponed with the elk during the rut season. Loose panels and panel strands could injure the elk.
Maintain the elk enclosure free from loose panels and loose panel wires. Ensure that a safe method of correcting these
areas is employed and that in the future a safe method of maintaining the elk's enclosure is in place year-round (options
were discussed).
3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.


The watering areas for the cow and goat, fallow deer, and whitetail deer have areas of poor drainage under their watering
pans where artesian water overflows and creates pooling of water that they have to stand in to get a drink. Adequate
drainage of water is required to protect animal health. Ensure that these areas are maintained so that animals don't have
to walk/stand in water to get to the clean drinking water.
