ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several animals were noted to have thinning haircoats at the time of inspection and one litter of newborns had died.
These issues appeared confined to two enclosures but were not recorded or relayed to the attending veterinarian.
The animals need to be monitored daily and recorded to assure early identification of adverse trends which may
then be conveyed to the attending veterinarian. This assures the continued health and well-being of the animals.
Correct: this point forward.
