SANITATION.
*** In the barn housing sheep, goats, and pigs there are several cracks in the floor near the sheep stall closest to
the
pig stall on the left side of the barn. There is a deep crack in the concrete approximately 4 inches with crumbling
concrete surrounding it. Cracks in the floor allow the harborage of vermin and debris and creates areas of standing
water that attract pests, such as mosquitos. Standing water can seep under the fence into animal stalls. Buildings
and grounds kept in good repair ensure animal areas are cleaned and sanitizated properly. Well kept facilities also
help to
maintain an effective pest control program. The crumbling concrete and cracks must be repaired to ensure animals
are maintained in a clean environment. Correct by April 15, 2016
