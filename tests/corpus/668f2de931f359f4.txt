FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
No artificial cooling was supplied to the six rabbits housed outdoors during the inspection when atmospheric air
temperatures were 98 to 101 degrees fahrenheit and top row in-cage temperatures were recorded at 105 degrees.
Rabbits were stretched out on the bottom of the cages. Water bottles were present in the cages but bottle
temperature measured equivalent to surrounding air temperature.
Lack of additional cooling when temperatures are above 90 degrees F can cause discomfort and stress, heat
stress/stroke, illness and death.
Additional cooling must be provided when temperatures are above 90 degrees F.
Corrected at the time of the inspection with frozen water bottles placed in each cage and fans placed in the
enclosure.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several areas of fencing were damaged such that animals could become entangled in the fence or incur injury.
These areas included the fence line at the front (west) of the juvenile camels (2) and llama (2) / alpaca(1) pen, as
well as the bottom rail along the back (east) and front (west) of the adult camel (2) and guanaco (2) pen.
All enclosures or facilities for all the animals must be constructed of such material and of such strength as
appropriate for the animals involved. All facilities must be structurally sound, free from sharp, protruding points or
edges, and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to properly contain them. A
system of timely identification, maintenance, and repair of facilities must be in place to ensure the health and
well-being of all animals.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Excessive amounts of feces were present in the cavy (3 animals) enclosure and in the indoor litter boxes of the
muntjac (1) and the capybara (1). Buildup of fecal material can lead to unsanitary conditions resulting in odor, food
contamination, and illness and disease in the animals. Fecal material must be removed as often as necessary toprevent buildup and maintain healthy living conditions. To be corrected by August 15, 2019.
