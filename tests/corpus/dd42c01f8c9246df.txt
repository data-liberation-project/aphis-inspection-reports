2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The adult dark brown and white smooth hair guinea pig previously cited on the last inspection report still has a
uniformly cloudy left eye and is housed in its own enclosure. The licensee informed the APHIS officials that this
guinea pig was not examined by a licensed veterinarian; instead, she talked to the attending veterinarian over the
phone and received only verbal instructions. This animal is still not receiving any treatment and failure to have it
examined prevents accurate diagnosis of the condition or the development of an appropriate treatment plan. When
left untreated eye problems may become painful and may progress to impairment of vision. Correct by ensuring
that this animal is examined by a licensed veterinarian and that animals which become ill in the future are also
examined and treated appropriately.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
During this inspection the floor of the guinea pig enclosures had approximately a half inch layer of compacted
soiled/wet bedding that was beneath newer bedding. The licensee informed the APHIS officials that the guinea pig
enclosures were last cleaned two weeks ago, but that new bedding had been added on top of the soiled bedding.
Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards such bacterial, fungal, and viral
diseases. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta/soiled bedding
and must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring enclosures are cleaned and sanitized as
required.
Note: This was an incomplete inspection. While only partially through the inspection process, the APHIS officials
discussed noncompliant items identified above with the licensee. At that time the licensee stated her intention to
discontinue her license under the Animal Welfare Act. The licensee then voluntarily surrendered her license and
walked out of the animal building. APHIS Officials stopped the inspection process at that time and left the facility.
An accurate animal count had not yet been completed and not all animals had been inspected. Non-compliances
were discussed during the inspection with the licensee; Robert Markmann, ACI; and Mary Geib, VMO. This report
will be sent to the licensee by certified mail.NO REGUALTED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A USDA LICENSE.
