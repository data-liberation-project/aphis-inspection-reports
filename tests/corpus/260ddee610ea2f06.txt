The public may contact the animals during feeding. Employees or attendants are not present during these times of
public contact. One of the rabbits present at a previous inspection was seen by the attending veterinarian for aback issue that was causing lameness. The care takers are not aware of how the injury happened because there
are no attendants present at times of public contact. Unattended public contact may result in physical injury to the
animals by trauma or them eating unapproved items. The animals experience mental harm when they are subject
to ignorant and inappropriate human contact. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or
attendant must be present at all times during public contact.

Shelter from inclement weather. Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the
species concerned shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent
discomfort to such animals. Individual animals shall be acclimated before they are exposed to the extremes of the
individual climate.The shelter provided is not a sufficient shelter for the watusi. It does not protect the animal from wind and rain in the

high for other animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it
protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent
physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such
fences less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
A perimeter fence must be errected around any enclosure housing a wild or exotic animal to act as secondary
