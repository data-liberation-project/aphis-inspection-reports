2.126(a)(4) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
On April 26, 2022, at 7:06 PM the inspector arrived at the facility to conduct a routine facility inspection. The licensee
asked if photos would be taken on inspection. The licensee was informed that taking photos of all non-compliant items
during the facility inspection is part of the inspection process. The licensee stated that he would not allow photos to be
taken on the inspection. The inspector informed the licensee that not allowing photographs of his facility as needed would
be considered a refusal of inspection. The licensee again stated that he would only allow an inspection without a camera.
Refusal of inspection to include taking photos as necessary interferes with APHIS’s ability to assure animal welfare. Each
dealer, exhibitor, intermediate handler, or carrier, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to inspect and
photograph the facilities, property and animals, as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the provisions of the
Act, the regulations and the standards in this subchapter; and to document, by the taking of photographs and other
means, conditions and areas of noncompliance. To be corrected from this date forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
