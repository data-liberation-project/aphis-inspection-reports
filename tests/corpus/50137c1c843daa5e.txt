Sanitation.
There are transport crates, containers and other supplies stored on top of and directly beside the animal enclosures inside
the housing building. These items are accumulating hair, dust, and cobwebs which increases the possible disease
hazard posed by insect nesting and vermin. Storing the items in these locations has inhibited complete cleaning around
the enclosures evidenced by the accumulation of the hair, dust, and cobwebs on the enclosure fence wire and on the
wire/mesh tops of the enclosures. All items shall be removed and stored in an appropriate area that will allow adequate
cleaning of the facility to protect the animals from exposure to insects and vermin. Correct by October 13, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the President.
