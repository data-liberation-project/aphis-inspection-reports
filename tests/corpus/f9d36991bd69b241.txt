Three live roaches were seen on the wall of one room on the 3rd floor of the facility. The room had some areas of drywall
that was peeling due to excessive moisture in the room from a recent wash down. The level of moisture in the room after
cleaning may contribute to the presence of the pests. A pest control program must be effective in preventing the attraction
or harborage of pests. Effective measures must be implemented to minimize the harborage of pests. Correct by October
