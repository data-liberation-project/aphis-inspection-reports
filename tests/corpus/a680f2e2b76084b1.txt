2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee had documentation and records indicating that the attending veterinarian has made regularly
scheduled visits to the facility however the written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) could not be located during the
inspection. Without a written PVC, APHIS officials cannot completely verify that the care of the animals is overseen
by the attending veterinarian. A formal written PVC reflecting the care of the animals must be maintained and made
available for APHIS officials during inspections so that it can be verified that appropriate veterinary care is provided
and available for animals at the facility.
Correct by 11/24/14.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
