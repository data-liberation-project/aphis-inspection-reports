ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The medicine cabinet containing pharmaceuticals was not accessible for inspection by APHIS Officials. The owner
and senior trainer who have the only keys to the medicine cabinet were unavailable during the inspection. The staff
on hand did not have access to the medications in the cabinet. The inspectors were unable to inspect the
medications contained in the locked medicine cabinet. Animal care staff need to have access to the medicine
cabinet. All facilities, property and animals must be accessible by APHIS Officials to conduct inspections under the
Animal Welfare Act to ensure the facility is in compliance with the Act.
