REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
***On 7/9/15 Animal Care Veterinary Medical Officer (VMO) contacted and spoke with the facility owner via
telephone. The owner stated that she has at least 8 breeding female sugar gliders and that she sells the offspring.
The VMO informed the owner that the activity is regulated under the Animal Welfare Act and requires a valid USDA
license. According to Animal Care records, an application had been sent to the owner in September 2013. The
owner stated she had started to fill it out but did not complete it due to personal events.
Any person operating or intending to operate as a dealer, exhibitor, or operator of an auction sale, except persons
who are exempted from the licensing requirements under section 2.1 (a)(3), must have a valid license.
Acquire a valid USDA license if you wish to continue to breed and sell animals to the public.
Exit briefing conducted via telephone with the owner.
Conducting regulated activities without a valid USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
