A female Dogue De Bordeaux, micro chip 0A02017453, was observed with significant drainage from both eyes.
The accumulated discharge was a whitish-green color with a slight reddening of the lid area on the upper lids. This
dog did not exhibit significant squinting or appear to be impaired by this condition but the owner has not consulted
with a licensed veterinarian as to the cause of this drainage. No veterinary care steps has been taken at this time.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment program. To be
corrected by: 05/28/14
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
