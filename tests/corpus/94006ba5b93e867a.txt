2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
At the time of inspection, there was a lack of a barrier between the facility’s coati enclosure and the general public.
Several attendees were observed being able to pet and place both hands and fingers into the coati’s primary enclosure.
With public access, the facility’s animal can cause harm or injury to the general public, and it raises a safety risk to the
animal within the enclosure. A public barrier system must be maintained around the entire enclosure to ensure that the
public does not have direct access to the coati.

Handling of animals.
At the time of inspection, there were no employees present while two attendees interacted with the facility’s wallaby. The
general public has full access to the wallaby enclosure and are allowed to handle the facility’s animal and offer feed that is
provided by the facility for purchase. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily identified employee must be present at all
times during periods of public contact to ensure the safety of both the animal and the general public.
