INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The USDA inspector reviewed records dated within the month of February 2014 from a recently terminated animal
use protocol using hamsters. This protocol listed specific endpoints that if an animal were to reach, it was to be
humanely euthanized, one of which was a weight loss greater than 30%. There were 2 cases in which the
protocol's endpoints were not followed. One of the animals, as of day 5 had lost greater than 30% of starting
weight, was euthanized on day 7 due to abnormal appearance and posture. The records on the other animal show
that weight loss was greater than 30% on day 5 and day 6 indicated further weight loss without continued
documentation on that animal in the records being reviewed. The IACUC must ensure that activities involving
animals will avoid or minimize distress, discomfort and pain.
This is a terminated study if re-activated the IACUC must correct from that point forward.
