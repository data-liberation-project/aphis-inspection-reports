2.40(b)(1) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The refrigerator that is used to store medical products has not been maintained in a state of cleanliness appropriate for
these items. The interior surfaces of the refrigerator that are in contact with these products have an accumulation of a
brown-to-black material. The products stored include bottles of dewormer and a vial containing a penicillin-based
antibiotic for injection.

Direct contamination of these products during storage in a refrigerator that isn't kept clean or removal from their container
may occur. The use of contaminated products may cause illness in animals, such as infection at the site of injection.

Equipment that is used to store or administer medical products must be maintained to be free of contamination, such as
by regular cleaning or sanitization.

This noncompliance was corrected at the time of inspection.
3.6(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.


There were 5 out of 21 outdoor primary enclosures that housed adult coonhounds. The heads of the dogs were observed
within 2 inches of the roof when standing in a normal standing position.

The interior height of a primary enclosure must be at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the
enclosure when it is in a normal standing position.

The enclosures for the coonhounds need to be at least 6 inches above their heads when at a normal standing position.
