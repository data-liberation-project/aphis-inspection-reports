2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Whereas the minimum space and exercise requirements for dogs, under the Animal Welfare Act regulations, were
being met for all dogs observed, IACUC approved protocols for dogs reference a guideline document titled (cid:28)"Animal
Social Housing and Environmental Enrichment"(cid:29). The protocols ask the principle investigator whether there will be
any deviation from this guideline, and the principle investigator must check (cid:28)"Yes"(cid:29) or "(cid:28)No"(cid:29). On all but one of the
protocols which pertain to dogs currently on site, the box is checked (cid:28)"No"(cid:29), despite the fact that the following
elements of this guideline were not being adhered to:
1.) Single housing for medical and/or welfare reasons should be documented in the animal records. A review of
animal medical records showed that some dogs were housed singly without any medical or welfare reason having
been documented in the records. Specifically, dogs 727, 728, and 729 were singly housed without a reason
documented in their records.
2.) Each dog should have access to at least one toy in their home enclosure. Whereas staff claimed that toys are
normally present except during cleaning, the enclosures in rooms 216 and 215 did not contain toys at the time of
inspection.
3.) Dogs housed singly must be within sight of other dogs. The design of the runs does not allow the dogs to see
other dogs when housed individually.
Any significant changes to the IACUC-approved protocol must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC. The
current housing practices for the dogs differ significantly from what was approved by the IACUC. The housing and
enrichment practices should be reviewed, any changes should be approved, and the protocol and actual practices
should be brought into alignment in order to safeguard the welfare of the animals under study.
To be corrected by 3/15/15.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
