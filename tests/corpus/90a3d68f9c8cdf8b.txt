stored in the sealable container. Through out the room were flying insects which could contaminate the open food.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the eastern side of the large kennel building there was one raised wire enclosure which contained one adult and
six puppies. The puppies were observed with their feet falling through the wire flooring. The dealer has placed a
small piece of carpet on the wire flooring. The carpet does not cover the entire area available to the puppies thus
allowing their feet to fall through when they move about. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained
so that they have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury, and that, if
of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any openings in the floor.

The kennel facility currently consists of two indoor housing buildings. The large building consists of two animal
housing rooms and a separate food storage room. In all rooms of the building the ceiling and door surfaces needs
to be cleaned to remove an accumulation of dirt, hair, webs, flying insect nest and dark matter. In the trailer type
building there is a work space and sink area that needs to be cleaned to remove the used syringes and dirt. In this
area the dealer is storing medications, chemical spray cleaners and cans of insect spray killer. Premises where
housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good repair to
protect the animals from injury, to facilitate husbandry practices and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas
for rodents and other pests and vermin. The dealer must maintain cleaning of the premises and pest control to
protect the health and well-being of the animals.
