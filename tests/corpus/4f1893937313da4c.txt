***A bottle of pyrantel pamoate was located on the counter within the kennel building. This bottle had an expiration
date of 12/15 and was ready for use. Doseage instructions for the kennel were located on the bottle. Medication
that is outdated must not be considered an appropriate veterinary care measure as the efficacy of this medication
cannot be assured after posted expiration dates. Steps must be taken to ensure that all medications are maintained
within dated usage ranges. To be corrected by: 09/24/16

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The area immediately on the west side of the kennel building and surrounding the outdoor enclosures has been
overgrown with vegetative growth on the ground, over the fences, and onto the building. This overgrowth of weeds
must be contained to be able to fully visualize the structures covered and reduce cleaning and pest control issues.
Areas in and around the kennel must be routinely controlled for unnecessary weed growth. To be corrected
by:09/24/16
3.4(b)(2)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***Two Australian shepherds are housed in an outdoor set of concrete floor enclosures. A solid shade panel was
located over the top of one of the enclosures but did not provide additional shade for the adjacent enclosure. This
adjacent enclosure currently does not have any shade structure in place except for the barrel structure used for
shelter. All outdoor enclosures must be provided with adequate shade structures to effectively provide shade to the
enclosure during the daylight hours. Shade must be provided for this enclosure. To be corrected by: 09/20/16
3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***Two exterior portions of the kennel enclosures have wire mesh flooring surfaces in need of repair. One
enclosure has the cattle stock panel support dropping down and not provided support to the flooring. The flooringhas torn along at least two sides and is sagging significantly, creating openings along the sides on the floor.
Another enclosure has torn areas of the flooring creating openings that pose foot entrapment or escape risks to the
dogs contained. All enclosures must be routinely maintained to ensure structural stability and integrity to ensure the
containment functions as designed. To be corrected by: 09/24/16
