Veterinary care for dogs.
The written program of veterinary care was missing the frequency of the hands on exam visit for adult dogs and was
missing information regarding the sampling for parasites.
The physical examination is necessary in order to ensure that the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care. Not doing
parasite sampling/tests can lead to health problems with the dogs. The facility must add to the Program of Veterinary
Care how often each animal is to be examined by the attending veterinarian not to be less than every 12 months, and
work with their attending veterinarian to develop and document a plan for parasite sampling/testing.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class A license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by May 16, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
