3.80(a)(2)(iii) Critical

Primary enclosures.
On 3/14/2021, an investigator locked a divider that separates macaques housed in adjacent enclosures. The bolt that
secures the divider did not fully engage, which allowed the animals to open the divider and resulted in two females being
housed together. On the morning of 3/15/2021, both females were observed to have injuries consistent with fight wounds.
Animal #2-16 sustained minor injuries to extremities. Animal #128-07 sustained bruising and scratching, as well as
injuries to both feet that resulted in non-weight bearing lameness and required daily veterinary care. Per this section of
the regulations, primary enclosures must be maintained so that they contain the non-human primates securely and
prevents accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.

In response to this incident, the research facility retrained research staff on securing enclosures. To remain corrected
from this date (September 7th, 2021) forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
