ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
On 19 August 2014 a rabbit which had been under veterinary treatment for suspected coccidiosis was found by
facility personnel recumbent, paddling, and non-responsive. The facility manager chose to euthanize the rabbit and
used a method that is not approved by the AVMA guidelines on Euthanasia. At the time this decision was made,
the affected animal was under treatment for suspected coccidiosis. The facility manager, who is also the Primary
Investigator for Protocol AG-12-14, did not consult the university attending veterinarian or any licensed veterinarian
regarding the acutely deteriorarted condition of this animal. Protocol AG 12-14 does not list a standard method of
euthanasia, since the animals on this study are not expected to require euthanasia except for emergency
conditions. The protocol states on page 8, section 3.15.2 that "Attending veterinarian is notified if animals are
distressed." Also on page 1 (Investigator Assurance Statement) the Primary Investigator affirms that "the OSU
Attending Veterinarian is authorized to humanely euthanize animals that are found to be experiencing severe pain
and/or distress". There is nothing in protocol AG 12-14 that allows the Private Investigator to independently
diagnose an animal's condition. There is no provision in the protocol that allows the Primary Investigator or any
non-veterinary staff member to unilaterally determine that euthanasia is an appropriate choice for any regulated
animal, and there is no allowance in the protocol for the use of non-AVMA approved methods of euthanasia. The
primary investigator violated the relevant protocol's guidelines for appropriate veterinary care. Any treatment of a
sick/injured animal, including euthanasia, must be carried out after consultation with the attending veterinarian.
Euthanasia should be conducted in an appropriate manner by the veterinary staff or by adequately trained
personnel under veterinary supervision.
To be corrected from this point forward.
3.58(b)
CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
On 15 August 2014 two rabbits were placed under treatment for suspected coccidiosis. Initially these two rabbits
were housed in a separate area away from the main rabbit holding room. However, while still under treatment these
rabbits were moved into the main rabbit holding room and housed with the group. Although these rabbits were in
individual enclosures, their proximity to the healthy animals does increase the risk of contamination or infection tothe healthy animals. Rabbits that are undergoing treatment for communicable disease should not be housed with or
near healthy animals.
Correct from this point forward.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representatives.
