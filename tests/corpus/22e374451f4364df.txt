2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During the inspection the inspectors noticed two expired bottles of Meloxicam 7.5 mg tablets (RX number: 2130363) that
are currently being administered daily to the eldest of the two wolves for arthritis. The medication expired on 10/8/19.
Expired medications are less effective for their intended use and can cause harm and/or injury to the animal due to the
breakdown of the ingredients in the medication. The facility must establish and maintain an adequate program of
veterinary care which uses appropriate methods to prevent, control and treat diseases and injuries.

3.53(c)(1)

Primary enclosures.
Two rabbits, weighing approximately 12-13 pounds, are in stackable wire cage enclosures for small animals, where one
rabbit is housed on top of the other. Both rabbits do not have enough room to make normal postural movements and
behaviors due to their size in relation to the size of their enclosures. The rabbit in the lower enclosure is also not readily
able to get away from the bedding and feces being dropped on it from the top enclosure. Lack of adequate space can
affect the rabbits’ well-being by causing harm and/or injury to the animals. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a
way that provides sufficient space for the animals to make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of

movement.
