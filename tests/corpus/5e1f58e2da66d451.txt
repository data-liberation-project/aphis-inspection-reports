2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult, red, long-haired, female Dachshund (Microchip # 0A02132206, DOB 2008) has a severe build-up of
dental tartar encasing all of the remaining upper and lower cheek teeth and over half of the surface of each canine
and each front tooth. The majority of the surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized due to the excessive
build-up of tartar. There is hair and/or debris and a yellow/tan/milky substance running along the top of all of the
upper left cheek teeth near the gumline. Some of the cheek teeth on the left side of the mouth are severely loose
and one tooth fell out when the licensee moved it. The gums are severely red and swollen and in some areas they
are pulled back from the teeth. Dental conditions such as these can be painful and can lead to further health
complications. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the
diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon
request.
One adult, white, female Anatolian/Great Pyrenees mix (Microchip # 0A01786177) has excessively long toe-nails on
all of her toes and excessively long (double) dewclaws. On most of the toes the nails were so long that they were
curling out and altering the position of the toes as she was standing/walking. One of the dewclaws on the back right
foot was curling back into the pad and the pad was moderately red and swollen. Long nails can be painful for the
animal. The licensee must ensure that all toenails are trimmed in order to prevent, control and treat injuries
associated with long toenails.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were at least six enclosures housing 9 adult dogs and 8 puppies that had sharp points or jagged edges. In at
least five enclosures there were broken wires of the floors and or walls that were sticking inwards, and at least one
enclosure in the "Big Dog Runs" that had a feeder that had a jagged piece of metal hanging from the bottom side. Sharp points can cause injuries to the dogs. The licensee must maintain the primary enclosures so that they have
no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs.

3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Throughout the facility there were chewed and worn surfaces in multiple enclosures housing 13 dogs and 32
puppies. Plastic thresholds around egress doors, bottom edges of exterior walls made of wood and plastic, rims of
food and water bowls, and wooden supports in indoor portions of the sheltered enclosures were chewed or worn
and had varying levels of dirt, debris, and hair stuck in the uneven surfaces.
Chewed and worn surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which can lead to disease hazards. All surface
of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized
must be replaced when worn or soiled. The damaged and worn wood and plastic must be replaced or altered in a
manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces remain in good
repair at all times.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Within one of the outdoor runs of the "dalmatian building" and one outdoor run of the "tool shed" the licensee has
laid down a layer of wood chips over pea gravel in an attempt to keep the floor dry. In the enclosure in the
"dalmation building", nearly the entire layer of wood chips is wet and mixed with feces. Over half of the outdoor
portion of this enclosure is covered with the soiled wood chips. In the enclosure in the "tool shed", there is a thin
layer of wood chips mixed in with pea gravel and feces throughout approximately 2/3 of the enclosure. There are
four dogs total in these enclosures.
Failure to keep enclosures clean and dry can lead to disease hazards for the animals. All floors made of dirt,
absorbent bedding, gravel or similar material must be raked or spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all
animals remain clean and dry and so they can avoid contact with excreta.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.The areas below the outdoor portion of the raised sheltered enclosures of the "Tool Shed", housing 2 adult dogs
and about 18 puppies, had an accumulation of water from the recent rains mixed with the feces that created
puddles. The puddles and feces were attracting an excessive number of flies.
The accumulation of feces and food waste can lead to disease hazards, pests, insects and odors. The licensee
must clean the grounds below raised enclosures with mesh or slatted floors as often as necessary to prevent
accumulation of feces and food waste, and to reduce the disease hazards, pests, insects, and odors.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: JUNE 9, 2016
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Throughout the facility there was brown grimy residue on a large number of feeders, egress doors, thresholds,
interior, and exterior walls, in multiple enclosures housing 71 adult dogs. There was algae growing in one water
bowl in an enclosure housing one adult. An accumulation of hair and debris was present on wire dividers/walls
throughout the facility and the wooden support structures of the raised enclosures in the "Big Barn".
The build-up of dirt, feces, and debris can harbor diseases. The licensee must spot-clean all used primary
enclosures, and food and water bowls daily and sanitize at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Throughout the "Hunte" Building, housing 40 dogs, there was a large amount of mouse feces in the wash-downs on
both sides of the building. There was, also, small fly-like bugs on the window. Under the outdoor portion of the
raised sheltered enclosures in the "Tool Shed", housing 2 adult dogs and about 18 puppies, was a large number of
flies.
The presence of pests can cause food contamination and lead to health hazards for the dogs. The licensee must
ensure that a safe and effective program for the control of pests, including flies and mice, is established and
maintained.
