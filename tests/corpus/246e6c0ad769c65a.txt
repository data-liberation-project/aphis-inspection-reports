3.52(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Artificial cooling was not being provided to five rabbits housed outdoors at 14:45 hours on the day of the inspection.
The atmospheric temperature at that time was 93.4 F. Two of the rabbits were observed to be panting.
Overheating may cause discomfort and adversely affect animal health. The facility should ensure that artificial
cooling is provided to rabbits when the atmospheric temperature exceeds 90 F.
This non-compliant item was corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sharp objects were present in an enclosure housing hoof stock. The ends of a section of wire fencing were
protruding into the enclosure. Two nails were protruding from a warped board on the side of a shelter in the same
enclosure.
Sharp objects may cause injuries to the animals. Animal enclosures should be constructed and maintained in a
manner that will protect the animals from injury.

An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 17, 2016.
