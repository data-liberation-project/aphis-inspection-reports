2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection the licensee does not have a written Program of Veterinary Care with a veterinarian for the
care of the animals. When the Program of Veterinary Care is not filled out, information on how the licensee provides
for the health and wellbeing of the animals on the premise is not recorded. The licensee shall employ an attending
veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant
arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled
visits to the facility where the animals are located. Consult with the attending veterinarian to complete a written
program of veterinary care to include all animals held by the facility and to accurately reflect the veterinary care
needed for the animals. The
Program of Veterinary Care must be completely filled out and must be made available at the inspector's request at
the time of facility inspection.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Current animal records are not available for review at the time of inspection. While few older records are available,
there are no current records for the animals on hand. Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure each
animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace the animals. A system should be in
place to ensure that complete acquisition and disposition records, including animals born at the facility, are
maintained and made available for examination by APHIS officials.
