The current program of veterinary care provides clear instruction that any non-pregnant or nursing dog identified
with a grade 3 or 4 dental disease shall have its teeth examined and cleaned by a licensed veterinarian. On 11 July
2015 the licensee indicated that he had cleaned all the animals(cid:25) teeth himself and that as of the start of the
inspection had not had a licensed veterinarian clean the identified dogs.
The current program of veterinary care provided by the facility indicates that the dogs will have access to an outside
pen three days a week for a half an hour. At the time of the inspection the facility no longer had an outside pen. The
licensee currently houses the animals to ensure that all individually housed dogs are provided at least two times
their required floor space or that compatibly housed groups are provided at least 100 percent of the required space
for each dog. The licensees must follow an appropriate plan set forth by the attending veterinarian within the
program of veterinary care to provide the dogs with an opportunity for exercise.
The Licensee shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care.
Licensee must contact the veterinarian to set up and determine an appropriate timeframe for an examination.
Documentation of the examination, diagnosis and treatment must be maintained and made available for inspection.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).***The following animals noted to have signs of severe dental disease during the inspection (USDA tags 281, 254,
169, 290, 275, 179, 330, 302, 255, 180,273,313,272, 314, 230, 242, 299, 310,315,316,280, 282, 278, 262, 234).
The signs noted indicating the severe dental disease were a combination several of the following 1) a heavy buildup
of tan material adhered to his canine teeth, pre-molars and molars 2) gums reddened and have receded back from
the tooth roots 3) a grey to green substance has accumulated along the gum line 4) a white to yellow discharge
from the gum line 5) loose and/or missing teeth.
*** The following animals noted to have signs of moderate dental disease during the inspection (USDA tags 203,
263, 289, 269, 286, 197, 312, 207). The signs noted indicating the moderate dental disease were the presence of
one or combination several of the following 1) moderate buildup of tan material adhered to the canine teeth,
pre-molars and molars 2) gums slightly reddened and inflamed.
***The following animals are noted to be confirmed bred or are currently nursing a litter of puppies (USDA tags 314,
230, 234,299,263). Per the program of veterinary care pregnant or nursing animals will be able to be seen for dental
cleaning one week after the weaning of puppies. In the time before weaning these animals should be offered
palliative care such as antibiotics and/or soft foods to relieve any discomfort caused by dental disease and to
ensure proper nutrition.
These animals were identified by the veterinarian on 8 May2015 as having grade 3 or 4 dental disease, as defined
by the program of veterinary care. The licensee did not follow the instruction provided in the program of veterinary
care indicating that the animal should have received care by a licensed veterinarian. The licensee indicated that he
cleaned each of these animals on 11 July 2015. The program of veterinary care as well as instructions from the
attending veterinarian should be followed to ensure adequate care for the animals. Untreated dental disease may
lead to problems consuming food as well as several conditions, such as cardiac disease, that affect the health and
well-being of the animal.
Appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries must be utilized. These dogs
must be examined by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of assessment, treatment, and plan for each dog shall
be maintained for examination by APHIS officials.
Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian per the program of veterinary care, by close of
business on 14 November 2015.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The floors, walls and doors on the outside portion of the primary enclosures were moderately worn. The primaryenclosures in this area are constructed of primarily of coated wire. The wire coating has been worn or chewed off
over portions of the floors, walls and doors. In the majority of these areas the exposed wire is rusted. These areas
of the kennel are no longer in good repair. The areas where the coating is damaged provide crevices that organic
material can become entrapped preventing adequate cleaning and sanitization. Additionally, the rust which has
formed over the exposed wires also prevents them from being readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by repairing or
replacing these damaged areas. All surfaces in contact with the dogs must be readily cleaned and sanitized in
accordance with Sec. 3.11 (b) of this subpart, or be replaceable when worn or soiled.
Correct by: 13 December 2015.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
During the inspection it was noted that the wash-down areas had a heavy buildup of tan matter. There was a
moderate amount of feces and urine present within the wash down area. This buildup is an indicator of dried urine
and feces that has built up over time. Improper cleaning and sanitization of the wash down contributes to the odor
and disease hazards within the facility. This facility must establish and maintain a routine for proper cleaning and
sanitization for the facility to include all wash downs.
Correct by 27 November 2015.
