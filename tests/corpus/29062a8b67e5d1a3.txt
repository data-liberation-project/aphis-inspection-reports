ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The program of veterinary care was last updated by the facility and the attending veterinarian in 2012.The
current
program of veterinary care provided during the inspection includes gunshot and barbiturate overdose as the primary
forms of euthanasia. The current guidelines provided by the American Veterinary Medical Association regarding
humane euthanasia indicates that gunshot is only to be used in emergency situation. Gunshot should not be used
for
routine euthanasia of animals in animal controlled situations. The euthanasia conducted on August 5, 2015 of the
adult male tiger named (cid:28)Scruffy(cid:29) followed the 2012 program of veterinary care in that the animal was euthanized by
gunshot.The program of veterinary care needs to be updated to ensure that the animals are receiving adequate
care. The updated program of veterinary care needs to provide species specific information regarding all drug
names, dosages and routes of administration used by the facility.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***On August 5, 2015 the attending veterinarian was called to provide care for an adult male tiger named (cid:28)Scruffy.(cid:29)
This animal was recognized by facility representatives to be declining rapidly in health. The veterinarian visually
inspected the animal and indicated that the likely diagnosis was renal failure. After the visual inspection, the
attending veterinarian decided that the animal was to be euthanized. At the time of the visit, the veterinarian did not
have the capability to properly sedate, adequately diagnose or euthanize the animal. Per the veterinarian(cid:25)s
instructions, the animal was euthanized by a facility representative via gunshot deemed of adequate caliber. The
euthanasia was conducted and the animal expired on the first shot. A necropsy was not performed by the facility or
the veterinarian to determine the cause of the illness. Improper euthanasia can cause undue stress and suffering for
the animal. The attending veterinarian did not conduct any diagnostics related to the animals condition. These
diagnostics may have provided a medically manageable diagnosis for this animal. The ability conduct appropriate
diagnostics is vital for adequate veterinary care for the animals.The attending veterinarian needs to give adequate guidance to personnel involved in the care and use of animals
regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization, and euthanasia of animals in the facility.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of the inspection the two young bear cubs approximately 5 months old were observed in an abnormal
behavior of paw sucking and ear sucking. One cub was on the ground sucking his paw while vocalizing and the
other
cub was laying over the one cub and sucking on his siblings right ear. This behavior went on for an extended period
of time. It was observed at the beginning of the inspection and several hours later at the end of the inspection, the
cubs were observed sucking again. The one cubs ear was soaked and there was indication of hair loss on the ear.
The facility stated that all of their hand reared cubs do this behavior and they were not concerned with it. This is an
abnormal behavior pattern that can be attributed to stress and how the cubs cope with stress. Additionally the
constant sucking of the paw and ear can cause physical hot spots or potential ear infection. The facility did not
recognize that this was an abnormal behavior pattern and therefore did not convey this information to the vet in a
timely manner. The attending vet needs to assess the cubs behavior and assist the facility with a plan to encourage
normal behavior patterns for their health and well-being.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On August 5, 2015 an adult male tiger named "Scruffy" was euthanized via gunshot in the tiger holding area. At the
time of the euthanasia the male juvenile lion was present in lion holding directly adjacent to the tiger. At the time of
the euthanasia three shots were made with a high caliber rifle in an enclosed area. According to the facility
representative that conducted the euthanasia, the discharge of the firearm caused an employees ears to ring and
caused him discomfort. The juvenile lion was unable to escape the sound of the firearm in the building. The
discharge of the firearm may have caused trauma to the ear drums, and unnecessary discomfort for the juvenile
lion. Additionally studies have shown that animals exposed to another animal being euthanized can be stressful.
Because of the current holding situation and the fact that the lion cannot be shifted out onto exhibit, another method
of euthanizing the tiger should have been taken into consideration. Handling of all animals shall be done as
expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress or unnecessary
discomfort.Correct from this day forward.
3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The metal panels in the holding area for the baboons are rusted along the base and pitted and in disrepair in
some areas. This section of the holding wall can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. This section of wall
needs to be replaced to facilitate cleaning and sanitizing of the area.
*** Much of the wood perching and wood base in the non- human primate enclosures are no longer sealed and
impervious to moisture. Surfaces and furniture-type fixtures must be constructed in a manner and made of materials
that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. These enclosures
need to be addressed to facilitate cleaning of the enclosures for the health of the animals.
*** Some of the nails in the wood are exposed underneath the shelf which is a potential hazard to the animals.
These resting areas and platforms need to be maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** There were rodent droppings inside the baboon holding enclosure. The facility is using poison but there is a
concern a rodent could die inside the holding area and the non human primates could be exposed to the poison and
dead rodent. Additionally there is a lot of miscellaneous items and weed growth on the back side of the baboon
holding which can contribute to breeding and living areas for pests. The management of pest control needs to be
re-addressed to control rodent populations in a method that is also safe for the primates.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The Muntjac enclosure still has large pipes coming up out of the ground right in front of the shelter area which
can be a hazard for the small deer and cause potential injury to their legs. These pipes need to be buried under the
ground for their safety and to keep the enclosure in good repair.
Correct by ensuring that this enclosure and all other enclosures are constructed of appropriate materials for the
species, structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect all animals from injury and adequately contain
them.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The freezer storing frozen meat products for the carnivores at the facility still needs to be addressed. The seal
along the freezer door is missing in some areas and the door is not sealing properly. Due to this issue, there is a
build-up of ice inside the freezer along all the boxes of food. This needs to be addressed to adequately protect the
food supplies against deterioration and for the health of the animals.
3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The two bear young bear cubs that were observed in an abnormal behavior of paw sucking and ear sucking for an
extended period of time were locked out on their exhibit and did not have access to a back den area. The cubs are
currently in a concrete pad enclosure with a small pool and toddler type plastic structure. Normal social adjustments
for these cubs would to be able to bed down in a den area with each other that has some soft areas (hay or straw)
and get out of the view of the public. Once the den area was opened, the bears stopped the abnormal sucking
behavior and explored the den area for a while. This enclosure needs to be addressed and the cubs given access to
the den area so they may engage in normal social adjustments for the species. The enclosure for the adult black bears has not been addressed and the female bear still has a significant winter
coat that she is not able to shed out properly. In addition no pad, hay or bedding has been added to the enclosure
or den area to allow her to get off the concrete. This enclosure needs to be addressed and maintained to provide
the opportunity for the bears to engage in species appropriate behavior for their health and well being.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
*** The chicken being fed to the big cats is still being given out frozen. Feeding out frozen meat items is not
palatable for the animals. The facility manager states frozen food is placed in the enclosures around 3pm but is not
consumed for several hours. So the meat is left to thaw in variable temperatures on the ground of the enclosures.
APHIS considers frozen food wholesome when it is thawed in an appropriate manner (e.g. under refrigeration) to
prevent contamination. Currently the facility has no designated area to thaw food items appropriately to reduce
contamination. This needs to be addressed so that food items are fed out in a manner that ensures them to be
palatable and free from contamination.
*** Due to the variety of species in the park, overall diets and feeding practices need to be discussed with the
attending veterinarian to assure the animals are being fed nutritionally complete diets for their age, weight and body
condition.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
*** The Zebra enclosure needs to be cleaned. The facility is cleaning out the shelter area every few days, however
the waste is not removed from the enclosure just dumped in the back along the fence line. It is then removed from
there every few months. This is not adequate and does not reduce disease hazards and odors.
*** The bear enclosure is hosed but there is a build up of algae and grime along the concrete floors and walls
leading down into the drain area. In additional the den area still has not been cleaned out since spring. This
enclosure needs to be cleaned for the health of the animals and to reduce disease hazards.An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee and her animal care staff with ACI- Andrea D'Ambrosio and VMO
Dr. Michael Neafsey at the time of the inspection.
