Outdoor housing facilities.
There were three large breed dogs that were taller than the largest shelter unit provided in each of their outdoor
enclosures. The tops of the dogs’ heads could be visualized over the top of the igloo-style or barn-style shelter structures
while they were standing next to them. Shelter structures that are not large enough for the dogs to make normal postural
movements could decrease the dog’s comfort and/or willingness to utilize or access the shelter. The licensee must ensure
that all shelter units are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal
manner, and to turn about freely. To be corrected by: February 14, 2022

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
