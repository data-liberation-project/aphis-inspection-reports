3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A large pasture containing Pere David deer, eland, camels, and cattle is enclosed by a newly constructed eight foot
fence. There is no perimeter fence beyond the primary enclosure in the far outer sections of the pasture. Outdoor
housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the
facility. Unless a variance is approved in writing by the Administrator, potentially dangerous animals require a
perimeter fence at least eight feet high and other animals require a perimeter fence at least six feet high. It must be
a at least three feet from the primary enclosure and sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to
prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals/people outside.
