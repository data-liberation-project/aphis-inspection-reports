3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Pest Control.
**There was an excessive number of fruit flies noted on the wall directly above the primary enclosure containing 2
armadillos as well as on the bedding material and on other surfaces inside the armadillos' primary enclosure.
Per this Section of the Regulations, a safe and effective method to control insects and other pests should be
established and maintained. The presence of excessive numbers of fruit flies above and inside a primary animal
enclosure can cause distress to the animals as well as can contaminate and affect the palatability of the fresh fruits
and vegetables fed to the animals.
The licensee needs to implement and follow an effective pest control method to minimize the number of fruit flies
present inside and around the armadillos' enclosure for the health and well-being of the animals.
Correct by 12/6/17.
