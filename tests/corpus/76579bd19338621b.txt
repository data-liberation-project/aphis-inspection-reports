2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* The licensee acquired five dogs since the last inspection but did not obtain complete information concerning the
persons from whom each of those dogs was purchased or acquired. For two dogs, only the sellers' names were
documented. For another dog, the name and city of the seller was obtained but not the full address. The other two
had names and addresses but no USDA or State license numbers recorded.
**Complete and accurrate records must be made and maintained for each dog acquired so that APHIS officials can
track the exchanges/sales of animals more efficiently and effectively.
*** The licensee must make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the following information
concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, or held:
i. The name and address of the person from whom a dog was acquired.
ii. The USDA license or registration number of the person if he or she is licensed or registered under the Act
iii. The vehicle license number and State, AND the driver's license number (or photographic identifiaction card for
non-drivers issued by a State) and the State of the person, if he or she is not licensed or registered under the Act.
****TO BE CORRECTED: For all dogs acquired from this date forward.
The inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
