ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:15 AM on
27-Nov-18.
Tried to contact the licensee via cell phone. The licensee did not answer and the voice mailbox for the cell phone is
full. Texted the licensee that Dr. Hammel and I were at his facility to conduct an inspection and asked if he was
available. The licensee replied that he wouldn't be around until next week. I asked the licensee if either his son or
the woman that takes care of his animals in Indiana could host the inspections and the licensees response was No.
