2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care states that the attending veterinarian will visit the facility on an annual basis.
The last visit occurred in March 2013. Regular visits, at least annually, are required to ensure provisions for
adequate veterinary care including any recommended changes for the facility which might be made by the
veterinarian.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
"Amanda" a female dog in pen #5 has a buildup of brown material covering the cheek teeth and the normal tooth
structure cannot be identified under this material. The gums on the left upper side were swollen and pulling away
from the teeth. This dog was noted to be scratching constantly and numerous fleas were seen crawling in the
inguinal and tail area.
"Shai" a female Schnauzer in pen #12 has a buildup of brown material covering the cheek teeth and the normal
tooth structure cannot be identified under this material. Several fleas were noted crawling in the inguinal area and
the hair was slightly matted in this area.
A bottle of pyrantel pamoate that the licensee stated was recently used for the dogs is labeled with an expiration
date of October 2013. The use of expired medications, including dewormers, does not meet the current veterinary
medical standard of care. Expired drugs may also lose effectiveness and potency.
The program of veterinary care states that at least 2 dogs will have dentals performed every month. No dentals
have been done since November 2013. The above dogs have signs of dental disease which can be painful if the
teeth become infected. These dogs should be examined by a veterinarian and a program of veterinary care must bemaintained which includes adequate methods to diagnose and treat dental disease. The current facility program for
the control and treatment of fleas which states that the dogs and premises will be sprayed every 2 weeks appears to
be ineffective. Please consult with your veterinarian and review the efficacy of the current flea control program.
Fleas can be a source of discomfort and disease.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The whelping room/nursery was littered with unused and discarded items including 2 large empty bags of dog food,
cleaning supplies, empty bottles on the floor and discarded carpet pieces with dried feces. The shelves in the room
were cluttered with empty vaccine vials, bottles, a trash bag, books and empty baby bottles. Unused items should
be neatly stored and/or discarded. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter to
facilitate cleaning and sanitizing and reduce disease transmission potential.
3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Pen #1 housing 3 dogs, pen #4 housing 3 dogs and pen #7 housing 2 dogs had shelter structures with damaged
and/or missing rubber flaps used for wind and rain protection. These shelters cannot provide adequate protection to
prevent adverse effects form the weather. A method of protection from the wind and rain must be provided at the
entrance to the shelters.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The whelping/nursery room had an overwhelming smell of ammonia which caused irritation to the inspector's eyes
and nose. The window and door to this room had been closed and the fan was not on. There were no alternate
methods of air exchange/ventilation in this room. Four adult dogs and 19 puppies were housed in primary
enclosures in this room with pans under the grill-like floor. Newspaper lining the pans was soaked in urine. Plastic
coated liners on the floor under the enclosures were dirty with brown debris and were liquid stained. Discarded
pieces of carpet with dried feces were on the floor next to the enclosures.
Primary enclosures and animal areas must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation
of body wastes to reduce disease hazards and excessive odors. Heavy ammonia odors can cause irritation of the
animal's eyes and noses accelerating the risk of illness and disease transmission.
