2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- A female brown and tan Yorkshire terrier (Microchip # 100 535 812) had a heavy accumulation of brown, grey, and
black debris on numerous teeth. No teeth appeared loose and the gums did not appear to be inflamed or infected.
Buildup of dental tartar and debris may eventually lead to dental disease, including inflammation and infection of the
gums and loosening or even loss of teeth. Dental disease is a source of pain to the affected animal, and may
impact the willingness of that animal to eat without discomfort. This dog must be seen by a licensed veterinarian,
and treated appropriately.
