HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Rust
Throughout the sheltered facilities there are several access door frames that have become rusted. Inside of a
sheltered facility, (cid:28)Building C(cid:29) the front coated wire panels and doors have become rusted. Rusted areas can no
longer be cleaned and sanitized properly. The licensee must repair or replace the affected enclosures. The
licensee must ensure that all surfaces are free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and
sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.Inside an outdoor kennel, housing huskies, the dog shelter is clad in metal sheets. The metal sheets at the bottom
has been pulled loose and twisted upward. In another outdoor kennel, housing huskies, the metal roof ends are
bent downwards towards the dogs. These bent and twisted metal pieces have created sharp points or edges.
There are also screws used to hold the metal roof onto the dog shelter which have penetrated the wood leaving the
dogs exposed to their sharp ends.
Within an outdoor kennel, housing poodles, the metal stripes of a shelter have been pulled loose at the bottom and
twisted upward exposing the dogs to sharp edges.
Inside the sheltered facility, (cid:28)Building B(cid:29) there are weighted chains are used to keep the access doors shut. One
chain had twisted wires on the end of it and at the dogs level creating sharp points.
Within a sheltered facility housing beagles, there is a strip of metal on the outside of the access door that has been
pulled loose and bent upward and at the dogs level creating sharp points and edges.
Throughout both outdoor and sheltered facilities, the fencing is attached with wire. In many of the kennels the sharp
ends of the wires were bent inward to the enclosure and at the dogs level.
These sharp points and edges can cause injury to the dogs. The licensee must repair or replace these sharp points
and edges and also ensure that the housing facilities for the dogs, including dens and houses, are free of jagged
edges or sharp points that might injure the animals.
This affects at least 12 dogs

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning
There is a buildup of grime on several of the access doors of the sheltered facilities. Inside of the sheltered
building, (cid:28)Building C(cid:29) there is an accumulation of hair, dirt and grime built up on the front wire panels and doors.
There is an accumulation of hair, dirt, grime, fecal material, and bedding hanging down from the underneath section
of the outside floor sections of several of the sheltered facility enclosures.
The licensee must clean these affected enclosures and ensure that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in
contact with are spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks (or more often if necessary). All
other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards and practices.
This is a repeat non-compliant item.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste DisposalOn the outside of the majority of the outdoor enclosures there is an accumulation of old fecal material, hair, and
other organic material that has been removed from the enclosures. Outside one of the outdoor enclosures there is
a pile of old, discarded fecal material that according to the facility representative has been there since this past
winter. Outside one of the outdoor enclosures, housing 3 Huskies, there is a mostly decomposed cat carcass. This
accumulation of old fecal material, hair, dirt, and the decomposing cat carcass can attract flies, and/or rodents which
can transmit diseases to the dogs. The licensee must remove the old fecal material, hair, organic material and the
cat carcass from the outside areas near the enclosures and also needs to establish and maintain a program that will
ensure the facility is provided regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes,
bedding, debris, garbage, water, other fluids and wastes, and dead animals, in a manner that minimizes
contamination and disease risks.
This affects 38 dogs.

Daily Cleaning
Throughout the outdoor facility there is an accumulation of fecal material. Some of the fecal material had a dry
appearance, which can indicate that it is not fresh. When questioned by the inspectors the facility representative
indicated that the fecal material had not been removed for four days. The amount of fecal material made it difficult
for the dogs to avoid stepping in it.
There is an accumulation of old and packed fecal material on several of the outdoor flooring sections of the
sheltered facility. Some of the fecal material had a dry appearance, which can indicate that it is not fresh. Some of
these enclosures had fecal material smeared and covering the majority of the flooring section and also on the
outside walls of the enclosures. The amount of fecal material in these enclosures made it difficult for the dogs to
avoid stepping in it.
Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures daily in order to protect the health and well-being of the animals
and to reduce disease hazards pests, insects and odors. Licensee must remove the accumulated fecal material
from these enclosures and ensure that all excreta and food waste is removed daily from primary enclosures.
