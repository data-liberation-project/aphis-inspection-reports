RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection, records of animal births and deaths were not maintained for the guinea pigs. Records
must be kept on animals for animal tracking, assessment of the animal care program, and to comply with the Animal
Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that records on animal births and deaths are kept and maintained.
Correct from this day forward.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There are accumulations of brown stains and debris on the glassboard sides, ventalation pipe, and supports in the
primary enclosures. The cleaning process (method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this
accumulation of stains and debris inside the enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to
protential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often
enough to prevent an accumulation of scale, debris, stains, excreta, and soiled bedding and must be sanitized at
least once every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean to prevent an accumulation
of stains and debris and that all enclosures are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
