2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**A female Pomeranian microchip #005-008-600 continues to have problems with her teeth. The upper teeth
remain covered in a dark hard material and her right upper first pre-molar (the tooth far back on the upper right side
just behind the large tooth) of the mouth is still loose to the touch. Tooth problems can be painful and cause further
health issues in dogs if not treated. To ensure that the dog is not in pain and receives appropriate treatment have
the attending veterinarian evaluate the teeth and treat them per the veterinarian's instructions.
Note-the brown discharge of the right ear appears to be resolved.
**A male tri-colored Welsh Corgi microchip #0048833322 is observed again to have overgrown toenails. The
toenails turn to the outside when he walks. This can be painful and can affect his ability to walk normally. Correct
by addressing the overgrown toenails of this dog and develop and maintain a grooming program that addresses the
toenail health of all dogs at the facility.
2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Eleven puppies are not identified by an official USDA identification method (cage card, tag, or plastic collar). Lack
of official identification does not allow for the proper identification or tracking of the animals. Correct by identifying
all puppies with an official USDA method of identification. Correct by: 8 July 2016.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The disposition of twenty-three adult dogs have not been recorded on the APHIS 7005 inventory forms and the
APHIS 7006 form was not filled out or used for these animals. Eleven puppy births have not been recorded on an
APHIS Form 7005 or on cage cards. Lack of accurate and up-to-date inventory records does not ensure for the
proper tracking of the animals by APHIS Officials as necessary. Update the facility inventory records with all
required information so they accurately reflect the current inventory of animals. Correct by: 11 July 2016.3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Excessive rust development remains on the metal door flaps in the enclosures of the inside/outside building. The
presence of rust can prevent the surfaces from being properly cleaned and sanitized. Eliminate the rust from the
metal door flaps.
Note--licensee has initiated correction by purchasing paint and painting the outside of the metal door flaps.
Application of paint to the inside of the door flaps has not been completed.
3.3(e)(1)(3) REPEAT
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Several surfaces on the inside of the inside/outside building are not impervious to moisture. Some of the walls have
areas of scratched and worn paint and some of the metal door flaps are rusted. Surfaces that are in contact with
animals but are not imperious to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized to reduce disease hazards,
waste accumulation and odors. Correct by making all surfaces in contact with the dogs impervious to moisture.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Two enclosures in the whelping building and three enclosures in the inside/outside building have a buildup of
excreta and soiled bedding under the wire and along the edges. Accumulations of such material can soil the
animals housed within, create odors and attract pests. Ensure all edges and wires are cleaned thoroughly during
daily cleaning. Correct by July 7, 2016.
