2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has two attending veterinarians and written Programs of Veterinary Care (PVC). However, the written
PVCs are incomplete. In the PVC for hoofstock, the sections "Ectoparasites, Blood Parasites, and Internal
Parasites" state, "Ivermectin once yearly," but do not specify dosage or route of administration. In the other PVC
these same sections state, "As needed," but there are no types of drugs or methods, dosage, route of
administration, frequency, or concentration listed for these routine treatments. In addition, the vaccination
schedules are unclear. In the Dogs and Cats section, it shows the cats have been vaccinated on a specific date,
but not how often the veterinarian recommends. In the Other Warm-Blooded Animals section, the vaccination
schedule is also unclear. It states, "Rabbits Distemper," but not how often it should be given. In the Euthanasia
section it states, "Sleepaway," but not the route of administration.
Clear, complete PVCs are important for the proper understanding between animal caretakers and the attending
veterinarians, and to ensure medical treatments are administered accurately with the direction and knowledge of the
attending veterinarians. The licensee must ensure that the PVCs are filled in completely and accurately.
