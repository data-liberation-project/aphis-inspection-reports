2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
No Record of Disposition forms (APHIS Form 7006) were available from the licensee at the time of inspection.
Licensee stated that she did not have any.
3.6(a)(2)(ix) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the whelping building, there was an hole in the wall of the northwest occupied pen containing one adult female
and nursing puppies. In the main kennel building two kennels were found to have worn and exposed wood surfaces
on interior walls and dog doorways.
Along the exterior of the main kennel building there were four occupied runs on the east side with worn and
exposed wood around dog entry doors.
Exposed and unprotected wood surfaces absorb moisture and can make it more difficult to adequately clean and
sanitize those surfaces. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained in a manner that enables all
surfaces in contact with dogs to be readily sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b) or replaced when worn or soiled.
Non-compliance under 3.6(a)(2)(ix) was previously documented during USDA inspection on 24-APRIL-2019 and
24-JUNE-019.
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the main corridor of the whelping building there was a gas can, battery charger, tools, wood boards being stored
with bedding .A growth of weeds inside of the door area was also present.
Clutter in and around animal housing areas may attract rodents and insect pests which can introduce diseases into
the housing environment. Accumulations of construction materials, debris and items not used in the daily upkeep of
the kennel also makes it difficult to adequately clean and sanitize kennel items being kept in these areas.Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and
free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste material and discarded matter. Weeds, grasses and bushes must be
controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control, and to protect the health and well-being of
the animals.
Non-compliance under 3.11 (c) was previously documented during USDA inspection on 24-APRIL-2019 and
24-JUNE-2019
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. The licensee stated multiple times during the
