No non-compliant items identified during this inspection.
This was a focused inspection to address the veterinary care issue identified during the last inspection on July 18,
2016.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative by VMO Scott Welch and ACI Kevin Wilken.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on 8/25/16.
