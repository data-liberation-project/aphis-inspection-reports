FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal support pole to the right of the keeper entrance gate into the grey fox enclosure has rusted through,
resulting in an approximately 2”x2” hole in the support pole above the level of the concrete flooring. This
compromises the structural soundness of the enclosure, and may allow the fox to escape or result in injury. The
housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animal from injury and to contain the animal.

injury. Correct by 12/15/17.
