A female shiba inu with microchip number 941000013052495 is limping on her left rear leg. This dog is not putting
weight on that leg while she is walking. The presence of limping may be due to an injury or other medical conditions
and may cause pain for this dog.
A male Chinese pug with microchip number OAO1137624 has a cloudy right eye. The majority of this eye has a
dry, rough appearance and there is some redness and a slight build-up of a material around the outer edge. Issues
with the eyes may cause difficulty with the vision and can be painful.
These two dogs must be examined by a licensed veterinarian on or before 12 May 2015 to obtain an accurate
diagnosis and treatment plan. This information must be documented in writing and made available to the inspector.

An enclosure in the whelping building housing two adult beagles had an excessive accumulation of dirt, grime and
hair on the floor, corners, and walls of the inside portion of this enclosure.
A buildup of dirt and grime can create disease hazards.

facilities must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b) of this subpart to prevent an
accumulation of excreta, grime, and to prevent disease hazards, odors and pests. Correct by 8 May 2015.
