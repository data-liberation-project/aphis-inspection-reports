ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:30 pm on
02/10/2014.
I spoke with someone at the facility who said he did not have anything to do with the animals and was not
authorized to accompany on inspection. He indicated you were out of town. He attempted to call you on your cell
phone while I was there but he was not able to make contact. A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process.
