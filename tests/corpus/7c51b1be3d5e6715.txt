2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At least 4 striped skunks have excessively long toenails. The licensee states they trim the skunks' nails once a year in the
spring when doing their vaccinations and acknowledge the skunks are due for a trim. Excessively long toenails may break
and cause injury to the animals as well as affect the animal's gait when walking. The licensee must trim the skunk's nails
and create an appropriate plan to ensure the nails are kept at the proper length.

3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The facility states they do not clean and sanitize the sheltered housing for 5 adult dogs during the winter months. Both
indoor sections of these two enclosures had a buildup of brown organic material on the tin siding walls and floor mats. A
buildup of organic material on the enclosures could increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs.
Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and
more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. Hard
surfaces must be sanitized using one of the following methods: live steam under pressure or washing with hot water (at
least 180° F) and soap or detergent. The licensee must clean and sanitize the primary enclosures and ensure that all

aspects of the enclosure are maintained in a clean and sanitized condition in order to support the health of the dogs.
