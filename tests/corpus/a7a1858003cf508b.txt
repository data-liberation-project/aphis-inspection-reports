3.53(a)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Rabbit hutch floors are made of a thin wire mesh. Thin wire mesh without solid surfaces can result in discomfort or
eventual injury to rabbit hocks and legs. Some solid surfaces are available, and were occupied by rabbits at time of
inspection. The amount of solid surfaces was not sufficient for all animals in the enclosure. A system of enclosure
design and maintenance must be in place to prevent possible injury to the animals.
