There were pools of standing water around the water receptacles in the following enclosures; one containing one
zebra and one donkey, one containing two camels, and one containing four goats. The animals were unable to drink
from the receptacles without standing in the water and mud. Standing mud and water can be a source of intestinal
diseases and foot infections to the animals. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water.

impact on the health and well-being of the animals. A safe and effective program for the control of insects,
ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained.
