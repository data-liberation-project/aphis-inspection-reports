A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30am on
30-Oct-19.
Inspector arrived at facility during established optimal hours from last communications. Called the licensee and left
a voicemail. Licensee called back ten minutes later and said they would be unavailable for the day; they tried to
have another associate come by, but they were also unavailable. Inspector and licensee discussed
calling/texting/emailing USDA ahead of time, if there were future plans to be unavailable during the designated
optimal hours.
