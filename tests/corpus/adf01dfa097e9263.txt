2.31(c)(7) CRITICAL
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
During USDA review of IACUC records and facility paperwork on January 29, 2020 and January 30, 2020 the
following were found:
On September 29, 2019 a Bighorn ewe identified as Dolly, and under study on an active research protocol, was
found dead. Observation records and necropsy submission information show that the ewe was observed by
research personnel on September 25, 2019 to be less active than normal. On September 28, the ewe was
recumbent and not displaying normal avoidance behavior when personnel entered the pen. On September 29, 2019
the ewe was found dead in its pen. Diagnostic laboratory necropsy findings on the ewe included pulmonary edema,
mycoplasma infection, copper deficiency, aspiration pneumonia and mild suppurative hepatitis.
The IACUC approved research protocol for this study states: “With our observation schedule we expect to
recognize most all severely affected individuals so that they can be captured, examined, and then humanely
euthanized to alleviate pain and distress rather than dying of disease. For practical purposes, euthanasia will be
performed when the animal becomes sufficiently weak, lethargic, or moribund that they are not able to rise and flee
to avoid restrain (sic) by an approaching research or animal care member.”
The ewe died without the benefit of euthanasia despite observations recorded by research personnel on September
28, 2019 which support the ewe had reached the described endpoint for euthanasia as outlined in the approved
research protocol. This is an unapproved deviation from the IACUC approved protocol and not in compliance with 9
CFR 2.31 (c)(7).
To ensure the well-being and humane treatment of all research animals, it is important for the IACUC to review and
approve any significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing research activities
