2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Yorkshire terrier (#024) has a buildup of tartar on both upper canine teeth. The tartar is dark brown to black
in color and is covering the majority of the surface of both teeth. A grey line of material is located along the gum line
of the upper right canine tooth. The licensee has a dental plan and had recently evaluated the condition of the teeth
of all of the dogs, but had been under the impression that this particular older dog had no teeth, therefore, he had
not examined her.
Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues. The
licensee must have this dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.6(a)(2)(x) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In one enclosure, containing one adult female dog and three puppies, the flooring is constructed of wire. The adult
female dog had removed the puppies from the whelping box and the inspector observed the front and hind legs of at
least one puppy pass through the openings in the wire flooring. Openings in flooring that are large enough for the
puppy's feet and legs to pass through could cause injury to the foot and leg or result in entrapment of the puppy.
Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from
injury and does not allow the dogs' feet and legs to pass through any openings in the floor. The licensee must alter
the flooring in a manner that does not allow the feet and legs of the puppies to pass through the openings. The
licensee must ensure that the flooring of the enclosures is safe for the dogs at all times.
At the time of the inspection the licensee returned the puppies to a solid floored whelping box. (cid:9)
