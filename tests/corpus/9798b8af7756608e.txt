ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During the inspection, the following dogs were found with veterinary care issues.
- A male beagle (ID #3253) was found with severe dental calculus and tartar. The gum was resorbing above the
upper cheek tooth on the right side, leaving a small gap between the tooth and gum line.
- A female beagle (ID #3845) had severe dental calculus and tartar. There was an accumulation of hair and debris
coating the rear teeth. Her gums were red and inflamed.
- A male beagle (ID #2850) had severe dental calculus and an accumulation of hair and debris on the rear teeth.
His gums were red and inflamed.
- A male beagle (ID #2975) had a heavy accumulation of tartar and calculus on numerous teeth. A middle, upper
right tooth was broken in half and very loose at the gum line.
There was no indication that any of the dogs with dental problems had been identified by the facility personnel, or
any treatment implemented. Dental problems can be extremely painful to the affected animals, and can impact the
animal's appetite, health, and welfare.
All animals listed must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian within 10 days and an appropriate treatment plan
instituted for each animal. Correct by: 19 August 2016

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- In the outdoor housing area, there were multiple enclosures that contained wires with sharp points within reach of
the animals. Sharp points are a potential source of injury to the animals. All sharp points must be removed from
the enclosures, and a program of maintenance implemented to identify and correct any sharp points. Some of the
sharp points were corrected during the inspection. The remaining sharp points must be removed or repaired within
3 days.
