ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult white and black colored male Border Collie mix with no identification is carrying its right front leg in an
abnormal manner. There is an open lesion on top of the dog's paw. It appears moist and reddish-pink in color. The
skin is pulled back far enough to observe underlying tissues. It is circular in shape and covers most of the top
portion of the dog's paw. Along the inside area of the dog's right front leg there is an open lesion. This runs along
approximately 70 percent of the length of the dog's leg. The widest area of the lesion is approximately the width of
the dog's leg. This affected area also has a moist appearance in the deeper portion of the wound. There is dried
brown crusty matter around the edges of the lesion located on the middle area of the leg. A yellowish colored
underlying tissue is also observed in the more severe area of the wound located near the top of the leg.
The licensee stated the injury was first observed on February 7, 2015. The licensee also stated she has been
treating the dog with penicillin. However, a veterinarian has not yet been contacted regarding the injury.
Open wounds can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection which affects the health
and well being of the dog.
The dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate diagnosis and treatment administrated and
documented. Documentation must be maintained on all medical problems, diagnosis and treatments must be made
available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all
times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structure; construction.
Within the outdoor housing facility there are primary enclosures adjacent to each other separated by wire panels.
There are two holes along the bottom portion of two of the panels due to extensive rust and corrosion. Sharp points
and edges are present on the affected areas of the panels affecting at least three dogs. These areas on the panel
are large enough to allow the dog's legs or other body parts to pass through and be in contact with the sharp edges.
Sharp points can cause injuries and affect the health and well being of the dogs. The licensee must ensure the
housing facilities are kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by: February 26, 2015.
The licensee stated the injured dog listed above was attacked and injured by a male Doberman in an adjacent
enclosure when the dog's leg entered the occupied enclosure.
Injuries or death can occur when non-compatible dogs are able to be in contact with each other.
The licensee must ensure housing facilities for dogs protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely
and restrict other animals from entering.
