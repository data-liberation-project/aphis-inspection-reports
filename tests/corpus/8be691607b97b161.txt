3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care (APHIS Form 7002A) is incomplete. More specific instructions for rabies vaccination of
adult dogs is needed; the current instructions are "as determined by vet." There are no sampling instructions (frequency
of testing; number or percentage of dogs) for diagnosis of heartworm or intestinal parasites. There are dewormers listed
on the Program of Veterinary Care and on a separate medication list, but the instructions are not completely clear on
whether the dewormers are meant for adults or puppies. A couple of the dewormers do not have dosing instructions or
when they should be given. Incomplete or unclear instructions for medications and vaccines may result in inappropriate
or inadequate treatment of the dogs. A complete Program of Veterinary Care for dogs must be developed, documented in
writing, and signed by the Attending Veterinarian.

To be completed by December 31, 2021.
