ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****** The written guidance from the Attending Veterinarian directs the licensee on appropriate preventative care to
include annual rabies vaccines in several mammalian species as well as annual TB testing in NHPs maintained at
the facility. Currently the pig and coyote are overdue for this vaccine. In addition, annual TB testing is overdue for
the Vervet and should have been done in summer 2017. These preventative measures must be done in accordance
with the instructions of the attending veterinarian.

2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** In September the geriatric Ring Tailed Lemur showed signs of slowing down, sleeping more and going off food
according to the facility. The facility did not call a veterinarian, instead called another licensee, and was directed to
wait and watch the animal. The animal died a few days later. The facility did not communicate with the Attending
Veterinarian the animal's decline in health or that it had passed away. Direct and frequent communication is
required with the Attending Veterinarian to convey timely and accurate information on problems of animal health
and so the AV has the authority to oversee the heath conditions of the animals.
