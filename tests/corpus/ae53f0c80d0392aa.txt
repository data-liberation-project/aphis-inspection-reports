PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Two pigs have died while under anesthesia in a period of three months. Both cases were the result of improper
monitoring of the anesthesia machine by facility technicians. The attending veterinarian and IACUC were informed
of each event and immediate corrective action was taken. This included retraining technicians in the proper use and
monitoring of the anesthesia machine and adding signage to machines to ensure proper monitoring and use. The
research facility must ensure that training and instruction of personnel include the proper use of anesthetics for any
species used by the facility .
