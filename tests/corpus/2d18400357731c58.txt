ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adult, female Shih Tzu with chip number 091 579 554 ("Ginger") has some thick white colored discharge adhering
to the surface of the left eye. There is dark colored discharge that has dried around the lids of the eye. The surface
of the left eye appears dry and uneven in some areas. The licensee reports that the attending veterinarian
evaluated this dog a "couple of years" ago and she has been treating the eye since that time with ointment.The
licensee does not have written directions for treatment available for this dog from the veterinarian. Eye problems
can be caused by infection, trauma, many other medical problems and can be painful. These symptoms are
consistent with an ongoing medical problem that is not being controlled with the treatment currently being provided.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian by 3 July 2014 in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the inspector upon request.

licensed veterinarian. There was also a bottle of unidentifiable pills with no expiration date. All of these medication

side effects, and the use of expired medication. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility
are not expired and are labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices. To be corrected by 14
July 2014.
