ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A five week old male Golden Retriever puppy (TB1024M1) was repetitively blinking and squinting his right eye. On
closer observation, there was clear discharge and the appearance of darkened stained fur around the entire eye.
The third eyelid appeared elevated and, along with the squinting, it was difficult to observe the right eyeball/globe
itself. According to the licensee, she had not noticed the puppy(cid:25)s eye prior to the inspectors pointing it out. This
puppy(cid:25)s eye condition could indicate an injury, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may be painful.
The licensee must have this puppy seen by a licensed veterinarian, by December 4, 2014, in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Facility maintenance.
Two enclosures had holes in the main metal support pipes of the fencing. Rust had degraded the metal on one of
the pipes to where most of the circumference of the pipe was missing. The gate support pipe hole was
approximately 2 inches long and over half the circumference of the pole. This hole was about 6 inches off the
ground with sharp edges. Another enclosure inside the whelping building had an approximately one inch hole with
roughened/sharp edges along the bottom support pipe of the fencing inside the enclosure. These holes can
compromise the structural integrity, make it difficult to clean, and sharp edges can increase the risk of injury to the
animals. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury.
To be corrected by: December 12, 2014.
