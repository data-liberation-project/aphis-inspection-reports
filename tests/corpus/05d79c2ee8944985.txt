ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:50pm on
14-Feb-18.
I arrived at the facility at 12:45pm on 2/14/18 and was prevented from knocking on the door by a barking dog. I
called the primary number at 12:48 and left a message. I tried the secondary number, which has been
disconnected. I tried the primary number again at 12:50 and the owner answered. She stated that the entire
household was sick with the flu and unable to escort me through the kennels.
