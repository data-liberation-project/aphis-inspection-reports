FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The floor in the wooden house in the muntjac enclosure is rotten. There are several boards on the outside of the
house that have rotted and splintered leaving nails exposed and sharp points that may cause injury. There are two
metal barrels also used for housing or feeding areas. The first barrel has severe rust and corrosion leaving jagged
edges that can cut the muntjac The structural strength of the house and barrel are compromised and may allow the
muntjac to become injured while in use.
The primary enclosure fence is rusted with several areas of corrosion. All along the bottom portion of the fence
there are odd pieces of fence material, cage wire or panels loosely attached to the fence with wire. Some of the
panels have sharp points directed into the enclosure or in accessible areas that may cause injury to the muntjac.
There is a divider fence that divides the primary enclosure into two separate enclosures. There is a section of the
fence that the owner cut to access the second enclosure, the wire was not reattached and is hanging down into the
enclosure. There is a hole in the bottom of the divider fence toward the back side, the hole was not "cut" into the
fence but appears to have been made by the muntjac pushing through. The edges are stretched and bent and
some of the wires have broken leaving sharp points that may cause injury.
All structures shall be repaired or replaced. If a pass through is necessary it should be made safe to prevent injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.
Upon opening the door to the feed storage shed I observed several empty feed bags, insect spray and other items
on the floor around the open and closed bags of feed. There is spilled feed, dirt, and rodent droppings on the floor in
front of the bags. The shed is crowded and it is not possible to access the area behind and around the feed toinspect. Chemicals, insects and vermin can cause food contamination and deterioration which may lead to illness..
All trash shall be removed and discarded. The chemicals shall be removed and properly stored away from the feed
to prevent contamination, and the floors swept and maintained to discourage the presence of vermin. The shed
shall be made accessible for daily cleaning and inspection.

SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
There are pieces of wire, old metal barrels, broken branches, and fencing laying scattered throughout the muntjac
enclosure. There are several trees in the enclosure that have broken limbs and branches that are breaking and
falling into the enclosure. There are also branches that were placed in the enclosure for enrichment. Branches can
be used in the enclosure but they should not be allowed to accumulate and create a hazard. The clutter shall be
removed and accumulations of broken branches minimized to protect the muntjac from injury. Any dead or dying
trees as well as breaking limbs should also be removed to prevent them from falling into the enclosure and
potentially causing injury or allowing a muntjac to escape.
There is excessive wood, broken tree limbs, wire fencing, paper, discarded feed bags, etc. in the yard that
surrounds the muntjac enclosure. Accumulations of trash and clutter attract vermin and insects which increases the
risk of attracting and harboring vermin and insects. The trash and clutter shall be removed and the building and
grounds cleaned to minimize the attraction of insects and vermin, and protect the animals from injury.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
