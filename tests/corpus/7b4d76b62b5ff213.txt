ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1600 on
17-Oct-18.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the door. I also called the contact number and left a message. The licensee
called back and stated that he was at work and would not be able to return for several more hours.
