Facilities, general.
The outdoor housing for the fox had chain mesh fencing on the ground to prevent excessive digging. The mesh is fully
exposed. The animal could get a foot caught in the holes in the chain mesh and get injured. The outdoor housing
facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals. The mesh needs to be covered to prevent possible injury to the animal.

Sanitation.
In the indoor housing for the 2 raccoons and 1 ringtail lemur there was a buildup of feed/fecal waste on the bottom of the
enclosures and the climbing apparatuses, shelves and perches contained within. Excreta shall be removed from primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease
hazards and to reduce odors. The enclosures need to be cleaned and sanitized.
