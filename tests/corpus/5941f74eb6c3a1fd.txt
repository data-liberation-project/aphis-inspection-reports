HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Section 2.131(d)(2) Handling of animals: The public was observed feeding the goats during this inspection. The
two facility animal caretakers present at the facility did not have anything on their person (like a shirt, hat, or jacket)
that readily identified them as employees of the facility. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable
employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact so that the general public knows
to whom to report concerns and to whom has authority to monitor animal/human interactions. Correct by having
employees and attendants of the animal facility readily identifiable to the public. Correct by May 10, 2017.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The front of enclosure 1 housing 10 goats (5 adult & 5 kids) has the bottom of
the chain link fencing curling up into the enclosure. Goats walking the fence line may get a foot or leg through the
curled up fencing and be injured. The young goats may try to get under the curled up section of fencing and be
injured or get out of the enclosure. Animal enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by repairing or replacing the curled up section of
fencing. Correct by April 28, 2017.
