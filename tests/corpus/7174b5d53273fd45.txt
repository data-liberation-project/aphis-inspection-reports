WATERING.
There are 14 goats and 16 deer that drink from a single water trough located near their shelter structure. This water
trough has water that appears to be green in color due to the excessive amount of algae build up on the inside of
the trough. All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary to ensure that the animals have fresh, clean
water to drink. Having unsanitary water receptacles can contribute to disease and illness. Licensee must ensure
that the animals have a clean water source and that the receptacles are cleaned as often as necessary to prevent
the algae build up.
