3.80(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the brown capuchin enclosure housing two monkeys in the winter primate house, the remnants of a platform were
evident. Twisted and heavily damaged pieces of wood were present, posing an injury hazard to the monkeys. In
the ring tailed lemur enclosure in the winter primate house, the lemurs were sitting on a heavily damaged/chewed
wooden shelf, posing an injury hazard to the lemurs. Primary enclosures must be structurally sound and kept in
good repair. Correct by repairing or replacing the platform and shelving to ensure the safety of the animals.
3.84(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
All enclosures in the primate winter house contained evidence of dirt and debris build-up. This build-up can pose a
health hazard to the animals via disease transmission or exposure to harmful organisms. Indoor primary enclosures
are required to be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and as often as necessary to prevent buildup. Correct by
implementing a thorough cleaning and sanitization program that complies with the guidelines in this section.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
There was evidence of excreta build up and/or wet straw in the capybara hutch, the fennec fox enclosure, the flying
squirrel enclosure, and the goats shelter area. Excess excreta and/or wet straw poses a health hazard to the
animals and may prevent animals from having sanitary shelter from the elements. Correct by cleaning the affected
areas as often as necessary to maintain adequate sanitation.
