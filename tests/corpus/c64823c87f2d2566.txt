ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female, 12 year old, German Shepherd Dog with number 10588 has a large mass of tissue incorporating the last
mammary gland/nipple on the left side. The mass is firm and is approximately the size of a softball. This dog has not
been evaluated by a veterinarian for this problem. Tissue masses can become large and uncomfortable, can spread
to other parts of the body, and can lead to other medical problems.
Male, 14 year old, German Shepherd dog with number 944 is limping on his front right leg. The licensee states this
dog limps frequently and suspects it is a result of a previous injury. This dog has not been evaluated by a
veterinarian for this problem. Alteration of the gait such as limping can indicate injury and pain.
The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
These dogs must be evaluated by a veterinarian by 28 October 2014.
There is an expired bottle of injectable ivermectin (Noromectin - expiration date 12/2013). This is the bottle that the
licensee stated she is using to treat the dogs for blood parasites according to the program of veterinary care (PVC).
The PVC states that the ivermectin should be used on the "non shelties" but the licensee states that she is using the
ivermectin on the Shetland Sheep Dogs on occasion. There are no instructions from a veterinarian for mixing,
dosing and use of the injectable ivermectin in dogs. Expired medications can experience spoilage or have reduced
efficacy. This could lead to prolonged illness or suffering for the animals needing the drug. Incorrect use of
medications can cause unintended side effects. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility
are not expired, be labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices, and have instructions for use
from a veterinarian. To be corrected by 28 October 2014.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the bags of food being stored in the sheltered building has multiple holes exposing the food and some tapedareas on the bag. The licensee states that she believes that opossums have broken in to the building and have
been breaking open the bags and eating the food. She has addressed the vermin problem by trapping the
opossums but this bag is now open and at risk for contamination and at risk for attracting more vermin. The licensee
must ensure that supplies of food and bedding be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage,
contamination, and vermin infestation. To be corrected by 24 October 2014.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
