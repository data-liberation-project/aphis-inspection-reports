HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***On April 11, 2015 a child fell into the cheetah exhibit from the deck area and broke his leg. Subsequently the
child(cid:25)s mother and father were able to jump into the enclosure and retrieve the child. The viewing wall is
approximately 8 feet 3 inches from the ground inside the exhibit. According to the zoo staff, the two male cheetahs
in the exhibit stayed to the back side of the exhibit and did shift into holding without issue. The observation deck is a
large open area with an unobstructed view. There is a cement ledge with a wood slat extension that is between the
chain link fencing. At the far right of the deck the inspector was able to reach over and touch the primary enclosure
fence. The ledge has some small educational graphics but the area is very open and easily accessible for children
to sit on or guests to place items. There is no signage deterring guests from sitting on this ledge. This exhibit was
part of an overall zoo planning process last summer to have secondary containment and have Plexiglas installed in
the deck area. The glass has been ordered for this deck area but has yet to arrive and be installed. Due to the child
falling into the enclosure and the ability for the inspector to touch the primary enclosure fence to the right of the deck
there are insufficient barriers for this exhibit. This needs to be addressed for the safety of the guests and the
animals.
Corrected at time of incident by blocking off the deck from guests. Will be corrected permanently when the glass is
installed.
This was a focused inspection on the cheetah exhibit.
An exit briefing was conducted with the executive director via phone prior to being sent this report.
