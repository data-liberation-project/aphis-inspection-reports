Facilities, general.
During inspection a dark-colored fox was seen outside of its enclosure (but still inside the perimeter). The facility
representative said it has been getting out by the lockdown area and we could see tracks in the snow where it might have
been getting out between a gate and a post in that area. The fox had been recaptured without incident prior to the exit
interview and was contained in a different enclosure. Enclosures that don't contain animals could allow animals to get
injured or become un-accounted for while out. The facility must maintain enclosures in good repair to protect animals
from injury and to contain the animals.

Maintain correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
