2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-An adult female Saint Bernard "Annabelle" (#941000014961402) and Saint Bernard "Meya" (0A01441848) were
very thin and were housed with another male Saint Bernard. These female dogs had obvious visible waists and
abdominal tucks. The tops of their lumbar vertebrae were visible and the pelvic bones were becoming prominent.
"Meya" appeared thinner than "Annabelle" and her thin body condition with prominent bony structures was easily
evident through her heavy hair coat. Also, both dogs each had a wound-like lesion that appeared red and inflamed
most notably on the mid to upper portion near the inside of their right front legs. These wounds appeared
puncture-like on the right front legs and both legs appeared swollen compared to their left front legs. There was a
thinner amount of fur to no fur around these wounds and it also looked wet compared to surrounding fur. The facility
representative stated that the dogs had gotten into a fight and had noticed "Annabelle" had been favoring her right
front leg and that it looked swollen on Tuesday. "Annabelle" was still limping on the right front leg and she also had
a red to black lesion with a scab-like material that was approximately 1 inch in diameter above her left eye. The
licensee said that a veterinarian had been contacted the morning of inspection and a treatment plan had already
been established for "Annabelle" and her wounds but it had not yet been started at the time of inspection at
approximately 1pm. However, "Meya's" wound and swollen appearance of her leg had not been noticed by the
licensee or facility representative and a veterinarian had not been contacted about her condition. A closer
observation of "Meya" was attempted but the dog appeared skittish and would repeatedly run away from the facility
representative and go into the shelter unit when trying to get a closer look at her. The female dogs were observed
intensely fighting during the inspection and the facility representative sprayed water with a hose on the dogs to get
them to stop fighting. After this incident, "Meya" appeared to have fresh red blood-like material around the right
neck/shoulder region. "Meya's" leg condition could be due to a previous dog fight noted by the facility
representative and the bloody material around the neck could be due to the recent fight; these fights and possible
injuries could increase the risk of infection or other veterinary medical conditions which could be painful. Neither dog
was under treatment for their thin body condition.
- An adult female Miniature Pinscher "Harper" also appeared thin and was housed with four additional adult dogs.
She had an obvious visible waist and abdominal tuck. The top of her lumbar vertebrae were more visible than the
other dogs in the enclosure and her pelvic bones were also becoming prominent. The dog was very active and was
observed running up and down the length of the outdoor portion of her enclosure repeatedly; a closer observation
was attempted but the facility representative was unable to secure the dog. The pacing back and forth could beindicative of an abnormal behavior or other underlying veterinary medical condition which could be distressful.
-Miniature Pinscher "Keishia" (900085000505409) was in an enclosure with 4 of her puppies. She was also very
thin and had an obvious visible waist and abdominal tuck. The tops of her lumbar vertebrae were very prominent
and her pelvic bones were becoming prominent. Her puppies were currently 4-5 days old according to a facility
representative. One of the male puppies appeared listless and was not moving like the other puppies. The facility
representative removed the puppy for closer observation and treatment by the licensee. According to the licensee 2
puppies had previously died from the litter. This male puppy's condition could be due to several different veterinary
medical conditions some of which could result in death. The licensee must ensure that the PVC and treatment plans
for this puppy's condition are followed and if the puppy does not improve then ensure a veterinarian is contacted to
follow-up on a treatment plan.
-An adult female Miniature Pinscher "Fiona" (0A01737041) was observed running up and down the length of the
outdoor portion of her enclosure repeatedly. When she did stop, she was observed in a hunched position and
appeared to be trying to have a bowel movement; at least on one attempt a small amount of liquid stool was
observed which was red in color and appeared to be blood-like. The inspectors observed this straining-like behavior
at least 3 times in approximately 5 minutes. The facility representative had not noticed this dog's loose red stool and
a veterinarian had not been contacted about the dog's condition and no treatment was being given. The loose stool
could be due to gastrointestinal disorder, infection or other veterinary medical condition which could be painful. The
pacing back and forth could be indicative of an abnormal behavior or other underlying veterinary medical condition
which could be distressful.
A veterinarian had not been contacted about any of these dogs' ongoing thin body conditions listed above and they
were currently not under any treatment for their body conditions. The licensee mentioned that it was possible that
some of the dogs could be thin due to getting "bullied" by another dog in each enclosure over the food. A thin body
condition in dogs can also be due to inadequate nutrition, parasites, or other underlying medical problems. The
licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding the thin body conditions of these dogs. "Meya" and
"Fiona" must be examined by a veterinarian. These veterinary consultations and examinations are in order to
ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and that appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed.
-An adult female Boxer "Lily" still appeared thin. She was included on the report for the inspection conducted on
3/22/18 for being very thin. She still had an obvious visible waist and abdominal tuck. The tops of her lumbar
vertebrae were prominent and her pelvic bones were becoming prominent. She was still co-housed with another
adult dog. According to the licensee and facility representative, they were separating the dogs within the enclosure
at feeding time so they could each eat their own portions of food. The licensee had consulted with the veterinarian
since the last inspection and said that it had been recommended to feed her puppy food however she was still
feeding "Lily" adult food. It is important to follow the treatment plans established by the veterinarian otherwise it
could increase the risk that the animal does not improve or the condition could worsen.
The licensee must ensure that the PVC and all treatment plans of the veterinarian for all of the animals are followed
at all times. If the animal's condition does not seem to be improving or is worsening, then the licensee must
follow-up with the veterinarian. The licensee must ensure that all treatment plans are followed and that all animals
receive adequate veterinary care at all times2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
-There were a total 20 puppies which were less than 16 weeks of age at the facility that did not have individual
identification. The un-weaned puppies were in one of five litters being housed as a litter with their dam. Identification
is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping
requirements. The licensee must ensure that all dogs less than 16 weeks of age are identified by an official tag as
described in Sec. 2.51, a legible tattoo approved by the Administrator, a microchip, or a cage card (if maintained as
a litter with their dam and housed within the same primary enclosure). To be corrected by: April 9, 2018.
3.1(f) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-On the ground, directly adjacent to at least 3 outdoor enclosures housing Saint Bernards and/or Boxers, there is an
accumulation of waste, including feces, hair and other material such as leaves.
-The outdoor portion of an enclosure housing 2 adult Miniature Pinschers contained a dirt/pea gravel type ground
floor that was very wet compared to the enclosures located on either side of it. The wet enclosure contained small to
moderate sized puddles of water throughout the enclosure and had a very muddy appearance. The dogs inside this
enclosure had fur that appeared wet and was covered with mud on their feet, legs and abdomens; there was also
mud splattered throughout their fur on the tops of their backs and heads. The indoor portion of this enclosure had a
heavy build-up of dirt, mud, fecal material and grime covering most of the entire floor and around some of the
access door. This enclosure housed an adult female Miniature Pinscher "Fiona" that had loose stools.
This accumulation of waste material next to the dogs' enclosures and standing water inside of the enclosure
increases the risk of pests, odors and other disease hazards. The standing puddles of water in animal enclosures
must be drained or mopped up so that the animals can stay clean and dry at all times. The licensee must establish
and maintain a program that provides for the regular and frequent removal of animal and food waste, water and
debris from the kennel area to protect the dogs from pests, odors and other disease hazards at all times.
3.7(b) DIRECT
COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
-According to the licensee and a facility representative there were 2 adult female Saint Bernards, "Annabelle"
(#941000014961402) and "Meya" (0A01441848) that did not get along and had recently gotten into a fight. During
the inspection, the females were housed together with another male Saint Bernard. According to the facility
representative, she suspected that the females had recently been in a fight because she had noticed on Tuesday
that "Annabelle" was limping on her right front leg which appeared swollen with a suspected bite wound on it.
"Meya" also had a puncture-like wound that appeared to be a bite wound on her right front leg which had not been
previously noticed by the facility. Both females were also very thin. While looking at the dogs and their current
conditions, the dogs began to intensely fight. The facility representative sprayed the dogs with water from a hose toget the dogs to stop fighting. "Meya" appeared to have fresh red blood-like material around the neck. She was also
observed licking at her right front leg. When the facility representative was asked about separating the dogs and
why the 2 were still housed together despite the fighting, wounds and thin body conditions she replied that there
was no other place to put them and they did not have space to separate them.
-In addition to the thin body conditions of "Annabelle" and "Meya", there were two additional dogs that appeared to
be very thin that were each housed with at least one additional dog during the inspection. These dogs included adult
female Boxer "Lily" (0A02082504) and female Miniature Pinscher "Harper". Another adult female Miniature Pinscher
"Layla" was previously included on the report for the inspection conducted on 3/22/18 for being very thin was
co-housed with additional adult dogs. According to the licensee, she thought that these dogs could be thin due to
getting "bullied" by another dog in each enclosure over the food.
Dogs that are not compatible with each other but continue to be housed together increase the risk of dog fights
and/or other dominant behaviors which can increase the risk of injury, infections, malnutrition or other veterinary
medical conditions including death to one or more of the dogs. The licensee must ensure that dogs that are housed
in the same primary enclosure are compatible and that any dog exhibiting a vicious or overly aggressive disposition
is housed separately at all times. To be corrected by: April 6, 2018.
3.10 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
-There were at least four enclosures housing adult dogs that contained water receptacles located on the ground in
the outdoor portion of their enclosures. The water in these receptacles did not appear potable. Two enclosures each
contained water that was light to golden brown, opaque and mud-like. One of these enclosures housed 2 dogs, one
of which was an adult female Miniature Pinscher "Fiona" that had loose stools. Another enclosure contained a small
amount of water with a couple of worms in the center of the receptacle. This enclosure housed 5 dogs, one of which
was an adult female Miniature Pinscher "Haper" that appeared very thin. There was another enclosure with water
that appeared dark golden yellow with debris in it. When asked about the last time fresh water had been given to
these animals, the facility representative stated that it had been the night before last. Lack of potable water can
decrease an animal's intake of water, could increase the risk of disease hazards or adverse medical conditions. The
licensee must ensure that all of the dogs are offered potable water as required. The facility representative provided
fresh water as requested during the inspection.
3.11(a) DIRECT REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
-There were at least 8 enclosures throughout the facility housing dogs that contained greater than a day's worth of
feces. Some of the enclosures were in the outdoor facility and others were in the indoor and/or outdoor portion of a
sheltered building. One enclosure within a sheltered building housing two Miniature Pinschers had a heavy
accumulation of mashed and caked fecal material as well as dirt and grime covering the entire flooring of the indoorportion of their enclosure; there was not enough room for all of the dogs to occupy the indoor portion of the
enclosure without walking, standing, sitting or laying in this material. There were additional enclosures that
contained enough feces that the dogs were walking through it to maneuver through the enclosure. There were feces
that had been mashed and dried into the floors of many of the enclosures. Also, some of the feces had hair
embedded into the dried feces and some had mold-like discoloration observed on the feces. When asked about
when these enclosures were cleaned, the facility representative stated they were last cleaned this past weekend on
Sunday, approximately 4 days prior to inspection. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease
hazards and create an unhealthy environment for the animals. The licensee must ensure that all waste material is
removed from the primary enclosures daily as required.
3.11(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
-There were hard surfaces in contact with the dogs that had an excessive build-up of dirt, mud and/or grime. Within
a sheltered building, there were at least 2 enclosures that had an excessive build-up of dirt/mud, mashed feces and
grime on the floors, lower portions of the walls and around some of the access doors. The build-up was so heavy
that the dogs would not have a place to stand, walk, lay or sit without being in this material. One of these enclosures
housed 5 dogs, one of which was an adult female Miniature Pinscher "Haper" that appeared very thin. The other
enclosure housed 2 dogs, one of which was an adult female Miniature Pinscher "Fiona" that had loose stools.
According to a facility representative, the enclosures were last cleaned over the weekend. The build up of dirt and
grime can increase the risk of disease hazards in the dogs. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures and
food and water receptacles are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease hazards.
-The adult female Miniature Pinscher "Layla" included on the report for the inspection conducted on March 22, 2018
under 2.40 (b)(2) had been addressed.
The focused inspection and a preliminary exit interview were conducted with the licensee and a facility
representative on April 5, 2018. The exit interview was completed on April 6, 2018.
