Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
This research facility has a new part-time Attending Veterinarian (AV) as of 8/26/22. The new AV attended the last IACUC

Attending Veterinarian.

Per this Section, each research facility shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a
part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of
veterinary care that contains information regarding the medical care for the animals. Correct by 2/1/23.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
