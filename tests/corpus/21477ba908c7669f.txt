ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1640 on
25-Mar-19. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I honked my car horn. The
neighbor said she might be home soon. I waited a half hour and left.
End of report.
