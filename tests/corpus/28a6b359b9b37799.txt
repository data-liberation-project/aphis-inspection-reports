2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care remains incomplete. The guidance included in the written program of
veterinary care is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods
to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites. Currently the written
PVC contains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed. Additionally, the recommended
treatments consist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of
administration. Regarding frequency of administration, the written PVC says "as needed" for the majority of the
species. There is no guidance elsewhere clarifying what "as needed" means. Additional guidance for the use of
these drugs must be provided in the written PVC for all species for which these drugs are intended to be used.
Failure to include complete written guidance regarding these topics does not ensure welfare of the animals
maintained by the facility as mis-communications may lead to failure to provide measures for prevention, control,
and treatment of disease. Correct by working with the attending veterinarian to ensure that complete guidance
regarding the dose, route, and frequency of administration for all drugs listed for each species that are not
specifically labelled by the manufacturer are incorporated into the written program of veterinary care. The Farm
manager stated during this inspection that the current PVC is unchanged since the last inspection.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary (PVC) continues to authorize the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for
tranquilization (without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority
of species including: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat, Aoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai,
Fallow Deer, Eland, and Elk. Records on hand show that the facility is still currently using the drug.
Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this
drug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered
distressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug
can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated
they can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,or training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis
of respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available
which are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.
Because of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or
neuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of
general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.
The licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care
as required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and
is likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with your
attending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides
adequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of
administration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. Documentation of all
changes or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must
maintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There is no disposition records for 15 llamas. Accurate animal records regarding births, deaths, acquisition and
disposition are used to help evaluate the facility's animal care program and for animal tracking for ownership and
health care concerns. Every exhibitor must make, keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly
disclose the following information concerning animals purchased, acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his
or her control, or were transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of by that exhibitor, including any
offspring born of any animals while in his or her possession or under his control.
Correct by maintaining accurate records regarding all dispositions from this day forward.
