3.28(c)(1)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The space provided for three guinea pigs in their primary enclosure does not meet the standards in this
section. This single enclosure with overall dimensions at its floor level of approximately 10.5 by 21 inches provided
approximately 220.5 square inches, which was reduced to approximately 145 square inches by the presence of a
feeder (4 x 4.25 inches) and water bottle holder (9 x 6.5 inches).
The facility utilized the manufacturer(cid:25)'s specifications for dimensions, floor space and maximum stocking density.
These specifications of two guinea pigs greater than 350 grams did not account for the reduction due to the food
and water receptacles and used the dimensions of the top of the edge of the cage, which tapered to its floor thereby
overestimating the available floor space.
The weights of these three animals were 378, 404 and 410 grams, for an average of 397 grams. Guinea pigs
weighing over 350 grams are required to have 101 square inches of floor space each. Each of these primary
enclosures may house a maximum of one guinea pig greater than 350 grams in order to meet the space
requirement.
Failure to provide adequate floor space could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals.
The animals should be provided with adequate floor space so as to facilitate adequate freedom of movement.
