2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The inspectors reviewed the few acquisition and disposition records available for review which were the 2015
acquisition records for the marmosets and an acquisition record for a male spider monkey and a disposition record
for a female spider monkey. The following records were missing:
*The acquisition and disposition record for the second spider monkey (facility representative stated she obtained
two but then returned one that she was unable to sell)
*The disposition record for the six hedgehogs present during the last routine inspection that the facility
representative states she no longer owns.
*The disposition record for the marmosets present during the last inspection and not present during today's
inspection.
*The acquisition/disposition records for the animals being sold/exhibited during the Exotic Expo in Cowan, TN on
May 20, 2017.
It is important to keep accurate and complete records in order to trace the health and the ownership of animals. The
acquisition and disposition records must be complete and include all the required information.
3.77(f) REPEAT
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The sheltered housing for marmosets is not completely surrounded by a six foot perimeter fence. There is only one
small portion of the current fencing that meets the perimeter fence requirements. The licensee stated that a
variance request was sent to the office approximately six months ago however inspectors checked with the office
which has no records of receiving a variance request. The sheltered housing building requires a perimeter fence at
least six foot high which is at least three feet from the sheltered building or a variance approved by the
administrator. The administrator can approve a fence less than six feet high and less than three feet from the
sheltered building. It is important for the protection of the nonhuman primates to restrict access of unwanted animals
and unauthorized humans. Apply for a variance or construct a fence.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.Additional Inspectors
