FEEDING.
At least 3 self feeders and a bulk food container contained insects in the feed. There were 1/2 inch long worm like
insects and 1/4 inch beetle like insects crawling thru the food in the feeders and bulk container. Insects
contaminating the food can cause an illness or injury to the dogs. All animals must be fed a food that is insect free.
The dog food containers must be cleaned more often. The dog food must be uncontaminated, wholesome, and
palatable.
