CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The premises including buildings for the non human primates must be addressed. The majority of the wood
surfaces that have direct contact with the animals are not sealed and cannot be kept clean according to section
3.84. The wood ladder used for perching in the far Capuchin enclosure is in disrepair and has multiple nails
exposed along the ladder.
* The indoor building for the gibbon does not facilitate appropriate husbandry practices for cleaning or living area for
the animal. The building has only one overhead light that does not sufficiently provide adequate light for cleaning or
a light cycle for the gibbon. In addition, this building is filled with discarded materials not used for the animal making
the area cluttered. The humidity level is excessively high with a strong musty odor, and the enclosure has areas of
chipped paint and wood not sealed so the area cannot be adequately cleaned. Lastly the outdoor area for the
gibbon has multiple holes that were dug by a rabbit underneath the chain link which does not protect the animal
from potential injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The metal shift door for the adult female lion enclosure is rusted and pitting along the bottom. This rusting has
caused flaking of the metal along the bottom edge of the door. The metal may have sharp edges and the structural
integrity of the door could be compromised by the deteriorating door.
* There was a vertical support for the back wall of the enclosure for the adult female lion that is in disrepair. This
support is rusted at ground level and structural integrity of this support has been compromised. There is enough
horizontal support in this area to keep the animal contained at the time of the inspection. However, there is potential
for the animal to be injured by the support or for the support to be further damaged leading to a failure to contain the
animal.* Several doors in the llama and sheep enclosure were in disrepair. The wood on the door was broken and
protruding nails were exposed.
* In the majority of hoofstock enclosures there was downed chain-link fence. This fence was not a part of the
enclosure or the perimeter, but rather was a part of field dividers. The downed chain-link fence may lead the
animals to become entangled or injured.
* In the Elk and Fallow Deer enclosure there was metal debris on the ground next to the barn. There was also a
significant amount of chain-link fence in rolls next to the feeders. There were three potential shelters for the animals
in this enclosure. The "ice-house" building had approximately 50% of the roof was missing or in disrepair. The metal
was falling into the "ice-house." There was limited drainage of water from this shelter, there was water pooling on
the ground. The "old barn" had a hard pack of hay and fecal material for the flooring. This hard pack is a significant
depth and has accumulated to the point that the mature fallow and elk would be too tall for the barn. Between the
three shelters in this enclosure, there is insufficient space for the animals to be protected from the elements.
* The shelter in the Patagonian cavy enclosure was found to be in disrepair. The flooring was broken and the wall
had an approximately 10in round hole in the side. This could cause the animals to become entrapped or injured by
the shelter. There was also a hole along the fence that had been dug by the animals. This hole was almost
completely under the fence and could allow the animals to escape if not repaired.
Animal enclosures be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.

SANITATION.
Several of the enclosure shelter areas and areas at the entrance to the shelter areas have an accumulation of
feces that needs to be removed. These include the fallow deer and elk enclosure, the llama and sheep enclosure
and the cougar enclosure. The fallow deer and elk enclosure had a hard pack buildup of hay and fecal materials in
the barn that prevents the mature animals from entering the building due to the height of the pack. In the llama and
sheep enclosure there was heavy accumulation of fecal material in the barn. In the cougar enclosure, the bedding
area had not been changed and contained a large buildup of urine and feces mixed with straw. These areas need tobe cleaned as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
The cougar enclosure was corrected at the time of the exit briefing.
