Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Observation of the facility's 21-year old female black bear revealed a tooth on the right side of the lower jaw that appears
to be broken/sheared with a yellow discoloration in the center. The location of the tooth is consistent with where the
canine tooth would be located but the tooth currently is markedly shorter than what a canine tooth normally is. Further
observation of the bear revealed no abnormalities with eating but she was seen occasionally biting the bars of her
enclosure. However, this behavior was only witnessed when someone was standing outside of her enclosure with food.

The facility stated that there have been no abnormalities noted with the bear's eating behaviors and corroborated that bar-
biting was only seen occasionally and in anticipation of food. They were unaware of any dental issues the bear might
have been experiencing. Facility representatives also stated that the last oral exam the bear received was approximately
10 years ago by a previous Attending Veterinarian.

Facilities are required to establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Dental issues, including broken teeth, can be a
source of significant pain to animals as well as a source of potential infection, both of which negatively impact the health


and well-being of the animals. Additionally, while the bar-biting might be anticipatory of food, it can also be an indicator of
dental pain that also needs to be evaluated by the Attending Veterinarian. Correct by having the bear evaluated by the
Attending Veterinarian to assess the condition of the tooth, as well as any other dental issues observed, and determine a
possible course of treatment.

Correct by July 1, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
