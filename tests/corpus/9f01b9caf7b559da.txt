3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures.
There are multiple enclosures that have a build-up of food waste and/or animal waste within the enclosure.
There is one enclosure with twenty degus that has a build-up of feces and/or food waste on the floor of the
enclosure. The waste is mainly located on one shelf and the ramp between that shelf and the next lower shelf. The
waste covers nearly the entire floor of the shelf. In some areas the feces/waste is compacted and in some areas it is
wet.
There is a thick build-up of brown to black grime located on a section of one wall and one area of the door frame
within the coati mundi enclosure. The grime is thick and there is a small amount of bedding stuck to the soiled area
on the door frame.
The capybara enclosure has an excessive amount of food and/or animal waste throughout nearly the entire floor of
the enclosure. In some areas the bedding that covers the floor is wet and/or soiled with urine, feces, and/or food
waste. Some of the food is fresh, but there is a significant amount of waste from old decaying food mixed in with the
bedding.
Failure to clean animal enclosures can lead to health hazards, pests and odors. Primary enclosures shall be
cleaned
and excreta and food waste shall be removed in order to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein
and to minimize disease hazards, pests and odors.
