ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:15 a.m. on
04/29/2015.
Upon arrival contact was made with the zoo keeper and the zoo keeper stated that both she and the licensee were
unavailable to conduct an animal welfare inspection due to illness. We asked the zoo keeper if there was anyone
else available to conduct the inspection with us and we were informed no one that is authorized.
