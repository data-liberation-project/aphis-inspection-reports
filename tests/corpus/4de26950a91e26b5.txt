2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult female zebu and two adult llamas had significantly overgrown hooves. While the footpads of the llamas
were positioned and oriented normally, the toenails were noticeably overgrown. The hindlimb hooves of the female
zebu were also overgrown and longer than the forelimb hooves. The facility representative reported the llamas’
hooves are trimmed when they are sheared annually to avoid immobilizing and sedating them more than once.
They also stated the zebu’s hoof trimming was postponed due to recent inclement weather.
Overgrown hooves can lead to deformities in the bones of the feet as they can alter the conformation of the toes,
causing the toes to turn inappropriately. This can lead to pain and potential lameness. All animals needing feet
trimming should have their hooves trimmed in a timely manner, and as frequently as necessary for foot health.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The shelters for the zebu cattle and peccaries were excessively soiled and muddy. Although the recent occurrence
of heavy rainfall increased the amount of water exposure for both enclosures, there were no dry areas available for
any of the animals within the entire enclosure. Furthermore, the area directly under the shelter did not provide any
dry space from the inclement weather. There was only standing water and mud.
Animals that do not have access to any dry ground can cause discomfort, especially during inclement weather.
Shelters should be able to provide them with a dry area to avoid the elements. Animals kept outdoors shall be
afforded protection and preventative measures from discomfort of local climatic conditions.
