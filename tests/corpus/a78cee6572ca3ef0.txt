Sanitation.
In the enclosure housing 32 alpaca, the only shelter structure available has an accumulation of feces that covers
approximately half of the floor space.
Accumulation of excreta attracts pests and increases the likelihood of disease for the animals. Excreta must be removed
as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors.
To be corrected by 9 August 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
