FEEDING.
Food receptacles must minimize food contamination to help ensure food is kept wholesome. Feed pans must be
able to be cleaned and sanitized in accordance with the Animal Welfare Regulations. At least two feed pans are
cracked/broken and in need of repairs. These food receptacles have broken edges that cannot be cleaned and
sanitized properly and also need to be firmly attached to help ensure food is protected from outside elements that
could contaminate food. The breeder must repair, re-attach, and/or replace these feeders. The breeder needs to
put in place a good maintenance program that closely monitors all dog feeders for repairs and/or replace them when
needed. Correct by 11-05-2015.
