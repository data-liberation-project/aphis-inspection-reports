ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The current written program of veterinary care (PVC) does not include the guinea pigs. The PVC should include all
the covered animals to ensure the facility has a written guide to follow, approved by the attending veterinarian,
concerning the health and care of the animals. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure the PVC
reflects the current inventory of covered animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are multiple feed bunks in the goat enclosure which have an excessive amount of rust, including one feeder
that is in disrepair. A portion of the feeder has worn through; resulting in an opening that has sharp edges.
In a goat barn, a back wall of one feed bunk for sheep has a few sharp screws protruding through it in a location
that can injure an animal during feeding.
The outdoor shelter referred to as Goat Quarantine has a portion of corrugated, metal fence panel which has
separated from an adjacent panel. The edge of the panel appears sharp and the resulting opening is large enough
for a goat to get its muzzle through.
The outdoor housing facilities, including its furnishings, should be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury. A system should be in place to ensure animal housing facilities are
maintained as required.

WATERING.
In the goat pens, the overlying surface coats of several water receptacles are peeling off and the resulting surface ismoderately rusty. The presence of rust can prevent the required cleaning and sanitizing.
A system should be in place to ensure all water receptacles are maintained in a manner that allows them to be kept
clean and sanitary.
