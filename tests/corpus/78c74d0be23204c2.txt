2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The female capuchin monkey named Molly has an open wound on the
underside of the tip of her tail that is about an inch long. The wound appears deep and is a dark pink/red color. No
bleeding was observed from the site at the time of the inspection. Molly appeared alert and active. She is housed
with a male capuchin. The tail lesion on Molly was difficult to observe because she would rap her tail around her
body so the underside was not visible. The wound may reach the depth of the bone and could become infected.
Molly has not been seen or treated by the attending veterinarian for her current condition. Once the APHIS official
identified the condition of Molly, the animal caretaker made an appointment for today to bring her to the attending
veterinarian for the small animals. Correct by having Molly seen by the attending veterinarian and following the
recommendations of the veterinarian. Correct by January 29, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the animal caretaker.
