3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The following items need repair:

1. There is a large hole in the roof of the bison and elk building which was caused by a fallen tree. A dangling section of
plywood, with attached shingles, is present above the last stall which houses a bison. The dangling plywood could detach
and cause injury to the bison while it is present in the stall. The hole leaves the roof subject to further deterioration. The
roof should be repaired to maintain the structural strength of the roof and to protect the bison from injury.


2. The ceiling of the Brocket deer shelter has peeling paint along the front wall as well as in the center of the stall. Brown
water stains are also present which could be indicative of a roof leak. Peeling paint could fall to the floor and be ingested
by the deer. The cause of the leak and the damaged ceilings should be repaired to eliminate peeling paint and to
maintain the facility in good repair.


TO BE CORRECTED BY: SEPTEMBER 6, 2021
