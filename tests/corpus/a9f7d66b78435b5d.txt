FEEDING.
The ceiling of the food storage and preparation room is in disrepair, the room is dusty, and contains a large
accumulation of cobwebs.
One section of insulation directly above the food prep area is missing the paper covering while an adjacent section
has come partially detached and is hanging from the rafter. Numerous cobwebs are present on the walls, ceiling,
and on, and around objects in the room. Unopened bags of pelleted animal food in a closed plastic bin are dusty
and cobwebs and a live spider are present in the bin.
Food in this environment may be contaminated by dirt, particles of insulation, and insects. Contaminated food may
be less palatable to the animals and detrimental to their health. The licensee should ensure that the food
storage/preparation room is kept clean and in good repair to ensure that animal food is wholesome, palatable, and
free from contamination.
