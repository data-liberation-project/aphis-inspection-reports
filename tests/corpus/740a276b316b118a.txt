2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On May 25, 2021 the licensee purchased and transported a male and female bobcat kitten that were 4 weeks (28 days) of
age or younger. Records show the 2 bobcat kittens were born on May 01, 2021 and were only 25 days old when they
were transported. Nondomestic cats of this age range are not able to thermoregulate and lack a fully functioning immune
system to fight off disease and infection. Transporting young kittens 4 weeks (28 days) of age or younger puts them at
risk for illness or death. Nondomestic cats must be protected by not transporting kittens that are 4 weeks (28 days) or
younger in age.

Correct from this day forward

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
