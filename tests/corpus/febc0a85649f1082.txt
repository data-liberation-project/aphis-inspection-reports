Notification of change of operation.
Upon arrival at the facility, the inspector was not able to contact anyone at the site. Contact was made with an off-site
facility representative, and the inspector was informed that this site was no longer operating under their business. The
ownership and operation of this site had been transferred to a different company approximately three months prior. No
notification of change of operation was given to the USDA.
The ability of USDA to ensure the welfare of animals protected under the Animal Welfare Act is dependent on having
accurate information regarding business name, address, ownership, and operations. A registrant shall notify the Deputy
Administrator by certified mail of any change in the name, address, or ownership, or other change in operations affecting
its status as an exhibitor, carrier, or intermediate handler, within 10 days after making such change.
To be corrected immediately.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted by phone with a facility representative.
