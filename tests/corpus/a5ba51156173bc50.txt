Facilities, general.
The guest walkway path that leads up the hill between the Visayan warty pig and Emu enclosure has paint that is peeling
away in large pieces and strips. Several of the paint chips were seen in the pig enclosure and staff reported that this has
been a documented issue and a concern. Paint falling into the enclosure can be an ingestion hazard to the animals,
especially pig species that root in the ground and consume items off the ground. This needs to be addressed to prevent
paint chips from falling into the enclosure.
3.126(d)

Facilities, indoor.
The facility has several shelter structures and an indoor zebra barn that are prone to flooding and have inadequate
drainage. The day prior to the inspection, the facility and area experienced a significant thunderstorm and rain fall.
According to facility staff, the areas that flooded included the Zebra barn, Cavy barn and Jacob’s sheep shelter. The
flooding of these areas was extreme and led to inches of standing water in the shelters/barns. Due to the heavy flooding,
there were no places available for the animals to remain dry.

During the scheduled RL inspection process there was still a water line around the zebra barn, evidence of the recent
flooding, and the 2-month-old zebra filly had wet, dirty fur along her legs, belly and back.


The Jacob sheep shelter has a section of the back wall that is caved into the shelter from recent storms causing soil and
rock to push into the shelter. The salt and mineral block in this area was visibly soaked from high water levels, which left
the supplements contaminated by the waste of other animal enclosures from water flowing down hill into the sheep
enclosure.

The area where the facility is located is expected to have thunderstorms and rain for the next several days with the
temperatures falling into 40’s at night, according to weather reports. There is an extreme likelihood for the animals to get
wet from these flooded shelters and be in cold temperatures. Animals are likely to suffer from cold stress or illness
especially in young, immature animals like the zebra filly when she is wet.
The facility must be able to eliminate excess water effectively and rapidly to all animals to stay dry for their health,
comfort, and protection.
3.127(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
Several enclosures at the facility do not provide adequate shelter from the elements. The Jacob sheep enclosure, zebra
enclosure, and cavy enclosure have been affected by recent rain and thunderstorms, causing their barns and shelters to
become flooded, leaving no dry area for animals to stand and escape the elements. This has left their enclosures with no
suitable shelter providing protection from the elements, as the floors become covered with several inches of water during
a storm.

Animals that have no shelter from the elements are exposed to environmental stressors which can lead to illness or injury,
especially in young, immature, or old animals.


The facility must provide all animals with adequate shelter from the elements.

This is a 2nd Re-License Inspection for a Class C license.

The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the applicant.

The applicant is not currently in compliance with the AWA as documented above.

Your existing license will expire and a new license will not be issued. Conducting regulated activities without a valid USDA
license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
