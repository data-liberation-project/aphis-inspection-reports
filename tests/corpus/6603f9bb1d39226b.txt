2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
During the inspection dated 4/20/2017, the Licensee provided 20 certificates from breeders that were not USDA
licensed. These certificates were the only acquisition documentations that the facility provided for the animals
acquired from the unlicensed breeders. These certificates were missing valuable acquisition information required
by regulation such as but not limited to; the vehicle license number and State, and the driver's license number (or
photographic identification card for nondrivers issued by a State) and State of the person, if he or she is not licensed
or registered under the Act and he method of transportation including the name of the initial carrier or intermediate
handler or, if a privately owned vehicle is used to transport a dog or cat, the name of the owner of the privately
owned vehicle. The dog specific information was also missing from the certificate such as but not limited to; the
breed or type, the sex; the date of birth and the color and any distinctive markings. The dog specific information
was recorded on the facilities APHIS Form 7005 (Record of Animals On Hand), but not provided on the acquisition
documents as required by regulation. With the information provided on the acquisition records, there is no way to
correctly identify any specific animal information or identification of the animals acquired for accountability purposes.
This facility needs to ensure that all Acquisition forms are filled out with all the required information listed above. In
addition, the facility needs to have a method for properly identifying and accounting for all animals acquired from
unlicensed breeders.
This was a focused inspection for the review of the Acquisition and Disposition records that were collected on the
routine inspection dated 4/20/2017.
The records were reviewed from 4/20/2017 to 6/15/2017.
The Exit interview was conducted with the Licensee on 8/11/2017 due to the availability of the Licensee.Additional Inspectors
