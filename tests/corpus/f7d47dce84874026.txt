ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dog with USDA tag #81 (Yorkie Female) was observed to have her chain embedded in her skin. This has caused a
large open wound on the dogs neck. There were areas around the wound with a heavy accumulation of dark dried
blood. Chains that become embedded into skin cause the dog pain and discomfort. The Licensee was able to
remove the chain and administer Purishield to the dogs wound during the inspection. However; this dog must be
examined by a licensed veterinarian. Documentation of the examination, diagnosis and treatment plan must be
maintained by the Licensee and be made available for inspection by APHIS Officials.
