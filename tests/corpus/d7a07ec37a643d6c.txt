3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
One fawn fallow deer located outdoors near the enclosure housing raccoons does not have access to shelter. Not
having access to shelter does not ensure the animal is protected from inclement weather. The licensee must ensure
all animals have access to natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species
housed outdoors.

3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
An outdoor enclosure containing a male water buffalo, at least five goats and two fallow deer has standing water
puddles on the east side surrounding the food and water receptacles. In order to access the food and water
receptacles the hoofstock has to walk through the mud and water puddles. Muddy ground and standing puddles of
water can cause the animals to become wet and soiled, which could have a negative impact on their health and
well-being. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water.
