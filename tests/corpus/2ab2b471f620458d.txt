Contingency planning.
The facility has started writing a contingency plan but has not yet completed the plan. The plan as currently written does
not outline the tasks required to be carried out in response to identified emergencies/disasters. Tasks to address in the
plan include details such as steps to take to address the emergency, instructions for evacuation/moving animals or
sheltering in place, and for addressing animal needs such as food/water, sanitation, ventilation, heating/cooler (especially
for temperature sensitive species). A written detailed plan is necessary to prepare to address emergencies/disasters that
may be most likely to be experienced. Correct by ensuring the written contingency plan includes an outline of the specific
tasks required to be carried out in response to the identified emergencies/disasters. Correct by 10/15/22.
