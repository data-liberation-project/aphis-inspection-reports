FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One approximately 1 year old (approximate age) juvenile black bear escaped its enclosure on June 25, 2016. This
bear was able to access the public viewing area and was out of the enclosure for approximately 15-20 minutes
before being successfully darted and returned to an appropriate holding area. The primary enclosure includes an
area of fencing at the front which consists of 9 feet of vertical chain-link with a 5.5 foot angled kick-in (total height is
12.5 feet). There is a single strand of electrified wire at the top of the angled kick-in portion and another at the
junction of the vertical fence and kick-in. Additionally, there is a public viewing area that has a solid clear acrylic
window and a sloped roof.
On Wednesday, June 22, 2016 two juvenile black bears were introduced to a new enclosure. The enclosure
contains several tall trees. Many of these trees were wrapped with hot wire strands that were designed to look like
vines. However; according to the Vice President of Animal Care, the hot wire did not deter the bears from climbing
the trees on this date. In response the zoo removed the cubs from the enclosure and added additional strands of
hot grass at the bottom of the trees. The bears were re-introduced to the enclosure on Thursday, June 23, 2016
and again crossed the hot wire and climbed up the trees. The zoo staff then decided to close the enclosure on
Friday, June 24, 2016 and again added additional hot wire stands and hot grass around the trees in an attempt to
deter the bears from climbing up the trees.

On Saturday, June 25, 2016 the bears were again introduced to the enclosure. One keeper was posted on the
public viewing side of the enclosure to watch the cubs interactions with the enclosure. At approximately 11:15am
the keeper noticed the 1 year (approximate age) female back bear named Joanie scaling her enclosure fence next
to a public viewing area. The keeper tried to deter her from climbing the fence by verbally telling her to get down
and by shaking the fence. However; the keeper's efforts did not deter her from continuing up the enclosure fencing.
The bear managed to climb up the 9 feet chain link vertical of the enclosure. The keeper stated that she vocalized
as she crossed a hot wire stand at the top of the vertical fencing and continued to navigate up the 5 feet 5 inch
kick-in. She then crossed an additional strand of hot wire located at the top of the kick-in and onto the roof of the
public viewing area. The keeper stated that once the bear was on the roof, she walked onto the kick in and
appeared as though she wanted to get back into the enclosure. Ultimately the bear climbed down the public side of
the fence and onto the ground. The keeper stated he immediately notified zoo staff and that the zoo began visitorevacuation procedures before the bear made it to the ground. According to the keeper, approximately 100
members of the public were still in the area when the bear got to the ground at which point the keeper attempted to
remain between the bear and public until additional zoo staff arrived to evacuate the area. While evacuating the
public, the bear was corralled by keepers towards a back holding area at which point the bear scaled the fencing of
the holding enclosures and ended up on the top of the bear building (out of view of the keepers). A few seconds
later keepers located her on the back side of the bear building and next to the wolverine holding area. By this time
additional zoo staff had responded to the area and were able to guide her into the public viewing area for the
wolverines where she was contained until the Zoo Veterinarian arrived (at 11:34 AM) to sedate the bear. The
animal was fully sedated within 13 minutes and was immediately transported to the veterinarian clinic on site for
examination and recovery.
After the escape of Joanie, the second juvenile bear, Stevie, was still located within the enclosure. One of the
keepers attempted unsuccessfully to recall the second juvenile female black bear into the back holding area. Zoo
staff decided to sedate Stevie and move her into the back holding area. The Staff Veterinarian darted her at about
12:30. The animal was fully sedated within 15 minutes and was moved into the back holding area and was injected
with a reversal medication. No further examination or testing was recorded for this animal on this day. However; a
second injection of reversal medication was administered by the Staff Veterinarian on Sunday, June 26, 2016. Both
juvenile bears are currently being housed in the back holding area until the zoo can re-access the enclosure.
The Senior Vice President of Animal Care stated that this enclosure has previously contained an adult black bear
without incident. It has also contained two adult brown bears. He stated that they had completed some upgrades to
the enclosure and increased the kick-in height since the previous animals were housed in this enclosure. However;
the zoo had never had any issues with this enclose or had an escape from this enclosure in the past.
Although this enclosure had previously contained other animals in the past, this enclosure failed to adequately
contain this animal. Failure to adequately contain dangerous animals risks both the welfare of the animal and safety
of the public. Correct by ensuring that every enclosure is designed and constructed in a manner that is structurally
sound, and maintained to protect and contain the animals
Correct By: Prior to replacing this animal back into this exhibit.
This was a focused inspection to evaluate the incident involving escape of a juvenile black bear. Primary
enclosures, handling, and veterinary care surrounding this incident were evaluated during this inspection.
Inspection was conducted with the Vice President of Animal Care, staff members and Animal Care Inspector
Shannon Sebera.
The Exit interview was with the Senior Vice President of Animal Care and Conservation, Vice President of Animal
Care and Animal Care Inspector Shannon Sebera.
