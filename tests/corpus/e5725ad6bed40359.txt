Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary Care or
consultation with the attending veterinarian. A tri-color adult guinea pig in the "hospital pen" was exhibiting lameness in
the rear limbs. The rear limbs were extended behind the guinea pig and it appeared unable to support its weight. When
the guinea pig walked, it used the front legs to pull itself forward and the rear legs were dragging. The licensee had
observed the condition in this animal had been going on for approximately one month but had been getting worse. The
hospital pen was being treated with an antibiotic. The Program of Veterinary Care on file specified the antibiotic to be
used for respiratory or lymph node infections but not lameness. The veterinary clinic was contacted and stated the
attending veterinarian for this facility no longer worked there and they were unsure if the facility was still a client. They
stated that the facility was not treating this guinea pig according to their protocols.
Lameness with inability to use the rear limbs can cause pain and distress and can worsen if not addressed quickly.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate
plan for diagnosis and treatment.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
