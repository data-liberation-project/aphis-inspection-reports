A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:45 pm on
28-MAY-19.
This inspector visited the site's address on record, and the premises were found to be empty/vacated. The site's
general manager was contacted by calling the facility's telephone on file. The general manager stated the facility
had relocated to a new address in Parkland, FL. The new site under the licensee's current certificate must be
added, inspected and approved before USDA regulated activities are conducted at the site.
