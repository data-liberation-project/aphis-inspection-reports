2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Prior to the physical inspection, while sitting at the kitchen table completing the animals on hand count the licensee
stated that a certain dog, Gina with microchip id 1095395, needed to be removed from the count. I asked what
happened to Gina and the licensee stated that when she returned home at 5 PM the night before she found 5 of her
female, Golden Retrievers running loose. The 5 dogs were Georgia id 1095396, Ashley id 1095388, Amber id
1095385, Sondra id 1095394 and Gina id 1095395. The licensee stated that Gina id 1095395 had numerous
puncture wounds, had lost a lot of blood and it looked like the other dogs had shaken her multiple times. The
licensee put dogs Georgia, Ashley, Amber and Sondra in enclosures and went back to Gina. The licensee tried to
coax Gina to the heated barn and Gina collapsed. The licensee got Gina up again and she collapsed again and
could not get up. The licensee had to wait until the neighbor got home, the licensee stated 15-20 minutes, to carry
Gina to the barn. At that time the licensee covered Gina with towels and gave her an injection of penicillin. The
licensee went back to the barn the next morning at approximately 8:30 AM and found Gina dead. The licensee then
called the attending veterinarian at 8:47 AM. The licensee stated to me that she was following the protocol set forth
by her attending veterinarian. I asked to see the protocol to which she was referring. The licensee provided a
protocol that the veterinarian had established for "mild skin abrasions or superficial wounds". The licensee stated
she didn't understand what that meant and thought she could treat the dog on her own.
Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, diagnose and treat injuries with provisions made for emergencies.
The license must take all animals that are in need of veterinary care to a veterinarian for appropriate diagnosis,
prognosis and treatment. If the licensee does not understand the terminology used in the Program of Veterinary
Care, such as “mild skin abrasions or superficial wounds”, it is the responsibility of the licensee to ask for
clarification from the attending veterinarian so that they have a good understanding of the terms. Because the
licensee did not follow the veterinary care guidelines this dog suffered from serious injuries. This dog suffered and
died because it did not get immediate veterinary treatment for serious injuries.
To be corrected from this day forward.3.1(a) CRITICAL
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee had 5, female, Golden Retrievers escape from their enclosures. Georgia with id 1095396 squeezed
under a gap at the bottom of her fence. Ashley with id 1095388 dug out of her enclosure. The chain holding the
entrance gate closed for the enclosure housing Amber with id 1095385 and Gina with id 1095395 was broken and
Sondra with id 1095394 somehow climbed out of her enclosure.
Primary enclosures for dogs must be constructed so that they are structurally sound and must contain the dogs
securely.
If these dogs had been secured in their enclosures it would have prevented the needless suffering and death of the
dog Gina.
To be corrected by November 23, 2017.
The focused inspection was conducted with the licensee on November 15, 2017. The exit was conducted with the
licensee on November 22, 2017.
