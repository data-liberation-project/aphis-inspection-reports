2.126(a)(2)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The written program of veterinary care was not available for review at time of inspection. Review of records required by
the Animal Welfare Act facilitates the inspection process by allowing the inspector to determine compliance of documents
and to ensure that the established program of veterinary care is being followed for the health and well-being of the
animals. The licensee must, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to examine records required to be kept by the
Animal Welfare Act and the regulations.
