3.11(b)(3)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Currently all of the primary enclosures are being spot cleaned daily, however the sanitization of the enclosures is
inconsistent and not being done at least once every 2 weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of
brown grime of dirt and debris. There is a buildup of grime located on several metal doors into the outer runs, and
on the white runner along the plastic waffle step located in the runs. There is a buildup of dirt and grime in the
waffling of the steps that run inside the outdoor runs.
The lack of sanitization and removal of dirt and grime can provide a surface for the animals to come in contact with
bacteria or other health issues that live in that material.
The licensee must sanitize at least once every 2 weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt and
grime on any surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals, utilizing one of the methods described is this
sec 3.11 (b)(3).
