inspection.
3.26(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
When entering the room where the guinea pigs are kept there was an overwhelming odor of urine. This odorburned the the inspectors eyes and nose.
Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs shall be adequately vented to provide for the health and comfort of the
animals at all times. Such facilities shall be provided with fresh air either by means of windows, doors, vents, or air
conditioning, and shall be ventilated so as to minimize drafts, odors, and moisture condensation.
A mechanism shall be provided to vent the indoor housing for the guinea pigs to reduce odors for the health and
comfort of the guinea pigs.
3.29(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food containers had a large amount of feces mixed in with the food.
Guinea pigs shall be fed a diet free of contamination daily.
Feed the guinea pigs daily in clean food receptacles so that the food is not contaminated with feces.
3.31(a)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
There is an extreme amount of feces in 75% of the enclosures.
Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris.
Enclosures shall be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
Clean the enclosures as often as necessary to remove excreta and waste. Sanitize the enclosures a minimum of
once every two weeks and more often to reduce odor and contamination of the animals in the enclosures.
3.31(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The floor in the rooms where the guinea pigs are housed is carpeted. The carpet is covered with used bedding and
feces. Premises shall be kept clean and free of accumulations of trash.
The floors in the room where the guinea pigs are housed must be kept clean to reduce odors for the health of the
guinea pigs.
3.32 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
The licensee has previously used an employee to help with daily care and cleaning of the guinea pigs. Because of
the number of citations for basic animal care it appears the licensee is unable to care for the guinea pigs by herself.
A sufficient number of employees shall be utilized to maintain the prescribed level of husbandry practices set forth in
this subpart.
If the licensee cannot provide even basic care for the guinea pigs on hand then an employee must be hired to
ensure that the needs of the guinea pigs are being met, or the number of guinea pigs must be reduced so the
licensee can meet the basic animal care needs of her guinea pigs.
Inspection and exit conducted with the licensee.
