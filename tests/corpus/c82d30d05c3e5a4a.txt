2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has not had a designated attending veterinarian from April 3, 2017 until present. After the attending
veterinarian retired, the USDA inspector was informed that another veterinarian on staff would become the
attending veterinarian, responsible for over-seeing the facility’s program of veterinary care. That person was no
longer on site performing veterinary duties after 2/6/17. A second staff veterinarian reportedly took over as attending
veterinarian, but as of 4/3/17 that person was also no longer on site performing veterinary duties. This left the facility
with a series of intermittent relief veterinarians; seven additional veterinarians in addition to the aforementioned
former staff veterinarians have been used from 4/3/17 until present. The veterinarian who had been gone as of
2/6/17 has now been reintegrated, and stated that he is acting as attending veterinarian, but he is currently only
working two to three days per week, and he does not have a signed written program of veterinary care with the
facility. When administration was asked who has been acting as the attending veterinarian during the month of April
they provided a list showing a different veterinarian each day, with a total of nine veterinarians listed. Veterinarians
and staff members report that the veterinary department is currently understaffed, and unable to keep up with
preventive health programs. The lack of continuity creates confusion about veterinary authority and policies.
Failure to have an attending veterinarian could be detrimental to the welfare of the animals. The facility must
formally employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements in order to safeguard the welfare of the
animals. In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall
include a written program of veterinary care.
To be corrected from this time forward.
2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Veterinarians at this facility do not currently have the adequate authority to make animal welfare decisions regarding
humane euthanasia of animals.Multiple animal keepers and multiple veterinarians who have been employed at the zoo expressed a concern that
humane euthanasia for an animal that may be suffering has sometimes been delayed while awaiting final approval
from administration. Additionally, due to the recent situation where there have been multiple veterinarians filling in,
there has been confusion about the approval process.
Records involving the approval process were examined for several animals, and staff involved was interviewed, and
it was observed that even when the veterinarian, animal keeper, and curator were in agreement regarding
euthanasia, there was sometimes an hour or more delay awaiting final approval.
The Health Alert process involves a form which is used to update the director about the status of animals that are
being evaluated for Quality of Life. The form is also expected to be included with any euthanasia requests. The form
has signature lines for three people: 1.) The General Curator, Animal Division or Appropriate Designee, 2.) Chief
Vet or Appropriate Designee, and the last, listed under “Authorized”, 3.) Executive Director or Appropriate Designee.
Several forms for recently euthanized animals were examined where the “Chief Vet or Appropriate Designee” line
has been signed by a non-veterinarian who was not designated by a veterinarian.
Whereas the zoo administration should be informed and involved in the day to day decisions about the animals, the
administrative personnel must ensure that the zoo’s veterinary professionals have the authority to ensure the
welfare of the animals on site, to include timely decisions regarding euthanasia when appropriate, in order to
prevent pain and distress. The authority of the attending veterinarian should be clear, and should not be
undermined. Failure to have a clear policy regarding veterinary authority could be detrimental to the welfare of the
animals.
The facility should ensure that there is an attending veterinarian who has the appropriate authority to ensure the
provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.
To be corrected from this time forward.
This focused inspection on the issue of veterinary authority occurred on May 2 through May 4, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
