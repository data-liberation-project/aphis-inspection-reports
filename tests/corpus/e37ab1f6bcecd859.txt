2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
This is a search inspection.
The facility has bred and sold serval kittens without a valid USDA license. The facility advertised serval kittens for sale
online in November 2021 and March 2022. The facility sold a kitten that fell ill shortly after the purchase then passed away
to an out of state buyer. The owner confirmed that he has bred and sold serval kittens including the one to the out of state
buyer and that he had an application for a USDA AWA license but that he has not yet applied for a license.
A valid license is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals and to comply with the Animal Welfare Act
and Regulations.
The facility needs to obtain a USDA license or discontinue regulated activities (selling regulated species such as servals).

NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner/facility representive.
