SANITATION.
*** In the first pen closest to the house there are fence boards that have come down and are stacked in a pile inside
the enclosure. Some of the boards still have nails exposed that could be a potential hazard to the animals. These
boards need to be removed from the enclosure to keep the area clean and in good repair for the safety of the
animals.
