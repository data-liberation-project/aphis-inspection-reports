ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****There was a female Shih Tzu (microchip # 0A02570914) that was squinting and rubbing its left eye. The left eye
had a creamy yellow discharge on the fur around the eye. There was also a small build up of brown crusty-like
material in the corner of the eye near the nose. Most of the eye appeared to have an abnormal blue haze which
made it difficult to see detail within the eye. An approximately pin point sized divot was located on the center of the
eye's surface. The part of the eye which is normally white appeared reddened. According to the licensee, she had
not noticed the dog's eye until it was pointed out during the inspection, which was around 1:30pm, and she said the
dog's eye was fine last night. The dog's eye condition could be the result of injury, illness or other medical condition
which may be uncomfortable and/or could lead to blindness. The licensee must have this animal examined by a
licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. TO BE

The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Erika Leisner VMO, and Chad Proctor ACI.
