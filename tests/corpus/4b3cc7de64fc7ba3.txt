Personnel qualifications.
Four female cynomolgus macaques approximately 2 years of age were given an improper dose of a test article which
resulted in euthanasia of the animals. An IACUC approved protocol involving cynomolgus macaques called for an initial
dose of a test article to be given at 30 mg/kg and lowered to 15 mg/kg on day 15; however, on day 15 of the study, four
cynomolgus macaques were given the original 30 mg/kg dose rather than the intended reduced dose amount of 15
mg/kg. The animals were given the incorrect dose due to a technician error. The dosing error was immediately
discovered, and a veterinarian was notified. Due to the potential adverse effects of the high dose, veterinary staff elected
to euthanize the four animals to prevent unnecessary pain and discomfort. The animals were euthanized and sent to
necropsy on day 18.

Deviations from a protocol can result in unnecessary pain or death. It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure
that all personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties to preclude such
adverse events.

Correct from this time forward.


2.33(b)(1) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
One adult domestic pig had a broken limb and received inadequate veterinary care. On 21 Oct 2020 a 1-year old female
Yorkshire pig (#1111), weighing 44.57 kg, was found not bearing weight on her left hindlimb. Staff reported the animal
preferred to be in a recumbent position and was reluctant to stand. The initial veterinary exam confirmed the lameness but
found no wounds, bruising, or apparent trauma. The animal was placed on pain medication and when lameness didn’t
improve, the pain medication was increased 2 days later. On 26 Oct 2020 the animal was still non-weight bearing and
there was mild swelling of the limb; moderate inflammation above the stifle was observed 4 days later. On 4 Nov 2020, a
Computed Tomography (CT) scan revealed an "oblique fracture to the left femur with bony callus formation". It took 15
days to obtain imaging diagnostics on this animal. The pig remained on the study until it was completed and was
euthanized on 11 Nov 2020.

The research facility must maintain a program of veterinary care that provides adequate staffing, facilities, equipment, and
services to ensure proper monitoring and diagnostics of animals and immediate intervention is required to prevent a
serious animal welfare issue. Failure to provide adequate personnel and resources could negatively impact animal
welfare.

Correct from this time forward by ensuring that there is adequate staffing, facilities, equipment, and services so that all
animals utilized in study procedures are adequately diagnosed and treated.
2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.


A male cynomolgus macaque approximately 2 years of age sustained an arm fracture during nasogastric dosing of the
test article. The fracture occurred on 5 Mar 2021 while positioning the animal within the procedure cage. The employee
manually restrained the non-sedated animal by grasping the macaque by the right forearm to position the animal. The
animal struggled during the physical restraint, which resulted in a mid-diaphyseal fracture of the radius and ulna.
According to the facility, the torque applied by the employee to the animal’s limb during positioning most likely resulted in
this injury.

Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

Corrective and preventative actions have been instituted by the facility. These include modification of the procedure to
prohibit grasping of the animal’s arm below the elbow. The procedure cage has also been modified to minimize animal
risk when used for smaller nonhuman primates. And finally, the facility is providing increased oversight and a more
experienced staff to conduct dosing.

Correct from this time forward.
3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
The flooring in eight pig enclosures housing eight adult domestic pigs (1 pig per enclosure) was determined to be
structurally unsafe. The facility technicians stated they saw the metal grates (26 x 47 inches) in multiple enclosures
displaced in the mornings and repositioned the grates without reporting this as a maintenance problem. In reference to an
adult female Yorkshire pig (#1111) who sustained a broken femur, the observation log on 05 Nov 2020 for this individual


pig stated that the animal was “Laying down unwilling to get up. Possible no access to water grate was up blocking lixit.”

The facility technicians eventually verbally conveyed to the attending veterinarian on 13 Nov 2020 that some of the pigs
would lift the grate edges with their snout and lift the metal grates off the floor. The veterinary staff was not aware of the
structural deficiency in the observation log which was reported on 05 Nov 2020 and it is unknown when exactly these pigs
began displacing the metal grates in their enclosures.

Pig enclosures must be constructed and maintained to protect the health and well-being of the animals. The enclosures
must also be constructed of appropriate material and strength for the animals involved to prevent injury.

The cages that allow animals to remove the flooring have been removed from use.

To be corrected immediately.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
