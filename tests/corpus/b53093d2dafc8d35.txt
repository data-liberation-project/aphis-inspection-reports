Facilities, indoor.
The temperature in the guinea pig housing facility was 56 degrees F as measured with a kestrel. The facility's wall
thermometer read 53.2 degrees F. The facility has a wall heater but it was not turned on. Ambient outdoor temperature
at the time of inspection (approximately 10am) was approximately 39 degrees F.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may cause discomfort and
predispose them to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.

Primary enclosures.
There was an opening in the enclosure wall at the rear of pens 58 and 45 measuring approximately 5 x 3 inches. It
appeared the edges of the opening were caused by chewing and the edges of the opening were rough to the touch.
Guinea pigs in the 2 enclosures (approximately 37 guinea pigs) were observed crawling through the opening from one
enclosure to the other.
Openings between enclosures with rough edges can result in injury to the animals and chewed areas are not easily


cleaned and sanitized.
Primary enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
