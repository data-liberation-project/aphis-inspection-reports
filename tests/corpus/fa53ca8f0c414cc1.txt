3.75(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
The shelter box inside an outdoor enclosure housing an adult female Cynomolgus Macaque is not kept in good repair.
The shelter box is elevated and made of wood. There is a hole in one of the walls that has sharp edges and is big
enough for the animal to stick its hands or face. The floor has a rotting and loose wood board that can break apart. The
surfaces of housing facilities such as boxes, houses, and other furniture type fixtures or objects must be sturdily
constructed and must be strong enough to provide for the safe activity and welfare of the nonhuman primate. Any surface
that come in contact with the nonhuman primate must be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the
animal. The shelter box needs to be repaired or replaced.

Facilities, general.
The following outdoor housing facilities were found to need maintenance and/or repair:
Primary enclosure housing 3 pigs and 1 goat have portion of the fence leaning forward and loose barbed wire. At time of
inspection, the goat got entangled on the loose barbed wire but was able to free itself. No injuries were noted. In
addition, a shelter house has part of the inside wall ripped off and jagged edges.


Primary enclosure housing a white racoon has an elevated resting platform with broken wood planks and nails sticking
out.
Primary enclosure housing 4 white tail deer has a broken chain-link fence post. Several tree branches have fallen along
the top part of the fence causing it to lean forward.
Primary enclosure housing an adult north American black bear has a resting platform with a detached wood plank.
Primary enclosures housing a bobcat has rotting wood platforms.
Primary enclosure housing a skunk has a broken resting platform and nails sticking out.
Primary enclosure housing an adult female tiger (Stormy) has wooden boards that have become detached from the stairs.
Primary enclosure of an adult serval (Samson) has a bent chain-link fence post and a rotten wooden roof post. Tree
branches have fallen almost along the entire fence. These branches put extra weight on the fence and weakens the
structure.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, and gaps in order to protect the
animals from injury. Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals.
