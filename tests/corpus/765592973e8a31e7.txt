2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has changed the attending veterinarian and needs to fill out a new program of veterinary care. This is
needed because the new veterinarian may have a different program of care than the last veterinarian and this new
program needs to be documented. The facility can then follow the new attending veterinarian's requirements for
animal care.
