Veterinary care for dogs.
There are four of seven wolf hybrid dogs that have multiple mats located throughout thier hair coats that have not been
trimmed to prevent matted fur. There are mats located in different locations on each dog which include the chest, ears,
back of thighs and sides of the animals. While the matted hair does not appear to be tight or down to the skin causing
discomfort to the regulated animals, the mats are too numerous and have not been trimmed often enough to prevent the
accumulation of matted haircoats as required per the regulations.

Matted haircoats can cause discomfort to the regulated animals if the mats get too tight and down to the skin, causing
possible hotspots or skin lesions due to moisture buildup or irritation under the mats.

The licensee must provide regular preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly
trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin, and teeth in accordance with their program of veterinary care
provided by their attending veterinarian.

To be corrected by: The licensee set up a veterinary care visit for the week of October 3rd 2022 to address the matted
haircoats.
