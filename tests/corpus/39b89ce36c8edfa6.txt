The Attending Veterinarian has stated that yearly site visits shall be conducted. The site visit is now overdue and
needs to be scheduled with the Veterinarian. The Program of Veterinary Care Plan needs to be updated to reflect
the four common marmosets that are now in the inventory. The preventative plan needs to be outlined for this

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The room for the capuchin has two areas that are in need of repair. The wall to the right as you enter and the
ceiling near the caging have picked and peeling paint. The drywall under the paint is exposed so these surfaces in
contact with the nonhuman primate are no longer able to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
