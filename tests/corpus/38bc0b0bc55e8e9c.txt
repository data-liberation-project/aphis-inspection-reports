2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
On August 23, 2016 two non-compatible non-human primates (NHP) were injured after staff failed to secure and
lock a divider door that separated them. According to the facility incident report the NHPs (adult male macaques)
opened the divider and were found injured when staff returned to the room approximately 20 minutes after shifting
animals. Both NHPs received prompt veterinary treatment. One was treated for minor wounds and has since
recovered. The second had a significant injury and was promptly euthanized. The staff member involved in the
incident has been re-trained. The facility self-reported the incident to APHIS officials.
Animals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar
problems from occurring in the future.
The inspection was focused on paperwork review.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
