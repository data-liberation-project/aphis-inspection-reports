3.50(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
Two rabbit kits in different litters sustained rear limb injuries that were determined to be related to the nest boxes in use at
that time. The Attending Veterinarian determined that the injuries warranted humane euthanasia. The nest boxes in that
area were immediately removed and replaced with different boxes to prevent any possible recurrence. The incident was
self-reported to the IACUC. The IACUC thoroughly investigated and concluded that appropriate actions were taken by
the husbandry and veterinary staffs to mitigate the unanticipated incident and to prevent future occurrences. The IACUC
also recorded that these nest boxes had been in regular use for more than 12 months with no prior negative incidents.
OLAW was notified appropriately per PHS policy. OLAW concurred with the actions taken by the university.

Nest box issues can lead to increased pain, suffering or death to the young animals contained therein.

Per the regulations, indoor and outdoor housing facilities for rabbits shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair, to protect the animals from injury.

Corrected prior to inspection.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
