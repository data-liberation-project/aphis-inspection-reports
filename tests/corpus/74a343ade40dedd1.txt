The shade cloth over the asiatic bear exhibit is tattered around the edges and a portion of it has become folded
under so that it no longer provides full protection from the sun. The animals do have access to their den at all times
and can get out of the sun there, however, the temperature inside the den on the day of inspection was 3 degrees
warmer than the outside temperature. For their comfort and well being, enough shade in addition to the den space
must be provided on warm days, so that both bears can get out of the direct sunlight at the same time. Correct by

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the off-exhibit portion of the zoo, a new gate has been installed in the perimeter fence. The space under the gate
is high enough for small animals such as skunks, foxes, etc. to enter the zoo property. The purpose of the
perimeter fence is to contain the animals and to prevent unwanted animals from gaining entrance. To protect the
animals in the zoo, the gap under the gate needs to be repaired. Correct by 7/24/14
