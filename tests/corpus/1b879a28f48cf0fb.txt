Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
A protocol using cotton rats was described as not causing more than momentary pain or distress to the animals being
used. Six of thirty rats used on the protocol were found dead. One of the remaining rats had an unkept haircoat and
bloated appearance. These rats are suffering more than momentary pain and distress. This protocol should contain
provision for relief from pain and distress or an explanation of why this would not be appropriate for animals used on this
protocol. This information is necessary for the IACUC to determine that the animals are being used in a humane and
judicious manner and must also be included on the facility's annual report to the USDA.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Dog 1988 had an injury to the toe just above the nail on the most lateral digit of the left hind foot. The skin of this area
was reddened and had some dry and fresh blood on the fur surrounding this area. The dog was not lame on this foot and
was not noted to be in obvious pain. This injury was revealed to have been noted by the caretaker of this area of the
facility the day prior but had not yet been reported to the attending veterinarian. Timely and accurate reporting of animal
injuries to the attending veterinarian is required. This timely reporting can prevent injuries from worsening and causing


animal pain and distress. The animal was evaluated and treated by a veterinarian at the time of inspection. Ensure that
this and all other information on animal health, behavior and well-being is reported to the attending veterinarian in a timely
and accurate manner.
