Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
On Tuesday October 27th, 2020, at approximately 11:10am, no responsible adult was available to conduct an inspection.
I spoke with a family member that the stated the licensee was away from the house. The family member knocked on the
front door to determine if the licensee's spouse was available. There was no answer at the front door. I left my business
with the family member. Additionally, I left a voice message for a return call.
