2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During today's inspection, a male fawn and white English Bulldog, "Bravo" (Microchip #0A02625879) was observed
squinting, with clear discharge surrounding both eyes and reddening of the left eye. The facility representative
stated that she had noticed that there had been some discharge surrounding the dog's eye recently and that the
dog had previously had surgery for eye issues However, the facility has not recently treated or communicated the
recent changes to the dog's eyes with the attending veterinarian. Diseases or injuries to the eyes can be painful to
the dog and become increasingly painful if left untreated. Failure to use appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries can result in pain to the animal and potentially worsening of the condition.
The licensee must implement and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that includes methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The dog must be evaluated by a Licensed Veterinarian
for further diagnosis and treatment of its health issues.
