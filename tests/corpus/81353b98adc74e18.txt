3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A 20 foot section of the east side whelping wall is falling apart and has come unattached. If this section was to fall
on the breeders with their puppies it could cause injury to the dogs and puppies below. Housing facilities must be
designed and constructed so that it is structurally sound. The license must repair this 20 foot section and maintain it
in good repair at all times.
