2.50(a)(1) Repeat

Time and method of identification.
The facility uses a metal tag attached to a collar and placed around the dog’s neck as the official form of identification.
One dog, Ashley Wilkes #79, did not have a collar with an attached metal tag on them at the time of inspection. Official
identification is necessary for APHIS officials to positively identify animals for inspection or under treatment and to
properly trace their movements.

All live dogs shall be identified by an official tag affixed to a collar around the animal’s neck, by a legible tattoo marking
approved by the Administrator, or by a microchip placed under the dog’s skin. The licensee must place a collar with an
attached metal tag around the neck of the 9 dogs listed above or apply one of the other forms of identification. The
licensee must ensure that all dogs have an official form of identification at all times.

*There are 6 litters of puppies, 15 total puppies, (Dams: Romi Belle #65, Paris #66, Poppy #108, Shelby #109, Taylor #77,
Josie #104) without an approved form of acquisition information. The facility is currently using a book to document the
acquisition information for any puppies that are born on the premise. The book the facility is using is not an approved form
of documentation for the puppies and is missing information that is required under this subpart. Acquisition information is

necessary for APHIS officials to make positive identification of animals during inspection or that are under treatment and
to properly trace their movements.

The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain an approved method of documentation which fully and correctly disclose all
information concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or
under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records
shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. The licensee must
record the acquisition information on an approved document for all puppies. The licensee must ensure all required
information is properly and accurately documented at all times.

*The facility is missing the Record of Disposition of Dog (APHIS Form 7006) for at least 9 dogs; Shari #127, Pinky #128,
Johnny #129, Ringo #130, Dixie #132, Itsy #125, Cole #124, Ebony #122, Char #121. The facility put on the Record of
Acquisition the first name of the person to whom the dogs were sold but this does not fulfill the requirement to fill out a
Record of Disposition (APHIS Form 7006) for each dog that is sold, exchanged/transferred or donated. Accurate and up
to date disposition records are necessary to identify animals still present at the facility and to trace their movements after
leaving the facility.

The licensee must create disposition forms (APHIS Form 7006) for the dogs listed above that includes the following; the
name and address of the person to whom the dog was sold or donated to, that person’s USDA license or registration if
they are licensed under the Act, the date the dog was disposed of, the method of disposition (sale or donation), the official
USDA tag number of the animal, a description of the animal (species, sex, date of birth, color or distinctive marking), the

method of transportation including the name of the initial carrier or intermediate handler or the name of the owner of the
privately owned vehicle used to transport the animal.
2.75(a)(1)(vi)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Two dogs had different official identification numbers on their puppy records, Record of Acquisition and Record of
Disposition. Both dogs were born to dam “Johnna” #96 on 9-November-2021. There was a female Yorkshire Terrier listed
as #31 on puppy records and a female Yorkshire Terrier listed as #32 on puppy records. On the Record of Acquisition,
#31 female Yorkshire Terrier was listed as “Pixie #131” and #32 female Yorkshire Terrier was listed as “Dixie #132”. Only
“Dixie #132” had a completed Record of Disposition, where her official identification number was 2021-96#32. Failure to
document the proper identification number on required documents interferes with APHIS officials’ ability to identify
animals and trace their movements.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records that fully disclose the official identification number of each animal.
The licensee must ensure that the correct official identification number is recorded on all required paperwork for each dog.

To be corrected by 6-June-2022.
2.75(a)(1)(ix) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005) is missing the disposition date for 9 dogs; Shari
#127, Pinky #128, Johnny #129, Ringo #130, Dixie #132, Itsy #125, Cole #124, Ebony #122, Char #121. Incomplete
acquisition and disposition records may interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to accurately inventory the animals,
identify individual dogs and to track their movements.


Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain records or forms that fully and correctly disclose the date each dog was
disposed. The licensee must add the disposition dates to APHIS Form 7005 and always maintain all required information
at all times.
2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
Upon reviewing the facility’s Record of Acquisition of Dogs on Hand, a toy poodle “Summer” #123 (date of birth 03-
September-2021), was marked as passed away on 19-February-2022. When inspectors inquired about her death, the
licensee stated she had passed away while they were out of the facility for approximately ~2 hours. They assume she was
attacked by the other dogs. They stated they normally put the puppies and “teens” (they state this is their definition of a
dog 4 months to 1 year of age) away into enclosures when they leave the facility. This is to avoid any incompatibility
issues while they are away, approximately 8-10 adults are left out while they are away. “Summer” would have been
considered a “teen” and by their protocol should have been placed into an enclosure before leaving the facility. They
thought “Summer” was in an enclosure or assumed she was hiding in a safe place when they left, they cannot remember
where she was when they left the facility. Upon returning to the facility, Summer was found dead, her body stiff, in the
main room under a table with no visible injuries but was “wet”. The licensee believes this was from the other dogs drooling
on her. The facility took her to the veterinarian for cremation, no necropsy was performed.
Summer may have had severe distress, trauma and physical harm before her eventual death. Handling of all animals
must be done in a manner that cannot lead to an animal’s death and must prevent trauma, behavioral stress, physical
harm or unnecessary discomfort. The licensee must take additional precautions to ensure a traumatic death does not
happen in the future.


To be corrected: From this day forward.
3.1(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The facility houses some dogs in wire crates and two enclosures, one containing one adult dog and another enclosure
containing one adult and four puppies, has clutter on top of the enclosures. The clutter on the wire crate housing the
single adult dog consisted of blankets, a room air freshener and various plastic objects. The clutter on top of the
enclosure housing an adult dog and her four puppies consisted of a box containing some books and blankets. Clutter
stored on top of the enclosures could impact the movement of air, as well as become too heavy and cause the top of the
enclosure to collapse potentially injuring an animal.

Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter. The licensee must remove the clutter from
the top of the enclosure. The licensee must ensure that all housing areas remain free from clutter at all times.
3.1(c)(2) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
There are two corners of trim in the designated feeding area that have been heavily chewed on by the dogs and cannot
be readily cleaned and sanitized. There is medium to dark brown residue present on these chewed surfaces. Surfaces
that are not able to be cleaned or sanitized may lead to the spread of disease hazards to the dogs.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities—including furniture type fixtures and
objects within the facility—that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced or repaired when worn or
soiled. These surfaces must be repaired or replaced so they can be cleaned and sanitized.

3.1(c)(3) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The facility is not cleaning and sanitizing all hard surfaces the dogs come into contact with in accordance to 3.11(b) of this
subpart. The licensee will allow the dogs to walk through the food storage room into their outdoor yard. There is a
moderate to excessive accumulation of brown residue consisting of dust, dirt, excreta and food waste covering the entire
floor surface in the food storage room. The insufficient cleaning of the designated food area does not allow the dogs to
walk into this room without walking in a moderate accumulation of dust, dirt, excreta residue, food waste and/or other
organic debris.

All hard surfaces for which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized every two weeks or as
often as necessary in accordance with 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent the accumulation of dust, dirt, excreta residue
and food waste in order to assist in reducing disease hazards within the facility. The facility must adopt a spot-cleaning
cleaning daily and a sanitizing schedule that prevents an accumulation of dust, dirt, excreta residue and food waste and is
done at a minimum of every 2 weeks.
3.1(e) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The plastic bin containing dog food did not have a cover on it. The cover was hanging at the back of the bin and was not
on top of the bin at the time of inspection. Open food could become contaminated by pests such as flies or mice which
may have a negative impact on the health of the dogs. All open supplies of food must be kept in leakproof containers with
a tightly fitting lid to prevent contamination and spoilage. The lid was placed on top of the food container and sealed
during the time of inspection.
3.4(c)

Outdoor housing facilities.

The steps leading from the sunporch to the outside exercise yard is trimmed in painted wood. The paint has been worn
and scratched away leaving a rough, wooden surface. This surface is no longer impervious to moisture.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis so that they may be readily cleaned and sanitized to prevent odors,
diseases, insects, pests, and vermin. The facility must maintain all surfaces and ensure they are kept impervious to
moisture.

To be corrected by: 16-June-2022.
3.7(c)

Compatible grouping.
There is one wire playpen enclosure on the ground containing a dam, Shelby #109 and her two puppies (11 weeks old).
The inspectors witnessed another small long-haired white and tan dog over 4 months of age jump into the enclosure, stay
for a few minutes and then jumped out of the enclosure. Housing puppies with adult dogs that are not their dam or foster
dam may result in injuries due to compatibility problems.

Puppies under 4 months of age or less may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs other than their
dams or foster dams. The licensee must ensure the puppies listed above are only housed with their dam, foster dam or
other puppies under 4 months of age at all times.

To be corrected: From this day forward.
3.8 Repeat

Exercise for dogs.

At least 3 exercise plans were found at the time of inspection from various past dates. Two of which the licensee states
they are following and after a conversation with the inspector determined the facility was not following either exercise plan
accordingly. One exercise plan signed by the Attending Veterinarian dated 5-November-2021 states they will feed their
“heavier” dogs “science diet lite” dog food. Inspectors asked if they had any heavier dogs, the facility representative
showed us 4 dogs that meet their standards as heavier. None of which are being fed “Science Diet Lite” dog food. The
second exercise plan (APHIS form 7013) was also signed 5-November-2021 by the Attending Veterinarian, this states all
dogs over 12 weeks of age (except dams with litters) are housed individually in an enclosure that provides at least two
times the amount of floor space required for each dog. One enclosure was housing two adult dogs at the time of
inspection, which does not follow this exercise plan. Not following the approved exercise plan does not guarantee the
dogs are provided the appropriate opportunity for exercise.

Dealers must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. The
facility must follow the existing exercise plans or create a new exercise plan that is approved by the Attending
Veterinarian that accurately depicts what forms of exercise are provided to each dog over 12 weeks of age.
3.13(a)(3) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
*At least 14 adult dogs and 5 puppies have been due for their vaccines according to the schedule on the licensee’s
Program of Veterinary Care. The APHIS inspector called the licensee’s veterinary clinic to confirm which dogs were due
for their vaccines due to lack of medical records available for inspection. The licensee was unaware these dogs needed
their vaccines at the time of inspection. The Program of Veterinary Care states dogs will be vaccinated for Parvovirus and
Distemper at 6-7 weeks, 10 weeks and annually. Rabies is to be given at 3 months, annually and then every 3 years after.
The licensee currently has the veterinarian give all vaccines. These dogs are due for the following vaccinations:

**Rabies: Candy #117, Taffy #118
**Distemper and Parvovirus: Oakley #87, Tobi Mac #62, Roxy #56, Shelby’s 2 puppies (11 weeks old), Romi-Belle’s 1
puppy (10 weeks) and Paris’s 2 puppies (9 weeks)
**Rabies, Distemper and Parvovirus: Shelby #109, Remington #81, Ashley Wilkes #79, Taylor #77, Baxter #112, Carmel
#116, Lexi #119 and Sampson #120.
Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian. The facility must follow the schedule for Rabies, Distemper and Parvovirus vaccines
written in the Program of Veterinary Care to protect the dogs from these contagious and/or deadly diseases. The facility
must vaccinate all dogs in need of the vaccines listed above and maintain the vaccine schedule n all dogs from this day
forward.

*The Program of Veterinary Care is still missing pertinent information on the routine for heart worm testing and fecal
sampling. There is no guidance currently provided in their program of veterinary care for the percentage or total number of
dogs to be sampled and the frequency of which they should be tested for heartworm and intestinal parasites. Sampling of
dogs for parasites is necessary to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests. The facility must
add the number of dogs to be sampled for heartworms and intestinal parasites to the Program of Veterinary Care.

*The licensee is not following the Parasite Control Program for Ectoparasites listed in the Program of Veterinary Care.
The Program of Veterinary Care states Revolution will be given monthly Spring to Fall. When talking to the licensee and

facility representative, they agreed that on the day of inspection (26-May-2022) that it is “spring”, and they should have
applied the Revolution to the dogs by this time of the year. Additionally, they have not been checking the dogs for
ectoparasites at any frequency and there is no additional information listed on the Program of Veterinary Care.
Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes the preventative treatment of ectoparasites. The facility must apply
Revolution to all dogs that can receive the medication and continue to follow their Parasite Control Program for
Ectoparasites from this day forward.
3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee has developed a Program of Veterinary Care that has been approved by the Attending Veterinarian, but it is
missing information for the preventative care and treatment plan to maintain clean and healthy ears, properly trimmed
nails, clean and healthy teeth. The licensee is not following the preventative care plan for healthy and unmatted hair and
properly trimmed nails.
**The plan for clean and healthy ears states “clean at the time of bathing. If red, scratching ears or shaking head call
veterinarian”, but does not list what ear cleaner is used,how often the cleaner should be used and how often the facility
checks for clean and healthy ears. The facility representative states, several dogs’ ears are cleaned at the groomer, but
they plan to do baths at the facility in the future.
**The plan for properly trimmed nails states “trim every 2-3 months or as needed”. The facility admits some dogs are not
done every 3 months. There is no frequency that states how often nails are checked by the facility or when a veterinarian
will be consulted.
**The plan for healthy and unmatted hair coats states “bathe every 4-6 weeks, grooming as needed” but does not state an
actual timeframe that each dog will be groomed or when a veterinarian will be consulted. Each dog is not being bathed

every 4-6 weeks, dogs are sent to the groomer for bathing and grooming at an undetermined interval.
**The plan for clean and healthy teeth states “Examine at least every 6 months and monitor more frequently if they have
history of dental disease. Call if swelling or di”. The facility needs to state when a veterinarian will be consulted.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care that is developed, documented in writing, and signed
by the attending veterinarian and includes preventative care plans to ensure healthy and un-matted hair coat, clean and
healthy ears, clean and healthy teeth and properly trimmed nails. The licensee must add to each of these plans on the
Program of Veterinary Care and follow each plan accordingly.

3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility is not keeping updated medical records of dates vaccines and medical treatments have been given to the
dogs.
**Male Poodle Tobi-Mac #62 is receiving 4 medications daily; one is once a day and the other three medications are to be
given every 12 hours. The licensee states he is receiving the medications but there is no written documentation that he
has been administered these medications at the appropriate times.
**There are no copies of medical records, including vaccines and deworming treatments for at least 7 dogs; Tucker #107,
Baxter #112, Carmel #116, Candy #117, Taffy #118, Lexie #119 and Sampson #120.
**There are no records available for the deworming of 3 litters of puppies (5 total puppies): Shelby #109 litter of 2 born 6-
March-2022, Romi-Belle #65 litter of 1 born 13-March-2022 and Paris #66 litter of 2 born 18-March-2022.
The lack of medical records makes it difficult to determine if the animals are receiving the medical treatments and

vaccines. This information is needed for APHIS inspectors to ensure the medical care is being provided by the licensee.
The licensee must maintain complete and updated medical records including the dates medications and vaccines were
given to each individual animal.
