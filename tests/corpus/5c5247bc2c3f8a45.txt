2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available for review at the time of inspection.
Three medications are in the lock box. Something has leaked, leaving a messy liquid coating on all the items in the
box. None of the items are labeled for use in rabbits; none have prescription labels as required for off-label use of
medications. The EnteDerm ointment expiration date is 5/17.
The medication supply must be monitored to ensure that expired medications are discarded so that they are not
inadvertently used for the animals. Expired medications may not have the potency necessary for treatment of a
medical condition. The lock box or other devices used to store medications should be kept closed and clean, and
must protect medications from adulteration that can adversely impact the animals when used.
The PVC must be completed to provide instruction to facility personnel for adequate veterinary care, and be
available for review at the time of ispection.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015, 4/12/2016, 9/6/16,
2/22/2017 and 4/5/2017.
2.126(a)(2) CRITICAL REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Records were not available to review at the time of inspection. No acquisition, disposition, Program of Veterinary
Care, or current medication records were available. Some incomplete medication records were on site.
Access to the records at the time of the inspection is necessary to evaluate the care of the animals in the facility,
and to track and reconcile all animals on the premises, and to reconcile any deceased animals with the facility
records. Maintenance of these records and access to these records for purposes of inspection is required to confirm
regulatory compliance.
3.53(a)(1) DIRECT REPEATPRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- Four of six kits of a litter in enclosure 9 in the garage room used for kindling had escaped their enclosure and were
loose in the room. A carpenter cloth mesh on the lower part of the enclosure door to prevent their escape had a gap
at one end, allowing them to push through and escape. The end of the mesh had exposed points, exposing the kits
to injury as they escaped the enclosure. The kits were all captured and returned to their enclosure at the time of
inspection.
- Several of the hanging cages are hanging at a slant; the support rods that were added since previous citations
were not in use. Uneven, bouncy flooring can cause stress to the legs and joints of the animals and otherwise cause
discomfort.
The facility was cited under this regulation previously on reports dated 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015,
4/12//2016, 9/6/2016,12/28/16, and 2/22/2017.
3.53(c)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- Three adult-sized rabbits were in a cage measuring 30 x 36 inches, or 7.5 sq. ft. The facility representative said
the scale on-site was not working properly so no animals were weighed. These adult-sized rabbits should have a
minimum of 3 sq. ft. each, or combined total of 9 sq. ft.
- Six rabbits appearing to be a mother and post-weaning-age bunnies are in a 24 x 30 inch enclosure, or 5 sq. ft.
This group should have a minimum of 10.5 sq. ft.
- Four rabbits appearing to be a mother and post-weaning-age bunnies are in a 24 x 30 inch enclosure, or 5 sq. ft.
This group should have a minimum of 7.5 sq. ft.
- Five rabbits appearing to be a mother and post-weaning-age bunnies are in a 35 x 31 inch enclosure, or 7.5 sq. ft.
This group should have a minimum of 9 sq. ft.
- Another five rabbits appearing to be a mother and post-weaning-age bunnies are in a 35 x 31 inch enclosure, or
7.5 sq. ft. This group should have a minimum of 9 sq. ft.
- Five rabbits appearing to be a mother and post-weaning-age bunnies are in a 30 x 30 inch enclosure, or 6.25 sq.
ft. This group should have a minimum of 9 sq. ft.
- Six rabbits appearing to be a mother and post-weaning-age bunnies are in a 24 x 30 inch enclosure, or 5 sq. ft.
This group should have a minimum of 10.5 sq. ft.
- Six rabbits appearing to be a mother and post-weaning-age bunnies are in a 30 x 30 inch enclosure, or 6.25 sq. ft.
This group should have a minimum of 10.5 sq. ft.
- Five rabbits appearing to be a mother and post-weaning-age bunnies are in a 24 x 30 inch enclosure, or 5 sq. ft.
This group should have a minimum of 9 sq. ft.
- Five rabbits appearing to be a mother and post-weaning-age bunnies are in a 30 x 30 inch enclosure, or 6.25 sq.
ft. This group should have a minimum of 9 sq. ft.
- Six rabbits appearing to be a mother and post-weaning-age bunnies are in a 30 x 30 inch enclosure, or 6.25 sq. ft.
This group should have a minimum of 10.5 sq. ft. Each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be provided a minimum amount of floor space according to USDA
APHIS Animal Welfare Act regulations. Housing rabbits in inappropriately-sized enclosures may stress the animals.
This housing space can lead to increased susceptibility to disease, incompatibility, and fighting. Rabbits must be
housed in enclosures with the minimum required floor space for their health and well-being.
- Cages in the garage room are 22 x 27 inches, or 4.125 sq. ft. each. The minimum floor space for these dams and
litters is 5 sq. ft.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 11/30/2015, 4/12/2016, 9/6/2016, 12/28/2016, 4/5/2017,
and 5/3/2017.
3.54(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
- Several self feeders are knocked down inside the cages. The feed inside the feeders on the cage floor is more
likely to become contaminated with urine or feces.
- enclosure containing five rabbits had a small self-feeder that was empty. The rabbits all crowded around the
feeder as the cage was approached. The facility worker added feed to the feeder, and the rabbits ate eagerly.
Care must be taken that all the animals have access to adequate amounts of uncontaminated feed each day to
ensure their health and limit spread of disease.

Previously cited 4/12/2016, 9/6/2016, 2/22/2017, and 4/5/2017.
3.55 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
Upon arriving at the facility, two primary enclosures in the kindling room each holding a doe and her litter had empty
water bottles. When filled by the facility representative, the rabbits immediately started drinking. One group was
satisfied quickly, the animals in the other group took turns at the lixit for well over 15 minutes. These rabbits were
obviously thirsty and access to water had been limited.
A sufficient amount of potable water must be provided to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.
Corrected for these rabbits at the time of the inspection. Sufficient potable water must be provided daily from this
point forward.
3.56(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
- Three rabbits in a cage by the garage have a wire floor directly over a catch tray. The catch tray is completely fullof waste so that more cannot fall through the wire mesh floor. The animals are unable to escape sitting in or moving
through their waste.
- The hanging cages have excess buildup of feces and muck underneath them.
- Several cages have excess accumulation of hair on/in them.
Sanitation issues can damage the hair coat and skin and make the animals susceptible to infection, especially
pododermatitis (foot infection). Poor sanitation also exposes these animals to bacterial growth that can be
hazardous and lower the immune system of these animals. A compromised immune system does not allow these
animals to build up the necessary antibodies to fight disease and infection. Buildup of waste also can draw flies and
other pests.
Licensee must ensure that there are adequate measures in place to remove all dust, dirt, urine, feces, excess hair,
and other organic material from all surfaces of the facility.
This is a repeat noncompliant item cited previously on reports dated 11/20/2014, 1/14/2015, 4/1/2015, 4/29/2015,
11/30/2015, and 4/12/2016, .
3.56(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
- This facility has clutter within and around the facility perimeter. The materials consist of unused wire cages, plastic
materials, wood, trash, and wire mesh. There is no organization of these materials and the majority is being kept in
unsanitary conditions and potentially contributing to disease hazards within the facility. Excessive clutter of materials
creates an ideal breeding ground for mammalian and insect pests and creates numerous hiding areas that may
conceal predators.
- There was also a moderate to large amount of dirt and evidence of urine splatter on the plastic sheeting
surrounding the outdoor rabbit enclosure area.
- The kindling room in the garage has disorganized storage of supplies and random clutter.
The licensee must ensure that that all unwanted items are properly discarded and removed from the property, and
that premises shall be kept clean in order to minimize odor and pests. Additionally, useful items must be properly
cleaned, organized and stored so that all areas of the premises, including the kindling room and storage areas, are
kept clean, in good repair, and free of the accumulation of materials in order to facilitate proper husbandry practices.
This is a repeat noncompliant item cited previously on inspection reports dated 4/1/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015,
and 4/12/2016.3.56(d)
SANITATION.
The outdoor and indoor areas have a significant number of flies. There are no fly control measures in place.
Flies and other pests can spread disease by contaminating feed and the animals themselves with fecal bacteria and
other contamination.
Adequate fly control measures must be implemented to reduce the risks posed by the infestation.
Correct by 8/25/2017.
