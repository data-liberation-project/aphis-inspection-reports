3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
In the outdoor portion of a sheltered building housing adult dogs, there were sections of coated wire mesh material that
had been cut into square-like shapes leaving exposed pointed wire ends around each side. The cut wire material was
positioned over the solid back wall in some of the enclosures. The wire ends were approximately an inch in length and
most laid flat against the solid wall, however, some were also bent into the enclosure at the dogs' level. These sharp
points can increase the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are kept free of sharp
points or edges. To be corrected by: July 2, 2022

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
