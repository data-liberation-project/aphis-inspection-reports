PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
An adult female Wheaten Terrier arrived inbound into Chicago-O’Hare from Seattle-Tacoma (AWB 006-77004756)
and was in a primary enclosure that was approximately 3 inches too short. The primary enclosure did not allow the
dog to stand or sit erect while inside. If the primary enclosure is too small, the dog is unable to comfortably assume
natural positions. All primary enclosures used to transport live dogs must be large enough for the animal to turn
about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a natural position.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
