SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
- In the round pen housing 3 adult and one 2 week old infant lemur the temperature in the indoor shelter was over
85 F. The initial temperature was 91 F taken at 1:43 PM . At 3:29 the temperature was recorded at 94F, and at 5
PM the temperature was 95.7 F. Two other sheltered primate enclosures were over 85 F at initial temperature
check. However, the facility was able to cool these two within the required 4 hour time frame.
Excessive heat in the enclosed shelter area can greatly impact the comfort and health of enclosed animals.
Primates in this situation are more likely to avoid the shelter entirely. The facility must ensure it has the means and
ability to maintain shelter temperatures between 45 and 85 F no matter the ambient temperature and weather
conditions.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The black bear enclosure had an excessive amount rust on the north side fencing panels. The licensee had
painted all of the welds in these enclosures, however, the panels are still rusted. Rusted metal cannot be properly
cleaned and sanitized, and can potentially affect the structural integrity of the enclosure. This poses a risk of
contamination to the enclosed animals, and possibly allow an animal to escape the enclosure if the structural
strength of the metal is excessively weakened.
- The porcupine enclosure has a hole that the animals have dug in the center of the enclosure that is approximately
3 feet wide and 3 to 4 feet deep. This hole has numerous boards and other debris laying in it . This entire area of
the enclosure poses a risk of injury and entrapment to the enclosed animals. The loose debris must be removed
from this hole, and the hole itself properly filled with an appropriate substance.
- The hyena enclosure has a large hole in the wall of the lockout, with loose wires and sharp points protruding into
the enclosure. This is a risk of injury or entrapment to the animal, and also makes the lockout area ineffective.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- Both den boxes in the porcupine enclosure have pools of fluid and mud on the ground in front of the doors. The
den boxes are approximately 2 foot X 3 foot in size, and the floor of the north den box is covered in water and mud.
The porcupines must cross the fluid pools in order to get into or out of the den boxes. They also have only one dry
den box available. Improper drainage systems and standing water where the animals are contained may result in
odors, spreading of diseases, insect infestation, decreased thermoregulation, and other health hazards. All pens
housing animals must have an adequate drainage system that is able to eliminate standing and excess water more
rapidly for the overall health of the animals. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water.
The method of drainage shall comply with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations relating to
pollution control or the protection of the environment.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
- At the time of the inspection there was a tiger enclosure that had a piece of raw meat sitting on top of the top wire.
Evidently, the public is allowed to feed tigers using a pole with raw meat attached to the end. However, the cooler
containing the raw meat was left in front of the tiger enclosure and a member of the public must have thrown the
meat on top of the tiger enclosure. The cooler of meat was left unattended over night without any cooling device
present to keep the meat fresh. Park policy for public feeding is an attendant is present to assist the pubic. Meat left
on top of the fencing or shadeout in the sun in a cooler without a cooling device or ice will quickly turn rancid and
become an attractant for insects, pests, and wild animals. Food not consumed must be removed from primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize
disease hazards and to reduce odors.
Correct from this point forward.
