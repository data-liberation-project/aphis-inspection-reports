2.4 Critical

Non-interference with APHIS officials.
The Inspector arrived for an unannounced inspection at 11:20 am on October 19, 2021. The licensee’s vehicle was there
but the door to the barn was closed. The inspector blew the car horn, after no response the inspector called the licensee
on his cellphone. The call was ended when the inspector saw the licensee coming around from the side of the barn. The
inspector got out of the car to meet the licensee and they proceeded into the barn. Upon entering the barn there was a
woman hosing down the floor, she informed me that she had heard the car horn and called the licensee from the back of
the barn.
The Inspector told them that it looked like they had done a lot of work since the last inspection. The inspector asked if the
licensee was ready for a walk through and he shrugged his shoulder and said yes. The very first rabbit enclosure (24 x
24 inches) had seven weaned bunnies in it. The inspector reminded the licensee that on the last inspection they had
discussed that each bunny required 1.5 sq ft of space. The licensee raised his voice and said well how many am I
supposed to have in it. The licensee yelled a profanity and asked what did the USDA expect him to do. The inspector
asked the licensee to calm down. The licensee started walking toward the back of the room and turned back toward the
inspector yelling profanities. He started slamming the cages. The inspector backed up toward the woman at the door and
said I think I will return at another time. She apologized for his behavior several times. The licensee started coming


closer and his face was very red, he was yelling saying he’d been in the business for a number of years, and he knows
what the (profanity) he’s doing and now I want to come in here and try to tell him what to do. The licensee continued
approaching waving his finger saying he was tired of USDA coming around and “you know what you can do, you can just
get the (profanity) out of here”. The Inspector stated she was leaving. The woman apologized some more. While walking
out of the door the licensee continued to follow behind yelling profanities. USDA felt threatened and harassed and
discontinued the inspection and left the property.
The licensee shall not interfere with, threaten, abuse (including verbally abuse), or harass any APHIS official in the course
of carrying out his or her duties.
To be corrected from this day forward.
3.53(c)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
The first rabbit enclosure on the left houses 7 weaned bunnies. The enclosure is 24 x 24 inches providing 4 sq ft of space
which is an insufficient amount of room for 7 bunnies. Each bunny requires a minimum of 1.5 sq ft of floor space to allow
them freedom of movement to make normal postural adjustments. Adequate space shall be provided.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
