ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On the previous two inspections (which had occurred 5 months apart from each other), the Program of Veterinary
Care that was reviewed did not address the: fennic fox, porcupines, servals, geoffrey cats, lynx, lemurs, bush baby
raccoon, fox & squirrels. This is still the case today.
The Program of Veterinary Care was still at the veterinarian for completion and has not yet been completed,
therefore it was not available for review to determine compliance if these species veterinary care have been
adequately addressed. This program of veterinary care has been at the veterinarian for (at least) 6 months now.
This Program of Veterinary Care shall be completed in a timely manner so that it can be reviewed to determine if all
of the mammals are receiving the necessary care prescribed by your veterinarian.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
On the previous two inspections (which had occurred 5 months apart from each other), the bush baby did not have
a primate enrichment plan. This is still the case today. The licensee stated that the plan is still being
reviewed/developed by the veterinarian, and therefore was not reviewed. This enrichment plan has been at theveterinarian for (at least) 6 months now. Additionally, the licensee acquired 2 juvenile marmosets. This species of
primate should also be included in the plan and address the special considerations for juvenile primates.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee has not performed any corrections in the large lion play yard since the last inspection. The enclosure
in the large lion play yard continues to be 10 feet high with a kick in, but the kick in portions cited on the last
inspection have not been corrected and are still remain unattached from its supports in several locations. They
continue to be upright. with no kick in portion in the affected areas and pose a risk of escape The height of this
enclosure in these affected areas pose a risk of escape
There has been no corrections in the tiger/lion yard since the last inspection either. In the tiger/lion enclosure the
fence is still not straight up and is wobbly & sagging in some areas. The space between each support pole is too far
apart to keep this fence in an upright position. Additionally, one of the vertical support posts for the fence has
broken off contributing to the pliability of the fence.
The clawed & splintered wood log in the cougar/leopard enclosure has also not been corrected. It continues to be
splintered with an exposed metal bolt. The cougar resting shelf also now has an exposed screw head. These
splinters, screw head, and bolt pose a risk of injury to these cats as they climb/walk &/or claw this log or surface.
The plywood on the tiger/lion yard shelter structure and the plywood in the back cougar enclosure are also now
splintered which can potentially injure these cats.

The plywood resting board in the 3 kinkajou enclosure also has had no corrections and continues to deteriorate.
When plywood deteriorates it can become soft and may not be structurally sound to support the weights of the
animals, and the resulting splinters can injure these animals as well.
The sand in the large lion play area has now eroded and has exposed the wire mesh . This wire mesh is not flat
against the sand and has gaps which can potentially injure the feet &/or legs of the cats.
The housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and contain them.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The licensee feeds a mixture of different types of meats and in varying ratios/quantities depending on availability.
The big cat diet is not standardized or uniform from day to day. The licensee stated that recently a tiger wasdiagnosed with a vitamin A deficiency.
The licensee continues to feed this non commercial diet to his cats. There is still no written, veterinarian, approved
diet plan. The written diet should specify the type, quantity, and frequency of any nutritional supplements.
Your veterinarian must approve (in writing) a feeding plan for all big cats to ensure that the cats are getting the
proper nutritional requirements (both for protein as well as vitamins & minerals) considering age, season, weight
and other considerations to prevent metabolic diseases, vitamin deficiencies, as well as other illnesses.
This is a focused inspection limited to the areas that were cited as non compliant on the previous inspection, as well
as, the inspection of the red fox and leopard.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted on-site with the licensee.
