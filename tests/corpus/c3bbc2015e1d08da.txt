ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Rex female juvenile white rabbit with no identification was observed sitting by herself squinting her eyes and
shaking. This rabbit is located inside cage 26 with 6 other rabbits that did not have water. The facility representative
put water inside of the enclosure by the request of the inspector. The other 6 rabbits went to the watering receptacle
to drink and the Rex juvenile white female rabbit sat by herself not attempting to go to the water receptacle. The
licensee put a small bowl of water in the enclosure for the juvenile white female rabbit and she drank only a small
portion before moving to the corner of the enclosure. The female rabbit sat in the corner with her head propped up
in tense position and stayed in this position for an hour in the corner. The rabbit appeared to be very sluggish and
unresponsive compared to the other rabbits. The facility representative stated that the rabbit was given to them the
day prior and were aware that the rabbit did not look right but did not contact the attending veterinarian. The
licensee must have this animal seen by a veterinarian for evaluation, diagnosis, and appropriate treatment. The
licensee must provide documentation to the inspector of the veterinarian(cid:25)s evaluation for review at the next
inspection.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was one animal identified on this inspection that was in need of veterinary care. The facility representative
had observed the signs of illness or abnormality in this animal and had not contacted the veterinarian to address
these issues. Untreated health concerns can be detrimental to the animal(cid:25)s health and well-being. The licensee
must observe all animals daily to assess their health status. The licensee must also establish a mechanism of direct
and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior and well-being is conveyed in an accurate and timely manner.

3.55 DIRECTWATERING.
There were three enclosures that contain watering receptacles that are empty; cage 13 with two adult rabbits, cage
26 with seven juvenile rabbits, and cage 27 with eight juvenile rabbits. After requesting the facility representative to
give the rabbits water, the inspectors observed the rabbits drinking profusely and consistently for 15 minutes. The
rabbits were very anxious as the licensee put the full water bottles on cages. Some of the rabbits appeared frantic
and were observed pushing other rabbits out of the way to get to the water source. Lack of drinking water can cause
discomfort and dehydration which can cause distress and disorientation. Lack of sufficient water can cause health
conditions that can be injurious or life threatening. The licensee must ensure that all rabbits have a sufficient
amount of potable water daily.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The enclosure containing the five Chinchillas has an accumulation of greenish/brown material on top of the hut.
The enclosure housing six hedgehogs has an accumulation of greenish/brown material on the exercise wheel.
Excreta shall be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained, to minimize
disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of these enclosures should be more timely and effective
to prevent the build-up of excreta.
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
This facility carries regulated and non-regulated species. This is facility continues to struggle with proper animal
husbandry practices with the limited amount of properly trained employees. There are currently 3 employees that
work at this facility. The facility representative stated that only 3 hours of each day is when all 3 employees are
present at the same time. The remainder of the business hours there are only two employees. The facility
representative stated that she and one employee do not show up until 30 minutes before the store opens and do
not have time to complete all the husbandry duties in a timely manner due to the large number of animals present atthis facility. The facility representative also stated that the owner has stopped working fulltime at this facility during
the week but continues to work part-time. With the ongoing animal husbandry and care issues this does not provide
for the health and well-being of the animals. The staffing level must be increased to include additional adequately
trained employees/volunteers or the numbers of animals shall be decreased until such point the present staff can
accommodate the needs of the animals.
