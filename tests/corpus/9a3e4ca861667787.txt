2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One fox (an entirely new species for the zoo) was added to the zoo in May 2017. This species has not been added
to the approved Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) form. Adequate veterinary care cannot be evaluated unless the
care is outlined in writing on the PVC. The prescribed veterinary care for all mammalian species present in the zoo
must be included on the facility's PVC. Correct by 1 February 2018.
3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility does not have a copy of the environmental enhancement plan available during this inspection. The
written plan allows APHIS inspectors to determine if the facility is meeting the needs of the nonhuman primates in a
manner approved by the attending veterinarian. This is particularly important with special considerations such as
with the individually housed nonhuman primate that this facility has. The licensee must have a written plan for
environmental enhancement for nonhuman primates that is approved by the attending veterinarian and made
available for APHIS inspectors upon request. To be corrected by 1 February 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
