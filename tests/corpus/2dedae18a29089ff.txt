2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a male Boston Terrier named 'Skeeter' (last 4 microchip digits 0251) with a dry, hacking, non-productive cough
but otherwise was active and with no nasal discharge. The licensee suspected irritation due to the kennel cleaning
solution and decided to switch brands; however the veterinarian was not contacted for diagnosis and treatment
recommendations.

There is a female Boston Terrier named 'Poppy' (last four microchip digits 0305) with a red swelling in the corner of the
right eye with no tearing or squinting noticed. The veterinarian has not yet been informed of this swelling at the time of the
inspection.

There is a female Boston Terrier named 'Sierra' with very mild cloudiness in the center of both eyes (left worse than right),
and redness around the eye. In the center of the cloudiness, a slight depression was visible on the surface of the eye.
There was no squinting or discharge. The licensee noticed the cloudiness and began treating the eye with ophthalmic
antibiotics, but not at the direction of the attending veterinarian.



The lack of veterinary care as directed by the attending veterinarian can cause a mild and treatable condition to become
more serious and cause unnecessary pain or discomfort to the regulated animals. Self treatment with antibiotics/drugs
without the proper diagnosis and consultation of the veterinarian can pose a serious risk for the regulated animals if the
medicine is incorrect for the problem.

Communication regarding animal health problems must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner to
ensure the proper diagnosis and treatment of the regulated animals.

To be corrected by 29 March 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
