2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Sun Bear “Emika” has patches of hairless skin. The skin is flesh colored and no drainage or lesions are
present. The bear has undergone various treatments and diagnostic tests. The attending veterinarian and the
licensee staff monitor the reoccurring condition of the animal. However, one of the recommendations from the
attending veterinarian is to provide outside access as this improved or resolved the condition in the past. Currently,
the bear is housed indoors for the winter and does not have outside access. The sun bear must be given outdoor
access as directed by the veterinarian to assist in the resolution of the patches of hair loss. The attending
veterinarian must be consulted regarding cage modifications or husbandry practices that may provide an
environment that prevents the reoccurrence of the patchy hair loss. Correct by March 20, 2017.
A visit has been scheduled with the attending veterinarian in March for further evaluation of the animal.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the director and curator.
