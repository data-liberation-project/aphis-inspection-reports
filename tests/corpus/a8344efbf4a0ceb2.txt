2.40(a)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Although some phone calls were made to the Attending Veterinarian since the last inspection on 2-4-14, the
veterinarian was unable to schedule a consult during this time frame to work on the veterinary care issues cited on
the last report. .
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Since the last inspection on 2-4-14, the Attending Veterinarian was still not consulted about the previously cited
veterinary care issue with the chimpanzees being diagnosed with whipworms last year by the veterinary technician
caretaker. During this inspection, at least 4 ibex were observed limping on their front legs. The owner states the
ibex get a hoof interdigital irritation whenever there is persistent rainy weather and then they treat the ibex with a
spray which heals the foot and stops the limping. During this inspection it had rained continuously for two days, but
no limping animals have been treated. The veterinarian has not been consulted about this recurring lameness
condition. The veterinarian must be consulted so that appropriate and adequate veterinary care is provided. For
recurring issues, veterinary approved treatment plans can be developed to provide immediate treatment to reduce
pain and treat illness/disease.
3.81(b) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Environmental Enrichment: Since the last inspection on 2-4-14, the Plan for Environmental Enhancement of
Nonhuman Primates for the facility has not been changed to add any more details for indoor enrichment. The
primates are still spending the majority of time indoors due to cold weather. Besides a radio playing at one end of
the barn, and the chimpanzees now having a television and videos being routinely played, no new enrichment
structures, devices, or toys were seen in the enclosures. It does not appear species specific environmental
enrichment is being provided. The program needs to provide more details and guidance as well as additional
species specific environmental enrichments. 3.81(c)(5)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
This facility has 3 chimpanzees, and the written Environmental Enrichment Plan was not changed since the last
inspection on 2-4-14 to describe what special considerations are given for these animals with greater cognitive
abilities. They now have a televison and videos, but there are no items specifically for the skills of chimpanzees.
The enrichment plan needs to provide more guidance on items and methods of providing enrichment to great apes
and the employees need to be trained in the needs of these primates.
Time still remains for correction on this item. Correction date 3-28-14.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A large - over a foot wide - hole is in the corner of the ceiling of the sided shelter in the enclosure currently housing
2 alpacas, and 3 juvenile animals including a watusi, bison, and Scottish Highlander. After a two day rain, the
shelter is entirely wet and muddy. Although these animals also have an open sided shelter, the nights are still cold
and the animals need the protection of a sided shelter where they can stay dry and protected from the cold winds
and rain. In the testing barn currently being used by 8 goats, apparently the roof leaks severely as there is a
puddle of water in the aisleway measuring over twenty feet long and up to three feet wide. The roofs or other
structures of these shelters need to be repaired or replaced to provide protection for the animals from rain. To be
corrected by 4-5-14.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Although measures were taken since the last inspection to aid water drainage, there are still puddles of water and
excess mud in the small pen leading to the shelter for the two elands. Whenever there are heavy rains, water runs
through this area. Methods need to be provided to keep the elands shelter access area mud free after heavy rains.
Even though recent measures were made to aid drainage, the enclosure now containing the 3 camels is excessively
muddy and has numerous areas of standing water. Suitable methods need to be provided to rapidly eliminate
excess water from both of these areas.
