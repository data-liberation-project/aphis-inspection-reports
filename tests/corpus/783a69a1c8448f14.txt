2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
* In multiple spots in the drive-thru park, farm animals approached very slow moving vehicles seeking bread which
the licensee provided customers to distribute from their cars. Llamas, elk, and buffalo were all observed sticking
their heads into vehicles to eat the bread, oftentimes when no employee was in sight. In an attempt to become
compliant after the last inspection, the licensee ensured that all roving patrol vehicles were readily identifiable with
bright, orange, blinking lights. The licensee also hired an extra employee specifically for the purpose of having
twice as many patrols occuring twice as often as compared to past years in order to monitor public feeding.
However, because the park is so large, spanning multiple acres, the roving patrols still could not observe all contact
between the farm animals and the public at all times. Close observation/supervision by employees helps prevent
people from feeding prohibited food items to the animals and it discourages the public from contacting the animals
in a harmful way. Close observation/supervision also helps ensure a quick response if an incident does occur
during the public feeding.
** The licensee must ensure that a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant is
present at all times during periods of public contact/feeding.
The inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted with facility representatives. The inspector drove through
the park solo and unannounced prior to the escorted portion of the inspection in order to determine whether or not
an employee was present at all times during public contact. In addition to the verbal exit interview on the day of
inspection, a follow-up was conducted with the licensee via phone on 20 April 2015. Due to time constraints,
paperwork (including Program of Vet Care and records of animal acquisitions/dispositions) was not checked during
this inspection.
