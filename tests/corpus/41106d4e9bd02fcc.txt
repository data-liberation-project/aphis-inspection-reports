FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(c) Drainage: The back end of the enclosure housing 7 deer born this year is excessively muddy with
large puddles of water. The water receptacle is in the back right corner. The deer have to walk through the mud
and water to get to their water. Walking through mud and water may cause problems such as foot rot. The
drainage must be improved to rapidly eliminate excess water to prevent muddy conditions to protect the health of
the animals. Correct by December 31, 2016.
Note: The attending veterinarian provided veterinary care to the female adult white-tailed deer cited on the
December 8, 2015 inspection report.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
