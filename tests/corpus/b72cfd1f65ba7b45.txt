2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
In June of 2015, an incident occurred where a guinea pig was left in a cage that had been processed through the
autoclave. According to the IACUC, cage-change procedures had been revised in 2012. The new procedures were
designed to require each cage to be visually examined to ensure no animals were left in cages. In this case, the
responsible staff member failed to follow required procedures, resulting in the death of the guinea pig. This is an
adverse event that caused the animal to experience overheating, physical harm, and unnecessary discomfort.
Correct by ensuring that handling of all animals is done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that
does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary
discomfort.
Note: The IACUC reviewed the incident and reported it to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare on 1 July 2015.
Corrective actions were taken including termination of the responsible employee and re-training of all animal and
support staff and supervisors.
Correct from this point forward.
The facility inspection was conducted on 16 September. Document review and subsequent exit interview was
conducted on 17 September with the attending veterinarian, IACUC administrator, and various facility personnel by
Scott Welch, VMO, and Kathy Campitelli, VMO.
