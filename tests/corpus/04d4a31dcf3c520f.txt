3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
There are at least 2 indoor enclosures each housing 1 adult dog where the tin siding divider wall has deteriorated creating
a rusty sharp point at the bottom of the wall.

In the outdoor exercise yard that is currently the primary enclosure for one adult dog, there is a hole cut in the metal siding
that has sharp points and a large handful of insulation has been pulled out from the hole.


There is at least 1 wood post in the outdoor portion of 4 enclosures each housing 1 adult dog that have been heavily
chewed on by the dogs.

Sharp metal points in an enclosure may result in lacerations or serious injury to the dogs. Access to insulation may result
in irritation to the skin, mouth or eyes of the dog and lead to discomfort or more serious illness if ingested. Wood posts
that have been heavily chewed on may result in an injury to the dogs' mouth and decrease the structural integrity of the
enclosure. Housing facilities must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury. The facility must
repair the enclosures so that they are kept in good repair and are safe for the dogs.

3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The facility is not removing the dog feces from the outdoor portion of the primary enclosures or the exercise yard on a
daily basis. The facility representative stated they remove feces from the outdoor enclosures weekly and not on a regular
schedule for the exercise yard. There are at least 13 outdoor enclosures, housing 16 adult dogs and 4 puppies, that have
a buildup of old and new feces. The exercise yard serves as a primary enclosure for one female dog and all dogs are
rotated into this enclosure 2-3 times per week.

There were approximately 3 days worth of feces in the outdoor enclosures, mostly pushed up against the building side.
Piles of feces are scattered across the ground in the exercise yard were a mix of fresh and old feces which appear dry
and white in color. Failure to remove feces on a daily basis could increase the risk of disease as well as cause the dogs to
become soiled. Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures daily. The facility must remove the feces from the

enclosures daily in order to support the health and well-being of the animals.

To be corrected by: From this day forward feces must be removed daily.

When dogs are present in the exercise yard, they have the ability to go below the outdoor enclosures where excreta falls
through to the ground. The female dog that is currently housed in the exercise yard was seen going under the enclosures
and laying down. Dogs exposed to an accumulation of excreta can increase the risk of disease as well as cause the dogs
to become soiled. The facility must remove the feces from under the outdoor enclosures daily or create a barrier that will
keep dogs out from under the outdoor enclosures.

3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
In the adult dog building, there is a closed tote on the ground that contained an assortment of clutter which included
grocery sacks, torn up fabric, cleaning disinfectants and oral dog supplements. Substances that are toxic to the dogs,
such as disinfectants, must not be stored in with food or supplements because it may result in contamination of those food
items and impact the dog's health and well-being.

The facility must store toxic substances that are required for normal husbandry practices in a different location away from
the food items.

3.6(a)(2)(ix)

Primary enclosures.
There were at least 3 enclosures, housing a total of 5 adult dogs and 4 puppies, that have white plastic feeding trays
mounted to the enclosure that have been heavily chewed on.

There are at least 7 enclosures each housing at least one adult dog that have metal self feeders that have rust present in
the food tray and up into the feeder.

There are at least 4 enclosures each housing one adult dog where the shift door to the outdoor portion of the enclosure
has been heavily chewed on.

Surfaces that are rusty or have been chewed on cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized to prevent disease hazards to the
dogs. The surfaces must be repaired or replaced so they are able to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
