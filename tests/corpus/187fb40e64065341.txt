ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- Several outdated medications were found in the refrigerator in the commissary building. The refrigerator was
"supposed to be locked" and was stated to only have medications for the absent licensee's dogs, therefore was not
subject to inspection according to the licensee. There were at least two medications prescribed for sloths in that
refrigerator, as well as a 25-dose package of feline vaccines. There is one bobcat at the facility and there have been
a couple domestic cats at the facility. There were several boxes of acyclovir said to be for a monkey no longer at the
facility. A bottle of Amoxi-drops is not labeled as to when it was mixed, and there is no prescription label on it.
Amoxi-drops must have a prescription from a licensed veterinarian, and it must be discarded 10 days after it is
reconstituted.
Outdated medications may not be effective, and may even become harmful. They must not be used.
- Several medications were found that were not labeled for use in the covered animals present at the facility.
Examples: Revolution is said to be used on the sloths. Gas relief drops on a shelf are labeled for humans, and are
said to be used for bloat in the sloths.
Use of medications in exotic species is difficult in that there is rarely, if ever, a medication that is labeled for them.
Limited information is available regarding dosage and potential toxicities. Off-label use of medications must be
under prescription of the attending veterinarian, with clearly written instructions.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee reviewed and updated some of the entries on the acquisition/disposition records before presenting
them for inspection. Even so, many entries were incomplete. They lacked disposition date, and whether the animal
died or was sold.
Maintaining accurate records is required of the licensee so that animals can be tracked to ensure legal and
appropriate transfer of ownership.
The licensee corrected most of the entries at the time of inspection.
Correct within 60 days, by 2/1/2016.3.84(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The indoor area of the breeding pair of howler monkeys has excess build-up of grime on inside surfaces. This grimy
coating can result in growth of disease-causing bacteria, and can result in odors that attract insects and other
vermin.
Thoroughly cleaning all surfaces at each cleaning for scent-marking species can be stressful to the animals. A
solution is to do rotational cleaning. For example, thoroughly clean half of the surfaces one week, then the other half
of the surfaces the following week. The entire shelter is then cleaned often enough to prevent problems associated
with grimy buildup without undue stress on the animals. Daily spot-cleaning to remove food and animal waste must
still be done.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a licensee.
Sue Orham, IES Investigator, accompanied this inspection.
