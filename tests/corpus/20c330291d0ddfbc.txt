ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During the time of inspection, the following medications were past the expiration date: Beuthanasia 390 mg- ml
expired 12/2016 and Atropine 100 ml bottle- expired 10/2016. These medications were intermingled with other
pharmaceuticals that are currently being used in the facility and are therefore ready for use. Researcher stated
these pharmaceuticals were used on an animal two weeks ago under an active protocol. The effectiveness of the
dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated to the animals could be drastically
changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure that all medications used are not expired in
accordance with standard veterinary practices and manufacturer's recommendations.
To be corrected from this point forward.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
