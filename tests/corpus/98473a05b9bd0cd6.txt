FEEDING.
There were approximately ten self feeders that had caked feed on the metal ridge inside the feeders. Additionally,
some of them having an accumulation of hair on the bungee cords holding the feeders to the enclosures. Food
receptacles that are not being properly cleaned and sanitized can create disease hazards for the dogs.
These food receptacles need to be properly cleaned and sanitized and a plan implemented to keep the feeders
clean.
