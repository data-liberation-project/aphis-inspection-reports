(b)(3)
***** At time of inspection a female white poodle micro chip # 485A5F6253 was observed to have hair missing along
her back and a reddened inflamed skin appearance to this area. This animal had not been discussed by the
licensee with a veterinarian to convey this health concern so that a determination by a veterinarian could be made
as to whether to bring the animal into the clinic for an evaluation.
This animal needs to be seen by a veterinarian for an evaluation of this area of concern and to determine if
treatment is needed.

3.1
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(f)
***** At time of inspection the drainage system used to remove water from the daily cleaning process and from rain
fall in the outdoor kennel area to the southeast of the whelping building was not working properly. Drainage systems
should rapidly eliminate water and animal waste.
Due to the heavy rainfall experienced in this area of Texas in the last month the ground can not absorb this liquid
fast enough to keep it from backing up and it is pooling beneath and behind the raised housing units of this kennel
area.
This drainage system needs to be corrected so that should a weather event such as this happen again this pooling
of the water will not happen which can lead to pest and insect infestation, odors and disease hazards which will
affect animal health.TO BE CORRECTED BY: 9/4/15
3.6
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a)(1)
***** At time of inspection the primary enclosures for the dogs in the outdoor kennel area farthest from the whelping
building and to the south of the whelping building is constructed of pipe and horse panel construction. This area is
covered by a metal roof which is attached to the pipe which makes up the framework for the enclosures.
The pipe and framework of the enclosures has areas of rust that if not painted or treated with a rust inhibitor will
become structurally unsound. This treatment or painting of the pipe will keep the metal structurally sound and the
enclosures in good repair.
