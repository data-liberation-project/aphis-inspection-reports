Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A white and gold female Shih Tzu, named Petunia with microchip number # 0A02592912, approximately eight years old
was found with poor dental health. The licensee noted that he had not noticed her condition. On the right side the upper
teeth behind the canine are almost completely encased in a hard brown material. The tooth directly behind the canine
tooth has some gum recession. On the left side the far back upper tooth is completely covered in a dark brown material
and the gums are red and swollen. The front teeth are three quarters covered in a very thick brown to dark brown material
with gum recession seen on almost every tooth. The first upper left front tooth from the midline is also slightly loose. The
licensee call and made an appointment for this dog before the end of the inspection. Poor dental health can cause pain
and discomfort to the animal as well as lead to further health issues. This dog must be evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. Each dealer must follow an appropriate
program of veterinary care for dogs that includes preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy teeth for all dogs.

3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The program of veterinary care states that the licensee will test 10% of his breeding stock for blood and intestinal
parasites. After going through paperwork and documentation since November 2021 and not finding results the inspector

asked the licensee if he was doing these tests and he told the inspector he was not. The plan for parasite control is
necessary in order to ensure the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care. Each dealer must follow the already
approved program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and signed by the attending
veterinarian that includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests (including fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia,
and heartworm).
