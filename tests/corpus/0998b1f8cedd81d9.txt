and the coatimundi (lacked address, license number) and is not maintaining an adequate inventory of offspring
produced at the facility. This does not allow for APHIS officials to track animals as needed. Provide and maintain
animal records that correctly disclose the information required by regulation including this information that was
unavailable; any offspring born of any animal, the name and address of the person from whom the animals were
purchased or otherwise acquired,the USDA license number of facility where animals were acquired. Correct by: 1
