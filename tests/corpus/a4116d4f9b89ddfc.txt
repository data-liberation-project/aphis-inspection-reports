ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Five guinea pigs were identified during inspection that had enlargements in their neck/jaw area. The written
program of veterinary care states that animals with submandibular abscesses should be monitored, and to notify the
veterinarian if sickness develops. The animals with the masses have not been separated from the general
population, nor have their enclosures been marked to indicated they are being monitored. There are no records
present to indicate the animals are being monitored. Failure to monitor the guinea pigs can result in sickness being
overlooked. If untreated, sickness may lead to death.
The facility is dealing with an outbreak of ringworm. Many guinea pigs with clinical signs are being housed
separately and treated once daily with Tinactin spray. The written program of veterinary care states animals
affected with ringworm shall be treated twice daily with Lamisil. Tinactin and Lamisil, though both are antifungal,
have two different active ingredients. There are no records present which document the treatment change has
been authorized by a veterinarian. Deviation from veterinary recommendations may result in prolonged animal
illness.
Licensee shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinary care by following the written program of veterinary care exactly. Documentation shall be maintained
which clearly shows which animals are being treated, how they are being treated, and for how long they have
undergone treatment. If deviations from the written program of veterinary care occur, they shall be documented and
approved by a licensed veterinarian.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Five guinea pigs were identified during inspection which had a thick greenish discharge from one eye, or had one
eye pasted closed. Licensee opened the eyes which were closed. Licensee stated he does not routinely treat
individual animals with eye discharge, but if several develop the condition, they are treated with antibiotics for apresumptive upper respiratory infection. Eye discharge may be caused by a number of different factors. If left
untreated and undiagnosed, loss of vision in the affected eye may result. Licensee must utilize appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The affected guinea pigs must be examined
by a licensed veterinarian. A protocol for the care and treatment of guinea pig eye conditions must be developed,
approved by the attending veterinarian, and implemented. Documentation of all animals affected and treated shall
be maintained by Licensee.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Currently, Licensee does not maintain records. Though Licensee knew how many animals were present, and had a
receipt for how many guinea pigs were sold last week, this was the only record available. To prevent lost, stolen, or
ineligible animals from being used for regulated activities, records of animals on hand, animals born, animals died or
euthanized, and animals sold are required. Licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully
and correctly disclose the required information.
