2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
This customer has operated as a dealer without a valid USDA license. On September 18, 2020, he sold 2 blue degu at an
exotic auction. Additionally, according to listings advertising puppies for sale as well as a conversation with the customer
himself, puppies have been sold or offered for sale using hired ground transport for shipment. Both the sale of degu as
exotic pets and sale of puppies sight unseen through a transporter require a USDA license. This customer has stated he
is planning to apply for a USDA license and is working diligently and cooperatively with APHIS to ensure his facility will be
compliant with the Animal Welfare Act.

No regulated activity may be conducted from this time forward until a USDA license covering the activities is obtained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
