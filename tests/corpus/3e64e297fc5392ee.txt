FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures housing the bactrian camel and dromedary camel have numerous areas where the woven wire and
chain link fencing have been pushed down by the camels leaning on the fence. These camels may escape their
enclosures or become entangled in the fence and injured while attempting to do so. This fencing needs to be
repaired or replaced in order to contain these animals and prevent injury to them.
The debris of an old bird shelter is inside the dromedary camel enclosure. These broken boards and old heat lamp
and cord are an injury hazard to this animal. Remove this debris from the enclosure.
The two enclosures each housing one black bear has electric wire strands located at the bottom of the enclosure
fence and several feet up in order to keep the bears from attempting to climb on the fence or damage it by clawing
it. This fence is not currently on and the bears approach the woven wire fencing with no fear of the electric fence.
This fence must remain charged in order for the primary enclosure fence to be judged adequate to contain the
bears. These bears are dangerous animals and an escape from this enclosure could result in an injury to a member
of the public or a facility employee which would have fatal results for the bears.

WATERING.
The water receptacles in the enclosure housing the muntjac deer and Fritz the bear have large amounts of algae
growing in them. Mosquito larvae were in the water receptacle for Fritz the bear. This would indicate that they have
not been cleaned frequently enough. Water receptacles need to be kept clean for the health of the animals using
them. Clean these water receptacles.
