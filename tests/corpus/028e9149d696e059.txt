addition her eyes appear glazed and she has difficulty with her range of movement. Due to the lack of an attending
veterinarian(cid:25)s evaluation it is difficult for the facility representative to determine what treatment should be for the
older female bear. Facility has noted the issues and should contact the attending veterinarian for evaluation of older
female bear. Correct by August 25, 2015
