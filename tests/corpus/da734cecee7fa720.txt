2.38(f)(1) Critical Repeat

Miscellaneous.
In March 2020 a male macaque had a femur fracture which was attributed to the handling method. The animal was
humanely euthanized. Handling methods that cause accidental orthopedic injuries can be refined to prevent physical
harm and unnecessary discomfort to the animals handled. Ensure that handling is refined to be done as carefully as
possible and in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort.

Note: The facility recognized this problem and promptly reported it to the veterinarians for treatment and to the IACUC.
Steps were taken by the facility to determine the cause and to prevent further occurrences.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
