FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In some the larger pens/exhibits, the enclosure fence line consists of a concrete wall 4 to 8 feet in height, covered
by gunnite, topped with chain link attached to stanchions. There are several small areas (given the amount of
enclosure fence present) where the substrate (both gunnite and dirt) below the existing chain link fence has been
eroded away (by natural and animal causes). In some areas the gunnite has chipped away from the supporting
concrete, creating cracks and large pieces of debris.
*In the truck pass through between the Arabian Oryx pen to the white lipped deer enclosure, as you are looking up
from the road/lower enclosure fence of the Arabian Oryx pen, there is an area where the erosion under the fence
has been filled with tree trunks, fence posts and rocks, creating a hazardous area.
*In the field exhibits, chicken wire has been attached on the exterior of the fence line as predator wire, and is mostly
buried. Erosion and animal activity has exposed chicken wire in some areas, covering the gap between the concrete
wall and the chain link. Chicken wire material is not appropriate and of sufficient strength to prevent entry of small
noncollection animals into the enclosure. Specific areas included:
North Africa; northwest fence line between North Africa and East Africa exhibit. One small area has been
temporarily patched with an additional section of chain link fencing, and the permanent repair needs to be
structurally sound. Areas not yet repaired are present. In front of this fence line, a PVC pipe is visible in a crevasse
created by erosion.
Asian plains exhibit; north side fence facing the white lipped deer and the Przewalski's horse exhibits
Facilities must be structurally sound, constructed with material that is an appropriate strength for the animals
involved and shall be maintained in good repair.

3.127(c)FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the North African field enclosure, housing Ankoli, scimitar horned oryx and other compatible species, there is a
small area under a grove of trees near the entry gate that is persistently wet, resulting in some standing water and
an area of green vegetation growth. This area of excess water has resulted in persistent runoff down the adjacent
slope and there are multiple deep crevasses and one area where the ground is no longer solid and has collapsed
creating a hole. The deep crevasses and hole may pose a hazard to an animal and have the potential for injury.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
On the outer service road heading to hillside holding, the effective height of the perimeter fence for the hillside
holding pens is decreased by the accumulation of dirt into a berm at multiple areas along the fence line. There are
also 2-3 areas where the fence posts have been damaged, or the chain link has been damaged, causing a small
hole. The effective height of the perimeter fence must be at least 6 feet high and maintained in good repair.

SANITATION.
In the main commissary, the tile that creates the baseboard has broken off in three different places, exposing the
wall to water used in cleaning and resulting in an area that can not be effectively cleaned. The junction of the wall
and the baseboard is peeling away and separating in two corner areas. The kitchen was inspected in the middle of
scrubbing, and water was pooling in several areas that had a dark buildup on the tile and grout of the floor. The
broken areas of tile are not maintained in good repair and the inability to effectively clean the main kitchen does not
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
