ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On today's inspection a female tan Yorkshire Bichon Cross dog with microchip number 990000001216777 was
noticed to have wounds on the inside flap of both ears. The tissues on the flaps of the ears appeared thicken. The
thicken areas of the right ear was hard and the left appeared fluid filled. The fluid filled area of the left ear appeared
purplish. The wounds were scabbed in the left ear and areas oozed blood and clear fluid in the right. The dog shook
its head repeatedly when observed from the outside of the cage. The Licensee stated he had not seen or treated
this dog's ear issue prior to today's inspection. The facility’s written program of veterinary care did not provide a
method of treatment for the condition noted. The Attending Veterinarian was contacted and agreed that the
Licensee should be identifying all health issues and that the dog needs to be treated at the clinic. An appointment
was made with the veterinarian for 10/11/2019. The Licensee does not currently have a method of daily
observation to allow for the identification of any health issues that are not easily identifiable from outside of the dogs
enclosures. Not having a method to identify health issues, such as ear issues, does not allow for prevention, control,
diagnose or treatment of the health issues within the kennel. Left untreated ear conditions such as this can be
painful and may progress. Correct by ensuring that there are methods for daily observation in place to properly
identify all health issues, including ear issues. In addition, the Licensee must ensure that appropriate methods are
used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat this dog and all other animals at the facility. Correct By: Close of
