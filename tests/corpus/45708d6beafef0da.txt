ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The female Boer goat referred to as Apricot has an abnormal swelling on the left side of her neck under her chin
area. She also has a thick off white colored discharge in her right eye. The goat has not been evaluated by the
attending veterinarian. These conditions are abnormal and can potentially be painful and do not provide for the
health, comfort and well-being of the animal. The goat must be evaluated by a veterinarian and the prescribed
treatment must be followed. Correct by: August 29, 2014.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is an approximately 2 to 3 foot gap in the perimeter fence behind the wolf enclosure. Lack of a complete
perimeter fence cannot keep unauthorized people and unwanted animals from having access to the animals housed
within. Also, it cannot function as a secondary containment system. The gap in the perimeter fence must be
repaired to close the open area. Correct by: September 15, 2014.
