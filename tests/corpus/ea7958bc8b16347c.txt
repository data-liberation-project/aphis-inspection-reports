INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
According to the facility representative, dogs in IACUC approved protocol 3427 are being housed in primary
enclosures that are not being properly sanitized every two weeks in accordance with 3.11 b 3 due to study
purposes. The principal investigator did not include or justify in the protocol that an exception to the required
sanitation interval was necessary. Scientifically justified exceptions to the standards of the Animal Welfare Act must
be documented and approved by the IACUC in order to ensure that the animals' welfare needs are being met. To
be corrected by 15 August 2014.
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One adult male cat named "Brad" was presented to the veterinary staff on 7 July 2014 for drooling after exposure to
a cleaning chemical (Process NPD). The staff reported that this cat had access to the chemical when out of its
primary enclosure while being transferred for exercise. The chemical container was stored out in the open in the
animal housing room. The staff reports that the cat knocked over the container and licked the chemical. The cat was
treated for oral ulcers and recovered. Improper storage of chemicals in animal areas can lead to intoxication or
injury. Substances that are toxic to the dogs or cats but are required for normal husbandry practices must not be
stored in food storage and preparation areas, but may be stored in cabinets in the animal areas. Corrected prior to
the time of inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
