Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
*** The licensee is not maintaining accurate records of offspring born at the facility and the date of sale or records of
disposition for the animals. This includes a wallaby and cavy born and then sold, breeding pairs of short tailed opossums,
breeding pairs of hedgehogs and a large colony of degus. In addition to records of animals on hand, accurate records
must be maintained for breeding females and their offspring and subsequently disposition records identifying where the
animals are sold must also be documented. This needs to be addressed in a timely and accurate manner for record
keeping purposes.

Sanitation.
*** There was an accumulation of feces in the bobcat enclosure on top of the green wooden box and an accumulation of
feces that had been removed was left outside the enclosure directly on the snow to be discarded at a later time. The
facility states the bobcat is cleaned every two weeks by the one volunteer who can access the enclosure with the animal
safely. This level and manner of cleaning is insufficient based on the amount of feces in the enclosure and feces removed
but left in the open outside the enclosure. The facility needs to address the enclosure design by being able to shift the

animal to a separate area to facilitate cleaning of the enclosure to ensure feces can be removed as often as necessary for
the health of the animal.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
*** A significant amount of clutter was seen in the main building housing approximately 55 animals including non-human
primates. The same building was also used for food preparation as well as for storage. Empty enclosures, some dirty,
could be seen stacked above freezers and in spaces between, above and below primary enclosures in use. Other items,
such as toys and boxes, were being stacked above the occupied enclosures.

*** A moderate amount of spider webs and dust could be seen hanging from the ceiling, covering the top of enclosures,
and covering the skylights. The excessive dust along items hanging from the walls and ceiling attract and hold debris and
contribute to the odor of ammonia in the room.
*** Unsanitary conditions in the areas surrounding primary enclosures housing animals can also lead to unpleasant odors,
attract pest and negatively impact animal welfare. Premises where housing facilities are located, must be kept clean and
free of clutter in order to facilitate husbandry practices and to protect the animals from disease as well as injury. This
building consistently struggles with this issue in winter months when animals are brought inside, and space is limited. The
facility must come up with a plan to store excess items in another area to be able to facilitate cleaning in this building for
the health of the animals.

Space requirements.
*** The facility is breeding and maintaining a colony of degu’s for feeding purposes for owls and reptiles, but is also
selling the animals to local licensed pet stores in the area. Animals that are bred for regulated purposes must be housed

and maintained in a manner meeting the AWA standards. Currently the facility has three aquariums, each approximately
40 gallons and housing 40 or more degus. The animals have limited shavings and inadequate space. Signs of
inadequate space for rodent species can be stress, fighting with conspecifics, injuries, and illness. These signs become
difficult to see with so many animals housed together. The placement of these aquariums did not allow the inspector good
visualization to observe all the animals present. Enclosures must be constructed and maintained to provide sufficient
space to allow each animal adequate freedom of movement.

Facilities, general.
*** In December of 2020 the facility reports that a female African Crested porcupine was killed by a weasel getting into
chain link enclosure and biting her neck. This enclosure is wrapped by a wood frame with plastic sheeting to protect the
animals from the cold and it’s likely the animal got through the plastic sheeting and through the chain link. They found the
weasel outside the enclosure and it had died due to injuries sustained in the porcupine enclosure. Outdoor facilities must
be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. This needs to be addressed for the
safety of the remaining male porcupine at the facility.

Sanitation.
*** A significant amount of clutter was seen in the main building housing approximately 55 animals. The same building
was also used for food preparation as well as for storage. Empty enclosures, some dirty, could be seen stacked above
freezers and in spaces between, above and below primary enclosures in use.

*** A blanket was covering a woodchuck in the main building and on top of the blanket were open bags of food items and

excess items. There was a small swarm of flies just underneath the blanket in the animals’ enclosure possibly attracted by
the blanket.

**** The metal water bottle holders for the degu’s are showing considerable signs of rust. These rusted areas limit the
effectiveness of cleaning and sanitizing and should be replaced to facilitate cleaning of the water holders.

*** There was considerable dust and debris on top of multiple enclosures including binturong’s, chinchilla’s, fennec foxes
and hedgehogs.

*** Currently the facility is housing a flock of birds in an enclosure on a shelf inside the wallaby enclosure. There were bird
droppings on the shelf and there is a concern that feces can contaminate the wallaby enclosure.

*** The warm room where the armadillo, tenrec, short tailed opossums, and skinny pigs are housed is also filled with
clutter, cleaning items and excessive dust and debris on tops of enclosures. There is also open trash can bins, plastic
bags hanging off wooden shelves and sugar gliders stacked on top of the armadillo enclosure.

Sanitation.
*** There were flies present in the woodchuck enclosure and in the wallaby enclosure despite the fly strips that were
hanging in the main building. The excess clutter and housekeeping issues contribute to pest control issues. Fly strips
need to be replaced more frequently and an effective program to control pests must be maintained to reduce pests in
these area and for the health of the animals.
