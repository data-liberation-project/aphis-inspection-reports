Currently, adult chinchilla’s are not being provided or offered access to dust baths. However, weaned chinchilla’s
are provided access to dust baths for 30 minutes each day. A Licensee stated that the weaned chinchilla’s receive
dust baths because it makes them look better and puffs their coats up. In communicating with the attending
veterinarian, he stated that he was unaware of the adults not being offered an opportunity for dust baths. The
attending veterinarian agreed that dust baths are essential for their normal grooming techniques and overall health
and wellbeing. Without access to dust baths, chinchillas have no ability to rid themselves of excessive moisture. In
addition, it exposes them to potential health issues such as hair loss, dry skin, fungal infections and hairballs.
Several health issues identified on today’s inspection could be a direct result of the lack of dust baths. The facility
must communicate with their attending veterinarian to ensure that they are using appropriate methods to prevent,
control, diagnose and treat all health issues.

Approximately 1 inch of the animal’s collar is covered with matted fur and a dry yellow crust. Upon further
examination, at least ½ inch of the animal’s collar is embedded into the top portion of her neck. The skin around the
affected area is covered in a thick yellow/green crust. Blood is present and muscle can be identified in the open
wound.
A male standard chinchilla, M-W122, was noticed to be inactive and in the back corner of the enclosure. Both of theeyes are crusted shut. A dry green discharge is observed surrounding the eyes and the fur is wet. A white creamy
pus-like material is expressing from the eye socket upon manipulation. The animal also has dry white/green crusts

covered with a green discharge. Portions of the green discharge are dried and crusty. The anatomy of the eye is
unrecognizable.
The left eye of a female ebony/violet chinchilla, 16011F, has at least a 5mm round growth extending from the front
portion of the bottom eyelid. The growth is obstructing approximately ¼ of the animal’s eye. A scab is observed in
the center of the growth. The growth is in direct contact with the outer surface of the eye. A wet green discharge is
present within the eye and on the surrounding skin. Approximately a ½ inch diameter of skin is missing hair on top

eye. The left eye is cloudy and the normal anatomy is unrecognizable. Near the center of the left eye is a dark
circular opacity. A white/creamy discharge is present in the right eye.
The tail tip of a female standard chinchilla, Y6363, is swollen with hair loss. The skin is extremely reddened, bloody,
and scabbed. A large portion of the tail is missing with only approximately 1-1.5 inches of tail remaining. The
chinchilla is painful, screaming when picked-up at its tail base. A piece of white material, bone, is extending from the

A male standard chinchilla, TE-7924, has blood on the middle of his tail. The fur with the blood is matted and
crusted. Under the matted fur is an open wound. The skin is reddened and thickened with hair loss. The center of
the wound is bright yellow and surrounded by a white creamy pus-like material. The chinchilla is extremely painful,
screaming when picked-up and when matted fur is manipulated.
All of the health issues identified above are significantly impacting animal health and wellbeing. Daily observation of
these animals is not effective. Thus, health issues are not identified within a timely manner. It is the Licensees
responsibility that daily observations are completed appropriately and effectively. Additionally, there must be a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure all health issues are
addressed within a timely manner, to include the animals identified above.

FEEDING.
Over 45% of the enclosures have an excessive amount of rust on the self-feeders where the food is dispensed.
Rust cannot be effectively cleaned or sanitized. In addition, several feeders have a moderate buildup of debris
adhered to the inside walls. One of the Licensee’s stated that they do not currently have a routine method for
cleaning and sanitizing any of the self-feeders within the facility. Improper cleaning allows for the buildup of dust,
dirt, excreta and other organic materials. The Licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are kept clean and
sanitary at all times.

SANITATION.
A strong ammonia odor is present within the facility. Over 50% of the enclosures have moderate to excessiveamounts of rust on the wire mesh of the enclosure walls and/or the pans at the bottom of the enclosures. Rust
cannot be effectively cleaned or sanitized. In addition, over 50% of the enclosures have an excessive buildup of
excreta and/or urine soaked bedding and wood pieces that are urine saturated. In communicating with the facilities
attending veterinarian, he stated that he was concerned with the ventilation of the facility due to the strong ammonia
odor. Insufficient cleaning and sanitization is directly contributing to the odor within the facility. The Licensee must
ensure that excreta and urine saturated bedding and wood be removed from the enclosures as often as necessary
to prevent the contamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards and to reduce odor. The Licensee must
consult with their attending veterinarian to ensure that they have appropriate methods in place for routine cleaning
and sanitization to address the attending veterinarians concern for the ventilation/odor within the facility.
