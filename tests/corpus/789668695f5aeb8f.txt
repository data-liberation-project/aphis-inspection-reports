3.6(a)(2)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
* The Chain link fencing has come loose from the enclosure frame in two outdoor enclosures housing three dogs. The
gap was estimated to be three feet long by one foot tall in one enclosure and six inches by six inches in the other
enclosure. Three dogs are in contact with the affected fencing. One dog was observed crawling through the gap in the
fencing to the adjacent enclosure. No dogs were in the adjacent enclosure. The potential for injury exists if any dog gets
caught in the affected fencing. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain the dogs
securely. Correct by 12/22/20
3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
The entire top of one plastic water receptacle used by two dogs is chewed exposing a roughened, jagged edge. The
receptacle is located in outdoor housing. A chewed and roughened surface cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized. In
addition, it could harbor bacteria and other disease-causing agents that can affect the health and wellbeing of the dogs.
All surfaces must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized,
must be replaced when worn or soiled. Correct by 12/15/20.
3.11

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

* Cobwebs and dust were accumulating on the interior wall boards, ceiling and on an estimated 20-foot-tall entry door.
Two adult dogs and three puppies were being housed next to the affected surfaces. This indicates a living area exists for
rodents, other pests and other vermin. Unsanitary living conditions are created if the affected area is not kept clean.
This could lead to health issues for the animals. The licensee must ensure that all buildings and surrounding grounds
must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices
required in this sub part, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
* Official USDA dog on hand sheets (7005's) need to be updated. Official identification (microchip) had not been
recorded for 11 dogs. When the records and dogs currently at the facility do not match, it makes the records incomplete.
Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure each animal’s identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate
the ability to trace dogs. The licensee must ensure that they make, keep, and maintain records that fully and correctly
disclose all the required information regarding each dog. Correct by 12/22/20.

This inspection and exit interview done on 12/8/20 were conducted with the licensee.
