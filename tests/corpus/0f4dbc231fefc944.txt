A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1 pm on 16 June
2021. The inspector called and left a message requesting a call back, rang the doorbell, and checked with an individual
at the office next door, who also called the licensee. The inspector waited 30 minutes. No return call was received. The
licensee must ensure that a responsible adult is available to accompany an inspector upon inspection during regular
business hours.
