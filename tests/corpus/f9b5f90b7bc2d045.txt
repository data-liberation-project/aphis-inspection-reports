ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male dog, Zach, and a female dog, Black Beauty, were observed with a moderate amount of tan/brown dental
tartar on their upper and lower teeth. Zach was also observed with hair loss on the end of his tail. These dogs had
not yet received veterinary care for these conditions. Dental disease can be painful and can lead to other negative
health issues. Veterinary care must be provided in order to prevent pain and distress for these animals. The
licensee has a system in place for dental management, however these two dogs dental conditions had not been
previously identified/documented.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the "puppy room" there was a female Papillion/ Pomeranian puppy being housed in an enclosure with two other
puppies. The puppy was observed with her feet falling through the floor while she walked around the enclosure.
The other puppies housed in the enclosure were larger in size and their feet did not fall through the openings in the
mesh floor. Puppies can be injured if their feet fall through openings in the floor. Floors must be constructed in a
manner that prevents the dogs feet from falling through. The licensee offered additional resting surfaces to the
puppy at the time of inspection by placing a blanket in the enclosure.
***********Correct from this day forward
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
