2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection, it was observed that several animals are in need of veterinary care.
***A male Dromedary camel, Zo, has a large growth on his chest pad that was irregular in shape, approximately 4
inches by 8 inches extending approximately 6 inches down from the body wall. The growth was covered with flies.
The licensee provided documentation of a physical exam provided by the attending veterinarian, which stated that a
surgical resection should be performed at a facility that can address all surgical and postoperative concerns. The
licensee periodically applies fly spray to the area.
***An intact adult male tricolor goat that had been non-weight bearing on his right front leg during the APHIS
inspection on March 9, 2017 was observed during this inspection to still be non-weight bearing. The facility
representative provided documentation showing that the veterinarian had examined and treated the goat on March
9, 2017. The goat was rechecked on May 27, 2017 by the veterinarian and it was his recommendation that 1) more
diagnostic work needs to be done (radiographs, bloodwork, appropriate serology), or 2) if the facility representatives
do not want to proceed with more diagnostics then it is his recommendation to cull the animal. The veterinarian
stated in his report that the animal did not appear to be in pain and the NSAIDS used previously provided no
improvement. In addition to the lameness observed, it was also observed that the goat was bleeding from his left
horn, which appears to be damaged. The licensee did not notice this prior to us pointing it out.
***Nine goats, seven sheep, and one cow had overgrown hooves due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to
appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the
facility’s program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof
care in a timely manner.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The
program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee is required to follow the guidance of their attending
veterinarian.2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***The public is permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosure and feed the animals. There are no barriers or
signs present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food that is sold on the premises.
There was only one attendant present during this inspection and he wasn't supervising all the public interactions or
contact the guests had with the animals when they walked directly up to the enclosures to feed the animals.
Continued unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals. Licensees must
ensure that during periods of public exhibition, a responsible, knowledgeable employee or attendant is present at all
times during periods of public contact.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Two enclosures that housed Dromedary camels had fencing in disrepair. One had a hole with broken fencing that
had sharp points that were poking straight up and some points were poking straight into the pen. The other pen had
fencing that was falling down and created gaps and sharp points that were pointing into the enclosure.
***Two enclosures that housed some sheep and goats had broken fencing with sharp points and there were gaps
large enough that the animal's horns or head could get stuck and therefore poses the risk of injury to animals in the
enclosure.
***The enclosure housing the goats in the barn had rust along the lower parts of the walls, which was 10 inches or
greater in height. In one corner there was a hole that was large enough for the animal's horns or head to get stuck
and therefore poses the risk of injury to animals in the enclosure.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points and protruding edges in order to protect the
animals from injury. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to ensure all animal
facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or escape.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***Near the eland enclosure, a large portion of the perimeter fence was in disrepair. One of the metal poles
stabilizing the chain link was leaning outward, away from the property at approximately a 30 degree slant. Another
metal stabilizing pole was leaning inward. Along one section of the fence, the metal bar at the top of the fence was
broken into two pieces.
***Near the camel and sheep enclosure, an approximately 100 foot long segment of the perimeter fence was lessthan 6 feet tall due to the amount of dirt and land that was leaning against it.
***Near the enclosure containing the coati, a tree was leaning on the perimeter fence causing the fence to lean
downward.
All of the issues cited above decrease the efficacy of the perimeter fence to function as a secondary containment
system for the regulated animals and to protect them from outside animals entering the premises.
The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from having contact with the animals, and so it can function as a secondary containment
system. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact
between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
