ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was an individually housed male English Bulldog (#036*010*061) that was squinting his right eye and
rubbing at it with his paw. On closer observation, there was a slight amount of greenish white discharge at the
bottom of the eye. A cloudy bluish grey lesion was present within the central left portion of the eye. The
surrounding tissues (conjunctiva) of the right eye also appeared slightly reddened and inflamed. According to the
licensee, she had not noticed the dog(cid:25)s eye prior to the inspectors pointing it out. The licensee also noted that the
dog(cid:25)s eye condition may have resulted from an aggressive episode between this dog and another dog with which it
had been housed with yesterday.
***There was a female Yorkshire Terrier (#0A01403513) that was squinting her left eye. On closer observation,
there was some greenish white discharge surrounding the left eye. Most of the eye appeared dark bluish grey in
color; the iris and pupil were difficult to visualize. An approximately pinpoint sized concave lesion was located
centrally on the surface of the eye. According to the licensee, she had just noticed the dog(cid:25)s left eye during the
inspection and noted that it may have resulted from a fight with another dog it had been housed with the previous
day.
The lesions on these dogs(cid:25) eyes could indicate an injury, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may be
painful. Neither of these dogs had been examined by a veterinarian for their current conditions nor were they under
any type of treatment at the time of inspection.
The licensee must have these dogs seen by a licensed veterinarian no later than July 19, 2014 in order to ensure
that accurate diagnoses are made and that appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed.
