2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was found to be incomplete and missing information on appropriate
methods to deliver adequate veterinary care to wild and exotic animal species. Upon review of the facility's PVC, no
information on the adequate medical care of red foxes (or other wild/exotic animals) was found. The attending
veterinarian (AV) must develop adequate methods to deliver veterinary care to all wild and exotic mammal species
at the premises, and include these on the appropriate section of the PVC. In order to provide adequate veterinary
care to regulated animals, the facility and the AV should review and update the PVC by listing specific and detailed
information on preventive, diagnosing and treatment methods for all species.
