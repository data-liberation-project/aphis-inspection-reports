Facilities, general.
Records indicated that in June 2019 four 13-lined ground squirrels got out of their primary enclosure which led to the
necessary humane euthanasia of two of the ground squirrels. Two of the ground squirrels were returned to their enclosure
without adverse effects. It wasn't clear how the ground squirrels got out but they might have been able to bounce the lid
open enough to get out. The laboratory reports it has added extra clips to secure the enclosure lids and has increased
the safety of the animal rooms in the case that a ground squirrel were to get out. To protect the animals' health and
wellbeing, the facility must ensure that primary enclosures safely contain the animals and protect them from injury.

Note: This incident was reported to the IACUC and corrective actions were taken.

Correction: Ensure that corrective actions are followed.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
