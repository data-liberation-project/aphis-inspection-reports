FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Upon entering the rabbit room, there was a strong odor consistent with ammonia, and the inspector experienced
mild ocular and respiratory irritation until a window was opened. Inhalation of ammonia has been associated with
respiratory and ocular disease in laboratory rabbits and may affect animal welfare adversely. Facilities must be
adequately ventilated to minimize odors and maintain health and comfort of the animals at all times.
Correction date: Immediate
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Excreta and hair were present in large amounts in the pans and on wires of rabbit primary enclosures.
Accumulation of waste products can contribute to bacterial buildup and increase ventilatory requirements tomaintain air and primary enclosures in clean conditions to prevent adverse effects upon animal welfare and health.
Buildup of hair on primary enclosures provides additional surfaces for excreta and bacteria to accumulate, also
leading to potentially adverse conditions for animal welfare. Primary enclosures shall be kept reasonably free of
excreta and hair by periodic cleaning.
Correction date: 06 January 2020
3.56(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Along two racks of rabbit cages urine had pooled down the upright supports and was present on the floor. Urine
had been sprayed onto the wall behind one rack of cages. Minor rusting of the upright supports was evident.
Accumulation of animal excreta may impede effective cleaning methods, impair the structural integrity of
enclosures, and contribute to conditions associated with animal injury or disease. Cleaning to remove waste
products of animals that can contribute to unhealthful odors, potentially harmful bacterial overgrowth and equipment
deterioration, is necessary to protect animals from injury and to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
