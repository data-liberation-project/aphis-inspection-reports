2.126(c)(1)(iii)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The licensee did not include the dates that she would be traveling with her animals, to the State Fair of Virginia, on the
itinerary that she submitted to Animal Care.
Itineraries that do not include all the required information can make it difficult for Animal Care to track animal exhibition
and perform necessary inspections to ensure animal welfare at traveling sites.
All licensees that exhibit animals overnight at any location other than the person's approved site, must provide an itinerary
to Animal Care at least 48 hours prior to travel which includes the names, dates, and locations where the animals will
travel, be housed, and be exhibited in addition to the name of the person exhibiting the animals and the required animal
information (name or ID number, species, sex, and age).
