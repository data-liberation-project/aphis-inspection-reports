2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A Shih Tzu puppy (#16-76) had a chicken egg size buildup of fecal matter caked on its rear end. After the
inspectors pointed this out, the facility representative immediately took and washed the puppys hind end. After the
fecal material was removed by the facility representative, inspectors noticed the puppy had reddened and inflamed
area about the size of a golf ball on the anal area. There were seven other puppies (#16-81 thru #16-87) that had
fecal matter build up on the rear end. This reddened and inflamed area could indicate infection or other veterinary
medical condition which could be painful. There was a female Maltese #318 that had the ID chain in its mouth and
around the neck, pinching the lower jaw. The facility representative immediately removed the chain once pointed
out. The lower jaw had swelling on the front lip. The inflamed area on the lip was approximately 1/2" x 1". The
inflamed area could indicate a injury or other medical condition. The licensee must consult with a licensed
veterinarian before close of business on 3/24/2016, regarding these animals conditions in order to obtain an
accurate diagnosis and to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.3(c)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Lighting.
***Inside the sheltered facility there was not enough light to observe the animals, maintain adequate cleaning or for
inspection of the facility and animals without a flashlight. Not having enough light prevents adequate cleaning,
hinders observation of the animals for health problems and can affect the well being of the animals. The licensee
must ensure the sheltered housing facilities for dogs must be lighted well enough to permit routine inspection and
cleaning of the facility, and observation of the dogs. Animal areas must be provided a regular diurnal lighting cycle
of either natural or artificial light. Lighting must be uniformly diffused throughout animal facilities and provide
sufficient illumination to aid in maintaining good housekeeping practices, adequate cleaning, adequate inspection of
animals, and for the well-being of the animals.
To be corrected by: April 1, 2016.
3.9(b) REPEATFEEDING.
Food receptacles.
***There were approximately 6 self-feeders affecting at least 12 dogs with a build up on the ledge and the metal
plate inside the feeder. There was brownish grime covering about 60%-80% of the metal plates and ledges of these
self-feeders. The licensee needs to clean and sanitize the self-feeders to protect the health and well-being of the
dogs. The licensee needs to establish and maintain a program to ensure feeders and waterers are cleaned and
sanitized at least every 2 weeks or more often if necessary.
