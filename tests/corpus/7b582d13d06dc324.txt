3.130 CRITICAL
WATERING.
A vole was found dead in a cage during a routine cage change. The caretaker observed the water bottle had been
improperly placed in the cage which restricted the animal's access to water. Based on an internal investigation by
the Division of Animal Resources, it was determined that the animal likely had no access to water for at least 5
days. If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the
health and comfort of the animal. The internal investigation also resulted in corrective actions taken by the
institution to mitigate further recurrences.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
