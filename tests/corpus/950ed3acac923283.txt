SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The ambient temperature according to the inspector's Kestrel thermometer in the indoor portion of the Japanese
Snow Macaque enclosure was measured at 34.9 degrees F. The outdoor temperature at the conclusion of the
inspection was 26 degrees F and the low temperature reported over night on weather.gov for this zip code was
reported as 24 degrees F. This problem appears to be a result of the keeper door being left open and the heater in
this area not working properly for an unknown period of time. Because the zoo employees had not noticed the
malfunctioning heater today as of the time of inspection (about 11am), the temperature in this area was below 45
degrees for at least 4 hours. Failure to maintain the temperature in the sheltered building housing nonhuman
primates can result in animals who are unable to maintain a safe body temperature. The licensee must ensure that
the sheltered part of sheltered housing facilities must be sufficiently heated and cooled when necessary to protect
the nonhuman primates from temperature extremes, and to provide for their health and well-being. The ambient
temperature in the sheltered part of the facility must not fall below 45 degrees F for more than 4 consecutive hours
when nonhuman primates are present, To be corrected by close of business on 5 Feb 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
