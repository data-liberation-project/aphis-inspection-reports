FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee had cleaning materials (bleach) and insect repellents (cans and bottle) on an upper shelf in the
storage section of the (cid:28)barn(cid:29) over food supplements, granular de-wormers and electrolytes. These items were on a
high, open shelf above the food storage area. The licensee was asked to rearrange these items last year during the
inspection. The licensee removed these items and stored them appropriately when this was pointed out both years.
However, the licensee must ensure that all substances that are toxic to the animals are not stored in food storage
and preparation areas, but may be stored in cabinets in the animal areas or below the food supplements, granular
de-wormers and electrolytes.
This was corrected during the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
