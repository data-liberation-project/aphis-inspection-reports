SANITATION.
The sink in the animal feed room was in disrepair. The construction of the sink allows for water to collect around the
edges of the sink on the counter. This has caused the material covering the counter to peel back from the sink.
This allows water and other materials to seep into the exposed surfaces and cannot be adequately cleaned and
disinfected.
This sink needs to be repaired or replaced so that water cannot collect around the edges and cause damage to the
counter.
