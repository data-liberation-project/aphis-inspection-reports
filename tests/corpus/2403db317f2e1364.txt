ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In an animal surgery room, there was a 1cc syringe containing solution with incomplete labeling, on a table next to
an expired vial of sterile saline. According to the facility representative, the syringe contained saline solution from
the expired vial of saline. Without proper labeling of syringes, there may be unintended use of its contents.
Furthermore, in a locked, controlled drug safe in this surgery suite, there was also an expired sterile saline vial
mixed with other non-expired drugs. Medical items intended for animal use should be properly labeled, and expired
medications should be identified and placed in a separate area to avoid unintentional use on regulated animals.
Correct from this day forward.
A protocol involving surgery on a covered species stated that Butorphanol would be administered post-operatively
at 3mg/kg subcutaneously. There was no written documentation on reviewed medical/surgical logs that
Butorphanol had been administered post-operatively. Without proper and detailed written documentation of
medications being administered as stated in the protocol, there is no means to verify administration. Research
facilities should establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care. Records of post-operative care of
animals should be complete.
Correct from this day forward.

SANITATION.
-Air vents in multiple animal areas had a heavy buildup of dust. One vent was directly over animal enclosures.
Premises must be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the health of the animals and to facilitate
prescribed husbandry practices. A system of routine and scheduled housekeeping maintenance must be in place to
ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
Correct by June 19, 2015 -There were porous, un-sealed ceiling tiles in a room designated for surgery of a covered species. Un-sealed
surfaces including floors, walls, and ceilings cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized to facilitate good housekeeping
practices in areas used for animal surgery. A system of repair or replacement and maintenance of surfaces which
can be readily cleaned and sanitized must be in place.
