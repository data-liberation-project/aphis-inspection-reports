Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The following animals were identified as needing veterinary care:
- A young adult tan & grey guinea pig in enclosure 17 was observed with hair loss around the right eye. The underlying
skin was crusty with scabs present.
- A young adult tri color (white/tan/brindle) guinea pig in enclosure 17 was observed with hair loss below the left ear and
around the right eye. The underlying skin was crusty with scabs present.
- A young adult black guinea pig in enclosure 51 was observed with hair loss around the right eye. The underlying skin
was crusty with numerous scabs present.

When observing these three guinea pigs, it was noted the animals were still housed with other guinea pigs. The written
Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) states that animals identified with ringworm must be removed immediately from
enclosures so as to limit the spread. The PVC states that ringworm should be treated with a Miconazole nitrate 2% cream.

Failure to conduct daily observations can result in delay of care provided to animals and can prolong animal health
problems and cause further spreading of disease. Correct by following the written Program of Veterinary Care on file,
observing animals daily, separating guinea pigs with ringworm and other health problems, treating animals according to

the veterinarian's instructions, and communicating with the attending on veterinarian when there are health problems.
Additionally, licensee must provide documentation of such treatments to APHIS officials upon request. Remains
uncorrected.
3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
An adult grey & white guinea pig was noted to be loose on the floor under racks in the building. Housing facilities need to
protect the guinea pigs from injury and contain the animals securely. Failure to do so can lead to injury or death from falls
to the ground from upper enclosures, escape from the animal room, or become trapped outside the enclosure. Correct by
ensuring that enclosures are properly maintained to prevent animals escapes. Remains uncorrected
3.25(c)

Facilities, general.
Storage. There were accumulations of spilled feed, loose shavings, and scattered hay on the floor by food storage area
by the door of the guinea pig room. A pile of empty bags was next to food and bedding storage area. Supplies of food and
bedding must be stored in areas that protect supplies against spoilage, deterioration, or contamination. Licensee must
ensure that the food storage and bedding areas are kept clean to protect supplies from spoilage or contamination from
insects, rodents, or other pests. Correct by February 26, 2022.
3.28(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
Enclosure # 58 housing 15 adult guinea pig and enclosure # 59 housing approximately 46 weanling guinea pigs still have
unsealed wood surfaces on the sides and floor of enclosures. Unsealed wood cannot be adequately cleaned or properly
sanitized and allows the absorption of liquids and moisture. In addition, unsealed wood retains odors which can increase

the risk of disease to the guinea pigs housed in them. These two enclosures are also used to treat guinea pigs with
ringworm. Correct by sealing all wood surfaces or replacing wood with an impervious surface. Remains uncorrected.
3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
Space. Insufficient space was being provided to approximately 19 weanling guinea pigs in the 4th enclosure in the rolling
rack with rubber pans. Enclosure measured 32 inches by 20 inches or 640 square inches of floor space. Weanling guinea
pigs weighting up to 350 grams require at least 60 square inches of floor space. Can not house more than 10 weanling
guinea pigs in this size enclosure.

Inadequate space can cause stress, overcrowding, and aggression in animals. Licensee must ensure that guinea pigs are
provided with at least the minimum amount of floor space per animal to prevent unnecessary stress or discomfort. Correct
by February 27, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
