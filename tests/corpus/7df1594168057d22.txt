2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The records of animals on hand are incomplete. The owner declined to provide the information on the disposition
of one Patagonian cavy and two brown nosed coatimundi. Records of sales, donations, transfers, and deaths must
be kept. Accurate documentation of the animal inventory ensures that all animals are accounted for and receive
proper care. Records of dispositions must be maintained to ensure animals receive proper care and to facilitate the
regulatory requirements of the Animal Welfare Act.
2.126(a)(2) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***The licensee still refuses to disclose the disposition of one Patagonian cavy and 2 brown nosed coatimundi.
Licensees are required to provide information regarding the disposition of animals to an APHIS official. Failure to
provide the information to an APHIS official is in violation of the regulations of the Animal Welfare Act. The
disposition of animals is necessary for APHIS officials to track/trace animals for health issues. The disposition of the
animals must be disclosed to an APHIS official upon request at the time of an inspection. Correct by March 7, 2017.
3.50(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
***The boards used to partially block the 1 inch by 1 inch floor openings in the rabbit cages appear to be treated
wood and particle board. The particle board has irregular edges that appear chewed. The boards could pose an
ingestion or injury hazard to the animals. Outdoor housing facilities for rabbits must be structurally sound,
maintained in good repair, and protect the rabbits from injury.
3.50(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL. Waste disposal
***The enclosures housing four rabbits had an accumulation of fecal and a dark yellow material under the raised
cages. There was an excessive amount of feces in the corners of each of the cages. Accumulations of manure can
lead to strong odors, attract pests, and may pose a disease hazard for the animals. The accumulation of fecal
material must be removed for the health and well-being of the animals and to maintain an effective pest control
program.
3.53(a)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General
The floor of the rabbit enclosure has 1 inch by 1 inch openings. The feet of the chocolate satin rabbits housed in this
cage can pass through the opening easily. Particle boards have been placed in the enclosure, however it does not
cover the entire cage floor and may cause addition problems (See Section 3.50(a)). Primary enclosures must be
constructed in a manner that protects the feet and legs from injury. The floor of the rabbit enclosure must be
modified to safely prevent the feet of the rabbit from passing through.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Along the left of the enclosure housing four mouflon sheep, the chain link fencing t is curled upward into the
enclosure. A piece of wood has been placed over the section of fence, However, it is not secured in a manner that
will prevent injury.
***The portion of fence along the right side of the goat enclosure housing two adults and two kids, is curled upward,
extending into the enclosure.
Unsecured fencing the curls into an enclosure could cause injury to a hoof or leg of an animal walking the fence
line. The curled fencing must be repaired or secured in a manner that will prevent injury to the animals.
***Due to ground erosion, gap has formed between the ground and portions of the bottom of the fence on right side
of the pen housing six deer. The gap approximately 3 inches and is large enough to allow the entry of unwanted
animals or objects. It also could be a point of escape or injury Enclosure should be constructed in a manner that
protects the animals and prevents escape. Measures must be taken to eliminate the gap and prevent the problem
from reoccurring.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of Enclosures
***The squirrel cage has an excessive amount of feces, sunflower seeds, and peanut hulls in the bottom of thecage. Excess waste can become an attractant for pests and expose the animals to disease and therefore should be
removed as often as necessary to prevent build-up. Animal and food wastes must be removed from the bottom of
the squirrel cage at a frequency that will prevent the excessive accumulation of waste.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses approximately 50 regulated species and numerous non-regulated species. Based upon the
number of animals and non-complaint items related to cleaning, sanitation, waste disposal and maintenance there is
an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the husbandry responsibilities of the facility on a
daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of trained employees to carry out the day to day husbandry duties
and maintenance on the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is needed to ensure that cleaning, animal
observations, maintenance tasks, and pest control duties are performed at professionally acceptable level for the
number of animals housed at the facility.
