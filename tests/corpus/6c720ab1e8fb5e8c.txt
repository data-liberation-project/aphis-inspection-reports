HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the first run of the west sheltered housing area, a metal support pole has rusted partially through the pipe at the
bottom of the pole, leaving an exposed hole in the metal. This is a potential source of injury to the animals, and also
weakens the support pole. The pole must be repaired or replaced.
- In the third enclosure of the western housing area, the wall of the shelter itself is damaged and most the wall
section is missing. This is not an effective shelter, and does provide adequate protection for the dogs. This wall
must be replaced and maintained.
- On the north side of the main shelter building, two runs are missing the indoor/outdoor flaps. This allows wind and
rain to enter the sheltered housing area and could negatively impact the animals. These weather flaps must be
installed and maintained.
All items were corrected by the facility on the day of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
