2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:50 p.m. on
10/20/2015.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 1:50 p.m. and knocked on the door, no one answered. I called the phone
number for the facility and I was informed that the licensee was not available and that it could be a couple more
hours before he would be returning. The individual told me that I could try him on his cell phone. I called the cell
phone and there was no answer, I left a message. I then waited at the facility for 30 minutes before leaving.
