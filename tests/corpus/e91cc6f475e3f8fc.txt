3.1(a) Critical

Housing facilities, general.
According to the licensee, an 8-year-old female intact miniature Aussie, "Lacy," was turned out of the kennel and onto the
property to be kept as a "retired" dog on the property. Several weeks after having been let out to run loose on the
property, she was kicked by a horse and experienced a traumatic injury which required her euthanasia, according to the
licensee. Although the licensee considered Lacy to be a retired breeding dog, the licensee indicated that Lacy had
weaned a litter puppies prior to being turned out onto the property. Additionally, at the time of inspection, the facility's
inventory did not show that Lacy had been removed from the inventory at the time of her injury.

The housing facility is not protective of the dogs, as one of the facility's dog was injured severely as a result of having
been outside unrestricted and unsecured from other animals.

Housing facilities for dogs must protect animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from
entering.
