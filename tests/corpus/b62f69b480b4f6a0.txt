2.75(b)(1)(iv)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Several sales (disposition) records for both hedgehogs and short tail possums were missing an address for the
buyer. Complete disposition records are necessary to allow for tracing of ownership of the animals.
All disposition records of animals shall include the name and address of the person to whom the animal was sold or
given.

WATERING.
Approximately eight enclosures housing hedgehogs contained water bottles that had visible green growth on the
inside of the water bottle on the surfaces of the top and upper sides of the bottles. Contaminated water may not be
potable leading to the hedgehogs choosing not to drink or may lead to spread of disease/illness.
All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Approximately 20 percent of the hedgehog enclosures were noted to have wet and dirty shavings in them. There
was a distinct ammonia odor in the hedgehog room and the odors were stronger at the enclosure level (when they
were pulled forward to be inspected). The wet shavings were very evident from the underside of the enclosures. All
feeding is done on the shavings so in these enclosures the feed is contaminated by the wet/soiled shavings. Some
of the hedgehogs could not avoid the contamination as there were no clean areas of shavings. Several of the
enclosures had walls with brown streaks staining them at the height the hedgehogs were scratching at the walls.
Excreta including urine and fecal contaminated shavings must be removed from the enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent contamination, minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
