CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
One enclosure two housing shiba inus in the sheltered whelping building has an excess of feces in the outdoor
portion of the enclosure. The feces line the sides of the enclosure and are dry and covered with hair. The facility
representative stated that this enclosure was last spot cleaned to remove feces before the weekend. (The
inspection day is Monday.) An excessive accumulation of feces can attract pests, contribute to odors, and play a
role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that excreta and food wastes are removed from the primary
enclosures daily and from under primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of
feces and food waste. Correct by 11 August 2015.
The two dogs, female shiba inu (ID # 941000013052495) and male Chinese pug (ID # OAO1137624) cited on 8
May 2015 have been examined by the attending veterinarian.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMOand Kendall Lundy, ACI.
