PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Under protocol AN-636 records indicate a piglet (L182-12) was born on September 23, 2017 and documented to
have trouble nursing. Supportive care was provided to assist with feeding by research personnel. Records indicate
that at 900 on September 24, 2017 the piglet was identified as weak, small and not receiving adequate nutrition per
veterinary assessment. Laboratory staff began formula feeding every three hours. The next documented entry
occurs on September 25, 2017 at 0200 stating the piglet was found dead. Staff indicated that the piglet was fed on
a 3 hour schedule and appeared stable, but did not recognize the need to document the care and observations.
The facility must ensure that all personnel involved in animal care and use are appropriately qualified and trained.
Animal observations, record keeping and documentation are integral parts of humane animal care and necessary
for assurance that animal distress is minimized. The facility should review review personnel qualifications including
research technicians, laboratory staff and scientists. Training and instruction should be provided regarding the
record-keeping and documentation necessary to demonstrate compliance with acceptable standards for animal
treatment, care and use. Correct by: October 29, 2017.
This inspection was conducted with CCM and RCS staff. The exit interview was conducted with the IACUC Vice
Chair, AV, CCM and RCS staff.
