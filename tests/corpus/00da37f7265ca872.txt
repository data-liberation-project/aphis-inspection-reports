HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** The prairie dog's exhibit allows the public to touch the animals through the wire mesh top. The owner also stated
that the prairie dogs can jump and grab the wire. For the safety of the animal and the public there needs to be a
public barrier to prevent them from putting their fingers through the wire. During public exhibition, any animal must
be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers
between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by

promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently
accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed
by the attending veterinarian.This plan must be made available to APHIS upon request. Correct by August 27, 2015
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** The perimeter fence that borders the giraffe barn has areas where outside animals can gain access to the park.
The perimeter fence consists of dead pine trees on the bottom third and cow panel on the top two-thirds. In some
areas there is a clearing between the pine trees and the cow panels that needs to be sealed to keep predators out
of the park for the safety of the animals. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals by restrictingunauthorized humans, and animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going through it or under it. Correct
