Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Shih Tzu (microchip #004364872) has poor dental health. On the left side there is a buildup of thick light
brownish material on the upper canine and cheek teeth completely covering the third cheek tooth. Adjacent gum areas
are inflammed and receding. On the right side, some of the upper front teeth, the canine tooth, and all of the cheek teeth
are also mostly covered with the same light brownish material. The gums are also inflamed and have receded to the point
that the bone or root of the tooth is exposed above the area of the 1st upper cheek tooth and the 2nd cheek tooth is loose,
moving easily when touched. This dog last received dental care from the attending veterinarian in May 2020.

Male Shih Tzu (microchip 047377258) has poor dental health. A heavy buildup of brownish material is on the left upper
canine tooth and the remaining cheek teeth is completely covered. There is a greyish material at the gum lines of these
teeth and the adjacent gums are very inflamed. The right side the gums are also very inflamed over the affected teeth,
with the upper canine and cheek teeth covered in a thick layer of brownish material that turns to grey near the gum line.
This dog last received dental care from the attending veterinarian in January 2020.

Male Shih Tzu (microchip #004521009) has poor dental health and was observed licking around the right side of his
mouth. Examination revealed a heavy covering of a greyish brown material over the left upper front tooth, upper canine,

and upper cheek tooth. The material is heaviest along the gum line and the gums are very inflamed to the point that they
are bleeding above the cheek tooth. On the right side, there is a similar thick buildup of the greyish brown material on the
upper canine and cheek teeth. On this side the gums are also very inflamed and receding over the cheek teeth. The
second upper cheek tooth is loose and moves easily when touched. This dog last received dental care from the attending
veterinarian on June 23, 2020.

Dental disease in dogs can be very painful. Buildup of tartar and other material on the teeth and along the gum lines can
lead to infections of the surrounding gums and bone that can lead to tooth loss and even systemic infections.

The above dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The licensee needs to work with their Attending Veterinarian to come up with an effective plan to prevent,
diagnose, and treat dental issues in timely manner.

Housing facilities, general.
In the Whelping Building, the outdoor portion of one enclosure, containing one dog, has numerous sharp points located at
the level of the animal. The sharp points consist of a broken piece of chain link fencing that is protruding into the
enclosure and a broken piece of wire flooring that is bent upward. The chain link gate has a section of coated wire
attached to the inside of it and numerous sharp points are sticking up along the top of it.

Enclosure #8 in the Male Building, containing two dogs, has broken chain link fencing that has created a sharp point at

the level of the dog.

Enclosure #7 in the Male Building, containing one dog, has a piece of wire in the flooring that has bent upward creating a
sharp point which the dog could step on.

Contact with sharp points could cause injury to the dog.

Housing facilities for dogs must be maintained in good repair and protect the animals from injury. The licensee must
either remove the sharp points or alter them in a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must
ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.

One enclosure located in the whelping building, containing one Shetland Sheepdog, has a large gap between the
enclosure gate and the flooring that could allow the dog's leg to pass through. The gap was large enough for the
inspector to pass her hand through. Gaps large enough to allow the feet and legs of a dog to pass through could result in
injury to the animal.

Housing facilities for dogs must be maintained in good repair and protect the animals from injury. The licensee must alter
the enclosure in a manner that eliminates the gap between the flooring and the gate. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.

In the Male Building the inspectors observed two empty enclosures in which the metal framework holding up the flooring
had broken causing the flooring to collapse. The following enclosures also have damage to the metal framework beneath
the flooring of the enclosures:

Enclosure #8: Contains 2 dogs. The metal framework along one side is rusted and broken and is is no longer attached to
the rest of the framework.

Enclosure #7: Contains one dog. The metal framework along one side is rusted and broken and is no longer attached to
the rest of the framework.

Enclosure #3: Contains one dog. The metal framework along one side is rusted and broken and is no longer attached to
the rest of the framework.

Enclosure #5: Contains one dog. The metal framework along one side and along both sides of the back section of the
enclosure has rusted and broken and is no longer attached to the rest of the framework.

Enclosure #10: Contains one dog. The metal framework along one side is rusted and broken and is no longer attached
to the rest of the framework.

Enclosure #11: Contains two dogs. The metal framework along both sides of the enclosure is rusted and broken and is

no longer attached to the rest of the framework.

Enclosure #12: Contains two dogs. The metal framework along one side is rusted and broken and is no longer attached
to the rest of the framework.

Broken metal framework could weaken the structural stability of the enclosure and could cause injury to the animals
should the framework collapse.

Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so they are structurally sound, maintained in good repair,
and protect the animals from injury. The licensee must alter the broken framework in a manner that ensures it is
structurally sound and protects the dogs from injury. The licensee must maintain all enclosures in good repair at all times.

In the Whelping Building there are at least three enclosures, containing a total of approximately three adult dogs and
three puppies, which have excessively damaged carpet squares. The edges of the carpet squares have been shredded
into long strands of material and the inspectors observed one puppy chewing and pulling on the damaged areas of the
carpet square. The damaged carpet squares could cause injury to an animal should it become entangled in the shredded
fibers and could have a negative impact on the health of an animal should it swallow damaged carpet materials.

Housing facilities for dogs must be maintained in good repair and protect the dogs from injury. The licensee must remove
the damaged carpet squares or alter them in a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must

maintain all enclosures in good repair at all times.

To be corrected by: The licensee removed two of the damaged carpets at the time of the inspection and all other carpets
must be in compliance by May 07, 2021.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
One enclosure in the Whelping Building, housing one dog, contains an excessive accumulation of feces. The licensee
stated that the enclosure was not cleaned yesterday. A buildup of feces could cause the dog to become soiled, could
attract pests, and could also increase the risk of disease.

Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily. The licensee must remove the feces from the
affected enclosure and ensure that all waste is removed from each enclosure daily.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
At least three enclosures in the Male Building, containing a total of four dogs, have a heavy buildup of dark brown colored
dirt and debris on the inside of the access doors. The licensee stated that the enclosures and doors were power washed
sometime in April. A buildup of dirt, debris and excreta could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

Used primary enclosures must be sanitized once every two weeks or more often if necessary to prevent the buildup of
dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease hazards. The licensee must remove the dirt and debris buildup from

the access doors and ensure they remain in a sanitized condition in order to support the health and well-being of the
dogs.
