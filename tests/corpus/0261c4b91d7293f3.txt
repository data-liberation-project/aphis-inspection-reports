Sanitation.
Some of the enclosures are wet and/or heavily soiled. Lower pens seem more commonly affected. Though cleaned and

disease. Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and
debris. A program must be developed and maintained which provides effective cleaning and sanitation.
