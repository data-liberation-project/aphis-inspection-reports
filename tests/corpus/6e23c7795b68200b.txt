CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Section 3.84(c) Housekeeping: The floor of the room housing the marmoset has holes in the linoleum floor and the
linoleum floor is coming up away from the walls. Debris is accumulating in the holes and gaps by the walls.
Accumulations of food debris may attract pests and animal waste/food debris may cause odors. The animal room
must be kept clean and in good repair to facilitate the husbandry practices required in subpart. The linoleum floor
must be repaired or replaced so the floor may be adequately cleaned to maintain the health of the animal, deter
pests and prevent odors. Correct by January 2, 2016.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(c) Storage: A large dish of food for the two hedgehogs is stored up on a ledge above the animals.
The food is just below the windowsill that has dead flies and cobwebs. The ledge is soiled with dirt, debris and
spilled food. The food for the hedgehogs is exposed to pests and debris. Eating contaminated food may cause the
animals to become ill. Supplies of food must be stored in facilities which adequately protect the food against
deterioration, molding and contamination by vermin. These areas must be cleaned and the food stored in facilities
to keep it free from contamination and to sustain its nutritive value to maintain the animals in good health. Correct
by November 3, 2015.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(b) Shelter from inclement weather: There are four kid goats housed in an enclosure with one igloo
shelter. The igloo shelter is not large enough to comfortably house all four goats. All animals kept outdoors must
be provided adequate shelter to afford them protection from inclement weather and to prevent discomfort to the
animals. Once the APHIS official identified the lack of adequate shelter, an employee put another shelter inside the
enclosure. Corrected during the inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with the co-owner.
