RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Some of the records (APHIS form 7006) did not include the method of transportation including the name of the
carrier or intermediate handler, or if a privately owner vehicle is used to transport a dog or puppy, the name of the
owner of the privately owned vehicle. The method of transport including the name of carrier, intermediate handler,
or name of the person if a private owner must be listed on APHIS form 7006 to help keep track of animal shipments.
