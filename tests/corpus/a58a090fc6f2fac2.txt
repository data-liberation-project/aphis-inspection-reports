2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A licensed veterinarian visited the facility on 1/15/2020 and 2/20/2020 and observed animals and we saw there
were at least 20 animals that the facility had identified and was treating (mostly for eye conditions) prior to
inspection. Some of the animals under treatment appeared to have resolving conditions. However, there were four
animals with conditions in need of veterinary care that had not been identified prior to inspection:
Chinchilla labeled with paper card RVDK J144 and housed close to bank 29 had eyes that were crusted shut. Its
right eyelids were swollen and had some hair loss. The licensee handled it to look closer and the eyes had a thick
pale discharge. The licensee treated it and added it to the treatment plan.
White female chinchilla housed in 30C: one eye (its left) had eyelids that were swollen, had hair loss around the
eyelids, and it had some discharge in the eye. It was added to the treatment plan by the licensee.
Grey female chinchilla housed in 47D was unkempt and had a scab under its collar. We asked the licensee to
handle it so we could look closer and found that the underside of the collar was embedded into the neck. The
licensee removed the collar; and I observed hair loss, a putrid odor, and a granular and liquid pale discharge in the
area where the collar had been embedded. Ensure that the attending veterinarian's treatment plan is followed for
this chinchilla.
Indirect non-compliance:
A female chinchilla housed in 75 was noted to be excessively drooling and not chewing its food properly. The
licensee handled it for a closer look and we saw that its lower front (incisor) teeth were long and did not allow the
chinchilla close its mouth in a normal manner. Overgrown teeth can be painful and can cause improper chewing
and lead to malnutrition. Ensure that the attending veterinarian's treatment plan is followed for this chinchilla.
Overgrown teeth, the eye problems and the embedded collar noted above are conditions that are not acute (not
recently occurring with the past 24 hours) and that these conditions were overlooked in daily observations. The
facility must develop and maintain a method of daily observations of the animals so that conditions in need of
veterinary care are identified and promptly treated per the veterinarian's instructions.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee pointed out and demonstrated that enclosures are being replaced/repaired as a routine practice,
however; thirteen chinchilla enclosures or feeders in the enclosures were in disrepair during the time of inspection
and are in need of repair or need to be replaced:
-One enclosure had a five by one and a half inch hole in the floor with wire points exposed to the chinchillas. This
hole was large enough to potentially allow the animals to escape. Note: The licensee moved the animals in this
enclosure to another enclosure that did not contain holes and points in them during the inspection.
-Two adult chinchillas in two separate enclosures were observed moving through a hole in their wire walls into
adjacent enclosures. The edges of both holes contained sharp wires that were exposed to the animals. Note: The
licensee moved both animals to different enclosures that did not contain holes and points in them during the
inspection.
-No fewer than ten of the feeders front edges have rusted to the extent that rough and sharp edges are exposed to
the chinchillas.
Holes in enclosures, sharp points, and rusted feeder edges could cause injury to the chinchillas. Ensure that items
and enclosures are repaired or replaced to protect the health of the chinchillas.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
