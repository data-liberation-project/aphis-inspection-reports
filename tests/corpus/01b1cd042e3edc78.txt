2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1550 on
20-Sep-17. I went to the licensee's property. The licensee was not there. A facility representative contacted the
licensee by phone. The licensee said she wanted her husband to be there for the inspection but she was not able
to get a hold of him by phone. I told her I would wait for a half hour and if he didn't show up I would leave. I waited
for a half hour and he never showed up. I then left.
End of report.
