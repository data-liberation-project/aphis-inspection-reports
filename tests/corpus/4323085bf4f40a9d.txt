ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One aged skunk was noted at the time of inspection to have thin hair over the extent of its back from the neck to the
base of the tail. The attending veterinarian had examined the animal last fall after which the hair loss became
apparent. The veterinarian prescribed cosequin and meloxicam for lameness, but according to the director, did not
do bloodwork to further evaluate the animal. Bloodwork has not been done since that time, and records show that
the animal has had periodic episodes of vomiting since September 2015, in addition to developing hair loss. Failure
to diagnose conditions or to followup when treatment does not correct issues can cause unnecessary discomfort,
pain or distress to the animals. Correct by having the animal examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis of hairloss
and vomiting. Records from the veterinarian regarding diagnosis, treatment and prognosis for all animals with
conditions (acute or chronic) must be maintained by the facility and available for review by USDA personnel. To be
corrected by: 27 June 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility director.
