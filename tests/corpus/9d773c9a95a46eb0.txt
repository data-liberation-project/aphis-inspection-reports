OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** An outside run on the west side of the kennel area contained two adult German Shepherds with access to one
dog house. This shelter does not provide adequate space for both dogs to enter the shelter and make normal
postural adjustment simultaneously. Additional shelter space must be provided to allow all dogs within the
enclosure to enter the sheltered space with space to turn, stand and lie down freely. To be corrected by: 08/23/14
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner. The report is to be sent via email.
