2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care form states that the arctic foxes are to be treated monthly with Frontline for
ectoparasites. The licensee has other written instructions from the attending veterinarian as of 25 May 2016 to use
NexGard for the foxes for flea control at least through August. The licensee states that one arctic fox was treated
with NexGard at the time it was recommended in May but has not been given the NexGard or Frontline since.
Failure to follow the program of veterinary care and other written directions from the attending veterinarian can
result in a variety of medical and husbandry problems for the animals. The licensee must use appropriate methods
to control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries as directed by the attending veterinarian.
3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The resting surfaces, climbing ladders, and some spots on the walls in two sheltered capuchin enclosures were still
visibly soiled. The licensee states that these were last sprayed clean about 2 weeks ago. There was also an
accumulation of feces in the indoor section of one sheltered black-and-white lemur enclosure. The licensee states
the feces were last removed from this enclosure two days ago. Failure to clean hard surfaces with which nonhuman
primate come into contact can result in odors, attraction of pests, and general unsanitary conditions and can also
play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces that nonhuman primates come
into contact with are spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.84 of subpart F to prevent accumulation
of excreta or disease hazard. If species scent mark, the surfaces must be sanitized or replaced at regular intervals
as determined by the attending veterinarian in accordance with generally accepted professional and husbandry
practices.
3.77(a)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The sheltered portion of three sheltered buildings housing non-human primates had ambient temperatures above 85
degrees F as measured by the inspector(cid:25)s kestrel thermometer for more than 4 hours during the inspection.
-The "snow" building had the following ambient temperatures in degrees F: 89.6- 90.0 at 1:33 pm; 91.6 at 2:56 pm;
and 91.9 at 6:23 pm. -The "capuchin" building had the following ambient temperatures in degrees F: 88.8 at 1:42; 91.2 at 3:03 pm; and
93.1 at 6:27pm.
-The "colobus" building had the following ambient temperatures in degrees F: 87.7 at 1:52 pm; 87.1 at 3:09 pm, and
88.2 at 6:32.
Inability to protect the nonhuman primates from temperature extremes can result in discomfort for the animals and
inability to maintain a safe body temperature. The licensee must ensure that the sheltered housing facilities be
sufficiently heated and cooled when necessary to protect the nonhuman primates from temperature extremes. The
ambient temperature in the sheltered part of the facility must not rise above 85 degrees F for more than 4
consecutive hours when nonhuman primates are present unless temperatures above 85 degrees are approved by
the attending veterinarian. Correct by 7 August 2016.
3.81(c)(4)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There is an individually housed Pata's monkey in a sheltered housing at the facility. The environmental
enhancement plan written by the licensee states that the Pata's monkey will be housed in pairs. There are no
special considerations in the environmental enhancement plan to address the needs of this individually housed
animal. The licensee must ensure that the environmental enhancement plan outlines the special attention regarding
the enhancement of the environment of individually housed nonhuman primates that are unable to see and hear
nonhuman primate species of their own or compatible species. Correct by 1 Sept. 2016.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The area around the water receptacle for the zebras is covered with mud and standing water. These animals
cannot approach the water receptacles without walking through the mud and standing water. Standing water and
mud can also attract pests and can lead to an increase in disease transmission. A suitable method must be
established to rapidly eliminate excess water.
This routine inspection was conducted on 1 Aug. 2016 with facility representatives as well as Dr. Margaret Shaver,
VMO and Kendall Lundy, ACI
The exit interview was conducted with a facility representative on 2 Aug. 2016.
