Sanitation.
There are accumulations of excreta, hay, bedding and hair on the drainboards below the wire rabbit enclosures.
Infrequent cleaning can expose the rabbits to high ammonia odors which can increase disease hazards. Primary
enclosures that have wire or mesh floors, the troughs, drainboards, or pans must be cleaned at least once each week to
maintain sanitary conditions. Correct by December 15, 2022.
