The juvenile black bear has hair loss all across the chest, the back of the ears, and around the eyes. He was not
noticed to be indicating any skin irritation such as itching or rubbing the areas of hair loss. This condition needs to
be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to determine what is causing the hair loss. The facility owner contacted
the attending veterinarian immediately and made an appointment for him to examine the juvenile bear on the day of
this inspection.
The peccary housed by itself in the central section of the exhibit area has a red and inflamed area around its right
eye with some crusty excretion. There is also an elongated toe on the front right hoof that needs to be trimmed to
return it to normal length before it impacts his ability to walk normally.
The attending veterinarian needs to examine the eye and determine a treatment plan for it and a plan for trimming
the feet, with special attention to the long toe on the front right hoof.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This and the previous inspection are indicating a possible pattern of personnel not performing adequate daily
assessment of animal health and communicating that information to supervisors and the attending veterinarian.
Personnel should be trained and expected to examine each animal daily and report any health conditions or
abnormal behavior to the appropriate supervisor and or the attending veterinarian. This type of daily health
assessment will (cid:28)catch(cid:29) many health issues that can be addressed before they become serious conditions. This
program of daily health assessment and communication needs to be set up, put into effect, and maintained to
ensure the overall health and well-being of the animal collection.
