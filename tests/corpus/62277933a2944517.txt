ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On Feb 14, 2015 electrical power was lost to the barn that housed the Capybaras and Rabbits. The owner did not
realize that the animals were without heat for several hours with temperatures reported to be 40 below.
The capybara(cid:25)s exposure to lower temperatures led to frost bitten areas on the feet and ears. There was initial
communication with the attending veterinarian via electronic communications (text messaging) but the animals
were not examined by the veterinarian to properly diagnose the extent of injuries. When the animals were finally
examined several weeks later, the veterinarian determined euthanasia as best option to prevent further suffering of
the animals.
Vet care including appropriate methods to diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries needs to be addressed at this
facility for the health of the remaining animals there.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The licensee notified the attending veterinarian via text message of the potential for frostbite on the capybara's
feet and ears. The licensee soaked the animals feet and gave antibiotics but did not communicate to the vet their
condition for several weeks until he contacted the vet again to say "the situation looked grim, the female's front feet
look dead and the males foot fell off and is just barely hanging on". The licensee did not take the animals to the vet
for assessment nor did he have frequent communication with the vet so that timely and accurate information was
conveyed. This would have ensured adequate vet care was being provided. This needs to be addressed
immediately for the health care of the remaining animals at the facility.

On Feb 14, 2015 the power went out for the barn housing the capybara(cid:25)s and rabbits. The facility has no method of
monitoring the temperatures throughout the day to assure the animals were comfortable and no back- up method in
place when loss of power occurred. As a result the Capybara's sustained areas of frostbite to their ears and feet.
Maintaining adequate temperatures is vital for animal health in various weather seasons and conditions. This overall
issue of loss of power and lack of monitoring temperatures needs to be addressed for the health of the animals
remaining at the facility.

An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection and again via phone prior to receiving
the report.
