Primary enclosures.
On 2/20/2022, a female cynomolgus macaque escaped from her enclosure after hours and received a small bite wound
on her toe from another NHP in the room. The NHP was discovered on top of her cage the following morning and was
immediately examined and cared for by the veterinary staff. An enlarged opening was noted between the cage and the
exercise tunnel that allowed the animal to escape. Husbandry staff placed additional plastic straps to the firmly secure
the exercise tunnel to the enclosure to prevent recurrence. All other enclosures with exercise tunnels were similarly
secured.
All nonhuman primate enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain the animals securely and
prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.
