ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current written program of veterinary care (PVC) does not include the opossum that was acquired in June of
2014. The PVC should include all the covered animals to ensure the facility has a written guide to follow, approved
by the attending veterinarian, concerning the health and care of the animals. A system should be in place and
maintained to ensure the PVC reflects the current inventory of covered animals.
To be corrected by August 1, 2015
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representaitve.
