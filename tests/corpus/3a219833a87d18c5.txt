3.13(c)(3) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection, the following animals had just arrived at the KLM cargo office:
A cat on waybill number 074-51153804, from Moscow, on flight KL-904, via Amsterdam.
A dog on waybill number 074-48062501, from Edinburgh, U.K., on flight KL-1286 and KL-605, via Amsterdam.
Neither animal's crate had documentation regarding the time the animal had last been offered food and water prior
to shipment, and no instructions from the shipper regarding feeding and watering during travel.
Failure to ensure that the shipper provides certification in writing regarding feeding and watering instructions at the
time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment can put the animal at risk. This information should be clearly displayed
on the carrier, during transit. The airline must ensure that the owner has provided this information in writing, in order
to help ensure that animals are adequately cared for while in transit.
3.14(a)(6) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At the time of inspection, a cat on waybill number 074-51153804, on flight KL-904 from Moscow, via Amsterdam,
had just arrived at the KLM cargo office.
Its crate had a label attached to one side, with an illustration depicting a dog, fish, some chicks, and a turtle, and
"LIVE ANIMALS" in small print.
Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it should be clearly marked on top and on one or
more sides with the words ``Live Animals,'' in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high to help ensure proper handling by
transportation personnel.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a representative at the cargo office.
