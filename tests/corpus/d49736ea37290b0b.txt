2.31(d)(5) Critical

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC is responsible for conducting regular reviews of activities related to the care and use of animals to ensure that
all activities are in accordance with the facility protocols, SOPs, and Animal Welfare Regulations.
Protocol A-202007-1 states that “if animals will be housed in labs or anywhere else outside the central facility vivarium for
more than 24 hours (12 hours for USDA-regulated species),” justification must be provided. During this inspection, about
a dozen animals were found in a lab outside of the approved vole room in the central vivarium. When asked how long the
animals had been in the unapproved area, the response was 11 days. The IACUC and the LARC supervisor were
unaware these animals were being housed in the lab. No protocol amendments were provided justifying or explaining the
deviation from approved housing.
At the time of this inspection, several cages of voles were found to be housing 3 animals, both in the approved vole
housing rooms and in the lab. The cages were divided in half with a Plexiglas panel with perforated holes to physically
separate the voles. A pair of voles were being housed on one side and a single vole was on the other side.
Nowhere in protocol A-202007-1 does it discuss a model using 3 voles housed in this way.
Protocol A-202007-1 states that anytime animals are used in one of the social defeat models, attendants will be present to
observe and intervene if necessary and the length of the studies with more than 1 animal would not exceed 1 hour. At the


time of this inspection no one was observing the interaction with the 3 voles and it was apparent from the amount of feces
in the vole cages that they had been in those cages longer than 1 hour.
The IACUC has failed to ensure that this PI has conducted activities in accordance with facility SOPs and the approved
protocol. In failing to ensure this PI adhered to approved standards, animals have been living in a stressful environment
for an extended period of time causing extended discomfort for these animals.
The facility needs to ensure the principal investigator for this protocol is conducting activities in accordance with the
description of that activity outlined in the protocol approved by the IACUC and following approved SOPs outlining
husbandry and housing requirements.

Sanitation.
Several of the vole enclosures, both in the approved vole housing rooms and in the lab, had an excessive accumulation of
feces. There were no areas within these enclosures that were free of contamination. Exposure to excessive fecal
contamination can predispose the animals to illness however none of the voles were showing signs of illness at this time.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
The facility needs to increase the frequency of cage changes for these animals.
