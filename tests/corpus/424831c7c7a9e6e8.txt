FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* One enclosure housing one rabbit has an accumulation of fecal waste on 25 to 30 percent of available surface
flooring. The waste buildup is located in outdoor housing. The licensee stated that the last time fecal waste had
been removed from the enclosure was two weeks ago. Unsanitary living conditions exist that could lead to potential
contamination, odors or disease risks. The licensee must ensure that fecal waste is removed often enough to
minimize any potential contamination, odors or disease risks. Correct by 4/21/14.

According to the noaa website ( weather.gov. ) the lowest recorded air temperature in the last 24 hours was 39
degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest recorded wind chill for the area was 33 degrees Fahrenheit. This can affect the
rabbits ability to maintain a safe body temperature and conserve body heat. The licensee shall provide adequate
housing for all rabbits kept outdoors when the atmospheric temperature falls below 40 [deg]F.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The wood plywood located below the asphalt shingles on the roof in one enclosure has a roughened surface due
to deterioration from wood rot. The affected wood surface is located in outdoor housing. One goat is in contact with
the wood roof surface. Further deterioration or wood rot can affect the structural strength of the wood surface. If
exposed wood becomes ingested, it could cause potential digestion problems. The licensee must ensure all
outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair at all times to protect the animals from injury.
