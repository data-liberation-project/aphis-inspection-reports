OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shelter
In an outdoor enclosure, containing 4 dogs, the shelters are not large enough to contain all animals comfortably at
the same time. Shelters need to be large enough for all dogs to escape the elements of weather. The licensee
needs to provide additional and adequate shelter or remove 2 dogs from the enclosure. The licensee must ensure
that all dogs housed in an outdoor enclosure have access to shelter that is large enough so that each animal can
sit, stand, lie in a normal fashion, and turn about freely at all times.
