ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was missing the required frequency for regularly scheduled visits by
the attending veterinarian (AV) to the site premises. Formal arrangements with the facility's AV must include
regularly scheduled visits to the premises. To ensure adequate veterinary care to regulated animals, the licensee
and the AV should review and update the PVC as soon as possible.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A large accumulation of debris consisting mainly of dead vegetation was observed in very close proximity to the
northwest portion of the perimeter fence. Removal and disposal of debris/trash at the facility's buildings and
grounds are paramount to minimize vermin infestation into primary enclosures and potential disease hazards to
regulated animals. Debris and trash at the facility should be removed and properly disposed as soon as possible.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility's perimeter fence was found in need of repair along the south and northwest portions. The barb wire
lines that rest on the extension arms of the fence were out of place and/or damaged along the affected fence
portions. The facility's perimeter fence must be maintained in good repair and be structurally sound so that it
protects regulated animals by restricting vermin and/or unauthorized persons from going through it, over it, or under
it, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals at the premises. The perimeter
fence needs to be repaired/replaced as soon as possible.
