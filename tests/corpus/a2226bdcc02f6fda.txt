HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is only a single rope barrier in front of several animal enclosures including the kulan, and a mixed species
enclosure housing blackbuck, zebra, nilgai, and aoudad. The single rope barrier is drooping close to the ground in
several areas making it easy to walk over the rope and come in contact with the animals. Sufficient public barriers
must be in place to protect the of the animals and for the safety of public. Sufficient barriers must be installed in
front of both camel enclosures, kulan, and the mixed species enclosure housing blackbuck, a zebra, a nilgai, and
aoudads.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Lion Enclosure:
Structural strength: Lion Enclosure: The enclosure is 80 feet x 70 feet and 12 feet in height with no overhang or
electric wire. The enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel
poles, 4 inches in diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest
upon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep
roots - no lower branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is
approximately 4 feet from the enclosure fence. There is now an 8 foot high tensile wire barrier fence approximately
20 feet from the front of the enclosure.
The enclosure currently houses a -4 year old male lion and a – 3 year old female lion with limited mobility. The
enclosure is only 12 feet in height. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that will ensure
containment of healthy big cats. Based upon known physical and behavioral characteristics of exotic cats,
modifications to the enclosure to increase the height must be made to prevent escape.
NOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014 and recommendations were made.
*** The following additional structural strength items were noted during this inspection:Primary enclosure fencing in several areas of the llama and deer fallow enclosures had large gaps at the base of
the fencing which could allow entry of unwanted animals. These gaps tended to occur at areas of water drainage
where the ground had washed away.
The primary fencing of the fallow deer enclosure (across from the camel enclosure) is bowed and bent at the top of
the fence. This damage to the fence could potentially lead to further collapse thus not keeping the fallow deer
secure in their enclosure.
All primary animal enclosures shall be structurally sound, maintained in good repair and constructed in a manner to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The bears are housed in a 20’ x 20’ x 12’ chain link enclosure with a concrete floor. Within the enclosure there is a
single tire swing, a water trough for the bears to climb in and a couple of loose small logs. The current structures
provide little stimulation for bears who typically enjoy climbing and digging. An elevated surface and substrate to
encourage digging should be added to the enclosure to allow the animal to demonstrate species typical behavior
and improve their psychological well-being. Correct by July 30, 2017.
NOTE: A new enclosure is under construction for the bears that will provide additional space and structures to
encourage species typical behavior.
The tigers are housed in a 30’ x 40’ x 10’ closed top enclosure with a dirt floor and a single elevated structure. No
water feature is available swim like activity. The current enclosure limits the species typical behaviors the three (3)
tigers could demonstrate. Tigers often engage in running, climbing, jumping and water play and should be housed in
a manner that allows them to demonstrate these natural behaviors. The current enclosure must be modified or
husbandry practices adjusted in a manner that will allow the tigers to jump, climb, run and water play to improve
their overall well-being. Correct by September 30, 2017.
NOTE: A new enclosure is under construction for the tigers that will provide additional space and structures to
encourage species typical behavior.
*** Tiger enclosure: The elevated platform within the enclosure will only allow 2 of the 3 tigers to climb upon it and
rest. Tigers typically use elevated surfaces to rest and observe their surroundings. There should be enough
elevated surfaces available within the enclosure for each animals to rest at the same time. An additional elevated
surface or an extension of the current platform must be constructed for the psychological well-being of all the tigers.Correct by July 30, 2017.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses approximately 175 regulated and non-regulated animals. There was only one keeper present
performing husbandry duties during the inspection. Based upon the number of housekeeping, maintenance, building
projects, there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform the day to day responsibilities for
maintaining the facility in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations. There must be a sufficient number of
employees to carry out the facility husbandry duties, repairs, and projects. The facility has contracted part-time labor
to initiate work on several renovation and fencing projects. Additional personnel must be obtained to maintain
routine upkeep of the facility in a timely manner to ensure the well-being and safety of the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
