SANITATION.
*** There was a lot of miscellaneous items and clutter just outside the first reindeer pen that needs to be cleaned up
and removed from the area. There were also empty discarded cat food cans in the main barn in an old feeder, and
empty bags and debris inside the barn. This area need to be kept clean and trash items need to be discarded in
appropriate areas to facilitate good housekeeping practices.
