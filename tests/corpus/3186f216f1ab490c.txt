2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There were people petting and feeding the animals in the petting zoo enclosures without any facility representatives
present. Unsupervised contact between animals and members of the public poses a potential risk both to the health
of the animals, and the welfare of the public. The licensee must ensure that a responsible, knowledgeable, and
readily identifiable employee or attendant is present at all times during periods of public contact.
To be corrected from this date forward.
3.75(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the chimpanzee barn, a ring-tailed lemur was outside its enclosure. The bars of the enclosure are not sufficient
to contain the animal. Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are
structurally sound for the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and
they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.
To be corrected from this date forward.
3.81(b) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The environmental enrichment provided for the non-human primates was not adequate. The facilities enhancement
plan states “The toys in their cage are changed on a regular basis.” There were at least ten enclosures housing 18
non-human primates with no toys in the enclosure. There were other enclosures with minimal enrichment but not
toys. The lack of environmental enhancement may lead to abnormal behavior patterns and decreased mental and
emotional health. The licensee must provide environmental enhancement in accordance with currently accepted
professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the
attending veterinarian that is appropriate for the species housed at the facility.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL. There were structures that were not being maintained.
***There were two enclosures housing two ligers and one tiger that did not have sufficient enclosure fencing. The
exterior fence was twelve feet high with a three foot kick-in at 90 degrees.
***There was one enclosure housing a juvenile tiger (approximately seven months old) with an insufficient enclosure
fence, The fence was six feet high without any kick-in.
***There was loose metal on several shelters in the drive-through portion of the facility. The sheet metal was pulled
away from the support structure and in most instances was within reach of the animals contained in the enclosures.
***The wood platforms in the big cat area on the hill were deteriorating. There were broken pieces of wood, nails
exposed, sharp points exposed, and some of the platforms appeared unstable.
The broken metal shelters and sharp points could cause injury to the animals. The facility must be constructed of
such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals. The housing facility shall be structurally sound
and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals. Big cat enclosures must
have enclosure fencing that is twelve feet high with a three foot kick-in at 45 degrees or have a 16 foot high fence.
The licensee must remove all sharp points or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the animals.
The metal on the shelters must be repaired and/or replaced. The wood platforms must be repaired and/or replaced.
3.127(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was insufficient shade in two enclosures housing three lions. These are the same enclosures cited on the
May 24, 2016, and October 12, 2016, inspection reports. There were no trees in the enclosure that provide shade.
A tarp was placed on a portion of the west fence but does not provide shade for most of the day. The lack of shade
can cause pain and distress to the animals. It also inhibits the animals ability to thermoregulate and prevent
overheating. The licensee must provide shade in these enclosures.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative and Jeff Baker, Veterinary Medical
Officer.
