Sec. 2.40 Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors) (b) Each dealer or exhibitor
shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include: (2).
* Female, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, "(cid:28)Raven"(cid:29) with no identification has a dry appearance to the surface of her
eyes. Both eyes also have pigment and a rough surface on the surfaces. The (cid:28)whites(cid:29) of the eyes are red. There is
a dried dark discharge around the eyelids of both eyes and a small amount of mucus on the surfaces of the eyes.
Eye problems can be caused by a variety of problems and can be painful.
* Female, Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, "(cid:28)Twix"(cid:29) with number 4B170B1905 has blue/white color to the entire surface
of her left eye. The color on the surface of the eye makes it difficult to see into the eye. Eye problems can be
caused by a variety of problems and can be painful. This dog also has gums that have receded away from the
(cid:28)"cheek teeth(cid:29)" (premolars) and molars on the top of both sides of the mouth that have exposed the tooth roots.
There is also an accumulation of brown material coating about half of the canine teeth and the molars. Dental
disease can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of
the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal.
* Male, Maltese, (cid:28)"Mischief"(cid:29) with number 4A3B2A7E34 has an accumulation of brown material completely coating
and obscuring the "(cid:28)cheek teeth"(cid:29) (premolars) and molars and about half of the canine teeth. The first upper (cid:28)cheek
teeth(cid:29) were loose when touched. The gums are red and have receded away from the surface of the "(cid:28)cheek teeth(cid:29)"
and molars. There is a white, creamy discharge along the upper gum line. Dental disease can cause damage to the
gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting
the overall health of the animal.
* Male Chinese Crested with number 4A3A0O767E has an accumulation of brown material completely coating and
obscuring the "(cid:28)cheek teeth(cid:29)" (premolars) and molars and most of the canine teeth. The gums are red and have
receded away from the canine teeth and some of the molars. Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue
and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall
health of the animal.** The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian by the close of business on 26
February 2014 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed. The licensee must document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the
inspector upon request.
* Male, Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, "(cid:28)Pete"(cid:29) with number 471470001A has a matted coat. The mats are on all four
limbs and are tight against the skin. Matted hair can cause skin infections and become painful. In addition, matted
coats do not provide complete protection against the elements. The licensee must remove the matted hair. As part
of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of hair coat maintenance
to ensure that animals are cleaned when their hair coats become soiled and that matted hair is removed on a
regular basis.
* There is a bottle of "(cid:28)Excede"(cid:29) Injectable and a bottle of Oxytocin injectable with no directions for appropriate use
from the attending veterinarian. These medications were found intermingled with other medications in the whelping
building refrigerator and are therefore considered ready for use. Lack of approved instructions can lead to misuse of
a medication. The licensee must ensure that all medications are used in a manner consistent with the provision of
adequate veterinary care to protect the health of the animals and ensure drugs are used in an appropriate manner.
All medications must be labeled and administered properly as part of the facility(cid:25)s programs of adequate veterinary
care.
2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Sec. 2.50 Time and method of identification. (a) A class ``A'' dealer (breeder) shall identify all live dogs and cats on
the premises as follows: (1).
* (cid:28)"Raven"(cid:29) a black and tan female King Charles Cavalier is not identified. (cid:28)"Raven(cid:29)" was cited on this report for a
veterinary care problem.

record keeping requirements.
To be corrected by, 01-March-2014.3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces- (3) Cleaning.
* Eleven panel dividers, located in small dog kennel, have an excessive accumulation of brown to black waste on
their surfaces. This indicates that daily spot-cleaning is not taking place. An accumulation of waste can increase
the disease potential for the 18 adult dogs.
These surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b )to prevent an accumulation of waste
and reduce disease hazards for the dogs.
3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
Sec. 3.9 Feeding. (b).
* Three metal self-feeders, used to feed six adult dogs in the large dog kennel, have an excessive accumulation of
brown debris in the area where the dogs eat out of. This indicates the feeders are not being cleaned often enough.
Improper cleaning and sanitization can increase the disease hazards for the dogs.
All self-feeders must be kept clean and must be sanitized. Measures must be taken to ensure that there is no
molding, deterioration and caking of feed. Clean and sanitized feeders will prevent disease risk for animals.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
