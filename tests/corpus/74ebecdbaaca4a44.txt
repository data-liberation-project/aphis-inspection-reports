Handling of animals.
At the time of inspection, the facility reported an adverse incident that occurred the previous summer. On 12 Aug 2020,
an employee violated the protocol for handling animals in hot weather and placed the long tailed weasel in a carrier when
it was over 100* F to clean the enclosure; without putting the carrier in the air conditioned building or providing ice packs.
The long tailed weasel was found dead in the carrier due to the actions of the employee. The facility took corrective
action by immediately terminating the employee for violation of protocol resulting in an animal death and retrained the
current employees on the protocols for handling animals during hot weather.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Curator of Animal Programs.
