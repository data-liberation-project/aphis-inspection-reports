FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Two coati mundi are housed in an outdoor enclosure which is partitioned in the middle. Neither of the two separate
living areas has a shelter box for the individual coati mundi living in that section. Shelter must be provided for all
animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals during inclement
weather. A shelter box must be added to each of the two sections of this outdoor enclosure to provide adequate
shelter for both coati mundi. To be corrected by: November 25, 2015.
