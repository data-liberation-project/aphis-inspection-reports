Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocol M1800049-01 is approved for use of a large number of ferrets. The protocol as approved does not contain a
rationale for the appropriateness of the numbers of ferrets to be used. The protocol gives a general overview of three
phases of the research including model validation, treatment and vaccination. The description in the 'numbers justification'
section of the protocol is not consistent with this overview and asks for numbers of animals in groups that are not
specifically identified/described in the overview or elsewhere in the protocol. An attachment to the protocol includes a
second requested number of ferrets to be used that is over 200 animals less than in the actual body of the protocol.
An animal use proposal must include a rationale for the appropriateness of the numbers of animals to be used so that the
IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee) can conduct a thorough review of the components of the activities
related to the care and use of animals and determine that the proposed activities are in accordance with the Animal
Welfare Act. Correct prior to use of any ferrets on this proposal.
3.83 Critical

Watering.
On the morning of Saturday March 26, 2022 the animal care technician found that one rack of squirrel monkeys (housing
5 monkeys on study) was askew and the water line to the rack was disconnected from the water supply. The monkeys


appeared fine and the water supply was reattached and flow verified. A vet tech checked on the monkeys that morning-no
issues identified. On the morning of Sunday March 27, 2022 the animal care technician noted that one squirrel monkey
was lying on the floor of its enclosure. The vet tech started triage and called the veterinarian who arrived quickly. The
monkey was hypothermic, in lateral recumbency and appeared dehydrated. Supportive care was provided and due to lack
of response the monkey was euthanized a few hours later. A second monkey was found to be alert but with ataxia and
tremors of the hind limbs. Treatment and supplementation were supplied, and this monkey made a full recovery. The
other three monkeys remained clinically normal. A necropsy report for the monkey that died showed changes consistent
with low fluid volume and/or low blood pressure such as severe dehydration. The review of husbandry records conducted
by the IACUC showed that the monkeys most likely did not have access to water for a period of up to 17 hours which with
other factors such as age and study procedures may have contributed to the clinical presentation of the two affected
monkeys.
Access to a sufficient quantity of potable water is necessary for the monkeys to prevent dehydration and provide for good
overall health. If potable water is not continually available to the nonhuman primates, it must be offered to them as often
as necessary to ensure their health and well-being, but no less than twice daily for at least 1 hour each time, unless
otherwise required by the attending veterinarian or research approved by the Committee. The facility has conducted
retraining of husbandry staff and instituted additional daily checks of the watering system. Corrected prior to inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, the Director of the Office of Animal
Welfare Assurance and other facility representatives.
