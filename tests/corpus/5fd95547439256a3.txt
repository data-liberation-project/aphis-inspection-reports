Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The Yak, “Blossom” had overgrown hooves on both back feet. The inner hoof of the right rear foot is misshapen with an
angular curvature over the outer hoof. The hooves of the left rear foot also have abnormal curvature inward toward the
middle of this foot. A young, male bison “Cupid” had overgrown hooves on both front feet with abnormal, inward
curvatures of these hooves. Female Reindeer, “Spice”, had overgrown hooves on all four feet. The hooves on all feet had
abnormal inward curvatures. The dewclaws of all four feet were also severely overgrown with abnormal curvatures. The
overgrown hooves of these animals did not appear to cause any lameness or gait abnormalities at time of this inspection.
The overgrowth of hooves may cause the animals discomfort and lead to injuries or lameness if not appropriately
addressed. The facility must establish and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that includes a timely
schedule of hoof trimming and care.

A white, male sheep “Leonard” and a brown alpaca “Merlot” had unshorn, overgrown hair coats. The overgrown coats of
these animals did not appear to affect movement or postural adjustments or cause visible discomfort or stress at time of
inspection. Unshorn, overgrown hair coats may lead to stress, discomfort and medical issues in these animals including


overheating, underlying skin conditions or other injuries if not appropriately addressed. The facility must establish and
maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that includes timely scheduling of shearing when needed.

Facilities, general.
There was an approximately 2-foot section of wire fencing along the bottom in the Zebu pen which was in disrepair. The
wires in this section were bowed inward, crumpled, and broken apart with wire points protruding into the enclosure.

There was a sheep enclosure in disrepair. A section along one corner about 3 feet in length had a broken, jagged board
behind areas of broken and loose wire fencing with pointed ends protruding into the enclosure. In another section of this
enclosure was a large piece of a wooden panel in disrepair with a large opening having several broken, loose, splintered
pieces.

Fencing materials including boards and wires which are broken, damaged and in disrepair may cause injury to the


animals. Animals may become entangled in broken fencing and sharp points may cause lacerations or puncture wounds.
A system must be in place to ensure all enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(a)

Facilities, outdoor.
A sheep enclosure housing one sheep did not provide adequate shade. There were shaded areas in the enclosure;
however, there was not enough coverage for the sheep’s entire body during normal postural adjustments or movements.
At time of inspection there was no indication of overheating or discomfort for this animal. Outdoor enclosures with
inadequate shade may cause overheating or discomfort of the animals. Sufficient shade by natural or artificial means
must be provided to all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from the direct sunlight.

Sanitation.
There was a heavy accumulation of rodent feces spread along the floor next to the walls and corners and on the shelves
of a food storage shed for hoof stock. There is a pest control program in place for rodents including a few traps in this
shed; however, it appears to be ineffective. Pests and vermin may contaminate food as well as harbor and spread
diseases. A safe and effective pest control program must be established and maintained to protect the health and well-
being of the animals.
