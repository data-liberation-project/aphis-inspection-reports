NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
An inspection was attempted on 20 September 2016 at the address listed in ACIS and on the RBIS, but the licensee
was not the owner of the location at this address anymore. The new owner of the property stated that the licensee
had sold them the property June 1, 2016 and the licensee only had the kennel facility down the road. The licensee
must contact the regional office and give the proper address for the kennel.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a bottle of expired medication intermingled with other medications and vaccinations in the refrigerator in
the kennel area. It was a bottle of Cal-Pho-Sol with an expiration date of February 2008 and no labeled dosage or
directions for use. This medication was intermingled with other pharmaceuticals that are currently being used in the
sheltered facility and are therefore ready for use. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility
are not expired and are labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices and manufacturer's
recommendations.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The official APHIS USDA acquisition or dogs on hand sheets (7005's) had 48 dogs recorded on 3/3/2016, but there
were 42 adult dogs counted by the inspector. Also, a black, white, and tan chihuahua with microchip number
0007277D43 was recorded to be brindle on the 7005. When the records and dogs at the facility do not match it
makes the records incomplete. Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure each animal’s identity can be
known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace dogs. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate
records of all dogs at all times at their facility.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were rodent droppings accumulating on the storage stack unit holding food containers and bleach bottles.
The shelving unit is located against the sink of the kennel building. The licensee stated the sink cabinet structure
has rodents and is going to be replaced by a stainless steel unit. Rodent dropping accumulations can lead to
unsanitary conditions and the potential for transmission of disease from rodents to dogs. The licensee must ensure
all areas of the facility are kept clean to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination
by pests in animal areas.
