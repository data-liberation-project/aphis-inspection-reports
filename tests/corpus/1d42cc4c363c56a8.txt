establish a program of veterinary care. An attending veterinarian must be obtained under contract to write a program of
veterinary care for the guinea pigs; provide veterinary care and consultation when needed; and to give husbandry
guidance to ensure the guinea pigs remain in good health and are handled appropriately. Correct by June 30, 2022

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Records of animals on hand are not being maintained consistently. The last documentation of guinea pigs on hand was
record in February 2022. In February there were 890 guinea pigs. At the time of inspection, there were 987 guinea pigs


and the facility representative was not aware of the number of guinea pigs there were in the colony. A method to
consistently document the number of animals on hand must be implemented and maintained to ensure all animals are
accounted for in accordance with the requirements of section 2.75(b)(1) of the Animal Welfare Act.

Facilities, general.
During the inspection approximately 5 young guinea pigs were observed running around on the floor of the building. The
facility representative stated that some guinea pigs were getting out on occasion. The cage from which the animals
escaped from could not be determined at the time of inspection. Housing facilities for guinea pigs should be constructed
and maintained in a manner that contains the animals. For the over all health and well-being of the guinea pigs, efforts
must be made to determine how the guinea pigs escape and measures taken to ensure the enclosure is designed to
prevent such escapes. Correct by June 30, 2022.
3.26(d)

Facilities, indoor.
Some interior surfaces in the building for the guinea pigs is not substantially impervious to moisture. The ceiling and some
of the wall surfaces are constructed of treated wood or treated particle board that has not been sealed. Some areas of the
ceiling show signs of water damage. The painted surfaces of the cage changing and drying station has worn off and the
surface has multiple scratches and dings. The support poles for the two newer racks are unpainted and showing signs of
water damage. .

Interior surfaces of indoor housing for guinea pigs should be maintained in a manner that renders the surfaces
substantially impervious to moisture. All interior surfaces must be sealed to prevent moisture from seeping through and to
facilitate sanitization. Correct by July 17, 2022

Watering.
The outside surfaces of the waterlines have an excessive amount of buildup of dust and debris. Many of the collection
cups under the lixits have a build-up of a black material. Water receptacles should be sanitized when dirty and at least
every 2 weeks. To minimize the build-up of debris and to ensure the guinea pigs do not drink contaminated water, the
collection cups should be cleaned at a frequency that prevents build-up of debris and that ensures the guinea pigs drink
potable water. Correct by June 17, 2022
