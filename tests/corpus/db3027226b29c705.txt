HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the dog kennel room, there was a large, open plastic barrel containing dry dog food which was kept without a lid.
Open supplies of food may become contaminated by debris, pests or may deteriorate or spoil so should be stored
or kept in a manner to protect the health of the dogs. All open supplies of food must be kept in leak-proof containers
with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination, deterioration of its nutritive value, and spoilage.
Corrected at time of inspection.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative.
