HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the back holding area of Emerald Forest, one of the gibbon enclosures contained two plastic structures that were
chewed and the plastic was damaged. The gibbons have access to these housing facilities and therefore the
objects within them. The broken and chewed plastic cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized.
The licensee must maintain all surfaces within a non-human primate housing facility on a regular basis. Surfaces of
housing facilities, including furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility, that cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the back holding area of Emerald Forest, near the aye-aye enclosure, a plastic bag of bedding used for the
nonhuman primates had a hole in it. Some of the bedding material was lying on the ground next to the bag. The
hole in the bag could potentially allow for the contamination of the bedding or vermin infestation.
Outside of the Great Ape House, bales of bedding and alfalfa, intended for use and consumption by nonhuman
primates, was uncovered and exposed to potential contamination. The area had a roof to protect the supplies from
rain and snow, however it was open, allowing for birds to potentially fly in and defecate on the supplies and for wind
to potentially blow debris onto them.
In Emerald Forest and the capuchin/spider monkey/langur back holding area, the walk in refrigerator contained
ventilation fans that were blowing air directly onto the uncovered food supplies. The uncovered food could
potentially become contaminated from debris being blown out of the fan.
The licensee must store all supplies of food and bedding in a manner that protects it from spoilage, contamination,
and vermin infestation. To be corrected by: October 20, 2016

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the indoor exhibits of the Emerald Forest, there are metal tie cords with sharp points in the primary enclosures of
the Golden lion tamarins and the White faced sakis. In the back holding area of Emerald Forest, there are metal tie
cords with sharp points in the primary enclosure of the solitary Emperor tamarin. In the back holding area of the
Congo Basin, there are metal tie cords with sharp points in the primary enclosures of the De Brazza's monkey and
the primary enclosure of the Mandrill. In the back holding area of the Capuchin monkeys, Spider monkeys, and
Langurs there are metal tie cords with sharp points in numerous primary enclosures. The non-human primates have
access to all of the listed primary enclosures and could potentially come into contact with and injure themselves on
these sharp points.
The licensee must ensure that the primary enclosures have no sharp points or edges that could injure the
nonhuman primates.

sanitizing.

are able to be readily cleaned and sanitized or replaced when worm or soiled.
