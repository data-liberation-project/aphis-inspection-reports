ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1220 on
08-AUG-19.
The inspector called the owner since the front gate to the property was locked. A voicemail was left and a returned
call was received. The owner stated they were away from the property and there was no one available to
accompany inspectors on an inspection of the facility at that time. Inspector called back the owner to advise him an
attempted inspection report would be issued since the time of the inspection was during his optimal hours for
inspection.
Additional Inspectors
