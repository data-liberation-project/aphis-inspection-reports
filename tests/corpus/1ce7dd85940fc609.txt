2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available for inspection. In order to comply with this section of the
Animal Welfare Act (AWA) a written PVC must be in place and available for inspection at all times. Under formal
arrangements, as directed by the AWA, the establishment must have an updated PVC by the current Attending
Veterinarian (AV). To ensure adequate veterinary medical care to regulated animals, a complete written PVC must be
readily available for inspection. Also, the contracted AV must schedule and regularly visit the establishment's premises.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by November 15, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
