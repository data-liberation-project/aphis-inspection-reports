2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 246 guinea pigs
were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of adults, weanlings, or
newborns present.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Facilities, general.
Although enclosure walls were at least 7 inches in height, during the inspection, one guinea pig was observed to be out of
the enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to


access food and water.
The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times and does not allow them to escape.
Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Primary enclosures.
There were 2 guinea pig pens that did not provide the required amount of floor space. The pens measured 48 x 24
inches or 1,152 square inches of floor space. There were 31 and 32 weanling guinea pigs housed in two pens of this
size. Each weanling requires a minimum of 60 square inches of floor space. Total floor space required to house these
weanlings is 1,860 square inches for 31 weanlings and 1,920 square inches for 32 weanlings. There cannot be more
than 19 weanling guinea pigs housed in an enclosure measuring 48 by 24 inches.
Inadequate space can cause stress, crowding, and aggression in animals.
The licensee must ensure that all guinea pigs are provided with the minimum amount of floor space in order to avoid
overcrowding and to support the health and well-being of the guinea pigs.

3.31(b)

Sanitation.
There was a large amount of discarded bedding, hay, and debris on the floor under and around the guinea pig pens. The
floor under the stacked pens of weanlings contained an accumulation of grime and debris.
The lack of sanitation and presence of grime and debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and
may contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to


facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.
