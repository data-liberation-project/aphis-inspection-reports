INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Approved protocols 2014-0310 covering rabbits and guinea pigs and 2014-0311 covering rabbits both describe
blood collection procedures via cardiac exsanguination and euthanasia procedures involving intra-cardiac injection
of euthanasia solution. Neither protocol describes administration of appropriate anesthesia prior to the cardiac
injections. Injections into the heart are only acceptable after an animal has been deeply anesthetized.
Although the facility stated that these injections are never done without appropriate anesthesia, prior to protocol
approval the IACUC should determine that proposed activities contain documentation assuring that procedures that
may cause more than slight pain or distress are performed only with appropriate sedatives, anesthesia or
analgesics.
Correct: All future protocol approvals by the IACUC.

MISCELLANEOUS.
Pharmaceuticals used on regulated animals at the WEAC facility were unavailable for inspection review. The drugs
were stored in a safe that could only be opened by the principal investigator who was out of the country until July.
Inspectors requested access to controlled substances used in this area because other medications including
epinephrine and atropine had been identified as expired but were co-mingled in an emergency kit with unexpired
medication. Additionally, an expired, open bottle of Isoflurane was identified on a shelf in this area.
All property, facilities and animals shall be available for inspection purposes upon request by APHIS officials in
order to assess compliance with the regulations and standards under the Animal Welfare Act. Correct by: All future
inspections.

SANITATION.Review of the temperature strip log book maintained in the LARR facility indicated that on several dates including
3/23/2015, 3/24/2015, 3/25/2015, 3/26/2015, 3/27/2015 and other random single dates the temperature strips failed
to record that the temperature reached the required 180 degrees in the cage washer. The facility SOP, Clean Cage
Wash Operations for LARR, indicates that in cases of temperature fails the cage wash should be retested. No
documentation was available to indicate that any re-testing had been done to confirm optimal performance of the
cage washer.
Guinea pig cages shall be sanitized by washing them with hot water (180 degrees F) when a mechanical cage
washer is used. Adequate sanitation of enclosures is required to minimize disease hazards and maintain healthy
animals. The facility should review established standard operating procedures and employee compliance with these
procedures.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*A free standing metal building used for food storage at the WEAC location had excessively rusted areas at the
bottom of the walls near the junction with the concrete floor. In some areas holes resulted that communicated with
the exterior. During this inspection after heavy rains water had entered the interior of the building and covered
approximately 50 % of the floor. The feed in this building is stored on pallets and was not in direct contact with the
water.*At the RSC location food is stored on pallets in a shelter that is not completely enclosed. Accumulations of dirt,
debris and food were noted on the floor adjacent to the animal feed. Loose wet food pellets were identified on top of
stacked bags of goat feed. A small animal trap was set and baited in this area.
Supplies of food shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect them from molding, deterioration or
contamination by vermin in order to protect food quality and wholesomeness. Food storage areas should be
designed and maintained to adequately protect food. On June 24, 2015 the facility indicated that work orders had
been submitted for correction of the above non-compliances.
Correct by: July 6, 2015.

SANITATION.
*The livestock feed room at the VMP location had large areas of paint peeling from the ceiling. On June 24, 2015
the facility indicated that a work order had been submitted for correction of this non-compliance.
*The food storage area used primarily for meal worms at the biology vivarium had a damaged ceiling. The racks
holding the meal worm trays were excessively rusted at the bottom. Debris and unidentified dried substances were
noted on the flat surfaces holding the trays. A large open bucket on the floor was half full of dead meal worms and
dirty, discarded bedding substrate. This non-compliance was corrected during the inspection.
*In building 992 at VMP the metal hay feeders provided for the goats housed on the right side of the building when
entered from the front were excessively rusted. The feeders as viewed from the back were damaged with holes.
Rusted metal can have sharp edges that could cause injury to the animals. On June 24, 2015 the facility indicated
that a work order had been submitted for correction of this non-compliance.
Premises and buildings shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to meet
acceptable husbandry standards as defined under the AWA.
Correct by: July 18, 2015.
This inspection was conducted June 16, 2015-June 18, 2015.
The facility inspection was conducted with the CMP director, other staff veterinarians and APHIS personnel.
The exit interview was conducted on June 18, 2015 at 5 p.m. with APHIS personnel, CMP director, Institutional
Official, IACUC chair and the manager of animal welfare assurance.Additional Inspectors
