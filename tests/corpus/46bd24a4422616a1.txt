ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Yorkie (microchip # 990000001614655) had a considerable amount of tartar buildup on both sides of its
mouth. Upon closer examination, there was a loose piece on the right side of its mouth. I was not able to
determine whether it was a loose piece of tartar or a loose tooth covered in tartar. I also observed a small amount
of red fluid coming from this area in what I assume to be blood.
Dental issues can be painful and the mouth/gums can become infected. In addition the infection can become
systemic causing further health issues. The dog needs to be seen by the Attending Veterinarian and treated per
his/her instructions.
Correct by 4/16/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
