2.126(a)(2) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Review of the May 2016 auction records show a consignment form for the sale of seven hedgehogs (#117-123) for
which the consignor is one of the facility principals. It was established by conversation with the facility representative
that the animals were purchased at another auction the previous weekend and resold at the May 2016 auction.
There were no records available during the inspection to show where or when the hedgehogs were originally
acquired.
Each dealer shall have all records including all required acquisition records availabe to allow APHIS officials to
examine records required to be kept by the Act.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
