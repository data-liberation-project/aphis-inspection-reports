3.1(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In at least twelve enclosures there was "pegboard" placed on the wire flooring which was showing deterioration and
wear on the surface and edges. There were also some tears in the plastic walls that allowed dirt and debris to get
lodged behind the plastic surface, not allowing proper cleaning and sanitization.
The worn and deteriorated surfaces can not readily be cleaned and or sanitized which can play a role in disease
transmission. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities including houses, dens, and other
furniture type fixtures, and objects within the facility be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow
them to be readily cleaned and sanitized or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Throughout the facility there was a buildup of hair, dust, and cobwebs on the wire tops of the enclosures, on and
around support structures, countertops, and most other surfaces of items in the facility. There was fly speck on
wires and ceilings.
The lack of cleaning within the facility can cause disease to be harbored, attract rodents and pests, and
cause odors that could affect the respiratory systems of the animals. The licensee must clean and sanitize the
surfaces in accordance to 3.11(b) at least every two weeks or more often as necessary for the surfaces in contact
with the animals. All other surfaces of the housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to
satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
