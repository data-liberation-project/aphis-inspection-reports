Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A litter of 4 English bulldog puppies are being treated for weakness in their legs with Vitamin “C” 500mg once daily. There
is no approved treatment plan for weakness in puppy legs by the attending veterinarian. The veterinarian did examine one
male English Bulldog puppy in June that has an abnormal gait in its left rear leg. The licensee and veterinarian state the
treatment plan is to wait and see if there is improvement and to recheck in 2 months if not improved. There was no written
record of this exam or treatment plan for this individual puppy. The exam findings and treatment plan were discussed in
person between the licensee, veterinarian and inspector.

Abnormal conditions must be diagnosed by a veterinarian and treatment plans must also be approved by a veterinarian in
order to provide adequate veterinary care. Failure to do so does not ensure the treatment plan is appropriate or effective
which may allow the condition to worsen and place the health and well-being of the animal in jeopardy. Each dealer shall
use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee must ensure that all
dogs presenting abnormal conditions are evaluated and diagnosed by a veterinarian and all treatment plans are approved
by a veterinarian in order to provide the dogs with adequate veterinary care.

The attending veterinarian and the licensee made treatment plan in writing for these puppies at the time of inspection.

2.50(a)(2)

Time and method of identification.
The facility uses cage cards as the form of official identification for puppies under 16 weeks of age. There are 2 litters of
puppies, a litter of 4 English Bulldogs born 9-April-2022 and a litter of 2 Shih Tzu-Bichons born 29-May-2022, that have no
official identification. Official identification is necessary for APHIS officials to be able to properly identify animals for
inspection and to trace their movements. The licensee must assign an official identification number to each of these dogs
and any future dogs born at the facility in timely manner after their birth.

To be corrected by: This was corrected at the time of inspection.
2.75(a)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005) is missing acquisition information for several
dogs. The facility uses microchips under the dog’s skin as the form of official identification for adult dogs. Certain
acquisition information was corrected at the time of inspection.

**Missing the microchip number for Female Elkhound “Tessa” and Female Bichon “Pamella”. Both dog’s identification
were added at the time of inspection.
**Missing the name and address of the person from whom a dog was purchased or acquired from for Female Elkhound
“Tessa”(fixed at the time of inspection), Male Yorkshire Terrier “Remington” (address only), Male Shih Tzu “Rand Si” and
Male Pug “Tommy Hawk” (address only).
**Missing the date each dog was acquired for Male Yorkshire Terrier “Remington”, Female Poodles “Taffy” and “Tara”
(both fixed at the time of inspection), Male Poodle “Torpedo” and Male English Bulldog “Marshall” (fixed at the time of
inspection).

**Missing the USDA License number of the persons whom dogs were purchased from for Male Maltese “Billy”, Female
Poodle “Candy” and English Bulldog “Marshall” (fixed at the time of inspection).
**Missing the date and method of disposition for Female Pug “Lanie” and one English bulldog puppy born on 9-April-2022.

Incomplete acquisition records may interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to accurately inventory the animals, identify
individual dogs and to track their movements.

Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain records or forms that fully and correctly disclose all acquisition and disposition
information for each dog. The licensee must add the required acquisition and disposition information for the 12 dogs listed
above to APHIS form 7005, add the disposition information of the one puppy listed above to the cage card for the litter of
English Bulldogs born 9-April-2022 and ensure all records are accurate and maintained at all times.
3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility is not keeping records of medical treatments that are being given to the following dogs:

**4 English Bulldogs born 9-April-2022 have been receiving 500mg of vitamin C once a day for an undetermined amount
of time. The licensee states they are receiving the vitamin but there is no written documentation that they have been
administered and how long the puppies have been on the vitamin C supplement.

**Male English Bulldog “Diesel” (microchip number 9000020180725840) was diagnosed with bilateral conjunctivitis 7-
February-2022 and was prescribed an antibiotic eye ointment 4 times a day for 7 days. He was later prescribed another
eye medication for chronic dry eye on an unknown date to be given twice a day for the rest of his life. There is no record

of either medication being given according to the schedule prescribed by the veterinarian. The licensee states the dog is
receiving the eye medication but there is no written documentation that they have been administered and how long
“Diesel” has been on this medication.

The lack of medical records makes it difficult to determine if the animals are receiving the medical treatments. This
information is needed for APHIS inspectors to ensure the medical care is being provided by the licensee. The licensee
must maintain complete and updated medical records including the dates medications are given to each individual animal.

To be corrected by: From this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
