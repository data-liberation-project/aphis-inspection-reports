Facilities, general.
Three Patagonia mara's are housed in a room loose on the floor with some caged birds and a loose cockatiel. A big
section of the linoleum type floor is missing near the door exposing the subfloor beneath. The cockatiel has also
destroyed sections of the wall leaving portions of the cinderblock construction underneath exposed. These areas cannot
be adequately cleaned and sanitized, posing a disease hazard. The animals may also become sick by ingesting the
material or injured by becoming entrapped. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and illness.

Sanitation.
The floor of the front room to the left housing 4 opossums is cluttered with empty soda bottles, dirty paper plates, plastic
bags, and other trash. There are large items such as coolers, plastic containers, and other items hindering access to the
opossum enclosures. There is a plastic bag of cat food on the floor with a hole torn in the bag. The floor in this room and
throughout the facility is grimy with dirt/debris accumulated in the corners. Around the animal enclosures throughout the


premises, there is spilled bedding, food, and feces. The area around one of the prairie dog enclosures is very cluttered,
preventing easy access to the enclosure.

Accumulations of dirt, trash, and other debris and clutter can be a disease hazard to animals, can create noxious odors,
and can be a breeding ground for vermin. Excessive clutter can hinder husbandry practices.

Trash should be placed in designated areas, the premises kept clean, and clutter minimized. Correct by September 30,
