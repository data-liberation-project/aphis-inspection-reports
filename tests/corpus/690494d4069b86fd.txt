ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1715 on
07-Nov-18. I went to the licensee's house. No one answered the door. I honked the car horn. I then contacted the
licensee by phone and left a message. I waited 45 minutes and then left the property.
End of report.
