3.1(b) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(b) Condition and site.
There were areas of clutter and trash both inside the housing facility and in the food storage building. The licensee
has removed the stacks of newspaper and plastic bottles that were previously noted in the area. However, the
storage area inside the housing facility had tools, hardware, and other material not pertaining to the care of the
animals. The food storage building had multiple empty dog food bags. Areas of clutter and trash offer habitat for
rodents and prevent adequate cleaning and sanitization of the facility. The licensee shall ensure all animal areas
inside of housing facilities are kept neat and free of clutter, including trash, equipment, and stored material not
pertaining to the care of the animals.
A focused inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee on August 27, 2014.This inspection was
limited to both direct and indirect non-compliant items found during a routine inspection on August 13,2014. The
licensee provided records that documented that both "Bam Bam" ID #47790A7436 and "Sugar" ID # 035794634
were examined by the attending veterinarian and given a written diagnosis and treatment plan. "Bam Bam" has
completed his prescribed treatment and was not coughing during the inspection. "Sugar" was prescribed daily
treatment for her eyes which the licensee is providing and the condition on her foot appeared to have improved
following treatment. The dog is now walking on all four feet. Additionally, the licensee has provided two types of
traps as well as mouse bait in attempts to remove rodents from the facility and provided covers for the openings in
the wire with sharp points.
