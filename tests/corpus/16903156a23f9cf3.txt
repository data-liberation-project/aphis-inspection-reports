A female Maltese (#27) has poor dental health. There is a buildup of brown tartar on the upper cheek teeth on both
sides of the mouth. A buildup of brown tartar is also covering the surface of the top part of both upper canine teeth.
A small line of grey material is located along the gum line of the upper cheek teeth on the left side of the mouth. A
much thicker amount of the grey material is located along the gum line of the cheek teeth on the right side of the
mouth. The gums have become slightly reddened. Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog
as well as lead to further health issues.
The above mentioned dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
A female Pomeranian (ID #102) has excessively long toenails on both front feet. The toenails have developed a
significant curve towards the bottom of the foot. Overgrown toenails could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as
well as, affect the dog’s natural gait. The licensee must trim this dog’s toenails to an acceptable length and ensure
that the toenails of all dogs are maintained at an acceptable length at all times.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure, containing one puppy, the ends of twisted wires have created sharp points at the level of the
puppy. In at least two other enclosures, containing a total of five adult dogs, the metal framing around the doors
has broken and bent inward creating sharp edges at the level of the dogs. Sharp points and edges could cause
injury to the dogs.
Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injuries. The licensee must
remove the sharp points and broken metal framing or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury risk towards
the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all animal enclosures remain in good repair and are safe for the dogs at all
times.The inspection and exit interview were conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell, CS Faron Greenough, and the facility
representative.
