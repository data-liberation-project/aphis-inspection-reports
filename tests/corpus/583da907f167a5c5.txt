2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
According to the minutes from April 2016, there was an incident on April 15, 2016 in which 4 NHP escape from their
primary enclosure.
Two NHP were captured the same day, one the next day and the other one on July 22.There was no injury to the
animals and they stayed within the perimeter area of the facility.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
behavioral stress, or unnecessary discomfort.
The situation has been corrected by retraining the employees, changing the padlock system by using color coded
padlocks and controlling who has the keys and by having security guards recheck the enclosure padlocks during the
rounds they make around the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
