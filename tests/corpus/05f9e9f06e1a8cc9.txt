2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****Otis (m/c0071B72F7) a male fawn Pug, was very thin. His ribs, backbone, hip bones and shoulders were easily
observed and there was a very defined abdominal tuck. Both eyes are crusted with a dry discharge and previous
veterinary notes stated that the dog was blind. The owner stated that the dog had lost weight before and was
treated with dewormer and different dog food and that was her plan now. There was no consultation with a
veterinarian to establish a diagnosis or to confirm that this was the correct treatment for this dog. Eye conditions can
be uncomfortable or painful and the discharges can attract flies and cause the condition to worsen. Poor body
condition can be the result of parasites, inadequate nutrition, or an underlying medical condition. The dog must be
evaluated by a veterinarian within 2 days of this inspection, to know with certainty the problem and the correct
treatment. Documentation of the evaluation, recommended treatment and delivered treatments must be available to
APHIS officials.
The veterinarian was called during the inspection for an appointment for that same evening.
