2.31(d)(1)(iii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Review of Protocols AQ002 and AU001: These 2 protocols did not contain a written assurance by the principal
investigator that the animal use activities do not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments.

Per this Section, the IACUC shall determine during the review of proposed animal use activities or significant changes in
ongoing activities that the principal investigator has provided written assurance that the activities do not unnecessarily
duplicate previous experiments. This requirement ensures that the animals under study do not experience research
activities that are unnecessarily duplicative.

The IACUC needs to address this deficiency for these 2 protocols and needs to ensure that all approved protocols contain
a written assurance regarding unnecessary duplication. Correct by 6/1/22.
2.31(e)(2)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Review of Protocols AQ002 and AU001: These 2 protocols did not contain a rationale for the appropriateness of the
numbers of animals to be used.



Per this Section, a proposal to conduct an activity involving animals, or to make a significant change in an ongoing activity
involving animals, must contain a rationale for involving animals and for the appropriateness of the species and numbers
of animals to be used. This requirement ensures that the appropriate species and number of animals are used in the
proposed research activities.

The IACUC needs to address this deficiency for these 2 protocols and needs to ensure that all approved protocols contain
a rationale for the appropriateness of the numbers of animals. Correct by 6/1/22.

The inspection and exit briefing were conducted 5/2/22 with facility representatives.
