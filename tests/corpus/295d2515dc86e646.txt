2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The adult male cream colored poodle (with no official form of identification) that was listed under 2.40 (b) (2) on the
November 30, 2015 inspection report has not received adequate veterinary care. The dog had been having loose
stools with some blood present. The licensee took a fecal sample to a veterinary clinic on December 3, 2015 but did
not have the dog examined by a veterinarian. The licensee did not follow-up with the veterinary clinic and stated that
the dog no longer has a bloody stool and that it went away on its own. However, the inspector spoke to the
attending veterinarian today who stated the fecal was positive for Colitis. The attending veterinarian also stated the
dog needs to be examined.
The dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administered. Documentation
should be available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment must be part of their
documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.4(a)(1)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Five labrador/poodle puppies approximately a day old and one puppy approximately three weeks old are being
housed with their dams in an outdoor housing facility during cold weather. The temperature recorded at the time of
inspection was 46.7 degrees F. Housing puppies less than eight weeks of age in outdoor facilities has not been
approved by the attending veterinarian. The potential for stress and discomfort exists if the puppies cannot tolerate
outside temperatures for an extended period of time. The licensee must have written approval from the attending
veterinarian to house puppies that young in outdoor enclosures.
Corrected at time of inspection. The puppies and their dams were moved to a heated sheltered facility.
3.4(b)(4) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The four wooden shelters being used by five adult labrador/poodle dogs and six puppies within the outdoor housing
facility contain very little or no bedding material. The ambient temperature at the time of inspection was recorded at47.1 degrees F by the inspector's Kestrel device. According to the National Weather Service, the low temperature
for tonight will be approximately 34 degrees F.
Dogs that are not provided with clean and dry bedding material during low ambient temperatures can have difficulty
maintaining a safe body temperature. The licensee must provide dry bedding when the ambient temperatures are
below 50 degrees F and additional bedding when the temperature is below 35 degrees F.
Bedding was provided for the shelters being used at the time of inspection.
This is a focused inspection to address the direct non-compliant item listed under 3.1 (f) on the November 30, 2015
inspection report. This non-compliant item has been corrected.
Exit briefing conducted with the facility representative and licensee.
