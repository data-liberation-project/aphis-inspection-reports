facilities and review of the program of humane care and use occurred on October 29, 2014. The next program and
facility review was conducted by the IACUC on May 7, 2015, which is greater than the required six month interval (7

that they meet the current standards for all species.
The IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research
facility's animal facilities, including animal study areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A- Animal Welfare, as a
basis for evaluation.
