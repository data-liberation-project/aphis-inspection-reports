2.1(a)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This was a search inspection.
Facility owner's brother(s) were present during the search inspections on 9/15/2014 and 9/16/2014. Owner's
brothers confirmed that their brother had several dogs and he sells his puppies to a broker. On 9/16/2014 the
Owner contacted me by phone. He confirmed that he sells to a USDA Licensed broker. He also confirmed that he
currently has 12 dogs currently at his facility. Of the 12 dogs currently at the facility, 8 of his dogs are females of the
breeding age. Sale records confirm that he sold puppies to a USDA licensed broker on 2/24/2014, 3/3/2014,
6/16/2014 and 6/30/2014. Regulations regarding licensing requirements were explained in detail. When greater
than 4 breeding females are maintained, the wholesale sale of puppies without a license is a violation of Section 2.1
of the Animal Welfare Act. Any person operating or intending to operate as a dealer (who is not otherwise
exempted from the licensing requirements) must have a valid license. The owner shall file a completed application
form with the AC Regional Director if he would like to conduct any further regulated activity.
An application packet was provided to the owner's brother on 9/16/2014.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITY MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED
