CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the cargo office for Aer Lingus, operated by Menzies, one cat had been accepted for transport on waybill #
125-86769933, on a flight bound for Dublin. The animal enclosure did not have a signed consignor's certification
regarding when the cat was last offered food and water, and what the feeding and watering instructions were for the
trip. This certification should be clearly visible on top of the animal enclosure.
Carriers must ensure that a certification is signed by the consignor that includes written instructions for feeding and
watering, and that this information is clearly visible on the primary enclosure so that the animal can be properly
cared for during transit.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the intermediate handler representatives at the cargo office.
