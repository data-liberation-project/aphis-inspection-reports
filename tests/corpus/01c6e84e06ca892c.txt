ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dog #54, a Boston Terrier female, has a large open lesion on her right side that is about 2” wide and about 5” long
starting at the base of her neck to about ¾ of the way down her side and shoulder area. The lesion is wet with an
area of the wound, approximately 1.5 x 2.5 inches in diameter, that is dark red, crusted, and sloughing exposing the
underlying tissue. There is a thick, creamy, white/yellow discharge coating the underlying tissues. The Licensee
stated that he noticed the issue on 10/2/2018 and started treating with Dermajell. This product was prescribed to
the Licensee for another animal with a past issue (no diagnosis or reason for treatment was listed on the
prescription). In addition, there was no written guidance in the Program of Veterinarian Care for the use of Dermajell
or how to treat lesions of this size. The Licensee did not contact the Veterinarian for guidance until after the
inspection had been completed. This condition is something that should have been apparent to the Licensee during
his daily observation. Failure to communicate with the attending veterinarian when the program of veterinarian care
does not have adequate guidance and does not allow for the proper diagnoses or treatment of an animal’s
condition. The Licensee was notified the day of inspection (10/3/2014) that this dog must be seen by a licensed
veterinarian in order to obtain a proper diagnosis and treatment for the animal's condition.
Correct By: COB 10/4/2018, This dog was confirmed to have already been picked up by the attending veterinarian
and in his care at the time of the Exit.
Dog #25, a Bichon female, was noted to have an open lesion on her hind quarters. The lesion is irregular in size
and shape, but is approximately 0.75 inches by 2 inches in its widest spot. The surface of the lesion has a thin
brown crust covering nearly the entire surface with a mild amount of yellow-white discharge present. The skin
surrounding the lesion is mildly pink and swollen. The licensee is currently treating the lesion with Dermajell. This
product was prescribed to the Licensee for another animal with a past issue (no diagnosis or reason for treatment
was listed on the prescription). In addition, there was no written guidance in the Program of Veterinarian Care for
the use of Dermajell. The Licensee has guidance in his Program of Veterinarian Care for mild scrapes, minor cuts or
hot spots. However; Dermajell is not currently listed in the Program of Veterinarian Care. Upon further
examination, this dog was also noticed to have 2 cuts/scratchers on her right side that the Licensee called “razor
burn”. The Licensee stated that the dog had recently been clipped and that he had not noticed these areas or
started treatment prior to today's inspection. In addition, the cuts/scratches should have been apparent during the
Licensees daily observation or during their use of Dermajell on the animals open lesion. The Licensee did notcontact the Veterinarian prior to today's inspection for the issues identified above. The Licensee failed to
communicate with his attending veterinarian to ensure that he was provided with adequate guidance to allow for a
proper diagnoses or treatment of the issues identified above. The Licensee must have this dog seen by a licensed
veterinarian.
Correct By: 10/5/2018, This dog was confirmed to have an appointment to be seen by the attending veterinarian at
the time of the Exit.

Dog #6, a Yorkie male, was noted to have matting of the hair. Upon further examination, the dog was noticed to
have several small to medium sized matts that covered the dogs back, sides and hind quarters. The matting covers
approximately 75% of the dogs body.
Dog #133, a Maltese male, was noticed to have matting of the hair. Upon further examination, this dog has small
matts in various areas of her body; back, sides, hind quarters and down her back legs. The matts cover about 30%
of the dogs body. In addition, this dog has excessively long toenails.
Dog #4, a Pomeranian Male, was noticed to have matting of the hair. Upon further examination, this dog was
noticed to have several areas with small matts on his sides and hind quarters. The matting covers approximately

noticed to have several areas with small to large matts on his sides, hind quarters, base of the neck and down his
back. The matting covers approximately 45% of this dogs body.
Dogs #6, #133, #4, and #3 have all been identified on today's inspection as having matting of the hair or long
toenails. The Licensee had not identified any of the issues listed above prior to today's inspection. In addition, the
Licensees did not follow any grooming protocols or contact his veterinarian for guidance to assist in the prevention
of these grooming issues prior to today's inspection. Matted hair coats can be painful and can lead to further
veterinary care issues and skin disorders. This facility must ensure that there are methods in place for daily
observation of all animals in order to identify issues such as matting. In addition, the Licensee must ensure that he
is following all protocols outlined in his program of veterinarian care or that he is communicating with his attending
veterinarian to ensure that there are appropriate measures in place to prevent, control and diagnosis all veterinary
care issues that are identified in his facility.

Exit.

FEEDING.On today's inspection, there were 26 self-feeders with a heavy to excessive accumulation of black matter adhered
to the inside lip of the feeder where the dogs eat and/or on the side walls where the food is put in or held while in
the self-feeder. These feeders are not being cleaned often enough to prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris, food
and other potential disease hazards. The Licensee must ensure that all cleaning protocols for the kennel include a
method of cleaning all of the food receptacles (self-feeders) as often as necessary to meet the standards set forth in
this subpart.
