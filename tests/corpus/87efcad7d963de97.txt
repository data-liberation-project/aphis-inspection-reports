Primary enclosures.
An enclosure containing 1 female dog and 3 puppies had a grate flooring with 1 inch by 1 inch openings. The grate was
in good shape, but the puppies were able to get their feet and legs through the openings of the flooring. Flooring with
openings that allow the puppies' feet to pass through could cause injury to those puppies. The puppies must be provided
with an enclosure that doesn't allow for the feet to pass through the openings. Correct by 2/16/23.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.

End of report.
