PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
The facility has purchased animals from unlicensed sources who are required to be licensed. The acquisition
records indicate three different unlicensed rabbit breeders were each paid more than $500 for their animals during
the last year. Obtaining animals from unlicensed sources, who are required to be licensed, does not allow
inspection for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, its regulations and standards.
Assure animals are obtained from licensed sources when required.
To be corrected: From this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Manager.
