FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one rabbit barn, uncovered light bulbs are hung over a portion of the rabbit enclosures, particularly over food
receptacles. In the event of breakage, rabbits could be injured by shattered glass. A system should be in place to
ensure light sources in animal facilities are maintained in a manner that doesn't pose a risk to the animals.
Indoor and outdoor housing facilities for rabbits shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to
protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In 2 rabbit barns, the majority of rabbit enclosures are moderately covered in rust. The presence of rust may prevent
the required cleaning and sanitizing of the enclosures, which may adversely affect the health and well-being of the
animals.
The facility is currently replacing rabbit primary enclosures, food receptacles, wood beams, and other structures. It
was noted that one barn has been completed and a second barn had one row of enclosures replaced.
The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that they are
substantially impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In at least 2 primary enclosures, there are portions of the wire mesh floor that are in disrepair. Temporary patches
are
in place but the edges of these patches have pointed sharp edges. Rabbits coming in contact with these areas can
become injured.
The floors of the primary enclosures shall be constructed so as to protect the rabbits' feet and legs from injury.

SANITATION.
In a rabbit barn, there was a large black spider identified in a food receptacle.The facility representative replaced the
rabbit's food receptacle at time of inspection.
In 2 rabbit barns, there was a moderate amount of flies present. Although there is some pest control present,
additional measures should be taken to minimize the fly populations in these areas. The presence of insects,
including flying pests, can injure and increase disease hazards in animal areas.
An effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established
and maintained.
