2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Attending Veterinarian and Program of Veterinary Care.
The licensee has changed attending veterinarians but has not developed a written and approved Program of
Veterinary Care plan in conjunction with the new attending veterinarian. This does not ensure that the attending
veterinarian has been given authority to oversee the adequacy of adequate veterinary care and other aspects of
animal care provided. Additionally, the written Program of Veterinary Care that the licensee provided during the
inspection did not include the alpaca, cow and prairie dog and lacked sufficient detail in several areas. The parasite
control programs for the species listed on page 3 and 4 did not provide the dosages, route of administration,
frequency and duration of treatment. The emergency care section on pages 2-4 did not clearly identify who would
provide emergency veterinary care including the emergency phone number of the attending veterinarian or the
names, contact information and duties performed by those providing husbandry care for the animals in the event
that the primary caretaker is unable to do so. Under the euthanasia section for pages 2-4, the method of euthanasia
was not listed, which must include product name, dosage and route of administration. An incomplete written
Program of Veterinary Care does not ensure that the attending veterinarian is aware and approves of all aspects of
veterinary and husbandry care being provided to the animals. The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian
to develop a written Program of Veterinary Care and include the components listed above that are lacking from the
written plan to ensure that it is complete and accurately reflects the veterinary care provided to the animals and that
the attending veterinarian has been given adequate authority over the veterinary care of the animals. Correct by
November 25, 2016.
