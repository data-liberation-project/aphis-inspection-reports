All surfaces must be maintained and kept in good repair. Proper cleaning and sanitization of surfaces will prevent
the disease potential to the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* There was a paneled enclosure housing seven puppies. The back panel had an approximately 4 inch by 4 inch
hole where the vertical wire strands broke off. There was a protruding point as a result of one the strands that broke
off. This broke wire was producing upward. The protruding wire could injure the puppies. The puppies could get
stuck in the hole from trying to get out of the enclosure through the hole, thus getting injured.
For the prevention of injury, all enclosures must be kept and maintained in good repair.To be corrected by: This was corrected at the time of inspection.
