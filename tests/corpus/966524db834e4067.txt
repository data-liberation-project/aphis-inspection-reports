3.14(c)

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
The carrier has not obtained certification statements with the required information for the dogs and cats previously
transported. Receipt of feeding and watering instructions for each animal received is imperative, as well as confirmation
that food and potable water were offered within four hours prior to transport. Doing so addresses the animals’ needs
during transit, as well as aids in their comfort and wellbeing.
Carries and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog or cat for transport unless the consignor certifies in writing to the
carrier or intermediate handler that the dog or cat was offered food and water within four hours preceeding delivery to the
carrier or intermediate handler. Instructions provided must be in compliance with 3.17 and provide the required
information for each dog and cat.
