ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A goat "Travis" appears thin. His dorsal thoracic area is tented with little muscle mass on either side of the thoracic
spinal column. The records indicated that this animal was last weighed in March 2015, when the veterinarian's
physical examination determined that this animal appeared normal & was healthy.
There are no keeper records for the last 13 months to review concerning this animal's condition. The licensee does
not have a scale, so no weight could be obtained on this inspection to compare it with last years' to see if this
animal has lost any weight
Have your veterinarian examine this goat and treat accordingly

INFORMATION AS TO BUSINESS; FURNISHING OF SAME BY DEALERS, EXHIBITORS, OPERATORS OF
AUCTION SALES, INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS, AND CARRIERS.
A goat "General" was euthanized in 2015. There are no records to indicate the reason for euthanization or the
events leading up to euthanization. The records did not indicate any recent medical issues that would warrant
euthanization.
Another goat "Nessie" was also euthanized in 2015 for a traumatic injury. There are no records to indicate when
this injury first occurred and when this animal was euthanized.
Without this type of information, it is not possible to determined if these animals received adequate veterinary care
(and pain relieving medications) before they were euthanized.
The facility's computer systems crashed back in 2015 and any information was lost. With the present method of
data collection it is difficult to retrieve specific daily keeper observations to determine if animals are receiving properdaily observations and veterinary care for sick or injured animals.
A system shall be developed and implemented which would determine & demonstrate compliance &/or enforcement
with the applicable regulations and standards of the Animal Welfare Act.

2.131(b)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The licensee is still utilizing 6 foot sticks with a flat edge to allow the public to feed meat to the panthers. These
implements do not minimize the risk of injury to these cats as they are being fed.
The use of feeding tongs (or other types of instruments) should be used which would not pose a risk of injury to the
cat's eyes, teeth, or other body parts during these feeding encounters by the public.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The barrier fences located at the raccoon exhibit (along the train track side) and the opossum exhibit (at the left
side) are incomplete leaving an area which would allow the public easy access up to the exhibits.
There shall be sufficient distance and or barriers between the public and the animals so as to assure the safety of
the animals and the public.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two door hinges in the goat/zebu exhibit are not secured by screws on one side which affix the hinge to the door.
This now allows the hinges to freely swing. These hinges are located above the water receptacle which now pose a
risk of injury to these animals as they drink.
These hinges shall be securely fastened to prevent potential injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The feed shed has accumulations of dirt, dead insects, and evidence of rodents. There were scattered peanut
shells and pieces of building insulation on top of a few feed bags and on the floor. The seal around the entrance
door is cracked/missing at the bottom. This area, as well as another area (between the floor and the wall), are no
longer sealed and have gaps. These spaces can facilitate areas where small rodents can enter the building.
This area presently has some rodent repellent bags, but this seems to be ineffective in controlling the rodent
population.
The feed shed shall be cleaned more frequently. The door seal shall be repaired or replaced and the gaps
reinsulated (or otherwise closed off) to minimize the entrance of rodents and protect the food from rodent
contamination.
