HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the west side of the female bulldog building, there is a hole between the concrete and the building. The hole is
directly under the dog door opening. Waste, old food or other material can buildup in the hole making it difficult to
adequately clean and sanitize the enclosure.
Inside of the building, one gate has a rusted piece of steel on the bottom rail. The rust is to the point that it is barely
holding together. The gate must be maintained so that the dogs are protected from other animals entering the
enclosure and prevent the dogs from going under the gate to escape.
On the male bulldog barn, the north wall has chewed siding and missing other parts of the wall. The wall must be
maintained and the surface repaired or replaced so it can be easily cleaned and sanitized.
Each of these items must be corrected to protect the dog(cid:25)s health and well- being. Surfaces must be maintained to
so they can be easily cleaned and sanitized. Enclosures must be maintained so they can keep and protect the dogs
in them. Owner must ensure that all areas of the kennel buildings are routinely maintained and repairs are made in
a timely manner. . All items must be corrected by 08-15-2015.
