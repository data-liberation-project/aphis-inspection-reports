Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The licensee did not submit a written itinerary to the Deputy Administrator notifying APHIS of their overnight travels for
exhibition. The licensee reports that they left the home site on 9/13/22.
Travel itineraries are necessary to ensure accountability for animals exhibited under the license, facilitate animal welfare
inspections while animals are not housed at the home site, and prevent attempted inspections. Licensees must submit a
travel itinerary no fewer than two days in advance of any travel and shall contain complete and accurate information
concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person’s approved site.
To be corrected from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
