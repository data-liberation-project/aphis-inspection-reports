2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility did not have a written program of veterinary care showing that they made a formal arrangement with a local
attending veterinarian for this site. Each dealer shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the
case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written
program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer. Correct by October 23, 2021.
2.75(b)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility did not have the acquisition forms or any information showing the inventory of any of the animals on hand
except for one monkey. The owner stated that the papers were on the premises but the employee couldn't locate them.
These documents should be made accessible during the inspection for the inspector to review. Every dealer shall make,
keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning animals other
than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under
his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records shall
include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. Correct from this day
forward.


3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
In the ruffed lemurs enclosure there was an excessive amount of old feces and the ground was soiled. The facility had not
spot-cleaned that day and the feces appeared to have been there for several days, some of which appeared hard and dry.
Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent
accumulation of excreta and disease hazards. Correct by September 30, 2021.
3.75(e)

Housing facilities, general.
There was a bag of Mazuri that the facility was feeding the nonhuman primates. The bag was on a table on the back
porch with its edges rolled back keeping it open. When we turned the pellets at the bottom of the bag, we observed
numerous amounts of bugs that resembled boll weevils. The feed had been contaminated and was no longer appropriate
for consumption of the animals. Only the food currently being used may be kept in animal areas, and when not in actual
use, open food must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination. Correct by October
23, 2021
3.77(f)

Sheltered housing facilities.
The perimeter fence for the nonhuman primates is only 5 feet tall and it must be at least 6 feet tall.. The outdoor area of a
sheltered housing facility must be enclosed by a fence that is of sufficient height to keep unwanted species out. Fences
less than 6 feet must be approved by the Administrator. Correct by November 23, 2021.
3.80(a)(2)(ix)

Primary enclosures.


In the common marmosets enclosure there was a plastic bucket being used as a den box and the rim and edges were
rough and damaged. It appears that the animals had been chewing or gnawing on it but there were no remnants of the
bucket observed in the primary enclosure. The surfaces of the buckets used as den boxes are worn and need to be
replaced.

The squirrel monkeys enclosure had a drum on the top level and was strapped down by strip ties. The drum had feces
smeared on it and was dirty. The inside was not visible so the inspectors inquired about the steps the facility took to
properly clean and sanitize. The employee stated that the drum had not been removed to be cleaned out and they only
spray the outside with a water hose. Also the wooden ledges were also soiled. These perches and furniture, in which the
animals come in contact with, need to be readily cleaned and sanitized or replaced if soiled.

The primary enclosures must have surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates to be readily cleaned and sanitized or
replaced when worn or soiled to prevent disease and or pests. Correct by October 23, 2021.
3.81(b)

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
In all of the nonhuman primates' enclosures there were only perches. The ruffed lemurs had a wood beam and the
squirrel moneys had a rope and a wood ledge going around the cage. There weren't any other types of enrichment in the
enclosures at the time of the inspection. The facility also did not have a written enrichment plan stating all of the types of
enrichment that they would provide for the animals. The facility must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan
for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must
be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or


reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian. This plan must be made available to APHIS upon
request,
3.84(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
While observing the ruffed lemurs enclosure we noticed mounds of red ant nests in the grass surrounding the concrete
slabs. They were tracking inside of the enclosures to the old food and feces. Also on the concrete slab for the marmosets
primary enclosure there were red ants tracking all over which made it difficult for the inspectors to standstill while
inspecting. It is important that an effective program is established and maintained to prevent pests so as to promote the
health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in the animals area. Correct by October 23, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the employee.
