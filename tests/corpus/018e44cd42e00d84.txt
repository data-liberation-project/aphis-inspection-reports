3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor kennel area has 5 dog runs that require repair to the surface areas. Maintenance and replacement of
surfaces is required on regular basis. The paint has started to peel away both inside the kennel areas and the
walk-thru area the adult dogs use to gain access to their exercise area. Surfaces in this condition can not be readily
cleaned and sanitized properly to protect the dogs from diseases. The licensee must replace or repair these
surfaces to protect the health and well being of the dogs.
