2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult, male Yorkshire terrier named John (mc# 048 277 607) was limping on his left front leg when he walked.
While standing, he was reluctant to put that foot on the floor and repeatedly held the foot in the air. There was a
swelling the size of a pea between digits 3 and 4. The swollen area was reddened and very soft upon palpation.
The licensee was not aware of the problem and had not consulted a veterinarian. Foot problems can be painful,
can affect the gait, and can worsen without treatment. The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian
by April 24, must follow the recommended treatment plan, and must provide written documentation of the medical
care to the inspector upon request.
2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
(a)(2) Puppies less than 16 weeks of age
Several litters of puppies did not have any form of identification (cage cards, collars, or tags). Appropriate
identification of dogs is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and
healthcare documentation. The licensee must properly identify each puppy.
TO BE CORRECTED BY APRIL 24, 2015.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted by Konnie Plumlee-VMO with the licensee on April 21, 2015. This
report was delivered and discussed with the licensee on April 22, 2015.
