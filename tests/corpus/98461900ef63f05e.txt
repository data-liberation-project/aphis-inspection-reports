2.50(c) Repeat

Time and method of identification.
The domestic cats maintained by the licensee still do not have official identification as required by the Animal Welfare Act.
The licensee currently identifies the adult domestic cats by name on the APHIS 7005 records but none of the 7 adult cats
have official USDA identification. The licensee stated that she has spoken with her attending veterinarian and has plans to
microchip all the adult animals.

Not having proper identification can cause misidentification of animals on inspections, veterinary care documentation,
acquisition and disposition records. In addition, it makes positive identification of medical treatment and sales impossible
to track.

The Licensee must ensure that an official USDA sequentially numbered tag is placed on the animal with a collar or kept
on the door of the animas cage or run, or an approved tattoo or microchip is used to positively identify the animals.
2.75(a)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Licensee is not keeping required acquisition records for the Bengal kittens. The Licensee is not currently keeping an
updated record of animals on hand for any offspring born on the premise. During inspection, a total of 9 kittens from 2

different litters are housed with their queens. The licensee’s APHIS Form 7005 record on hand lists 7 adult cats and 0
kittens. The licensee has purchased index cards for kitten cage records but has not put them in use.

Not having proper record keeping for the facilities does not allow for proper trace back of animals during a disease
outbreak and does not allow for accountability or identification of the animals during inspection.

The Licensee must ensure that she keeps and maintains records that fully and correctly disclose all information
concerning each cat that has been born on the premises.
3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
Surfaces and housing facilities for the domestic cats are not being cleaned or sanitized often enough. One outdoor
enclosure shelter box still contains old hay that, according to the licensee, was added over the past winter. This hay
appears dirty and soiled. That outdoor enclosure also has areas of painted wood supports with dirt covering their
surfaces. The room housing the indoor enclosures with queens and their kittens has spilled litter and food on the floor.
Hard surfaces in contact with the cats must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b)(2).
Additionally, other facility surfaces must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards and practices. Infrequent cleaning and sanitation of housing facilities exposes the animals to
unnecessary disease hazards, odors, insects and pests.
Correct by removing old, dirty hay from the shelter box, cleaning hard surfaces and housing facilities, and implementing a
cleaning and sanitization schedule in accordance with 3.11(b)(2).

3.4(c) Repeat


Outdoor housing facilities.
The three outdoor enclosures, housing six adult domestic cats and five kittens, are still constructed with wood permeable
to moisture and cannot be properly cleaned or sanitized. One of the enclosures is constructed and framed with unsealed
wood. The enclosed shelter box and wooden ramp are also constructed out of unsealed wood. The second enclosure with
a corresponding shelter box and resting platform is constructed with a mixture of painted and unsealed wood. Surfaces
permeable to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and/or sanitized to meet the requirements set for by 3.11 of the AWA
regulations. In addition, these structures and items are not designed or constructed in a way that they can be easily
removed once they become worn or soiled. The licensee has invested in a new metal enclosure to replace the one made
with unsealed wood. However, the new enclosure has not been assembled.

Having surfaces in contact with the animals that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized can expose the cats to
unnecessary disease hazards.

The Licensee must ensure that all enclosures, den boxes and furniture type fixtures are designed and constructed of
materials that are impervious to moisture and able to be properly cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced once they
become worn or soiled.
3.6(b)(3) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
The outdoor domestic cat enclosures, housing a total of six adult domestic cats and five kittens, still do not have a litter
box or other designated receptacle for litter. Lacking a litter box, the animals in these enclosures urinate and defecate
directly onto the soil or mulch.


Receptacles containing clean litter are required for cats to engage in species-specific behaviors such as covering their
excreta and provide them the ability to avoid their own wastes. Failing to have receptacles for litter prevents appropriate
husbandry including removal of feces as often as necessary.

The Licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures containing cats have enough receptacles with sufficient clean litter
to contain excreta and body waste.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
A red fox enclosure has areas of metal fencing that can potentially cause harm to the animals contained within. The
enclosure housing two adult red foxes has a metal fence along with chicken wire attached to the inside surface with zip
ties. The foxes have chewed the zip ties holding the bottom portion of the chicken wire and have created a gap
approximately 10-12” between the wire and the metal fence. During inspection the red foxes were seen sticking their head
underneath the chicken wire and up to the fence.
Loose wire fencing can pose a risk to the animals in the enclosure and allow them to become injured or entrapped.
Correct by ensuring facilities and housing structures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and contain them.

3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
Although sanitation at the facility has greatly improved, there are several areas that still need attention. The Patagonian
cavy enclosure has a mild amount of fecal matter present and the shelter box contains old, dirty hay from the winter.
There is still debris including old hay and Styrofoam pieces present in the enclosure housing two fennec foxes.

Additionally, at least three outdoor metal enclosures have wire walls with large amounts of trapped fur and cob/dustwebs.
Infrequent cleaning and sanitation of housing facilities exposes the animals to unnecessary disease hazards, odors,
insects and pests.
Correct by ensuring that all enclosures are being cleaned on a routine basis and as often as necessary to minimize
disease hazards and satisfy acceptable cleanliness standards.
