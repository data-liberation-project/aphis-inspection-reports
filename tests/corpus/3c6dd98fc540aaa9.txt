2.33(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Several aspects of the facility's veterinary care program need increased oversight and guidance from the attending
veterinarian.
- There is a systemic failure to document medical treatment, and incomplete documentation of long term medical
issues. Two beagles (Cheech and Chong) were identified in April 2017 as having "cherry eyes". However, there
was no further instruction on monitoring, follow up, or management. Two cats - "Raven" (ID 6949) and "Cisco" (ID
7020) were noted on inspection with opacity and apparent scarring in one eye. These were documented by the
facility but again there was no indication of a veterinarian examining these animals or any guidance on treatment,
management, follow up, or monitoring parameters. These types of chronic conditions require clear guidance from
the attending veterinarian, and must be fully and appropriately documented. Complete medical records are critical
both for effective monitoring and treatment, and also to ensure clear communication of medical problems with the
attending veterinarian.
- The facility has implemented a dental care program, and are categorizing each dog according to severity.
However, the actual procedure for cleaning the teeth is not adequate. The procedure involves sedating the animal
with xylazine and hand scaling the tartar off the teeth. There are no anesthetics or analgesics given, and it is
unclear how tooth extractions are handled. There are no written guidelines from the attending veterinarian, and no
SOP for the dental program at all.
Based on the records and dental program issues, there is nothing to indicate that the attending veterinarian has the
appropriate awareness and oversight needed to ensure adequate veterinary care at the facility. The facility must
work with the veterinarian to develop written guidance for the program, and must maintain appropriate records to
ensure thorough communication with the attending veterinarian.

2.33(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During the inspection, the following dogs were found with veterinary care issues.- A male beagle named "Whitey" (ID 4176) had red skin lesions on the lower rear legs. The facility had noted these
lesions several weeks ago, and treated initially with an oral antibiotic for approximately one week. However, there
was no follow-up treatment, and upon inspection the lesions had not resolved. Medical conditions must be
appropriately treated, which includes follow up evaluations to assess progress and changes to the treatment plan
when necessary. "Whitey" must be assessed by the attending veterinarian within 48 hours and treated
appropriately. Records of treatment must be made available to inspectors.
- One beagle (ID 3432) on row D has several live ticks inside the left ear. The dog was noted tilting and shaking its
head and appeared sensitive when the ear was touched. Another beagle (ID 2875) had several visible ticks on the
side and flank. The facility had noted this dog as having ticks approximately two weeks earlier, but there was no
indication of any treatment or preventative being applied.
Ticks are an irritant and a potential source of infection to animals. Therefore, tick control is a critical aspect of
animal health. The facility SOP states that dogs will be observed for fleas and ticks on a daily basis, and treated
with physical pest removal or chemical/dip application as appropriate. The facility must treat the two indicated dogs
in an appropriate manner within 48 hours, and must ensure that all dogs are evaluated daily and treated as
necessary.
3.6(a)(2)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
An outdoor pen containing seven puppies has an enclosure fence and a hot wire system that was disconnected
from the power supply. The hot wire was composed of two loose strands of wire at the base of the enclosure fence,
and several puppies were observed playing around and within these wires. Loose wires are a potential source of
entrapment, and could result in severe injury if a puppy were to become entangled. Any loose wires within reach of
the animals should be tightened or removed.
