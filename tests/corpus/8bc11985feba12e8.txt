3.81(c)(4)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There were 4 male marmosets that were individually housed and their enclosures were oriented along a wall
preventing them from being able to see one another. NHPs that are singly housed and cannot see and hear other
NHPs of their own or compatible species require special enrichment to compensate for the decrease in social
interaction. The facility must ensure that singly housed NHPs have the ability to see and hear other animals of their
own or compatible species or are provided special attention regarding enhancement of their environment.

This item was corrected at the time of inspection.
Inspection conducted on August 4-5th 2014 with an exit briefing on 5-August-2014 with the IACUC Chair and facility
representatives.
