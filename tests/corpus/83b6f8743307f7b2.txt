INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Program review, facility inspection and IO reports (Semiannuals) were not conducted and generated within six
months. Semiannuals were last conducted in March 2018. Lack of IACUC oversight may allow deficiencies to go
unnoticed and/or uncorrected, leading to less than optimal animal health and well being. Program review, facility
inspection, and IO reports must be conducted and generated at least every six months.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility uses a point system to assure animal discomfort and pain is limited. This system is not described in the
protocols. It is therefore difficult to determine if the point system satisfies the requirements listed in the protocols.
Animals may be used incorrectly if their use is not clearly defined in the protocols. A description of the procedures
used to ensure animal pain, discomfort, and use are limited must be included in the protocols.
