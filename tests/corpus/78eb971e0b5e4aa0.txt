ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection the young and smaller male bonnet macaque was observed harassing and being extremely
aggressive to the female macaque in the grouping of three housed in their enclosure. The female appeared
stressed as she was exhibiting multiple passive and submissive behaviors but the male would not retreat. Twice we
observed the young male grabbing and biting at her as she attempted to get higher up in the enclosure and she
dropped back down to the floor. We noticed bleeding wounds on her left front limb and on her face. The young
male had a laceration on the right lower mandibular area extending into his neck. The female was removed from
the enclosure and relocated to another enclosure by herself. The Attending Veterinarian was contacted and he is
said to arrive in the morning of 12-12-2015 to look at both animals.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The record of inventory of animals on hand was not current or up to date. The total count of several species was
not accurate to the animals on property at time of the inspection. Some species such as the tamanduas had
"transferred ?" next to two of the animals. The male spotted leopard was not on the inventory and several animals
that were recently acquired or born on premises were not recorded. This record must be kept current and
maintained to accurately reflect all the animals.
Disposition and acquisition records were not made available for review on this inspection. Acquisition of the female
spotted leopard, five young lions, three squirrel monkeys, three fennec foxes, one liger, and several tamanduas
were not on premises for review. The disposition records for the three red ruffed lemurs, three ruffed lemurs, four
kinkajous, one tabby tiger, two spot-nosed guenons, and three zebras were not made available for inspection. The
records were said to be in another location that was not readily available. These records need to be made
available for inspection.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the sheltered housing for the three gibbon the overhead light was burned out. The sheltered housing facilities
must be lighted well enough to permit routine inspection and cleaning of the facility, and observation of the
nonhuman primates. The non-working light was removed but a new working light needs to be installed.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There is one owl monkey, one capuchin and one Celebes that are housed individually. These animals must be
provided special attention regarding enhancement of their environment, based on the needs of the individual
species and in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian. Very little enrichment was being
provided at time of this inspection. These three animals need more enrichment and be identified on the enrichment
documents which have been approved by the attending veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several areas in the alpaca and camel enclosure had erosion issues which left holes and sharp concrete edges
around the support posts. The substrate needs to be addressed so that there are no holes or sharp edges that may
injure the animals.
There were several areas where holes had been dug by the four giant anteaters along the fence line and at the front
of their shelter. These areas need to be filled and the substrate maintained so that the animals will not be injured
and the enclosure can be monitored better for potential vermin issues.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
One of the wolves was locked in the middle enclosure at the time of this inspection. The facility representative was
unsure why as this was not an area he was responsible for. The animal had no shelter from inclement weather.
The representative called for a shelter to be brought to the enclosure and it was put in the enclosure during the
inspection.Corrected during the inspection.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Throughout the inspection several bait boxes for vermin were checked. The bait inside the boxes were moldy and
not effective. One box had become indented in the ground and had water and grass debris inside it. The licensee
employs a pest control service to maintain these devices but it appears that they are not being checked or
maintained as often as they need to be. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and
avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained.
