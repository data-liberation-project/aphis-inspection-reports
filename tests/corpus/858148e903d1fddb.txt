The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is not performing adequate daily observations. It was found during the inspectors’ inspection of the
dogs that three dogs had loose teeth. The attending veterinarian stated to the inspectors by phone that he had
taught the licensee and her husband how to identify and score dental health conditions. The inspectors, also,
identified a problem with the ears of one dog during the inspection.
The attending veterinarian was not aware of the progression of deteriorating dental problems or the presence of
Giardia in the facility. The attending veterinarian stated that he expected the licensee to keep him aware of the
situations for health and disease even if the licensee was utilizing other veterinarians to address the dogs’ health
needs.
The lack of daily observation and direct and frequent communication to convey the health, behavior, and well-being
in a timely and accurate manner to the attending veterinarian can cause health concerns and underlying issues to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases to go unaddressed. The licensee must perform daily observations of
all animals to assess their health and well-being, and have a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so
that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed to the
attending veterinarian.
To be completed: from this day forward
2.50(a)(1) REPEATTIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
11 adult dogs did not have individual identification on them at the time of the inspection. Four puppies under 16
weeks of age did not have identification.
The lack of identification does not allow for tracking animals within records and providing accurate veterinarian care.
The licensee must individually identify all live dogs.
2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records of dogs on-hand were not complete. The records only contained 19 of 26 adult dogs and no puppies.
The lack of records does not allow for the tracing of animals. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records
or forms which fully and correctly disclose this subpart concerning each dog or cat purchased or otherwise acquired,
owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized,
sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal
while in his or her possession or under his or her control.
3.1(b) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two piles of clutter are in the main dog area within the facility. The clutter is located on top of two dog enclosures
containing a total of three adult dogs. The clutter consists of boxes, paperwork, clothing materials and towels, a
basket, a scale, framed pictures, hairdryers, etc.
The accumulation of debris, unused materials and equipment, can impede the ability to clean and sanitize
sufficiently and can lead to vermin infestations. The licensee must remove the clutter from on top of the dog
enclosures and ensure that all dog areas remain free of clutter and trash at all times.
3.1(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were three enclosures housing five dogs that had excessive rust towards the bottom of the sides and along
the bottom.
Excessive rust does not allow for adequate cleaning of the enclosures and could affect structural integrity. The
surfaces in the housing facility must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily
cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. Interior surfaces and any surfaces that come incontact with dogs or cats must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that
affects the structural strength of the surface
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 2 crates housing 3 dogs and the enclosed porch area that is used to access the the outdoor portion of the facility
there was a buildup of debris, including food, feces, hair, urine, and unknown brown residue.
The lack of cleaning can lead to the health issues. Hard surfaces with which the dogs or cats come in contact must
be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta
and reduce disease hazards.
3.6(c)(1)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One enclosure, containing two dogs, did not provide minimum space required. The enclosure provided 4.17 square
feet. The dogs measured 18 inches and 17 inches requiring a minimum 7.60 square feet of space.
Failure to provide the dogs with the minimum amount of floor space does not allow for freedom of movement which
could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals. Each dog housed in a primary enclosure
must be provided a minimum amount of floor space as required by the Animal Welfare Act. The applicant must
provide each dog with an enclosure that meets the minimum required floor
space in order to support their health and well-being.
Corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.11(b)(1)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
During the inspection the licensee corrected the space situation by moving a puppy out of an enclosure and putting
in the adult dog without cleaning or sanitizing the enclosure. The puppy was moved to another area that had not
been cleaned and sanitized prior to its introduction. The licensee is treating for Giardia in all of their puppies. The
first puppy was diagnosed in October of 2019 and it was still present in the puppies at the time of this inspection.
Lack of cleaning and disinfecting between animals housed in enclosures allows for the spread of disease and
illness. Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized in accordance with
this section before they can be used to house, feed, or water another dog or cat, or social grouping of dogs.
To be corrected: from this day forwardThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and her husband.
