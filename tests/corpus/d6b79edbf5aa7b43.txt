Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A young rabbit was seen to be in poor condition, had some dried discharge in its right ear, mild discharge around its eyes,
and its left hind foot had hair loss. The licensee said that he noticed its poor condition yesterday (8/25) and that its dam
probably stopped letting it suckle but he was busy with other chores and hadn't attended to it. We had the licensee
separate it with its own food and water and explained he must contact the attending veterinarian for treatment
instructions. Delay in treatment of poor condition and an ear problem can cause discomfort in the rabbit and if from a
contagious cause could spread to other rabbits. Ensure that when health conditions are identified they are promptly
communicated to the attending veterinarian and treatment instructions are followed.

Indirect Non-Compliances:
*A pot-bellied pig in the back pen had a tusk (canine tooth) on its right side that has grown back and into its right upper
cheek. Animal Care Inspector Rivera was able to gently and carefully push the skin back by the tooth and we could not
see where the point ended, although we didn't see any signs of infection or a wound. Pig tusks (canine teeth) grow
throughout their life and the direction of this pig's tusk growth will cause pain and health problems if not addressed.

Ensure that this pig's tusk is thoroughly evaluated by the attending veterinarian and a treatment plan is made and followed
to prevent future problems with this (and other) tusks on this pig.

*An African-crested porcupine had problems observed in both eyes. The surface of each eyeball appeared pale in color,
it had mild amount of pale-colored discharge in the corners of the eyes. The conditions we observed today indicate that it
has problems with both eyes. Ensure that this porcupine's eye conditions are closely evaluated and treated per the
attending veterinarian's instructions.

*A white goat housed with the Barbados sheep had an abnormally growing hoof (his right back hoof). An older red alpaca
was observed to have front toenails that are overgrown. The other alpaca's toes were seen to have been trimmed but this
one's nails didn't appear to have been trimmed. Overgrown/abnormally growing hooves in goats and toenails in alpacas
can cause gait abnormalities and lead to painful conditions. Ensure that these two animals' feet are trimmed by an
experienced and knowledgeable person and that a routine of regular trimming of hooves and toenails is completed and
maintained.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A smaller white rabbit in the first pen by the walkway had a scab and hairless area on its nose. The licensee was not
aware of this condition and we pointed it out to the licensee. The licensee indicated it wouldn't be worth treating but we
explained that as an exhibit animal it must be treated per the attending veterinarian's instructions. The licensee and
facility must maintain a method of adequate daily observations to identify problems such as this and accurately

communicate them to the attending veterinarian and follow the veterinarian's prescribed treatment plan.

Facilities, general.
One enclosure housing 9 rabbits and another housing 7 rabbits was observed to have an excessive accumulation of
rotten food and soiled waste that was covered in flies. The licensee stated that it had been at least a week since they had
cleaned out the old food. Soiled waste and rotten food can attract flies, cause odors, and are a potential disease hazard
for the animals. Cleaning must be performed more frequently and as often as necessary in order to prevent vermin
infestations, odors, and disease hazards.

Note: This was corrected before the exit interview.
3.52(a) Direct

Facilities, outdoor.
The square rabbit enclosure (furthest east) lacks adequate shelter for the 9 rabbits in it. The area does not have sufficent
natural shade from trees and only has two shelters that all 9 rabbits could not comfortably fit in. Lack of access to shade
and shelter from elements can cause discomfort in affected rabbits. Ensure that these rabbits all have access to shelter
from direct sunlight and shelter from the elements at all times where they are housed.

Note: The licensee corrected this condition before the exit interview.
3.53(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.

The rabbit pen closest to the walking trail (west pen) housing 7 rabbits had a corner of loose wire mesh with points where
the rabbits could contact. A rabbit hutch up by the nursery housing 2 rabbits had two screws with points where the rabbits
could contact them. Loose wire and points could injure rabbits. To protect them from injury, ensure the areas where
rabbits are housed are free from sharp points and loose wire.

Facilities, general.
The following are in need of repair or replacement:
*The enclosure housing a muntjac, in the southwest corner by the shed, there is chain link fencing that is broken with
points.
*An enclosure housing 3 sika deer, had a panel on the northeast side of the pond that is bent, leaning, and had become
disconnected from the top of the post. Also, on the north side of the enclosure near the green shed there is a section of
fence that is bent and damaged across the top.
*An enclosure housing 4 barbary sheep had a tree branch that had fallen on one portion of the east side of the fence.
Also, on the west side there was a portion of fencing that was bent over and a section that had a tree branch that had
fallen on it. The fence was still standing and containing the animals, but the top of the fencing is bent and damaged.
*The gate on the north side of the enclosure housing 2 fallow deer had wire mesh fencing that had become detached from
the framing. There was a large hole in the mesh fencing with loose wires.
*Some of the wire panels between the two camels’ pens have become bent and have sharp points. One of the enclosures
houses 2 camels and the other 1 camel.
*The fence between the enclosure housing 3 wolves and 5 bison has a post on the west side that is leaning.

Enclosures that are not properly maintained could cause injury or death to the animals or allow animals to escape.
Enclosures must be maintained so that they are structurally sound and free from sharp points, loose wires, and holes.

Watering.
A liger was observed to not have any water for about 20hrs. His water receptacle was empty during inspection. The
licensee stated that the liger's water receptacle has a hole in it, that he has a new water trough for the enclosure but
hasn’t installed it. He said the last time the water receptacle was filled was around 4 or 5pm last night (8/25). The licensee
filled the water receptacle and the liger immediately began to drink water and continued to drink for over four minutes.
Lack of water can cause dehydration, discomfort, heat stress and even death, especially in extreme temperatures. The
licensee must ensure that potable water be provided as often as necessary for the heath and comfort of the animal.

Note: This was corrected prior to the exit interview.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
