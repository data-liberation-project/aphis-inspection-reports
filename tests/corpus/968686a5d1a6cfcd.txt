ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:40 p.m. on
21-FEB-19.
Upon arrival at the facility, I parked outside the facility gate, called the two contact numbers provided and left
messages. I then waited for 30 minutes.
End of report.
