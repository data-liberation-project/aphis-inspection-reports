REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This was a search inspection.
The facility representative was contacted and stated that there are more than four breeding female dogs on the
premises. Records provided to USDA APHIS Animal Care (AC) indicate that a dog was sold by the owner at this
address to a pet store on February 24, 2014. This constitutes a wholesale transaction and is a regulated activity.
Any person operating or intending to operate as a dealer, who are not exempted from the licensing requirements,
must have a valid license. The owner shall file a completed application form with the AC Regional Director if he
would like to conduct any further regulated activity.
The regulations and licensing requirements were discussed and an application packet was provided to the facility
representative.
