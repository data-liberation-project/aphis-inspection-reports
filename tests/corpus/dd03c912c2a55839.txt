Facilities, general.
Facilities are not being maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. An old tack room building adjacent to
the camel barn has wooden walls that are broken and rotting, exposing sharp edges of the wood and the inside of the
building (now used for storage). The wood framing on the front right side of the building has a section missing exposing
nails. One of the wallaby enclosures is covered with an old tarp that is fraying and has several strings dangling down into
the crate. Exposed nails, sharp wood edges, and frayed strings within an enclosure make animals at risk for injuries or
illnesses. Correct by ensuring facilities are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The enclosure housing two wallabies is located within inches of the facility's perimeter fence. A perimeter fence which is
less than 3 feet in distance from a primary enclosure may allow for animals or unauthorized persons outside the fence to
interact with the regulated animals inside the enclosure. The facility must maintain a distance of at least 3 feet between
primary enclosures and the perimeter fence, or receive written approval from the Administrator for shorter distances.
