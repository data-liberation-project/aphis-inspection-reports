2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility does not have a written Program of Veterinary Care. The facility must have a formal arrangement when
a part-time veterinarian is used which includes a written Program of Veterinary Care and regularly scheduled visits
by the veterinarian. The Program of Veterinary Care, which is reviewed on an annual basis by the attending
veterinarian, is used to ensure the facility has a clear understanding of how to treat the animals in their care
appropriately. Contact your attending veterinarian and create a written Program of Veterinary Care by July 31, 2017.
