RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Currently there are no records being kept on puppies born at the facility. There is one litter of 4 with no information
on the female or number of puppies in the litter, and one litter that was born in September 2014 that has no
information on the female or litter numbers or puppy ID numbers.
Complete puppy records of the female information, DOB, puppy numbers/sex, and ID numbers need to be kept for
proper management and care of the regulated animals.
The licensee must keep accurate and timely records of all offspring born at the facility by any regulated animals in
their possession.
