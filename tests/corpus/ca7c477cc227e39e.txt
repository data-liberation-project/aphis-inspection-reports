PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Two baboon enclosures had loops of water lines entering the cage from the top at the time of inspection. The
waterlines were attached to the source and to the cage at the water nipple. This created a loop of water line
sufficiently large for the animals to put a head through and possibly cause strangulation. Facility personnel
immediately removed the water lines from the enclosure when they were pointed out by USDA personnel and the
animal staff was instructed to assure the cages were pulled away from the water line origin to prevent the lines from
being reintroduced to the cages. Two more Baboons had enrichment devices attached to the front of their
enclosures by a rope that was sufficiently long that it could be pulled into the enclosure (but not the enrichment
device). This would create a loop of rope sufficiently large that a head or limb could be passed through and become
entrapped. Personnel must ensure that the enclosures in which animals are placed do not contribute to these risks.
Correct by ensuring that personnel are properly trained to handle animals and equipment in a manner that takes
into account the special capabilities and behaviors of the animals.
Two racks of rabbit enclosures, containing six rabbits each, had water nipples that did not fully reach into the
cage. The animal care staff had not noticed that the nipples did not break the plane of the back of the cage where
they were supposed to come into the cage through a hole approximately one and a half inches in diameter. The
staff had provided water bottles to two of the animals as an addition to the nipples. Having the nipple essentially
recessed into a small hole makes it difficult for the animal to easily access fresh water and could cause stress in the
animal and possibly lead to dehydration. Correct by ensuring that personnel are properly trained to monitor that the
basic needs of each animal are easily accessible.
One cat, that had recently had surgery, was noted to be in an enclosure that contained an Elizabethan collar.
The collar was not on the animal even though the surgical record said an E-collar would be used and did not have
any end date for the wear of the device. The collar is used to prevent self-injurious behavior and, if not on, may lead
to animal injury. Correct by ensuring personnel are properly trained to assure post-procedural care is provided and
documented as directed.
Immediate post-procedural care was outlined in the protocols for two animals but there was no documentation of
these procedures being performed by the investigative staff. An anesthesia record was present but did not indicate
any animal information past the discontinuation of anesthesia or for the remainder of the procedure day. Animal
number 23161 had no immediate post-procedural record and animal number 444 also had no immediate
post-procedural record and facility personnel stated that the procedure may go as late as 8 PM at which point theanimal would be returned to its enclosure. Failure to complete proper post-procedural care could lead to animals
experiencing unnecessary pain or distress and, often, the only way to monitor that the investigators are following the
standards approved by the IACUC is by records review. Correct by ensuring personnel are properly trained and
document their compliance with established post-procedural care.
All of the noted items above, except post-procedural care were addressed by the facility when identified by
USDA personnel. Correct against the future occurrence of these items by ensuring training and instruction of all
personnel in humane methods of animal maintenance and experimentation. The training must include: The basic
needs of each species of animal; Proper handling and care for the various species of animals used by the facility;
Proper pre-procedural and post- procedural care of animals; and Aseptic surgical methods and procedures.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The IACUC identified seventeen instances of expired medications during their last semi-annual site visit (the
number one deficiency identified). Only three of those medications were related to USDA covered species. While
none of these medications were found during this inspection, another four bottles of expired medication were found
in animal facilities remote from the central pharmacy. Expired medications are considered adulterated and are not
considered an appropriate method to prevent or treat diseases or injuries. If used on animals, expired medications
could fail to work as intended and possibly cause unexpected or adverse reactions. Correct by assuring there is a
set procedure for the identification and disposal of expired medications in areas outside of the central pharmacy.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Three primates were singly housed in adjacent cages in a narrow room at the time of inspection. The room had an
empty cage that was visible from the other three cages but none of the primates could see another. The facility
primate enrichment plan included four criteria for enrichment of this species. One of the four criteria was social
housing that includes visual contact with others. This criteria was not met for these primates and individually housed
nonhuman primates that are unable to see nonhuman primates of their own or compatible species require special
attention. Inadequate social enrichment to primates can lead to behavioral problems that may manifest in abnormal
and injurious behavior. Correct by assuring all primates receive at least the full enrichment outlined in the facility(cid:25)s
approved enrichment plan and that certain nonhuman primates are provided special attention regarding
enhancement of their environment, based on the needs of the individual species and in accordance with the
instructions of the attending veterinarian.
Another room contained nine primates in individual enclosures. Four enclosures had a foraging ball and three
had fleece tubes but one enclosure containing a primate (98007) with notable hairloss had neither of these
enhanced enrichment devices. The four animals with enhanced enrichment had no documentation that they werereceiving the enrichment or were using it effectively. The behavior specialist does keep record of each primate and
a periodic review of their conditions but this record alone does not demonstrate whether enrichment is being
provided in an effective manner. Correct by assuring that those nonhuman primates that show signs of being in
psychological distress, through behavior or appearance, are provided special attention as required.
During two days of on-site inspection of animal facilities, it appeared that all primates, except the three above,
were receiving basic enrichment as directed by the enrichment plan. The animals determined to need special
attention did not appear to be getting enough extra enrichment from the foraging balls and suet feeders used as
extra enrichment. Some animals did have foraging devices attached to the enclosure but in two days of inspection,
only one device was found to contain enrichment. The facility had a room dedicated to, and stocked with,
enrichment but the use of this enrichment was not evident or sufficiently documented to reasonably conclude that
the primates were benefitting from it. Facility personnel and the (cid:28)"Monkey Helper"(cid:29) form in the enrichment logs
indicated that the primates determined to need special consideration received extra enrichment once each week.
Since the enrichment was labor-intensive to set up and to clean up, it is apparent that more personnel would be
needed to increase the provision of extra enrichment. Correct by having the IACUC review the environmental
enhancement plan regarding special attention primates, based on the needs of the individual species in consultation
with the behaviorist and in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
During the inspection a room containing bats in 1 cubic foot butterfly transports was noted. The number of bats in
each enclosure ranged from one to five. The bats were quietly hanging in their enclosures at the time of inspection
and appeared to be normal. The protocol covering these bats did not describe the housing for the animals and
specifically did not address these 1 cubic foot enclosures as primary housing. At least two of the animals in these
enclosures had been housed that manner for up to 23 hours a day since September of 2015 according to facility
records and personal statements. To meet the requirement for sufficient space for normal social and postural
adjustments with adequate freedom of movement, Subpart F species that fly (i.e., bats) should be provided with
sufficient unobstructed enclosure volume to enable movement by flying and sufficient roosting space to allow all
individuals to rest simultaneously unless justified for scientific reasons in the protocol. Correct by: 18 July 2016
