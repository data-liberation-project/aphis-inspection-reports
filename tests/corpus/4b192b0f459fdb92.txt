3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The facility had two primary enclosures that were in need of repairs. The corner of the fencing in the camel pasture was
pulled away from the wooden top rail near the dumpster. The metal wire fencing in the Prehensile tail porcupine enclosure
had rusted through leaving sharp points and compromising the integrity of the fence. Additionally, the heating pad inside
the nest box was anchored down with screws. The tip of one screw was protruding from the bottom of the nest box and
was a potential sharp point. The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
Correct by November 7th, 2022 or before your next relicense inspection is scheduled.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
The facility's current pest control program for the kangaroo hay room and the capybara is inadequate. There was a large
accumulation of flies attracted to the kangaroo urine on the floor of the hay room. Additionally, the food receptacle for the
capybara attracted a large swarm of flies. They could be seen traveling between the food and a pile of excreta nearby.
Flies and other pests can harbor diseases which might impact the health and well-being of the animals. Correct by
November 7th, 2022 or before your next scheduled relicense inspection.
