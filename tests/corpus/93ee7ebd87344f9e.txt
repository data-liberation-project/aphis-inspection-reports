ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult female black and gold Yorkshire terrier "Ginger" ID # 057258591 is blinking and squinting in the right
eye. The eye had a watery discharge, with increased redness and a bluish tint overall. This dog was very active
and reluctant to allow a close examination and photograph.
***An adult male blue and tan Yorkshire terrier "Dewgee" ID# 47646C193A has a watery discharge in both eyes and
a brownish exudate in the hair surrounding the eyes. Both eyes appear cloudy with a bluish tint.
Eye problems can be caused by injury or disease and may be extremely painful and irritating to the affected animal.
***An adult female Yorkshire terrier "Rosie" ID# 7644437A68 has dental problems. She is licking excessively, and
the top left rear molar and top left canine are completely encased in a hard greyish-brown material. The inspector
was unable to visualize the rest of the dog's mouth due to its reluctance to be examined and photographed.
*** An adult female Maltese has dental problems. The top left molar and top left canine is encased in a hard
brownish material. The top left molar has a creamy white discharge at the gum line. This dog was very active and
was reluctant to be photographed.
Dental problems can be painful, make it difficult to eat, lead to the development of other health problems, and can
affect the well-being of the animal.
The licensee must have these dogs evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment, and
provide the inspector the documentation of this visit upon request.

2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are at least thirteen dogs that need grooming. There were mats of various sizes on the face, neck, ear,
limbs, abdomen and backs of these dogs.
Excessive matting causes pain and discomfort to the animal. In addition, matting can foster skin infections and can
hinder the animal's ability to move or defecate normally.
The licensee needs to remove the matted fur on these dogs. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the
licensee must establish and follow a program of regular coat maintenance for all the dogs to prevent thedevelopment of excessive matting.
The licensee must ensure that all animals on the facility receive adequate veterinary care and health maintenance
at all times.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In three outdoor enclosures housing four dogs, there are wire panels on the ground exposing surfaces that could
injure or entrap the animals. In two of these enclosures, there are several sharp points exposed to the animals.
Exposed wire panels and sharp points can injure the animals.
The licensee must ensure that all housing facilities are in good repair, contain the animals securely, and protect the
animals from injury.
To be corrected by September 25, 2014.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the sheltered building, there are at least six indoor/outdoor access doors that have an excessive buildup of dark
brown grime and grease on the outer surfaces. This is a potential source of contamination to the enclosed animals.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in contact with the dogs are cleaned and sanitized as often as needed to
help protect the health and welfare of the animals.
To be corrected by September 25, 2014.
3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the indoor housing facility, there is a strong odor of ammonia and other waste. Within just a few minutes, the
inspector's eyes were burning and watering due to the fumes.
A buildup of ammonia and other odors can cause respiratory and eye problems in the animals, and affect their
well-being. The licensee must ensure there is enough proper ventilation using windows, ventilation fans or air
conditioning to reduce these strong odors.
To be corrected immediately.
3.9(b)FEEDING.
In many of the indoor and sheltered enclosures, there are food bowls that are excessively chewed and roughened.
Chewed and roughened food bowls are difficult to properly clean and sanitize, which results in an increased risk of
contamination to the animals.
The licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are made of a durable material that can be properly cleaned and
sanitized. The affected receptacles must be repaired or replaced.

3.10
WATERING.
In six outdoor enclosures affecting nine dogs, there are water buckets that have a greenish discoloration in the
water to the point where the inspector could not visualize the bottom of the container. This is an indication that the
water is not being changed frequently enough, and that the water receptacles are not being cleaned often enough.
Inadequately cleaned water receptacles pose a potential health risk to the animals. Clean, potable water must be
available to the animals for their health and well- being.
The licensee must ensure that all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitized to protect the health of the
animals.
To be corrected by September 16, 2014.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In a majority of enclosures, in both the indoor facility and the outside pens, there is a buildup of fecal material. In a
majority of the indoor enclosures, there is hair and other waste materials caught in the wires.
In the sheltered facility, there is an enclosure containing one adult with four pups which has a buildup of grime, hair,
and waste on the cage walls. A soft dog bed present in this enclosure was visibly dirty and contaminated with at
least four piles of feces.
The presence of excessive fecal material and other waste can cause noxious odors, attract insects, rodents and
other pests, and cause disease hazards.
The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are cleaned at least daily, and often enough to prevent the soiling of
the dogs, reduce odors, pests, and other disease hazards.
To be corrected by September 16, 2014.
3.11(c)CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In and around the four northernmost outdoor enclosures, there is an overgrowth of grasses, weeds, and other
plants. In addition, there are construction materials and other discarded items near the runs.
Weeds and a buildup of materials and other discarded items can attract insects, rodents, pests, and other vermin,
and provide living and breeding areas for these pests.
The licensee must ensure that the premises are kept free of an overgrowth of plants and discarded materials to
reduce or eliminate living and breeding areas for pests and other vermin.
To be corrected by September 25, 2014.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the larger indoor facility, there are rodent droppings on the wash-downs and floors. Rodent feces were noted
inside a single empty feed bowl in an enclosure housing a single dog.
In the smaller indoor facility there is an automatic insect spray dispenser located at the entrance, but the device is
empty. At the far end of the building were multiple flying insects near the enclosure housing four puppies.
Rodents and insect pests cause disease hazards and can affect the health and well-being of the animals. The
licensee must ensure there is an effective pest control program in place.
