3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence along the front of the outdoor exercise area housing 5 dogs (3 Cocker Spaniels and 2 Schnauzers) and
the enclosure housing 1 Chihuahua has pulled away from the top support pole. The fence is pushed outward and
could eventually break away allowing a dog to escape or get caught. Maintain all housing facilities so that they are
in good repair, protect the animals from injuries, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from
entering.

3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Outdoor enclosure # 11 housing 3 Dachshunds named "Lightning", "Ginger" and "Zing" has a dog house which at
the time of inspection was providing the only shade for the dogs. There was not any other area inside the enclosure
for the dogs to protect themselves from the direct sunlight. Adequate shade needs to be provided so that the dogs
do not become uncomfortable, distressed or overheated. Provide one or more separate outside areas of shade
large enough to contain all the animals at one time to protect them from the direct rays of the sun.
