2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*****There were at least three animals with overgrown hooves. The hooves on the rear feet of an adult female
Audad sheep, the hooves on the left rear and right front feet of an adult male Audad sheep, and the hooves on all
four feet of an adult female Ibex goat were too long. These animals were located in the petting zoo area.
Overgrown hooves can cause pain, changes in locomotion, and may harbor disease. A program for hoof
maintenance must be established and the hooves on these animals must be trimmed.
2.131
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*****There were not sufficient public barriers in all areas of the facility. There was no barrier to keep the public from
entering the non-human primate (NHP) barn. The NHP barn is located behind the grain bins used for food storage
and approximately 150 feet past a gate that was open but could be closed and used as a public barrier. There also
was not a barrier at the juvenile Llama and miniature bovine enclosure fencing outside the giraffe barn. The general
public was feeding the animals through the fence with no attendant or barrier present. The absence of a barrier
allows the public access to areas with dangerous animals and could result in harm to the animals and/or public.
The public must be restricted from entering areas with dangerous animals and a barrier must be present in areas
that don(cid:25)t have an attendant present.

3.81(c)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
*****There was no documentation specifying the extra enhancement required for single housed young juveniles and
the great apes. There was a five-month old male Capuchin monkey housed in the giraffe barn. The Capuchin
could not see other non-human primates of its own species. There are also two adult chimpanzees housed at the
facility. The lack of special considerations for these animals may lead to psychological distress and stereotypicalbehavior. The licensee must provide extra enrichment for these animals and include these in the environmental
enhancement plan.
