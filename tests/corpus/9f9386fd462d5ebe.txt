Registration.
Attempts to contact facility personnel via contact information in eFile went unanswered, so an internet search was
conducted to find alternative contact information. There it was discovered that the facility had gone out of business in April
2020. The facility's website had a closure notice, and no contact information is currently valid. There was no notice to the
Deputy Administrator of the change in status.
Notifying the agency of change in status is vital to the efficient administration and enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act.
No correction date is possible because the facility no longer exists.

An inspection and exit briefing were not possible because the facility no longer exists.
