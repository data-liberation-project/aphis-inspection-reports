ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care forms, call for "Stool tests once yearly..." yet the facility has not been
conducting annual stool tests of the animals. Not following the written instructions as outlined on the PVC could
result in illnesses and parasites not being detected in a timely manner. The facility must follow the instructions as
provided in the Program of Veterinary Care form. Correct by 18 November 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
