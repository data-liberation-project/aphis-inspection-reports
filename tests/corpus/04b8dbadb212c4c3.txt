2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A video documented that there was not sufficient distance and/or barriers in place to ensure the safety of a juvenile
tiger and the public on May 3, 2019. When shown a screen shot of the video, the licensee confirmed the contact did
occur. Because of the strength and speed of tigers, there is an inherent danger present for both the viewing public
and the exhibited animal where there is any chance that the public could come into direct contact with juvenile or
adult tigers. Correct by ensuring that from this point forward all animals (particularly dangerous animals such as
tigers) are exhibited with barriers and/or sufficient distance from the public that is appropriate for their species, age,
strength, and speed.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
