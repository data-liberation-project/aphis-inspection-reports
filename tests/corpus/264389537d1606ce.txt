2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Maltese (tag # 186) is observed to be chewing on her left flank and the base of her tail. Closer observation
revealed hairless areas along the left flank, left hind leg, in front of the base of the tail, and behind the left shoulder.
These affected areas were slightly reddened and contained small areas of crusty, scab-like material. Although the
veterinarian has provided a treatment plan for canine skin conditions this dog's condition had not been noticed and
she is not currently receiving any treatment.
Abnormal skin conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. This dog must be evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all
dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all time.
3.1(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure containing one dog, the wooden resting board has the sharp end of a large screw sticking out of
the top of it. The dog is at risk of coming into contact with this sharp point every time it sits, lays, or walks on the
board, which could result in injury.
The surfaces of housing facilities must be free of sharp points or jagged edges that could injure the dogs. The
licensee must alter this resting board in a manner that eliminates the sharp end of the screw and ensure that all
surfaces remain free of sharp points and jagged edges at all times.
The licensee removed the resting board and the screw at the time of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell and the facility representative.
