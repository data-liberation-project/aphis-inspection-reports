3.127(d) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Upon reviewing the animal inventory, after the inspection on site, it came to light that five Grant's gazelles died
during the month of January 2020 due to injury / predation by other animals. The first animal died on 1/1/20, and
two additional animals were killed by predators on 1/10/20. Despite various predator control efforts and consultation
with California Fish & Wildlife, two additional animals perished due to predation on 1/19/20 and 1/20/20.
The facility has done extensive work in recent years to extend and improve perimeter fencing, but despite these
efforts the fencing is not adequately excluding predators. The perimeter fence must keep animals out of the facility
in order to protect the animals within. The facility is currently looking into various ways to exclude predators. The
facility must ensure that predators are excluded in order to protect the animals from this time forward.
The inspection was conducted on site with facility representatives on 3/3/2020.
The inspection required follow-up with inventory review and consultation with parties involved, and an exit interview
occurred by phone on 3/18/2020 with a facility representative.
