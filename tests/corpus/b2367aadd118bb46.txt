3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning
There are three enclosures, affecting 4 dogs, which have surfaces in contact with the animals and are in need of
cleaning and sanitization. These include the inside surfaces of the shelters which have a build up of dirt and grime,
the entrances to 2 shelters that have been chewed with embedded dirt and grime, and a wind and rain break that
has a build up of dirt and grime. When questioned as to when these surfaces were last cleaned and sanitized she
replied that it had been last fall (at least 7 months). The build up of dirt and grime on these surfaces does not allow
for sanitization to occur. The licensee must clean and sanitize these surfaces, develop and maintain a program that
ensures all hard surfaces with which the dogs come into contact with are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least
once every two weeks or more often if necessary, and all other surfaces within the housing facility are cleaned and
sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
