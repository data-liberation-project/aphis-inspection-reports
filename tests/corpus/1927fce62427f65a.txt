ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:00 PM on
11-Apr-18.
The inspector arrived on April 11, 2018 at 3:00 PM, parked in the driveway of the licensee's facility, went to the front
door of the house and rang the doorbell and knocked on the door. No one answered the door. The inspector then
honked his vehicle's horn, and called the licensee's phone. No one answered the phone so the inspector left a
message and waited 30 minutes before leaving the property. The licensee did not return the phone call as of 5:00
PM later that day.
