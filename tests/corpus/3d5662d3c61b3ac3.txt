FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The wolf enclosure has a significant amount of water pooling by the guest fence line. The wolves are
continuously running through the water in a pacing manner and were wet with some hair loss in the tail area. This
pooling of water needs to be addressed through methods of adequate drainage to rapidly eliminate this excess
water.
