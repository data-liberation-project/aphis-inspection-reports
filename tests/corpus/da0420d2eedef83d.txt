ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The current written program of veterinary care does not include the guinea pigs and hamsters. The PVC should
include all the covered animals to ensure the facility has a written guide to follow concerning the health and care of
the animals. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure the PVC reflects the current inventory of
covered animals.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The following veterinary care issues were noted at the facility:
Rabbits numbered 16979, 17313, 17681 and 17329 had head tilts. Rabbits numbered 17665 ( squinting and clear
discharge was observed), 16627 ( thick yellowish discharge was observed), and 17576 ( squinting and clear
discharge was observed) had eye problems which included heavy discharge. Rabbit #1309 was underweight,
depressed, and soiled.
According to the facility representative, these animals had not been seen by the attending veterinarian.
Failure to provide veterinary care to the rabbits could lead to unnecessary pain and discomfort. The rabbits should
be evaluated by a qualified veterinarian.

Numerous rabbits had overgrown nails. An excessive nail length can cause an animal to stand abnormally.
Abnormal posture may cause strain on joints and may be accompanied by possible pain and/or discomfort and joint
damage. In addition, long nails can get caught on the wire mesh floors of their primary enclosures. A system should
be in place to identify animals that are in need of nail trimming and provide trimming in a timely manner.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In the guinea pig and hamster room, the ambient temperature was observed to be 93 degrees F. According to the
facility representative, the air conditioner was not functioning and there was not a back up system available. This
animal room did not have any windows or vents to provide ventilation for the health and comfort of the animals. A
system should be in place to ensure that the ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities is not allowed to rise
above 85 degrees F.
Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs or hamsters shall be adequately ventilated to provide for the health and
comfort of the animals at all times. Such facilities shall be provided with fresh air either by means of windows, doors,
vents, or air conditioning, and shall be ventilated so as to minimize drafts, odors, and moisture condensation. The
ambient temperature shall not be allowed to rise above 85 [deg]F.

3.28(c)(1)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The interior height of at least one guinea pig enclosure is not 7 inches and does not meet our minimum
requirements. Insufficient interior height of the primary enclosure does not allow the guinea pigs to make normal
postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure
this requirement is met.

3.28(c)(1)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The available floor space provided in the enclosure housing 2 guinea pigs does not meet our minimum space
requirements. Each guinea pig shall be provided a minimum amount of floor space to make normal postural
adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure this
requirement is met.To be corrected by August 7, 2015

WATERING.
Potable water was not available to the guinea pigs being housed in plastic enclosures.The water receptacles are
open containers and were contaminated with excreta, bedding, and other debris. This contaminated water may
prevent the guinea pigs from receiving their normal daily water requirements. Failure to provide potable water may
lead to dehydration and other health issues. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure potable water is
made available to the animals.
Open containers used for dispensing water to guinea pigs shall be so placed in or attached to the primary enclosure
as to minimize contamination from excreta.

3.51(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The thermometer in the rabbit barn read 86 degrees F and there was not a source of auxiliary ventilation provided to
the animals. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure auxiliary ventilation is provided for the rabbits
when the ambient temperature is 85 degrees F or higher.
Indoor housing facilities for rabbits shall be adequately ventilated to provide for the health and comfort of the
animals at all times. Such facilities shall be provided with fresh air either by means of windows, doors, vents, or air
conditioning and shall be ventilated so as to minimize drafts, odors, and moisture condensation. Auxiliary
ventilation, such as exhaust fans and vents or air conditioning, shall be provided when the ambient temperature is
85 degrees F or higher.

3.51(d)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Two rows of rabbit enclosures are moderately covered in rust. On at least one rabbit enclosure, the wire mesh
forming the ceiling has rusted through, creating a hole in the mesh. The presence of rust may prevent the required
cleaning and sanitizing of the enclosures, which may adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals.
The interior surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that they are impervious tomoisture and may be readily sanitized.

3.53(a)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In one rabbit enclosure, a water nozzle is leaking into the primary enclosure. The rabbit was observed to be wet
from the dripping water. Wet hair coats may lead to irritation of the skin and/or dermatitis. A system should be in
place and maintained to ensure rabbits remain dry in their primary enclosures.
Primary enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to enable the rabbits to remain dry and clean.
To be corrected by August 3, 2015
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There is a moderate build up of hair and excreta observed along the edges of numerous rabbit enclosure. A
cleaning schedule should be in place to keep primary enclosures reasonably free of excreta, hair and other debris.
To be corrected by August 7, 2015
3.56(b)
SANITATION.
Rabbit enclosures are not being sanitized at least once every 30 days. According to the facility representative, the
enclosures are being sanitized prior to the introduction of new rabbits, but not every 30 days as required. Failure to
sanitize rabbit enclosures on a regular schedule could lead to unsanitary conditions. A system should be in place to
ensure rabbit enclosures are being sanitized as required.
Primary enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized at least once every 30 days by washing them with hot water (180
[deg]F.) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent
solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam or flame.To be corrected from this day forward
3.56(c)
SANITATION.
The floors in the rabbit barn have areas of standing liquid containing excreta and water used to wash down the
barn. The majority of the liquid is around the periphery of the barn. Standing liquid can attract flies and other flying
pests increasing disease hazards to animal areas. A system should be in place and maintained to keep the
premises clean in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
To be corrected by August 7, 2015.
3.56(d)
SANITATION.
In the rabbit barn, there was a moderate amount of flies. Although there is some pest control present, additional
measures should be taken to minimize the fly populations in these areas. The presence of pests can increase
disease hazards in animal areas.
An effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established
and maintained.
