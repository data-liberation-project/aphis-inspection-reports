2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 668 guinea pigs including adults,
weanlings, and newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no recent inventory records indicating the
number of adults, weanlings, and newborns except for some weanlings in January recorded or the number of guinea pigs
that died in the last few months. Failure to keep inventory records including births and deaths makes it difficult to track
changes in production, losses due to death, and to assess the animal care program. Licensee must ensure that records
are kept and maintained on guinea pigs held, owned, including births and deaths, and sold to help keep track of animals,
document changes in ownership, and to help assess the animal care program. Correct by February 21, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the manager.
