2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** There was a pig farrowing in a muddy pen that housed 9 other pigs. I noticed that the piglet was presenting feet
first.The licensee was informed and they watched it for a while. She then called her husband. Once the husband
observed it he asked me for suggestions. I then had to explain that the veterinarian employed by the facility must be
consulted and provide the veterinary care to the animals. It was then that licensee's called the veterinarian. The
licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented. The licensee must ensure that all animals
receive adequate veterinary care at all times. The veterinarian was contacted during the inspection and the
inspection was discontinued at that time. The licensees followed the veterinarians instructions. The piglet died but
the female pig is doing well. It was corrected on the first day of the inspection.
** There is a brown rabbit that had excessive matting covering its entire rear end. The mats are so dense that you
can not differentiate its tail from the accumulated mats. Excessive matting causes pain and discomfort to the animal.
In addition, matting can foster skin infections and can hinder the animal's ability to move or defecate normally. The
licensee needs to have the matted fur removed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate
veterinary care at all times. Correct by October 4, 2015

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** There was a thunderstorm the night before and the facility had some damage, a lot of standing water and mud.
All of the outside stalls of the barn were flooded and were completely muddy including a stall containing 10 pigs. By
3 pm the day after the storm they had not relocated the pigs from the muddy enclosure. During the inspection I
noticed a pig farrowing in the muddy enclosure that had small puddles of water. The licensees watched the pig a
while before deciding to relocate the pig to a suitable enclosure to farrow the piglets. When climatic conditions
present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of
those conditions. The licensee should have removed the pigs from this enclosure in a timely manner to ensure the
safety and health of these animals. This was corrected by moving the farrowing pig to a more suitable enclosure
and laying adequate amounts of hay for the animals to have dry areas to access within their enclosure3.54(b)
FEEDING.
** The rabbits' feeders were dirty and deteriorating. They had not been cleaned and some needed to be replaced.
All feeders shall be cleaned and/or sanitized at least once every two weeks for the health and well being of the
animal. It was corrected by the exit briefing.
3.56(a)(3)
SANITATION.
** There were two rabbits' cages that had an accumulation of feces below it that piled up reaching the wire floor of
their cages. The enclosures did not have a divider between the top and bottom enclosures allowing the feces to
drop into the rabbits enclosure below. The feces must be removed once a week to prevent illness and disease of
the animals. It was corrected by the exit briefing.
3.56(b)(3)
SANITATION.
** All of the rabbits' enclosures require cleaning. They had old hay and feces packed on the floors of the enclosures.
The wire floors could not be visualized except from beneath where the feces had collected and reached the wire
mesh floors. The staff had mentioned for at least a month that the enclosures had not been cleaned out. Primary
enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized at least once every 30 days to prevent disease and illness of the animals. It
was corrected by the exit briefing.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** A stall inside the barn is being used to store the hay for the animals. During the inspection I witnessed two goats
that had gotten in the hay storage and was standing on top of the hay while eating it. The storage should be able to
keep the animals out so that they can't contaminate the hay supply for the other animals. These goats could have
potentially urinated and/or defecated on the hay which could contaminate the hay. Supplies of hay shall be stored in
facilities which adequately protect such supplies against contamination by animals. It was corrected by the exit
interview.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** There was a pen with ten pigs that was completely muddy from corner to corner with small puddles of water.
There was another enclosure with two pigs that was generally muddy with an exception of a small portion under theshed. In order for these pigs to get to their drinking water they would have to walk through the mud to obtain it. The
licensee stated that there was a terrible storm the night before but the animals were not relocated in a timely
manner to provide them a drier environment until repairs and conditions were more appropriate. A suitable method
shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. It was corrected by the exit briefing.
3.130
WATERING.
In the goat and sheep primary enclosure there were two troughs of water that had an abundance of a green slimy
substance and debris in it. The licensee had filled the water troughs but did not clean or sanitize before doing so. All
receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary for the animals health and well being. It was corrected by the exit
briefing..
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
** In the enclosure containing a sheep and goat there were several strands of hay bale twine on the ground. This
can potentially be ingested and/or the animals may get entangled in the string. The premises should be kept clean
and the string should be removed from the enclosure. It was corrected by the exit briefing.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
