2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***According to the hands on veterinary inspection conducted on October 28, 2016, there were three adult dogs
identified as Bella, a Toy Poodle, #0A01600619, DOB 10/1/11, Raven, a Toy Poodle, #0A01600179, DOB 1214/05
and Prince, a Toy Poodle, #0A01601932. These three dogs were diagnosed with severe periodontal disease
according to the veterinarian's records. The licensee stated that these dogs were no longer at the facility. When
asked if they had received treatment for the periodontal disease prior to leaving the facility, the licensee stated that
the veterinarian had not been contacted for treatment and had received no treatment prior to being re-homed. Lack
of veterinary care for appropriate diagnosis or treatment can worsen the current condition, delay healing or result in
death. The licensee must assure that all regulated animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.
The licensee understands that this is to be corrected from this day, June 15, 2017, forward.
***There was a female Pomeranian identified as Cookie #0A01602528, DOB 9/3/10 that had been diagnosed on
October 28, 2016 with severe periodontal disease, according to the hands on veterinary inspection. The licensee
stated that this dog had not been taken to the veterinarian for treatment nor had there been any discussion with the
veterinarian concerning treatment. Upon observation of this dog, thick amounts of brown, yellow and green
substance covered approximately 30%-60% of the front teeth, the back teeth were completely encased with a thick
brown substance. The gum lines appeared to be receded. Dental care is essential for prevention of infection, oral
injuries, diseases and promotes the overall health of the animal. The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a
veterinarian, the treatment plan documented, followed and assure that all of the dogs receive adequate veterinary
care as required.

3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Beside the door in whelping house, there was a trash receptacle that was full of discarded material including
feces. This receptacle did not have a tight fitting lid. Trash that is not contained in a leakproof container with a tight
fitting lid attracts pests which increase the risk of disease to the animals. The licensee must place a tight fitting lid on
this trash receptacle and assure that all trash is stored as required.To be corrected by June 20, 2017.
3.3(b)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
***In the whelping facility, there was a strong odor of ammonia. This odor was observed by the inspectors by
sensations of stinging and burning to their eyes and nose during the entire inspection of this building. When asked
about the ventilation of this building, the facility representative stated that the timer on the exhaust fan was broken
and that it had to be turned on manually. High levels of ammonia can cause serious medical conditions in the dogs.
The licensee must ventilate this building appropriately to minimize conditions that can harm the animals and assure
that all buildings are ventilated as required.

3.10 DIRECT
WATERING.
***In the whelping house, there was an enclosure containing one adult Miniature Pinscher and 10 puppies. A gallon
bucket was in this enclosure and used for a water receptacle. This bucket was empty when first observed by the
inspectors. When asked how often water is offered to the animals, the facility representative stated that they are
given water in the mornings and again between 5pm and 7pm each day. When asked when the last time this
enclosure had been offered water, the facility representative stated, "Last night between 5pm and 7pm." At 1330 the
inspectors requested that the dogs in this enclosure be offered water. As soon as the bucket was filled, the adult
dog began drinking and continuously drank for one minute and fifty six seconds. The abdominal area of this dog
increased in size dramatically as the dog drank. Lack of water can cause dehydration, cause other medical issues
or result in death. The licensee must assure that all of the dogs are offer potable water as required.
This was corrected during the inspection and the licensee understands that this is to stay corrected from this day,
June 15, 2017, forward.
3.11(a) DIRECT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***In the outdoor enclosures, there were at least six enclosures containing ten adult dogs and three puppies that
had enough feces that the dogs were having to walk through it to maneuver through the enclosure. The feces was
mashed and dried into the cracks of the pavers that constructed the floor in the Husky enclosure. Also, there was
hair embedded into the dried feces in this enclosure. Mold was observed growing on the feces in the outdoor portion
of the whelping building in an enclosure containing one adult Saint Bernard and six puppies. There was also 2-4
cups of food waste observed on the ground in at least two of these enclosures. When asked how often these
enclosures were cleaned, the facility representative stated every 2-3 days. ***In the whelping house, there was an enclosure containing an adult female Miniature Pinscher and 10 puppies
approximately three weeks old. This enclosure floor was completely covered with feces (including the plastic type
box that some of the puppies were in). The adult nor the puppies could not walk, stand, sit or lay anywhere in this
enclosure that was not covered in feces. A blanket was on the floor of this enclosure, yet it too contained feces. The
puppies were soiled on their feet and on their backs. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease
by attracting and providing a harboring place for pests and creating an unhealthy environment for the animals. The
licensee must assure that all waste material is removed from the primary enclosures daily as required.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***In the whelping building, there was an open trash receptacle beside the door. There were ants crawling from the
trash, up the wall to the window above. Pests carry diseases which increases the risks of contamination to the dogs,
water and food supply. The licensee must rid this area of the ants and assure that measures are taken to reduce
contamination by pests as required.

3.11
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***In the outdoor portion of the sheltered facility, there was an enclosure containing two adult Miniature Pinschers.
On the south side of this enclosure, grass was growing through the fence. Tall weeds and grass create a harboring
place for pests and parasites and increases the risks for contact between pests, parasites and the dogs. The
licensee must clear the grass so that it does not enter the primary enclosure and assure that such items are
controlled as required.
