3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
The fencing of the enclosure used to house one male camel was not constructed and maintained in a manner appropriate
to housing a male camel in rut. The enclosure fence consisted of an eight foot tall livestock wire fence and an 8 foot tall
chain link metal gate at the far end of the enclosure (opposite end from the barn). The materials of both the fencing and
the gate are in good condition however the gate is fastened to both end posts of the fence by two strands of thin rusty
wire wrapped around both the post of the gate and the post of the fence on both sides. Upon inspection the two wires on
the west side of the gate were in place but the two wires on the east side were missing. The owner states that he did not
know where the two missing wire strands were or how they came to be missing. One of the wire strands was found on the
ground inside the zebra enclosure.
On the late afternoon of Thursday March 10, 2022 the Obion County Sheriff’s Office received a call of a loose camel at
the facility. Officers had to put the camel down for the safety of everyone on scene. The officer who arrived on scene in
response to the call observed that the gate was open towards the inside of the enclosure wide enough for a person to
walk through when he arrived.
It is unknown exactly how the gate came to be open on March 10, 2022, but the thin rusty wire was not strong or secure
enough to keep the gate securely closed. The opening of the gate allowed the camel to escape its enclosure. Outdoor


housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals. Correct before using the enclosure to house any regulated animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
