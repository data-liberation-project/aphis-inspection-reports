FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is excessive, thick, and saturated mud in both pot-bellied pig enclosures. The mud is covering the entire
ground except the animals' shelters in both enclosures. The pigs must walk through the mud to access their
shelters, food, and water bowls. Excessive mud can be a potential hazard to the animals.
Assure that measures are implemented to provide adequate drainage in both of these enclosures.

Note: Both pens were shoveled out, removing a substantial amount of mud between the time of inspection and the
exit briefing.
Note: The inspection exit briefing was conducted with the facility owner.
