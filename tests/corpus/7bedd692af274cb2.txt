ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The cotton top tamarin has a very dirty hair coat that is rough and dull in color. The animal does not appear to be
self- grooming. Previously it was noted that the facility needs to consult with a veterinarian that has knowledge and
experience in non-human primates to ensure that their nutritional and husbandry needs are taken care of. The
current attending vet has stated that he has little exotic experience and is not comfortable identifying issues with
non-human primates on routine visits. He is not familiar with their diet needs or vitamin requirements. For the health
of the non-human primates the facility should consult with a veterinarian who has experience with non-human
primates to assure their health care needs are being met.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The CTT that is dirty with a rough dull hair coat does not seem to be self grooming. This is an abnormal behavior
and could indicate stress or a potential health issues. The facility did not observe the condition of the animal as
concerning or out of ordinary and the facility currently does not have an attending vet that is comfortable diagnosing
and treating non human primates. This needs to be address and the animal seen by at vet with knowledge in the
care and treatment of NHP(cid:25)s.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** In the main building housing the non human primates and other various exotics the food storage area is in an
empty enclosure next to a lemur enclosure. The lemur has the ability to reach through the mesh and grab bags of
dry diet. This does not protect the supplies from potential contamination and only the food and bedding currently
being used may be kept in animal areas. So bags of diet stored for future use should be stored in a designated areato protect the supplies.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
*** The birth control for the lemurs currently is done by separating the animals. The currently accepted professional
standard is for compatible non-human primates to be socially housed and to use current veterinary methods as birth
control. Consultation with a veterinarian experienced with non-human primate birth control through hormone
implants or vasectomy is appropriate to be in compliance with this AWA Standard of social housing.
This was identified as a teachable moment in the last inspection and the facility is still housing the lemurs separately
and have yet to identify and contact a vet experienced with non human primates. This needs to be addressed for
the psychological and physical well being of the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The main building housing the non human primates and other exotics needs to be addressed. There are large
areas of clutter, tables with animals, excess supplies, buckets, chairs, spilled food etc. Premises must be kept free
of accumulations of trash, junk, waste, and discarded matter. This area needs to be addressed to facilitate cleaning
and promote good housekeeping practices.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Although there were fly strips up, they were filled and there was a large amount of flies throughout the building
and around the animal(cid:25)s enclosures and food. A more effective method of fly control needs to be maintained for the
health of the animals and to reduce contamination by pests in the area.

FACILITIES, GENERAL. *** In one chinchilla enclosure the wood box is chewed excessively exposing small nails. This is a safety hazard to
the animals and needs to be replaced for their safety.
*** The fabric hammock in the chipmunk enclosure is chewed excessively and needs to be replaced for the safety of
the animals.
*** The white board used as a visual barrier between the fox and goat enclosure is broken and in disrepair. This
board needs to be replaced fort the safety of the animals and to keep the enclosure in good repair.
*** The shelter structure in the goat pen next to the pigs is in disrepair with one wall bowing out creating a gap. This
shelter needs to be maintained in good repair for the safety of the animals.

SANITATION.
*** The sugar glider enclosure is dirty and needs to be cleaned. The enclosure needs to be cleaned more frequently
for the health of the animals and to reduce flies in the area from remaining food items.
*** The coati mundi enclosures were dirty and could not be cleaned because there was no holding area or method
to shift the animals and enter the enclosure safely to clean and maintain the area. These animals can be
aggressive and only certain employees can safely clean. For the safety of employees and to facilitate cleaning of
the animals on a regular basis a method of being able to shift the animals should be in place.
