ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the sheltered facility, there was an adult female English Bulldog identified as Lilly #482CO1OB5A that was
housed with another English Bulldog. Lilly had a large open wound at the base of her right ear. The wound
extended from the top of the head to the bottom of the ear close to the jaw. The depth was full skin thickness,
exposing the tissue below the skin. When this animal's head was turned slightly to the left, the wound width was
approximately 1" at the bottom and 2" at the top. The edges of the skin were jagged and dried with some darkened
areas as scabbing was beginning to form. The skin on the neck area was reddened and had hair loss near the
edges of the injury. The facility representative stated that this injury had not been noticed prior to this time. The dog
was removed from the enclosure and taken to the attending veterinarian during the inspection. Injuries left
unattended can lead to infection and unnecessary discomfort, pain or suffering of the animal.
***In the whelping building, there were small areas of loose stool in the washdown area underneath the enclosure of
a female seal/white Boston Terrier with four puppies. The puppies were identified as #1502 F, #1503 M, #1504 M,
#1505 M. Two of these puppies (the female and one of the males) were seen defecating this loose stool during the
inspection. The facility representative stated that the puppies had been dewormed recently and had received
vaccination shots. Loose stool can lead to diarrhea, dehydration and can be an indication of a serious medical
condition.
***In the whelping building, there was an adult female brindle French Bulldog, identified as # 482E061918 that
presented with a vomiting episode during the inspection. The vomit consisted of some liquid and undigested dog
food. This adult female had given birth to four puppies approximately two weeks ago. The facility representative
stated that this dog had not had any problems. Vomiting can lead to dehydration and be an indication of a serious
medical condition.
The licensee did correct the injured dog during the inspection. The licensee must consult with a licensed
veterinarian concerning the Boston Terrier puppies and the adult female French Bulldog and assure that adequate
veterinary care is provided to all of the animals as required. The licensee understands that consultaion is to be

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements. (2) Primary enclosures (i) Have no sharp points
***In the adult sheltered facility, there were two primary enclosures containing four adult dogs. In the indoor portion
of these two enclosures, the edges of the doorways to the outdoor portion were covered with a hard, thick plastic
material. At the top of the doorway these plastic strips were jagged and created sharp edges. Sharp edges create a
potential injury for the animals within the enclosure. The licensee must remove the sharp edges and assure that
there are no sharp points or edges in the primary enclosures as required.
To be corrected by January 16, 2015.
This inspection began at 1027.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.
