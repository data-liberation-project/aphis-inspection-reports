3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* In the main kennel, the wood framing for two dog doorways had gaps between the framing and the walls. One of
the wood frames was excessively chewed and scratch. One wood post, in one of the enclosures, was excessively
scratched and chewed. These wood surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Thus, the disease potential
can be increase for three adult dogs. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. This is so the surfaces
can be readily cleaned and sanitized. With proper cleaning and sanitization of the surfaces the disease potential for
the animals will be decreased.
To be corrected by 25-August-2015.
