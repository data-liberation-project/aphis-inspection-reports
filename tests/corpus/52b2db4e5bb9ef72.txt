2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
An unlicensed person is exhibiting white tail deer to the public in Chapman Park located in Stanely, WI. The
regulated activity was first observed in May 2014. The unlicensed person was informed of the requirement to obtain
a USDA license and an application packet was mailed at that time. However the unlicensed person has yet to
obtain a USDA license. Exhibiting white tail deer is a regulated activity that requires a valid USDA license. No
regulated activity can occur until a valid USDA license has been obtained.
