FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fencing in the deer enclosure is bent into the enclosure at multiple areas along the base. Also in some places,
the fencing is turned in and is on the ground. There is one area at the base of the pig enclosure where the fencing is
pulled into the enclosure along the base. These areas provide a potential for hooves to become entrapped which
can cause injury to the animals.
***
There is an area of fencing in the gate of the deer enclosure where the wire has been broken with some of the
resulting metal points turned into the enclosure. Metal points from fence wire can cause injury to the animals.
***
There is a metal base support bar in the beaver enclosure that has rusted to the point that flaking of the surface is
visible. Flaking, rusted metal can become structurally unsound.
***
The licensee must maintain indoor and outdoor housing facilities so that they are structurally sound and maintained
in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by 4 Jan. 2015.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is standing water and mud in the alley-ways from the sheltered portion to the outdoor portion of the enclosure
housing one pig. Standing water and mud may lead to an increase in disease transmission and pests and cause
odors. A method shall be developed to rapidly eliminate standing water. Correct by 18 Dec. 2014.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The floor covering of the indoor portion of the enclosure housing one goat is coming loose between the wash-down
drain and the wall. This is resulting in gaps between the concrete floor and this floor material which can not be
adequately cleaned and sanitized. Premises must be kept in good repair to facilitate the prescribed husbandrypractices of this subpart. Correct by 4 Jan. 2015.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
One live mouse was observed inside the flying squirrel enclosure and mouse droppings were observed in the
building housing the black-footed ferret. Rodents can play a role in disease transmission. A better method of pest
control shall be established and maintained throughout the facility. Correct by 10 Dec. 2014.
The incident involving the three cotton-top tamarins is under review.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
