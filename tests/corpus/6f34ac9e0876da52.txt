ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white hamster's lower incisors are growing back into its face. The extremely long incisors are contacting and
penetrating the skin below the left side of its nose. The nose and surrounding skin is reddened. There is discharge
present on the area where the incisors are contacting and penetrating the skin. Facility staff observed the hamster’s
condition, but didn't notify the veterinarian. Veterinary care issues left untreated can cause pain and discomfort.
Additionally, five hamsters sharing an enclosure had varying degrees of fur loss. The three white hamsters and two
brown hamsters had fur loss ranging from mild to severe. The small brown hamster had the most severe fur loss.
This hamster was partially or completely missing fur on the majority of its body. The other hamsters had patches of
partial and complete fur loss. Facility staff observed the hamsters' conditions, but didn't notify the veterinarian. Fur
loss can be the result of underlying veterinary care issues.
Notify the veterinarian of the hamsters' conditions. Follow through with all prescribed treatments and/or instructions.
To be corrected: All of the affected hamsters were taken to the veterinarian between the time of inspection and the
exit briefing.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the secretary.
