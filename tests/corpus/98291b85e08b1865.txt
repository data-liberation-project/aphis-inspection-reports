2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a bottle of injectable ivermectin in the food preparation room that is being used for the deworming of many
of the carnivores at the facility. The facility is maintaining documentation that the medication is being used regularly
but there are no instructions from the attending veterinarian for the use of this medication in these species either on
the bottle itself or on the written program of veterinary care. Lack of instructions for the use of medications can
result in incorrect use and unintended side effects. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility
are labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices including instructions for use in each species.
The facility's written Program of Veterinary Care does not contain treatment recommendations for all species
present in the facility. Lack of written instructions may result in improper treatment for the species. The licensee
must ensure that the program of veterinary care outlines the veterinary care to be given to all species in the facility.

3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The water receptacle being used for the wolf/dog hybrids is chewed along its upper edge resulting in a rough,
jagged surface. Surfaces that are rough and jagged cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces must
be constructed and maintained in a manner that allows them to be adequately cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 5
November 2014.
3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*There are several areas of rusted metal along the base of the back and right indoor walls (as viewed from in the
barn viewing area) in the ringtailed lemur enclosure.
*There is one area of rust along the base of the indoor wall near the back right corner (as viewed from in the barn
viewing area) of the enclosure housing capuchins.
*There is one area of rust in a support pipe at the base of the outdoor capuchin enclosure. The rust has resulted in
a defect with a rough edge on the underside of the pipe. *The base of the indoor potion of the metal enclosure housing a marmoset has a roughened, dirty surface and is
showing rust in areas.
Rusted surfaces in contact with nonhuman primate that cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. This can
contribute to disease transmission. Rust can also compromise the structural strength of the enclosure making it
unstable. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates be free of excessive rust
that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface. To be
corrected by 29 December 2014.
3.75(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a nail and a screw that are partially sticking out of the outdoor wall of the marmoset enclosure. Points
might cause injury to the animal housed in this enclosure. All surfaces must be maintained in a manner that
ensures surfaces are free of jagged edges or sharp points. Correct by 5 November 2014.
3.81(c)(4)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There is an individually housed marmoset in the barn area with no opportunity to see or hear other compatible
nonhuman primate species. The facility'(cid:25)s environment enhancement plan for nonhuman primates does not address
the special considerations for this individually housed marmoset. Individually housed nonhuman primates are at risk
for behavioral problems if their social needs are not addressed. The licensee must have a written environment
enhancement plan that outlines the special attention to be given to any individually housed nonhuman primate that
is not able to see or hear nonhuman primates of their own or compatible species. These special considerations
must be based on the needs of the individual species and be in accordance to the instructions of the attending
veterinarian. Correct by 12 November 2014.
3.84(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
All of the perches in the marmoset indoor housing portion are covered with a brown material. Accumulations of
excreta and dirt may increase disease transmission. Surfaces for nonhuman primates must be spot-cleaned on a
daily basis. Correct by 30 October 2014.
3.125(a)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal slider door for the bobcat enclosure is rusted along its lower edge. Also there is a metal hay feeder in the
llama building that is rusted in the receptacle portion. These rusted surfaces have resulted in jagged edges.
Jagged edges can cause injury to the animals.
Wire mesh fences being used to line the enclosure fences in both the inside portion of the pig enclosure and the
outside goat enclosure have wire points protruding into the enclosures. These wire points can cause injury to the
animals.
All surfaces must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 29 Nov. 2014.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There is evidence of birds roosting in the llama/cattle shelter building and in the bear shelter building. Bird
droppings were observed on the water receptacles and on the stored bedding. Also there were bird nests in the
bear shelter building. Birds can transmit diseases and can contaminate water and bedding. A program must be
developed and followed to control pests. Correct by 4 November 2014.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
