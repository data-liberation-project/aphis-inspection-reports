ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility has a program of veterinary in care in place for their animals as documented by veterinary visits for each
animal this year, however the documented Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) could not be located by the facility
during inspection. A documented PVC must be available for APHIS inspectors during inspection to help verify that
a formal agreement exists between the facility and attending veterinarian to provide necessary care to the animals
on hand. Ensure that the documented PVC is on hand for inspection.
