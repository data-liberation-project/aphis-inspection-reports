Once again, there are maintenance issues due to rust in large cat enclosures. This was an issue in another area of
the facility on 10/18/17.
This date there is an area at the right front corner of the first large cat enclosure ( housing 2 tigers/1lion ) where the
roof is not secured properly to the side wall . This is an area where an animal could be injured or possibly escape
and must be repaired .
The feed chute on the back wall of this enclosure is coated with rust and there are numerous areas of pitting rust in
the sheet metal covering the back wall of this enclosure.
The wood on the resting platform in the white tiger enclosure housing is deteriorating and there is an exposed nail.
The exposed nail may cause injury to the animals. The platform must be maintained in good condition to provide a
safe resting area.
All enclosures must be maintained on a regular schedule to prevent deterioration of metal /wooden structures to
protect the animals from injury and to contain them .
