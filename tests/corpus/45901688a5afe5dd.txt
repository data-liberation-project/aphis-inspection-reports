2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***The semi-annual facility inspection and review of the animal care and use program report for May 2014 was not
prepared and delivered to the Institutional Official of the research facility. It was stated in the meeting minutes that
the report would be attached but it was not completed.
The report must distinguish significant deficiencies from minor deficiencies. A significant deficiency is one which, in
reference to Subchapter A, and, in the judgement of the IACUC and the Institutional Official, is or may be a threat to
the health or safety of the animals. If the program or facility deficiences are noted, the reports must contain a
reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency. Any failure to adhere to the
plan and schedule that results in a significant deficiency remaining uncorrected shall be reported in writing within 15
business days by the IACUC, through the Institutional Official, to APHIS and any Federal agency funding at activity.
It is the responsibility of the facility to prepare evaluative reports on the findings and present these reports to the
Institutional Official. Correct from this day forward.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the exercise/play yards for the dogs in Kennel #1 there are several large holes, some of which are on the
perimeter of the fence line. These holes pose a potential for small animals to get in the enclosure and possibly
transmit disease or cause harm to the animals. They also could allow the dogs to escape the yard. These yards
must be kept in good repair and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict
other animals from entering. This was corrected before the exit briefing.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
