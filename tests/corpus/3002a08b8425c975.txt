ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:34 PM on
15-NOV-17.
When I arrived at the facility at 2:34 pm, there was no call button or another means to contact anyone at the facility.
I called the facility representative at 2:36 pm, 2:55 pm, and 3:16 pm and left a message with a call-back number
regarding the attempted inspection. I left the area at 3:20 pm.
