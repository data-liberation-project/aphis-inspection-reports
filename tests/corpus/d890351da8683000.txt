ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30-2:15 PM
on 18-Oct-16.
Arrived at the premises, knocked on the door and left a message on the owner's phone. The owner returned my call
and confirmed that no one was available for an inspection due to being out of town.
