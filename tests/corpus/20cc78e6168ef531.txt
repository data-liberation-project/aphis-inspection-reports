Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property:
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:14pm on

There was no response at the facility to the ringing of the doorbell and I was unable to leave a voicemail message at
the contact number as the mailbox was full.
