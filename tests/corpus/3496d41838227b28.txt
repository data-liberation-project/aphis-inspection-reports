FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two deceased rabbits were observed at approximately 1745 on top of a cage within the pen that housed the
rabbits. The licensee informed me that they were found and placed on top of the cage in the morning. Failure to
remove deceased animals from their enclosures can attract pests and can also facilitate the spread of disease to
other animals within that enclosure or animals around that enclosure. All deceased animals must be removed
promptly from their enclosures on a daily basis. Correct immediately.
3.56(b)(1)
SANITATION.
During inspection the licensee informed me that she last sanitized the rabbit enclosures about two months ago.
She said she does it every month when its warm out, but does it less frequently when it gets cold. Not sanitizing the
primary enclosure for the rabbits every thirty days doesn't ensure that the various types of germs (such as viruses,
bacteria, parasites, etc.) have been killed and that the enclosure is safe to use for new incoming rabbits. All primary
rabbit enclosures must be disinfected once every thirty days to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste,
excreta, and other disease hazards. Correct by 1/12/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
