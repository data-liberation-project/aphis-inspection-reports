Facilities, general
***The following areas were found in need of repair or replacement:
1. The resting perch for a lion named Katie requires repair or replacement. Several resting boards are loose from
the structural supports.
2. The hotwires for 3 enclosures (one housing 2 black bears Bart and Heather, a second housing the liger Sophie
and a third housing the lion Garfield) were not functional at the time of this inspection. Power cords to these units
must be left connected and plugged in to ensure these enclosures properly contain the animals in them.
3. 6 primary enclosures were found with structural support poles leaning either inward or outwards. The enclosures
affected were the following:
i. The wooden posts for the enclosure housing the bison named Elroy are leaning outward.
ii. The metal fence poles for the enclosure housing lions named Nichole and Paris are leaning inward.
iii. The metal fence poles for the enclosure housing a tiger named Lady are leaning outward.
iv. The metal fence poles for the enclosure housing a lion named Linus are leaning outward.
v. The metal fence poles for the enclosure housing a tiger named Sammy Jo are leaning outward.
vi. The metal fence poles for the enclosure housing a lion named Simba are leaning outward.
These areas are in need of repair or replacement. They are all areas of potential injury or escape. The facility
must ensure that all animal enclosures are maintained to adequately contain the animals and protect them from
injury.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED
3.127(d) REPEATFACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The perimeter fence is currently inadequate and does not function as a secondary containment system. Although
an 8 ft. high perimeter fence is present surrounding the facility, several areas behind big cat and bear enclosures
have excessive overgrowth of weeds and small trees/vines making it difficult to inspect these areas for structural
soundness. A perimeter fence that is maintained in good repair and not less than 8 feet in height is required for all
outdoor housing facilities that maintain dangerous animals. Perimeter fencing protects the animals in the facility by
ensuring in the event of an escape there is a secondary containment mechanism to prevent the animal from leaving
the property and endangering the public. The facility has removed the building materials found leaning against or
near the perimeter fence on the last inspection but still needs to remove large trees and remaining brush from the
fence area.
Note: The facility still has until November 1, 2015 to correct removal or altering of trees which was original
correction date on previous inspection.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED
