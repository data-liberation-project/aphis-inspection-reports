ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- The last recorded site visit by the attending veterinarian was on 5/10/11. Good communication and consultation
between the licensee and the attending veterinarian in the form of a written program of veterinary care and regularly
scheduled visits to the premise are necessary for the health of the animals. The licensee must schedule a site visit
with the attending veterinarian.To be corrected by 20 May 2014

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- In the walk-through portion of the park there was a Jacob sheep in thin body condition, with rough hair coat, and
excessively long horns. The upper right horn had grown to a length that it was in the sheep's mouth. There were
chew marks on this horn. The horn on the upper left had grown to a length that prevented the sheep from grazing
unless the grass was approximately 3 inches tall. The excess length of the horns impact the ability of the sheep to
eat normally, and harm the health of the animal. The applicant must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to
obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented
and provided to the inspector upon request. The applicant must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary
care at all times.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
- No paperwork ( record of disposition or animal inventory) was available during the inspection. Complete and
accurate records are necessary to ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the
ability to trace those animals. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all animals at all times
and must ensure those records are available to the inspector upon request. To be corrected from this date forward.
2.131(c)(1) REPEATHANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The lemurs public barrier gate was unlocked and allowed the public access beyong the gate and into the primate
area. The facility representative stated that the public had access to the area without constant park employee
supervision. He stated that empolyees came and went from the area during the day as they preformed their duties.
- The Jacob sheep in the walk-through portion of the park had no public barrier and no park employees were
present. The gate to their enclosure did not have a lock and could have been easily opened by the public. The
facility representative stated that the public had access to the area without constant park employee supervision. He
stated that empolyees came and went from the area during the day as they preformed their duties.
- A camel being kept in an outdoor enclosure in the walk-through zoo had a public barrier less than three feet and
could access the public. The facility representative stated that the public had access to the area without constant
park employee supervision. He stated that empolyees came and went from the area during the day as they
preformed their duties. This animal is in a location which would allow it to easily have contact with members of the
public.
- Numerous open and unlocked gates were noted in the walk through facility at the time of the inspection. The
facility representative stated that the two public schools that had been there that day had left. Asked if public could
still enter the park and he responded yes. Animals on exhibit must either have public barriers, and/or clearly
identified park personnel in the vicinity to ensure safety of visitors and exhibit animals.
3.81 DIRECT REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
- The facility is exhibiting three lemurs. The licensee was unable to provide inspectors with a documented plan for
environmental enhancement. All facilities with primates are required to have a documented and appropriate plan to
ensure adequate environmental enhancement for the animals, and to ensure that specific psychological needs of
the primates are being identified and addressed.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The food storage shed for the walk through park contained torn bags of food, with a portion of the contents spilled
onto the floor. The shed also had a considerable amount of spilled feed beneath the pallets and along the walls.
Spilled feed is an attractant for rodents and pests, which could potentially lead to contamination of stored feed andbedding in the area. The area immediately around the food storage shed was also overgrown with weeds, and
contained several items of unused material. This is potential harborage for pests and rodents. The area around the
storage shed should be cleared to help prevent rodent/pest infestation.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- Two cavvys being kept in an outdoor enclosure in the walk-through area of the park did not have adequate shelter.
The existing shelter is an igloo style dog house in the enclosure. This igloo dog house does not allow sufficient
room for both animals to provide adequate protection from wind, rain, and any other environmental effects. This is a
potential impact to the health and welfare of the enclosed animals. All animals in outdoor enclosures must have
adequate natural or artificial shelter to provide protection from the weather.
