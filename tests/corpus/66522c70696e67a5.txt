2.40(a)(1) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of the inspection, the licensee still had not employed an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements
and there was not an up to date program of written veterinary care. There were animals that are in need of veterinary care
at the time of inspection. The licensee must have an attending veterinarian who is willing to provide veterinary care to all
species maintained at the facility. This care should be documented on a written program of care and that describes
regularly scheduled visits to the facility.
2.40(b)(3) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
**The brown alpaca’s left eye still had thick discharge in the inner corner and accumulated along the lower lid. This animal
still has not seen a vet nor was his condition communicated to a veterinarian for further guidance, diagnosis, and possible
treatment.

A goat was limping and stiff on it's hind limbs. This condition had not been communicated to a veterinarian for guidance,
diagnosis, and possible treatment.



The licensee must ensure that the daily observation of all animals, and that a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication is in place so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health is conveyed to the
attending veterinarian.

Facilities, indoor.
There was a strong smell of ammonia throughout the main building that made the USDA inspectors' eyes water and nose
burn. The results of an ammonia indicator strip held in the room for several seconds were greater than 20ppm which is a
level that may be harmful to animals exposed over time. The guinea pigs are housed in this building all year with other
animal species also affected. There was an accumulation of feces in the building as well as large amounts of cobwebs,
dust, and debris which can trap and hold ammonia odor. The fan that was running did not effectively minimize the
ammonia odor throughout the building. Ammonia odor indicates that high levels of ammonia in the air, which is
detrimental to animal health. Indoor housing facilities must be adequately ventilated to reduce these odors to maintain the
health and comfort of the animals.
3.128 Repeat

Space requirements.
The facility has degus housed in an enclosure that still do not provide the animals enough space to make social
adjustments. Inadequate space can result in injuries and fighting which can cause pain and distress in the animals. The
facility must have enclosures that are constructed and maintained to provide sufficient space to prevent overcrowding.
3.130 Direct

Watering.
USDA officials observed an alpaca drinking out of a tub of dirty water. The water contained feces and was cloudy. The
clean water available for the alpaca and goats was frozen. There were multiple bottles of water in the main building with


discoloration. Dirty water can contain pathogens or be non-palatable and affect the health and well being of the animals.
All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

Correct this by 3/15/22
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
A considerable amount of spider webs, dust and debris could be seen hanging from the ceiling, covering the top of
enclosures, and covering the skylights. The excessive dust along items hanging from the walls and ceiling attracts and
holds dirt and bedding material and contributes to the odor of ammonia in the room. Unsanitary conditions in the areas
surrounding primary enclosures housing animals can also lead to unpleasant odors, attract pests, and negatively impact
animal welfare. Premises where housing facilities are located must be kept clean and free of clutter to facilitate good
husbandry practices and to protect the animals from disease as well as injury. The facility still needs to develop and follow
a plan to store excess items in another area to be able to facilitate cleaning in the buildings for the health of the animals.
3.131(d) Repeat

Sanitation.
There was still an accumulation of flies throughout the main indoor building area. The flies were around food bowls and
around animals in their enclosures. The facility is not using sufficient measures to mitigate flies inside the buildings. Flies
are known to be carriers of disease and can both cause and spread illness between animals and species. A safe and
effective program for controlling pests must be implemented and maintained
3.132 Repeat

Employees.


At the time of the inspection, one representatives was present at the facility to water, feed and clean all the animals.
According to facility representatives, one employee was supposed to be working at the facility but did not show up to
assist in feeding and daily observations. As evidenced by the non-compliant items listed in this report, the facility does
not have enough employees to maintain an acceptable level of husbandry and care for the animals at the facility. Lack of
employees is leading to adverse welfare impacts for these animals. The facility must ensure that staffing is adequate to
provide care for the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
