2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In review of records the USDA inspectors found that on 7-Nov-2019 the dog identified as #17 (Cassie) whelped 3
puppies and was nursing them normally, but on 10-Nov-2019 was observed by licensee to be lethargic, and
subsequently died on 11-Nov-2019. There were no instructions on the PVC in regards to post partum care and no
treatment was given to the animal upon observation of lethargy. The attending veterinarian was not consulted
before or after the dog's death.
On 2-Jun-2019 the dog identified as #21 (Brenda) was observed by licensee during his evening husbandry to be in
labor but making no progress delivering her pups. She subsequently died later that evening without delivering her
litter. The attending veterinarian was not consulted before or after the dog's death and the licensee stated he was
unaware that the attending veterinarian provided emergency and after-hours care and therefore he did not attempt
to call the attending veterinarian. The after-hours emergency telephone number for the attending veterinarian is
listed in the PVC.
In addition to daily observation, timely communication with the attending veterinarian is necessary to ensure the
health and well-being of the animals.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
During the inspection it was observed that the records were not being maintained to include dogs that had been
deceased or left the facility, and 3 female puppies that were 6 months old and kept as breeding stock were not on
the current records on hand.

3.6(c)(2) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During records review USDA inspectors noted that dog #8 (Freddie), a male Maltese, was housed in the same
primary enclosure with another intact male and four (4) intact female dogs. Freddie died on 26-Jul-2019 as a result
of a fight with one of the other dogs over one of the females that was coming into her heat cycle.
All dogs housed in a primary enclosure shall be compatible by observation, however, females in heat may not be
housed in the same primary enclosure as intact males except for breeding.

FEEDING.
During the inspection dog #10 (Lady), a female Shih Tzu that had just weaned 6 puppies, was observed to be thin
with ribs easily palpated and visible, tops of lumbar vertebrae visible, prominent pelvic bones, and a concave
abdominal posture. The licensee stated that the dog was being fed adult dog food with no supplementation. The
lactation cycle is a time of high metabolic demand. It is important to provide food that is of sufficient quantity and
nutritive value to maintain the normal body condition and weight of the animal.
A 5 week old puppy from dam #17 (Cassie), who is being fostered by another female, was noticeably small,
withdrawn, visibly shaking, and when handled was found to be cold to the touch, thin with ribs easily palpated and
visible, tops of lumbar vertebrae visible, prominent pelvic bones, and a concave abdominal posture. The other 2
puppies in the litter appeared to be robust, in good body condition, and appropriate size and weight for their age.
Based on the size and body condition of the litter mates it is evident that this puppy is not obtaining an appropriate
level of nutrition from the surrogate to allow it to grow and thrive. Supplementation is necessary for the puppy's
health and well being.
