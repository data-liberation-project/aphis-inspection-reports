3.75(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the primary enclosures for the animals the floors and toilets have missing and chipped paint in some areas. Paint
is worn off of walls and window frames. The fencing between the small and large yards has sections with chipped,
peeling, missing paint and rust, such as on the gate. Also the ceiling above the enclosure in the small yard has
peeling paint, and the wood appears to be deteriorating, and this could allow particles to fall into the enclosure.
All surfaces must be maintained and/or replaced on a regular basis. Failure to maintain and/or replace surfaces and
items in the enclosure can impede cleaning, create hazards, and otherwise put the health and well-being of the
animals at risk.

This was a focused inspection on:
- Non-compliant issues form the last inspection - specifically maintenance of surfaces;
- Veterinary care and medical records.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
