Feeding.
At the time of inspection, there was an open bag of cat food (dry kibble) being refrigerated that had a “best by” date of
October 2021. This kibble was being fed to the serval, as some of the kibble was in a food mixture in a plastic container in
the same refrigerator and confirmed by a staff member. Food that is past its “best by” date starts to decrease in quality,
wholesomeness, and nutritive value, which can negatively impact the health and well-being of the animal. The food shall
be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals
in good health.
