Facilities, outdoor.
* Two outdoor enclosures housing one Camel and one Zebra separately have no shade available for these animals to
have access to. The external temperature recorded by the inspector's kestrel was 94.3 degrees. Lack of shade can lead
to overheating issues that create unnecessary stress and discomfort which can negatively impact the health and well-
being of these animals. Shade provides comfort for the animal during periods of direct sunlight. The licensee must
ensure that shade is provided and be large enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect them from the direct
rays of the sun. Correct by 6/1/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
