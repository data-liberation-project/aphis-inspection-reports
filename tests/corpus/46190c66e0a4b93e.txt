INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
During the November 2016 facility inspection, a minor deficiency was noted by the IACUC and included in the
meeting minutes. The deficiency was not included in the Institutional Official (IO) report generated from that
inspection. A corrective plan with dates was not reported to the IO. The deficiency involved securing the oxygen
canisters. At inspection today, it was noted some oxygen canisters appeared unsecured. Reporting deficiencies
facilitates accountability and helps assure corrections will be made. Animal welfare may be impacted when
deficiencies go uncorrected. If program or facility deficiencies are noted, the IO reports must contain a reasonable
and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency.
