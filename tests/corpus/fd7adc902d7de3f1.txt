3.80(a)(2)(iii) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On October 1, 2016 animal T126123R escaped from its primary enclosure through a grooming panel because of a
failed lock or the ability of the animal to manipulate the locking mechanism. The animal sustained an injury during
the escape that resulted in euthanasia. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they
contain the non human primates securely and safely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including
opening by the animal.
The incident was reported to the IACUC prior to this inspection. Appropriate corrective action has been taken to
prevent similar future escapes. Locks were removed from grooming panels, cable ties installed and staff has been
re-trained on cage locking mechanisms and evaluating cage locking.
3.81(c)(2)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The written facility environmental enhancement plan states that animals identified with evidence of psychological
distress will have an appropriate plan developed to address the needs of the animal. The plan and any progress will
be documented in the animal's medical record.
The medical record of animal 150849 documents signs of of psychological distress through behavior and
appearance but does not adequately document a plan to address the enhanced needs of the animal or progress
after periodic observations and intervention/treatment. The record indicates the animal exhibited stereotypical
behavior in 2016 and recurring, intermittent soft stools attributed to stress since 2015. During this inspection
alopecia was noted over at least 20 % of the body that was not documented. The animal was permanently
exempted from any food enrichment because of a dietary sensitivity differential diagnosis.
The animal record does not provide information that sufficient special attention was provided to this animal
regarding enhancement of the environment after the animal was identified as requiring additional considerations by
facility personnel. The facility should review the environmental enhancement plan and ensure it contains adequate
provisions for special considerations necessary for those animals exhibiting signs of psychological distress and thatdocumentation is complete enough to demonstrate compliance with the facility plan and the requirements under the
Animal Welfare Act.
