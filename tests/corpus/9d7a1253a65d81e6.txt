HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Both inside housing facilities for nonhuman primates have painted walls and floors. The walls and floors have large
areas of pealing paint.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury.
Peeling paint must be removed to prevent ingestion of paint by the primates. The walls and floors must be repaired
for the safety of the animals contained.
