PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At the cargo facility serving Turkish Airlines, two juvenile dogs were inspected after arrival from Kyiv, Ukraine via
Istanbul, Turkey on waybill number 235-38699150 .
1. Fawn male juvenile dog: the floor of this animal's enclosure is covered with a single piece of absorbent paper
pad material. A small amount of shredded, loose material is evident at the back of the enclosure. The paper pad is
soiled with both liquid and solid excreta. A strong odor of animal waste is present in and around the enclosure.
There is not enough absorbent litter material to absorb and cover the excreta, and as a result the animal is in direct
contact with the excreta.
2. Black and brown brindle female juvenile dog: the solid plastic floor of this animal's enclosure is mostly exposed,
with no absorbent material or litter present on much of the surface area. There is an accumulation of some loose,
shredded material and excreta that was not absorbed or covered by litter around the edges of the enclosure. A
paper pad, visibly soiled with liquid and solid waste that is not covered or absorbed by litter material, is bunched at
the front of the enclosure. Without enough litter material in the enclosure, this animal's chest and forelimbs are in
direct contact with the excreta on this paper pad.
Carriers must ensure that primary enclosures with solid floors contain enough previously unused litter material to
absorb and cover excreta. The litter material must be of a suitably absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic.
This inspection was conducted at the cargo facility serving Turkish Airlines with a cargo handler present. No airline
representatives were available at this location.
