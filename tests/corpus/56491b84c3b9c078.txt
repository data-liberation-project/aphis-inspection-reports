3.11(b)(2) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Three enclosures housing four dogs have a buildup of dirt and organic material on the metal doors leading outside. There
is also an accumulation of similar material along the bottom surfaces of the door frames and between the frames and the
floor. Two enclosures, housing four dogs, have a brownish/back material on the walls and dirt accumulated in the sills of
the windows. The fences on the outdoor portions of six enclosures, housing approximately eight dogs, have an
accumulation of hair and organic debris along and under the fence. The indoor portions of these enclosures have a
buildup of dust and cobwebs on the metal fencing and supporting framing.

Areas where dirt, debris, hair and other waste accumulate provide an environment where bacteria, insects and other
pests can establish themselves and could pose a risk to the health and wellbeing of the dogs.

Enclosures, including food and water receptacles, must be sanitized at least every two weeks, and more often if
necessary, to prevent the accumulation dirt, hair, debris, and excreta, and other disease hazards. The enclosures must be
sanitized and a plan for routine sanitization every two weeks or as necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt and
debris must be followed.
