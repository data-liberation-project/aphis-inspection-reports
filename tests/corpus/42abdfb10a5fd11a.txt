3.26(b)

Facilities, indoor.
There was a strong ammonia odor throughout the indoor guinea pig housing areas. There were 3 roof vents partially open
but it did not provide enough ventilation to alleviate the ammonia odor.
Failure to provide adequate fresh air can cause respiratory distress and expose the guinea pigs to potential disease
hazards.
The indoor housing facilities must be adequately ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.
