ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The potbelly pig has excessively overgrown hooves (also called claws) on all 4 feet. The claws of the two front feet
are especially long, with the left claw being worse than the right There is an extra two-four inches of growth on these
claws causing the pig to abnormally bear extra weight on the heel when walking or standing. Bearing weight
abnormally can cause pain, joint injury, and an abnormal gait and diminished activity. Although the hooves were
trimmed in April, they have grown excessively long in the past two months. The current trimming schedule is
inadequate to keep up with the rate of growth. The hooves need to be trimmed more frequently to correct the shape
of the hoof and to allow the animal to bare weight on the hooves normally.
Because overgrown hooves can cause unnecessary pain to the animal’s feet and prevent the animal from engaging
in normal activity level, the hooves must be examined by the attending veterinarian and a plan established to have
the hooves trimmed at a frequency that will return the hooves to a normal conformation.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The records of animals on hand are incomplete. Six (6) artic fox kits were born late May or early June 2017, but
there is no record of their date of birth. Records must be maintained for all animals purchased, or otherwise
acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control. The records shall
include any offspring born to the animals in his or her possession. Accurate documentation of the animal inventory
ensures that all animals are accounted for and receive proper care.
***The disposition records are also still incomplete. The disposition records for two brown nosed coatimundi and
one Patagonian cavy are still missing from the animal records first noted on the inspection of 31-January 2017.
Records of sales, donations, transfers, euthanasia, and deaths must be kept. Records of dispositions must be
maintained to ensure animals receive proper care and to facilitate the regulatory requirements of the Animal Welfare
Act.2.126(a)(2) CRITICAL REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***The licensee still refuses to disclose the disposition of one Patagonian cavy and 2 brown nosed coatimundi which
were removed from the property prior to 06-March-2017. Licensees are required to provide access to all records
required to be kept by the Animal Welfare Act and the regulations. Licensees are required to provide information
regarding the disposition of animals to an APHIS official. Failure to provide the information to an APHIS official is in
violation of the regulations of the Animal Welfare Act. The disposition information of animals is necessary for APHIS
officials to track/trace animals for health issues. The disposition of the animals must be disclosed to an APHIS
official upon request at the time of an inspection.

FEEDING.
***The guinea pigs were provided with fruit treats (apples grapes, and oranges). Much of the fruit has gone uneaten
and is dispersed throughout the cages within and on top of the bedding. The fruit has become dried and discolored,
soiling the bedding in the cages. Fruit supplements that are left to accumulate in a cage can lead to damp bedding
which is a disease hazard and attractants for flies and ants. Uneaten fruit treats should be removed from cages to
prevent the soiling of the bedding and to ensure the animals are not exposed to vermin, pests, and disease. Correct
by June 16, 2017 and after all subsequent treat feedings.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The boards used to partially block the 1 inch by 1 inch floor openings in the rabbit cages appear to be treated
wood and particle board. The particle board still has rough irregular edges that appear chewed which was first
identified on the inspection of 12-October-2016 and has continued to be a problem through this inspection. The
rough edges on these boards could pose an ingestion or injury hazard to the animals. Outdoor housing facilities for
rabbits must be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, and protect the rabbits from injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures housing four rabbits still has an accumulation of fecal matter and a dark yellow material under the
raised cages which was first noted on the 12-October-2016 inspection and has continued through this inspection.
*** Both rabbit enclosures: A dark yellow material mixed with hair has built-up underneath and along the back legs
of the cage. The material appears to have a hard pasty texture. There are also what appeared to be dusty cobwebs
along the back wall surface under the cage.
***An excessive amount of rabbit feces has accumulated under the rabbit cages. Some of the pellets have alreadyturned grey or white, indicating old feces that has not been removed.
Accumulations of waste materials can lead to strong odors, attract pests, and may pose a disease hazard for the
animals. Fecal material, urine, and other debris must not be allowed to accumulate. Such practice can have harmful
effects on the health of the animals. Wastes under cages must be disposed of at a frequency that prevents
accumulation for the health and well-being of the animals and to maintain an effective pest control program.
3.53(a)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The floor of one of the rabbit enclosure has 1 inch by 1 inch openings. The feet of the chocolate satin rabbits
housed in this cage can pass through the openings easily. Particle boards have been placed in the enclosure,
however these boards do not cover the entire cage floor and may cause additional problems because of rough and
chewed edges. This was previously identified on the inspection report of 12-October-2016 and continues through
this current inspection. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that protects the feet and legs from
injury. The floor of the rabbit enclosure must be modified to safely prevent the feet of the rabbit from passing
through.
3.54 REPEAT
FEEDING.
***The wood floor boards within each of the rabbit cages have a build-up of a dry greyish brown material. The dry
greyish brown material present on the surface of the wood floor boards appears to be old feces and debris.
Receptacles with fresh food are placed on top of the wood floor boards within each of the rabbit cages. The cage
housing the brown satin rabbit and the black and white spotted lop-eared rabbit also has fresh red grapes on the
vine placed on top of the boards. The presence of food and food receptacles on these contaminated boards may
provide a vehicle for the contamination of the food within the receptacles and/or directly on the boards. Placing the
grapes directly on the soiled floor boards contaminates the foodstuff and compromise the palatability of the food.
Additionally, fresh food in receptacles placed in an excessively soiled cage can potentially lead to contamination of
the food. Animals must be provided with food that is free of contamination and palatable. Food must be provided to
the rabbits in a manner that will prevent contamination and maintain the palatability of the food.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
***Grey rabbit enclosure: The rabbit enclosure housing has wood floor boards that have a build-up of a greyish
brown material that appears to be old, dried feces. At the right front of the cage, at the space between the metal
mesh floor and the wood floor board, there is a build-up of white or grey fecal pellets mixed with straw and food
pellets.
***Lop-eared rabbit and brown satin rabbit enclosure: The wood floor boards within each of the rabbit cages have abuild-up of a dry greyish brown material that appears to be old, dried feces and debris.
Primary enclosures must be kept free of excreta, hair, and debris to provide the animals with a clean living
environment and prevent exposure to disease hazards. Excreta and debris must be removed from the primary
enclosures and done so at a frequency that will prevent the build-up of material to ensure animals are maintained in
a reasonable clean cage and are free of disease that may result from unsanitary living conditions.

SANITATION.
***Both rabbit enclosures have a buildup of grey-brown material that appears to be old dried feces on the wooden
floor boards. In addition, the cage for the grey rabbit has, at the right front of the cage, at the space between the
metal mesh floor and the wood floor board, a build-up of white or grey fecal pellets mixed with straw and food
pellets. Based upon the appearance of this buildup of fecal matter, these cages are not being sanitized at least
every 30 days as specified in the regulations. Rabbit cages should be sanitized every 30 days with one of the
methods appropriate to the caging system specified in the regulations, such as washing all soiled surfaces with a
detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant. Sanitizing the cages will help prevent the buildup of
old feces and debris and eliminate bacteria and viruses that can cause harmful diseases and discomfort.
Sanitize all rabbit cages at least on a 30 day interval. Start by June 19, 2017.and continuing thereafter.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The lemur enclosure has a buildup of fecal matter, dead leaves, trash, and other debris, on the floor and around
the entryway into the enclosure and excessive weeds growing on the floor in the outdoor play area. There is an
enclosure adjacent to the lemur housing facilities that has old rat holes and what appears to be old feces and dead
leaves still remaining in this pen. Housing facilities need to remain free from accumulations of trash and waste to
promote the health and well-being of the animal housed within the facility. Accumulations of trash, debris, fecal
matter, and weeds can attract insect and mammalian pests which can carry diseases harmful to the animals. The
lemur enclosure and the adjacent pen need to be cleaned, the weeds cut back, and any extraneous clutter
removed. Correct by June 17, 2017.
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***There is an accumulation of feces and food waste in the bottom of the lemur housing structure. The waste has
attracted flies to the area. Hard surfaces in which non-human primates may come into contact must be spot cleaned
daily to prevent accumulation of excreta. The housing facilities should also be sanitized in accordance with subpart
3.84(b) to prevent exposure to vermin and disease. The practice of daily removal of excreta and food wastes mustbe implemented to ensure the lemurs are free to avoid contact with contaminated material. Additionally, enclosures
must be sanitized at least every two (2) weeks, in accordance with professionally acceptable standards and by the
methods indicated in subpart 3.84(b)(3) of the Animal Welfare Act regulations. Correct by June 17, 2017
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Mouflon sheep: As a partial correction to the previously cited fence problem on the 12-May-2017 inspection, a
piece of wood was secured to the bottom of the section of fence that was bent upward into the enclosure. This
measure is not effective and created an uneven surface which could possibly cause injury to an animal running
along the fence line. Other sections of the fence along the left side of the enclosure are caved inward and partially
detached from support poles at the bottom portion. These sections of fencing in the current state are not
structurally sound and could give way and injure an animal. Overall the fencing is in disrepair and the structural
strength has been compromised due to tree damage and wear over time. The fencing must be constructed in
manner that will eliminate any gaps or sagging in the fence as well as be securely attached to support poles.
***Goat enclosure: The bottom of one section of fencing near the gate, is bent upward into the enclosure and bowed
outward. This has created a gap that would allow an animal to enter or exit the enclosure. The owner indicated one
goat was seen pushing the section of fence up and going under it to escape from the enclosure. The section of
fence no longer prevents the escape of animals or the entry of unwanted animals. The fence must be reconstructed
in a manner that will ensure the fence is structurally sound and made of such material and strength to contain the
goats within and prevent damage to the fence.
***Goat enclosure: The gate for the goat enclosure is a wire panel loosely secured with carabiners and a chain. The
panel gate fence is attached so the pointed edge extends into the enclosure. The goats in the enclosure could be
injured by the points along the edge of the gate fencing. The gate must be better secured, such as a hinge or metal
fence clamps, to ensure the gate is kept closed to prevent escape and the unwanted entry of patrons. Additionally,
the gate must be constructed in a manner that will allow the gate to be properly closed and the points eliminated to
prevent injury to the animals.
***Squirrel enclosure: The wire fencing is poorly attached at the top of the enclosure. Several sections of the wire
are broken and bent to the point that the mesh pattern has been compromised. A hole, approximately 5 inches in
diameter, is noted in the mesh. The hole is large enough for a squirrel to escape through.
At the time of the inspection, the black squirrel was not in the enclosure. The owner indicated the squirrel has been
seen roaming the property. The damage to the mesh wire has left gaps at the top of the enclosure that allowed the
squirrel to escape. The mesh must be replaced and constructed with a material of such strength as appropriate for
squirrels to prevent escape of the animals or the entry of unwanted animals.
***Jacob’s sheep: The gate is tied on both ends with only bale twine. One side is attached to an inside fence thathas been temporarily placed for rounding up the sheep for shearing. The other side is tied to a wood support post
with bale twine.
***Highland Cow / Zebu: The gate is not squarely placed. The gate leans forward as there is no latch but just a
single strand of bale twine to attach the top of the gate to the top of the metal support pole. There was also a chain
attached to the mid- section of the pole.
The use of bale twine does not securely fasten gates to prevent a person from untying the gate and gaining easy
entry into the enclosure or allowing animals to escape. Poorly secured gates do not prevent animals from being able
to dislodge the gate and escape.
***Highland cow / Zebu: A set of 4 rungs of board fencing are attached to a wood support post and extends beyond
the post but does not extend all the way to the metal support pole that secures the gate. The unattached boards
leave a gap between the fence and the gate, approximately 2-4 inches wide. The current design does not serve to
secure the enclosure and could be easily broken by an animal or human. The fencing must be constructed in a
manner that will provide adequate strength to contain domestic cattle.
***Jacob’s sheep / Donkey enclosure: The bottom rung of one section of fencing is partially broken and could injure
and animal. The board is displaced creating a gap between rungs that is large enough for a sheep to pass through
and escape. The rung should be replaced or the bottom portion fence constructed in a manner that would reduce
the gap and prevent animals from escaping or being injured.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***An open tub of corn has been placed on the floor near the door of the admission booth. The corn is provided for
patrons to use to feed the animals. Food for feeding to the animals must be free of contamination, wholesome, and
palatable. Food exposed to the open air can lose nutritive value and palatability. There is also a greater risk of the
food being contaminated by vermin and pests. Food for patrons to feed the animals must be stored in manner that
prevents contamination, such as in a container with a tightly fitting lid, to ensure animals are fed a wholesome and
palatable treat.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***According to the owner, the zoo has been closed for at least 3 weeks. Although there is a “No Trespassing” sign
at the main entrance to the zoo and the private entrance to the owner’s property, members of the public have
presumably gained access to the property through open and broken gates. The gate at the main entrance is broken.
The gate at the main entrance is under repair but currently does not close completely. Additionally, the back gate for
entrance into to the zoo is missing and the adjacent fencing for which it would be attached is bent down to the
ground due to a bent support pole. The entrance from the private home is also often left open. These gates are apart of the perimeter fence and if left open or broken will allow members of the public free access to the property
even when the zoo is closed. All gate entrances must be repaired and properly secured to prevent the entry of
unwanted persons for the protection of the animals. Correct June 22, 2017.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
***The deer water trough is splattered with black dots. The dots appear to be from the juice from the fruit on the
branches of a mulberry tree that hangs over the trough. Also, some mulberries are seen in the water trough. The
water is murky. Drinking water that is soiled and discolored due to an excessive amount of debris is not considered
potable for animals to drink. Water troughs should be placed in an area that prevents debris from falling into the
drinking water. And, the trough must be cleaned as frequently as necessary to ensure the animals have potable
water at all times.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***Squirrel cage: An excessive amount of fecal matter and sunflower shells and peanut hulls cover the bottom of the
enclosure. Excess food and animal wastes can become an attractant for pests and expose the animals to disease.
Such debris should be removed as often as necessary to prevent build-up and to maintain a clean enclosure.
Animal and food wastes must be removed from the bottom of the squirrel cage at a frequency that will prevent the
excessive accumulation of waste to facilitate the pest control program and prevent the exposure of the animals to
disease.
***The red shelter within the cavy enclosure housing 4 cavys contains a build-up of feces, urine, and debris that has
become caked into the floor of the enclosure. The build-up of fecal matter within the shelter poses a threat to the
animal health. The shelter must be cleaned of all excreta and debris to prevent disease, minimize odors, and for the
comfort of the animals. Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
with excreta, minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***The deer feed trough has jagged edges from chewing, that resulted in two deep U-shaped crevices along the top
edge of the trough. A limb could get caught in the crevices or other injury may occur due to the jagged edges and
the shape of the damage to the trough. The feeding trough needs to be replaced to prevent injury to the deer in the
enclosure.
***Pokeweed is present in the Highland cow / Zebu enclosure near the water trough. This weed is known to cause
gastrointestinal upset in cattle and is considered poisonous. Poisonous plants pose a threat to the health of theanimals. The pokeweed should be removed from the enclosure to prevent illness. Additionally, regular checks for
removal of the plant from the enclosure should be established.
***Mouflon sheep: The back of the shelter has a hole in the board, approximately 18 inches in diameter. The shelter
has been patched in several areas. The hole is located in an area in which a horn may get caught. Shelters must
be kept in good repair to maintain the integrity of the structure and provide adequate protection from injury.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Rat holes were observed in front of the shelter portion of the outdoor lemur enclosure, the prairie dog, and potbelly
pig, and behind the white nosed coatimundi enclosure. The rat problem has continued since the last inspection.
Rats are known to carry various diseases that may affect the health of the exhibit animals. A safe and effective pest
control program is required to ensure good animal health. Previously implemented pest control measures, i.e.
poison and filling of holes must be continued at an appropriate frequency to prevent harborage and recolonization of
the rodent population. An expert in the elimination of a rat infestation must be consulted for additional measures for
controlling the rat population.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses 64 regulated animals, numerous birds, and one (1) turtle. There are only two (2) employees to
feed, clean enclosures, and to conduct the maintenance of the enclosures and upkeep of the property. The same
employees also keep records and provide the daily observations of the animals. Additionally, these same
employees have regular responsibilities for a job unrelated to those of the zoo.
Based upon the number of animals and non-complaint items related to cleaning, sanitation, waste disposal and
maintenance there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the husbandry
responsibilities of the facility on a daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of trained employees to carry out
the day to day husbandry duties and maintenance on the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is needed
to ensure that cleaning, animal observations, maintenance tasks, and pest control duties are performed at
professionally acceptable level for the number of animals housed at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owners.Additional Inspectors
