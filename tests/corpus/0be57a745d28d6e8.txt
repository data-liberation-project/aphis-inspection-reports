ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Numerous prairie dogs and Richardson’s ground squirrels were observed to have areas of hair loss over their sides
and backs. One ground squirrel had a large scabbed and healing wound within its patch of hair loss. Three of the
six cavies had pieces of the tips of their ears missing. The tips of the ears were scabbed over and thickened. Flies
were observed to be on the ears and the animals were shaking their heads. One of the cavy with ear issues also
had an area of hair loss on its back approximately 1.5 inches by 5 inches. The skin was crusty, thickened, and
bloody. A discussion with the attending veterinarian revealed that the above issues had not been communicated to
her. Failure to communicate animal health issues to the attending veterinarian can lead to undue animal suffering
and disease transmission. Licensees are required to have a method of direct and frequent communication with their
attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being is conveyed.
