FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The licensee has a 9-3-14 perimeter fence variance for a camel, a zebra, and similar non-dangerous hoof stock.
The variance is for an enclosed front pasture along the road. During this inspection, a new zebra was found
grazing inside the six foot perimeter fence for the exotic animal enclosures. The older zebra who was in with the
camel was sold. For the new zebra to be housed where it is, a perimeter fence addition needs to be requested and
approved. To be corrected by 12-3-16.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with owners.
