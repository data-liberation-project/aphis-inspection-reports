Housing facilities, general.
There is an area of small holes in the painted wooden sheeting above the lemur's perch and a mouse was observed on
the insulation side of the hole. The holes, if left unaddressed, could become larger and potentially compromise the ceiling
around them. Ensure that this area is repaired/replaced and maintained in good repair.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The facility provides enrichment, however the environmental enhancement program was not available for inspection. A
plan for environmental enhancement that documents the plan to provide enrichment and special considerations (such as
single-housed non-human primates) must be directed by the attending veterinarian and available for inspection. This is
necessary to ensure the psychological well-being of the animals. Ensure that a documented plan for environmental
enrichment that addresses the required elements is maintained and available for inspection.
3.84(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
A mouse was observed above a small hole in the ceiling of the lemur enclosure. The facility has a professional pest
control program in place, however this area hasn't been addressed by the program. The presence of mice above the

enclosure could contaminate the lemur's area and cause a health hazard. Ensure that this area is addressed with a safe
and effective pest control program.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
1. The African crested porcupines’ enclosure is in disrepair. The animals’ shelter entrance doorway has multiple wires
exposed that are accessible to the animals. The exposed wires are the result of the animals chewing and removing the
wood framing around the shelter entrance doorway. These exposed wires could injure the animals. Ensure the enclosure
is maintained in good repair.
2. The Patagonian cavy enclosure is in disrepair. The animals have dug at least three holes in the ground, along the
fence line. The holes ranged in size from approximately 6 inches to 1 foot wide and approximately 3-4 inches deep. The
animals could continue to dig and escape from the enclosure if the holes aren’t addressed. Ensure the enclosure is
maintained to contain the animals.
3.129(a)

Feeding.
The facility is feeding strictly chicken thighs without vitamin supplements to the Eurasian lynxes and bobcats. This diet
lacks vitamins and minerals that these nondomestic cats need. Feeding an improper diet could cause the animals to
develop health problems. Ensure that a balanced diet with essential vitamins and minerals is provided.
