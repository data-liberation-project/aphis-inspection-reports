Section 3.131(c) Housekeeping: The walk in freezer in the commissary building is in disrepair.
1) The concrete floor is crumbling at the door entrance to about one foot into the freezer. There are also some wide
cracks in the floor where dirt and debris can accumulate. The floor of the freezer cannot be adequately cleaned in
these areas. The floor of the freezer must be repaired to allow it to be readily cleaned. Correct by August 18, 2016.

2) The floor has sunk down in the back right corner. Ice has accumulated on the ceiling, on shelving and on food
containers in the back right corner. The facility escort informed the APHIS official that condensation was forming in
this corner, causing the ice formation. Ice on food packages may damage or affect the nutritive value of the food.
The freezer must be repaired and\or food stored in the freezer in a manner that prevents ice from accumulation on
the stored items. Correct by May 25, 2016.
Note: This inspection was conducted on May 17-18, 2016. An exit interview was conducted with the facility Director
of Animal Health.
