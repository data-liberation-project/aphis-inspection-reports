3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete.

The section for ectoparasites is lacking how often the treatment will be applied to the adult dogs and puppies.

The section for blood parasites states "heartguard as needed", but there is no documentation that defines the phrase "as
needed".

The plan for sampling dogs for blood parasites and intestinal parasites, including the number of animals to be sampled, is
missing.

Failure to have a complete program on veterinary care does not ensure the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.


Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs. The missing information must be added to
the program of veterinary care to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.
