ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On April 15, 2016 the attending veterinarian conducted annual physicals on all dogs at the facility. At that time Adult
Poodle Female #212 was identified as having grade 4 dental disease. Per the program of veterinary care any dog
identified as having grade 3 or 4 dental disease shall be seen by the veterinarian for appropriate dental cleaning
and then followed up 6 months later for a re-check. This female was nursing a litter of puppies at the time of the
inspection and per the program of veterinary care the animal shall be seen after weaning her litter. This poodle was
not seen by a veterinarian for a dental cleaning after the April 15, 2016 physical exam. At the time of the inspection
of the Poodles teeth there was a moderate build-up of brown/yellow material on the canines and molars. Many of
the cheek teeth were missing. The gums were not red or inflamed. The animal was in good body condition and all
puppies in the litter appeared healthy and well nourished. The Licensee shall assure that the attending veterinarian
has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care.
Licensee must contact the veterinarian for the examination of the animal previously identified as having dental
disease. Documentation of the examination, diagnosis and treatment must be maintained and made available for
inspection.
