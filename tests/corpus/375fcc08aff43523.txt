WATERING.
The water receptacles for the prairie dogs, fallow deer and lamas contain large amounts of algae floating in them
and coating the inside of the receptacles. Water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary. The amount of algae
in these receptacles indicates that they have not been cleaned for some time. Water consumption may be reduced
when water is not palatable and this can have a negative affect on animal health. Clean these water receptacles as
needed to keep them clean and sanitary.
