HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is bedding stored in a barrel without the lid and some food stored in a bucket without a lid on it. Opened
supplies of food and bedding can become contaminated if not stored properly. All opened supplies of food and
bedding must be stored in leak-proof containers with tightly fitted lids. Correct by 14 July 2016.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was old, damp bedding in at least one dog shelter. Deteriorated, damp bedding can contribute to disease
transmission, attract pests and be uncomfortable for the dogs. Facility operators must provide for regular and
frequent collection, removal and disposal of bedding in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks.

3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
There are still at least two metal "(cid:28)self-feeders"(cid:29) that have a buildup of food residue and grime on the interior in
contact with the food. Dirty food receptacles can contaminate the food and affect the nutritive value of the food. If
self-feeders are used, the licensee must keep them clean and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 b.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Excreta covered a large portion (approximately a third of the floor space) of the outdoor section of one sheltered
whelping enclosure. According to the owner, this enclosure was cleaned 2 days ago. Accumulation of excreta can
soil the dogs, increase disease transmission, and attract flies and other pests. Excreta and food waste must be
removed from primary enclosures on a daily basis or more often to prevent the soiling of the dogs in the enclosure.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMOand Kendall Lundy, ACI.
