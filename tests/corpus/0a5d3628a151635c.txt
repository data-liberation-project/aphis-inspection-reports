2.31(d)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The 3/15/16 Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) meeting minutes discussed an unapproved
significant change to a protocol: Animals being used under the protocol titled "Dissecting the Neural Control of
Social Attachment" were not being observed at 12 hours following surgery, as required in the approved protocol.
Some were observed at closer to 24 hours post-op. This omission may have resulted in unrecognized and untreated
pain and distress for these animals.
Significant changes cannot be made to the study protocol without IACUC approval. The Principle Investigator is
responsible for ensuring that the procedures involving animals adhere to the approved protocol, in order to provide
adequate oversight of the welfare of the animals on study.
The IACUC had taken action to correct this problem at the time of inspection.
2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The protocol titled "Dissecting the Neural Control of Social Attachment" includes a surgical procedure on voles that
would be expected to cause moderate pain. In the protocol there is a section describing post-operative analgesia,
but it is worded in a way that is unclear as to whether additional doses of analgesia will be administered after
surgery. Two staff veterinarians were asked to read the section, and explain its intent, and they disagreed on its
interpretation. A review of surgical records between November 2015 and May 2016 showed that ten voles did not
receive any additional analgesia following embryo transfer surgery, and this omission of post-op analgesia is not in
accordance with the institution's document titled "LARC Veterinarians' Guidance for Pain Management for UCSF
Laboratory Animals".
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) must ensure that protocols include a clear description of
procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be minimized whenever possible, in order to
safeguard the well-being of the animals under study. Assessment of adequate pain management to be completed immediately, and protocol issue to be corrected by
8/17/16.

This inspection was conducted on 6/13/16 and 6/14/16 by Veterinary Medical Officers P. Smith and M. Schnell.
Only the Parnassus Complex facilities and animals were inspected during this inspection. Overall program and
protocols reviewed.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility's representatives.
