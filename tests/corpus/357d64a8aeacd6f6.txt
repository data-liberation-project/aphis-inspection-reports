2.126(a) CRITICAL
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
On the afternoon of July 01, 2019, I approached a parked van in Neosho, MO, that was loading puppies. I identified
myself as a USDA Animal Care Inspector to the driver of the vehicle and said that I was there to conduct an
inspection. The driver, Sara, who was wearing a T-shirt that said "LoneWolf" told me that I was not allowed to
inspect the vehicle because she was not an authorized person.
On July 02, 2019, I phoned Allison Hedgpeth, the owner of LoneWolf Pets, and explained what had happened the
previous day. Ms. Hedgpeth told me that she has directed all of her employees to deny USDA access to her
vehicles unless she is present for the inspection. She said to go ahead and write an NCI for refusal of inspection,
that she would appeal the report, and deal with the consequences.
Access to vehicles, animals, and records is necessary to complete an inspection to ensure the health, comfort, and
safety of the animals being transported. The registrant must allow APHIS officials to enter its place of business; to
inspect facilities, property, and animals; to examine and copy records; and to document non-compliant items via
photographs and other means.
The exit interview was conducted via phone with the registrant by Jami Niemann-SACS on July 09, 2019.
