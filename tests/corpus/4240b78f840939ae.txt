COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
In building 12, Room 1202, The APHIS inspection team observed one feline harem group exhibit behaviors that
included loud distressed vocalization, continuous chasing back and forth throughout the entire enclosure, and
dislodged tufts of fur floating out of the enclosure. This was observed for at least a minute and a half. Although there
was a recent reintroduction of queens which had been separated to raise their young, the conflict appeared
sustained and extreme. In addition, there were no partitions or visual barriers which would have allowed any
individual in the group to hide.
In another harem enclosure, healing scratches were noted on three of the cats. In addition, in a third harem
grouping, one male was noted to distinctly separate himself from the rest of the group, had healing scratches on his
nose, and what appeared to be an old ear injury. A review of this cat’s medical record indicated that the animal had
a history of previous scratches, which were noted on an entry dated 7/18/17. These repeated incidents suggest
incompatibility within this harem group.
Incompatible grouping and stressful re introductions can lead to continued distress and injury which affect the health
and well-being of the animals.
Facility shall observe animals for compatibility on a continuing basis and document these findings in order to devise
and implement effective approaches to minimize distress and maximize compatibility.
