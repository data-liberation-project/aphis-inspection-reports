ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 930am on
05/07/2014.
Several efforts were made to make contact with the licensee, including honking of the horn from the bottom of the
long driveway, pounding on the metal gate as was described by the licensee previously in order to get his attention.
Both methods met with negative results. At this time two neighbors arrived and one went to his residence and called
to him as his car was there, however no response. The second neighbor advised she would let Mr. Peveler know of
our arrival and ask him to call us if she heard from him that day. A message was left on his voicemail to call this
inspector in order to discuss best times of inspection and the option for there to be a second person that could be
contacted for inspections if he is unreachable. At this time there has been no contact made by the licensee to this
inspector.
Please call 618-315-3649 ASAP AnnMarie Houser, ACI and leave all home and cell numbers that you can be
reached and please leave any information of best times and days of the week for inspections. Thank you.
