ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
One expired bottle of euthanasia solution (lot # H5004, expiration date May 2017) was found during the inspection.
This bottle had not been used since 11/11/2016. Expired medications may have compromised efficacy and potency
and use of such does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The institution needs to ensure that medications are
not being used past their expiration date. To be corrected by 9/14/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
