2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care does not include all the AWA covered species housed and exhibited by the
licensee. The only animals listed, and for which directions have been provided by the attending veterinarian (AV),
include, wolf hybrids, domestic cats, ferrets, goats, donkey, alpaca, white-tailed deer, Sika deer, and pig. The
facility houses many other animals (nonhuman primates, large and small carnivores, domestic, wild and exotic small
mammals) but there are no provisions in the written program of veterinary care for the preventative care required,
handling of animals, euthanasia methods appropriate for each species, or any other species-specific veterinary care
concerns.
All AWA covered animals should be included in the written program of veterinary care in order to ensure that
adequate veterinary care for each species is discussed by the licensee and the AV and can be provided as directed
by the AV.
The written program of veterinary care is required for a licensed exhibitor who employs an attending veterinarian
(AV) on a part-time or consultant basis is required and should be comprehensive for all AWA covered animals. To
be corrected by 22 October 2015.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-There is a thin doe who had been nursing twin fawns. The doe is thin as evidenced by her visible ribs, and
prominent tops of the hips, and vertebrae. The representative states that he discussed this situation with the
attending veterinarian (AV) last year when she was in a similar condition but has not done so this year. While
nursing is a metabolic strain on a female and can result in weight loss, this degree of weight loss is concerning.
Also, it cannot be assumed that there are not concurrent problems occurring that contribute to the excessive weight
loss.
-There is a thin, geriatric bobcat as evidenced by a pronounced hollowing in the abdominal area behind the ribs anda visible loss of muscle mass in the rear legs. This animal was seen by a veterinarian for a dental problem about 2
months ago and was weighed at that time. The facility has not communicated with a veterinarian about this animal's
body condition nor have they weighed her since that time. Weight loss in any animal (but particularly in a geriatric
animal) can indicate that there are medical or nutritional problems occurring.
-There are three chipmunks who have evidence of wounds. One has a thinning, rough hair coat, a large scab on the
back of its neck, and is missing the tops of his ears. One has a large scar in the center of the top of his head and is
missing the top of the left ear, One has some damage to one of its ears and appears to be missing part of its tail.
The facility representative states that the animals were acquire in this condition but does not have documentation
from the AV to show that they have been assessed. Evidence of wounds can indicate incompatibility or space
issues, ongoing skin problems, or other medical problems.
-There is a geriatric artic fox who walks with a stiff, slow gait. The facility is feeding this animal a dog food with a
joint protective function as part of its regular diet. The facility representative states that they have had the animal
assessed by the attending veterinarian recently and have a receipt showing the visit but no other documentation
showing the communication with the veterinarian or any outcome or treatment plan resulting from that visit. Slow
gait in any animal (but particularly in a geriatric animal) can indicate joint changes that can be painful.
The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two animals (a doe and bobcat) were noted during the inspection to be in thin body condition but the condition of
these animals has not been communicated to the attending veterinarian (AV). The representative states that he
discussed this situation with the doe last year when she was in a similar condition but has not done so this year.
The bobcat was seen by a veterinarian about two months ago but the facility has not communicated with a
veterinarian about this animal's body condition since that time.
Direct and frequent communication with the AV regarding the daily observation of the animals is critical to address
animal health concerns in a timely manner. The licensee must ensure that animals are observed daily to asses their
health and well being. This information must be communicated to the AV in a direct and frequent manner so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal heath, behavior and well being are conveyed. To be correct
from this point forward.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.There is a accumulation of feces in the dirt floor area of the wolf-hybrid/dog enclosure. The representative states
that the feces were last spot cleaned about 2 days ago. Accumulation of feces can play a role in disease
transmission, attract pests, and contribute to odors. The licensee must remove excreta and food waste from primary
enclosures daily. To be corrected by 9 October 2015.
3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The concrete surface in one of the two corn-crib enclosures housing 4 Japanese macaques was pitted around the
water tank used as a swimming pool for these animals. The water was overflowing this tank and the pitted concrete
surface was wet and appeared to be absorbing the water as compared to an adjacent area that was not pitted and
allowed this excess water to pool. This pitted area is not impervious to moisture and cannot be adequately cleaned
or sanitized.
Surfaces that come into contact with nonhuman primates must be able to be readily cleaned and sanitized to
minimize the build-up of and contamination by excreta and food debris which poses a risk to the animals(cid:25) health.
The surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be
readily cleaned and sanitized. To be correct by 11/7/2015
3.75(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An open bag of Mazuri Primate biscuits and an open box of cereal used for treats for 2 ring-tailed lemurs were
found in the area housing these animals. Excessive flies were noted in this area and there were rodent feces on the
floor and on equipment stored on shelves beneath the cereal box, posing a risk of contamination for these food
items. Open food and bedding supplies must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent
spoilage and deterioration.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Housekeeping for premises. The office building where the kitchen and food preparation area and the indoor housing
for 2 ring-tailed lemurs are located had excessive buildup of fly speck on the light fixtures and ceiling above the
counter and the lemur enclosure. Fly speck is layers of excreta from the excessive flies noted in the building which
can contaminate food during preparation and can be reached by the lemurs on the light fixture above their
enclosure.
Rodent feces were noted on the floor and some surfaces of items stored around the indoor housing for the
ring-tailed lemurs. Empty bird cages, items not needed for husbandry of the lemurs, and other items stored in thisarea can harbor rodents, insects, and other pests. An oscillating fan blowing in the food preparation area was
heavily covered with dust and could contaminate the uncovered meat on the counter.
Facilities and premises must be kept clean to facilitate husbandry practices and to reduce or eliminate breeding and
living areas for rodents, pest, and vermin.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Excessive flies were noted in and around the outdoor enclosure for 4 Japanese macaques and in and around the
indoor enclosure for 2 ring-tailed lemurs. Flies can carry disease, contaminate food, and are a nuisance to the
animals.
Rodent feces were noted on the floor around the indoor enclosure for 2 ring-tailed lemurs as well as on items
stacked on shelves beneath the food storage area adjacent to the enclosure. The presence of rodent feces may
indicate an active pest problem in this area and poses a risk to the health of the animals through potential
contamination of their food and bedding. An effective program for control of insects and mammals that are pests
must be established and maintained to promote the health of animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal
areas.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A rusted wire with a sharp point was protruding from the water receptacle for 3 pygmy goats and 1 pot-bellied pig.
This wire was securing a chain to the receptacle and either broke or became unsecured, leaving a sharp point right
at the edge where the animals would drink, posing a risk of injury to these animals. The wire was secured to hide
the sharp end during the inspection. Facilities shall be constructed and maintained to protect the animals from
injury.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-The large chest freezer in the office that holds frozen meat meant for consumption by the animals in the facility is
also being used to store a dead owl and other dead animal parts. Storage of dead animals not meant or prepared
for consumption can cause contamination of the food.
-There are a variety of produce items such a mangos, plums, and a pineapple, being stored in the one of the office
refrigerators that are showing deterioration and molding.
-Deterioration, and contamination of food items can lead to illness in the animals consuming the food anddecreased nutritive value of the food. The licensee must store supplies of food in facilities which adequately protect
them against deterioration, molding or contamination. To be corrected by 10 October 2015.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is standing water and sloppy mud in the southwest corner of the deer enclosure. The water and mud in this
area is starting to turn green in several spots. The licensee states that the deer drink from this standing water. The
licensee also states that this is a result of the cleaning and hosing of structures in the enclosure and also happens
after rain. Standing water attracts pests and can lead to illness if contaminated water is consumed. The areas that
are starting to turn green must be corrected by 15 October 2015 and the overall drainage problem must be
corrected by 9 Nov 2015.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is an asphalt berm at the base of most of the perimeter fence. There are, however, three areas where there is
a gap of at least 5 inches under the fence where it appears that the asphalt has been disturbed. These areas were
1. in the west side by the emus, 2. the northwest corner, and 3 the north side. Gaps under the perimeter fence can
allow unwanted animals access to the facility. The licensee must ensure that the perimeter fence be constructed so
that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or
under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. To be corrected by 22 October 2015.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
The food receptacle used in the ferret enclosure appears dirty around the interior top edge. Dirty food receptacles
can cause contamination of the food and decrease the appetite of the animals using them. The licensee must
ensure that all food receptacles are kept clean and sanitary at all times. To be corrected by 10 October 2015.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Excessive flies were noted throughout the facility particularly around the enclosure housing 4 raccoons, the
wolf-hybrid enclosure, and around the outside of the office building as well as inside this building which houses 2
ferrets and 2 ring-tailed lemurs. Several fly traps were noted outside of the office building but these were empty of
bait. A fly strip and fly trap were hanging near the sink and food preparation area inside of the office building. Only
a few flies were in the trap, which did appear to have bait, and the fly strip was covered in flies but there were still
excessive flies in this area which were landing on meat that was uncovered in pails on the counter. APHIS VMOs
were bitten by flies several times during the inspection.Flies can carry disease, contaminate food, and are a nuisance to the animals.
The licensee must maintain a safe and effective program for the control of insects and other pests.
