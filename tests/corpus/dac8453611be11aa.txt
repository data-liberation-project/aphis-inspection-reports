ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:44pm on
10-Sep-19.
There was no response to ringing the doorbell and the message I received when calling the telephone number on
file was "call cannot be completed as dialed."
