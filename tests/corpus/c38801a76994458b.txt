2.31(d)(1)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The proposal to use animals does not contain information on procedures that are potentially painful or distressful to
the rabbits. The PI was present at the time of inspection to verbally explain to the APHIS inspector the procedure of
using complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), but the protocol did not have this noted, nor did it contain a consideration
of alternatives for CFA intradermal injections which is a procedure which may cause pain that is more than
momentary. The facility must ensure that any proposal containing potentially painful and/ or distressful procedures
that are more than momentary contains a consideration for alternatives and a narrative explaining why any
alternatives found were not used.

2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The protocol available for review by the APHIS inspector did not contain a complete description of the proposed use
of the rabbits. The PI was present at the inspection and verbally informed the inspector of the procedures but the
proposal did not contain information on the complete Freund's adjuvant injections, blood draws, antigen boost
injections, neither the method of those items - such as locations, quantity, and timing, nor the standard methods by
which animal health status is determined prior to blood draw - such as weight and pack cell volume (PCV). A
complete description must be available for IACUC review.

2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
At the time of inspection, there was one white rabbit observed to have a thin body condition, increased respiratory
rate, have plantar crusts and scaly skin, and no hind limb nails. The licensee was aware of the foot lesions and
attempted some palliative care for 1 week and reported the rabbit has had a normal appetite and thirst, but did not
notify the veterinarian about concerns with this animal.The condition of the hind feet in this rabbit warranted appropriate treatment as the lesions may be painful. Left
untreated, illness can progress and potentially cause significant discomfort to the animal.
Appropriate methods must be used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This includes
consultation of a veterinarian whenever abnormal conditions and behaviors are observed in rabbits.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee and the principal investigator at the time of inspection.
