3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
The licensee notified the inspector on March 28, 2020, that the arctic fox had escaped its enclosure and could not be
found. The base of the enclosure, consisting of concrete blocks, was reported to have moved and created a gap that the
animal exited through. The enclosure had been removed by the time of inspection. Enclosures shall be structurally sound
and maintained to protect the animals and contain them. The licensee must ensure that animal enclosures are secure to
protect the animals.
3.127(d) Critical

Facilities, outdoor.
On March 28, 2020, the licensee notified the inspector that the arctic fox had escaped it's primary enclosure and exited
the facility grounds under the perimeter fence. The fox was not recovered. On the day of inspection, multiple areas under
the perimeter fence revealed significant gaps under the perimeter fence. On the left hand side of the gate, and under the
left and right rear panels of the left rear corner of the lot there was evidence that an animal had been digging to access
the facility yard, resulting in gaps of depths varying from 6-12 inches. At the rear right corner of the yard the entire length
of one fence panel had a gap ranging in depth from approximately 6-8 inches. The perimeter fence must protect animals
by restricting animals from going over and under it, and serve as a secondary containment system for animals in the


facility. The facility must ensure the perimeter fence functions to contain the animals safely.

Classification and separation.
An adult Flemish Giant rabbit was housed in a large enclosure with one Patagonian Cavy and two Wallabies. Rabbits
shall not be housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species of animals unless required for scientific
reasons. Co housing may result in adverse behavioral and physical health effects. The licensee shall ensure that rabbits
are not housed in the same primary enclosure with other species.

3.33(b)

Classification and separation.
Two adult guinea pigs were housed with an adult armadillo. One guinea pig was observed to be lethargic, of a decreased
body condition in comparison to the other guinea pig, and have ocular discharge. Guinea pigs shall not be housed in the
same primary enclosure with any other species of animals. Co housing with another species risks adverse physical and
behavioral effects. The facility shall house the guinea pigs only with other guinea pigs.

Correct by: the facility removed the armadillo immediately.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
