3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outside portion of the enclosures is constructed of welded wire fence panels and each panel is framed with
metal pipe. The second enclosure, housing one dog, has a fence panel whose bottom pipe is rusty and has
numerous holes broken into its surface. The rust does not allow for the metal pipe to be cleaned and sanitized and
the numerous holes could affect the structural strength of the pipe. This metal pipe must be replaced or altered in a
manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization to occur and ensures that the fence panel remains
structurally sound.
3.8
