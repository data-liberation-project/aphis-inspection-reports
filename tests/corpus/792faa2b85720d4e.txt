2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:50 pm-1:23
pm on 10/06/2015.
We knocked on the house door and honked the car horn, with no response. The voicemail on the phone was full
and so we could not leave a message.
Additional Inspectors
Mcgruder William, Animal Care Inspector
