2.31(c)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semi-annual reports generated by the IACUC and sent to the Institutional Official (IO) do not contain all of the
required information. Report sent in October 2016 has not been signed by any of the IACUC members. Findings
from the program review are mentioned, but significant from minor deficiencies are not distinguished. An IO report
for the March 2017 facility inspection and program review has not been generated. Without clear and concise
communication between the IACUC and the IO in the form of semi-annual reports, animal use and facility findings
may go unnoticed and/or uncorrected resulting in decreased animal welfare. The IACUC must compile and submit
reports to the IO at least once every six months that contain all of the required information.
Remains Uncorrected
2.31(d)(1)(ii)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The animal use protocol identifies painful procedures conducted on the animals. No alternatives to these
procedures have been included in the IACUC approved protocol. Animals may undergo unnecessary pain and
distress if viable alternatives exist. The principle investigator must consider alternatives to procedures that may
cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress. A written narrative description of the methods and sources
used (i.e. key words, databases used and date search conducted) must be included in the IACUC approved
protocol.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Animal Use protocol has not been reviewed by the IACUC within the last year. The protocol was last reviewed
on May 13, 2016. Review of the October 2016 and March 2017 IACUC meeting notes, no annual review approval of
the ongoing protocol was recorded. Animal Use protocols must be reviewed at least annually to ensure optimal
animal welfare. Ongoing protocols must be reviewed at an interval as set by the IACUC but not less than annually.Correct by: September 30, 2017
