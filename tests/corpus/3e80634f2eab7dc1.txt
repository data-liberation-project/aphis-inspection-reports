Miscellaneous.
At the time of the inspection, the facility had no plan for training personnel regarding their roles and responsibilities as
outlined in the facility's emergency / contingency plan. Training is required to help ensure animal health and well-being in
the event of an emergency or disaster; if personnel are not clear on their roles and responsibilities, animals may suffer
illness, injury or death due to unpreparedness should an emergency or disaster strike. The facility must provide and
document participation in and successful completion of training for its current personnel regarding their roles and
responsibilities as outlined in the contingency plan and ensure that new hires receive this training within 30 days of their
start date. In addition, any changes to the plan as a result of the annual review of the plan must be communicated to
employees through additional training which must be conducted within 30 days of making the changes.
