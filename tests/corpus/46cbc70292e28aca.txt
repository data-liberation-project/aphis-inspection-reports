2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female reindeer, right ear tag #11, seen limping on her right front leg and holding the leg up when at rest on the
previous inspections is unchanged in her condition. The licensee did have the reindeer evaluated by a second
veterinarian on 7/12/2013 but there is no documentation of a diagnosis for her condition and no clear treatment
plan, including monitoring for improvement or follow-up by a veterinarian to determine if the treatment is effective
and/or the condition is stable, improving, or worsening.
Limping and holding a front leg off the ground are indications of an underlying painful condition which needs to be
diagnosed by a veterinarian to determine the best methods for treating the condition.
A plan needs to be documented, approved by a veterinarian, and be available for review by APHIS officials for the
monitoring of this reindeer by the licensee for pain and to recognize changes in her condition. This plan should
include criteria for when pain relief or other methods for reducing pain and distress need to be provided to ensure a
good quality of life and to prevent worsening of the underlying condition. The licensee should document that he is
monitoring this animal and when pain relief or other methods are provided to reduce pain and discomfort so the
veterinarian and APHIS officials can evaluate if the plan i effective.
2.126(a)(2) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
APHIS inspectors again requested to review the records of animals on hand, any veterinary records, including the
program of veterinary care, that were made for the animals, and any disposition records but the licensee stated that
his records were still not available for us to inspect. One female reindeer, right ear tag #11, was severely limping
and holding her right front foot off the ground when at rest but no records regarding her condition or what was the
plan for treatment and quality of life for this animal were available to review. Several animals have been disposed of
since the last inspection on 11/8/2013 but no records were provided by the licensee for review by APHIS officials.
No written program of veterinary care was able to be provided during this inspection.
Access to all required records for inspections is required for the Secretary to be able to enforce the AWA.The licensee shall allow APHIS officials access to conduct inspections.
2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The licensee had a reindeer escape during a temporary exhibition in the town of Dillon, CO on 12/5/2013.
According to the licensee, he brought a female reindeer, right ear tag #7, and placed her in an outdoor pen that was
provided by the event organizer at a shopping mall. The licensee left a volunteer to monitor the reindeer during
public exhibition while the licensee went inside the mall to act as Santa Claus. After the licensee left, the reindeer
was startled by children running toward the pen, she jumped out of the pen, and was running at large until the
following day when the licensee was able to recapture her with assistance from local animal control and police. The
licensee stated that the pen had not been adequately secured and the volunteer was not able to control the animal
(which was wearing a halter and lead rope) to prevent the escape. This reindeer was reported to run through city
streets and swam through a nearby reservoir while being pursued by law enforcement so she experienced
significant behvioral stress and was at great risk for injury or loss of life.
The licensee did not adequately protect this animal or have an appropriately qualified person to ensure the animal
could be safely contained in the temporary exhibit or handled to avoid behavioral stress or physical harm.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
To be corrected for all subsequent exhibitions of animals by the licensee.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The outdoor enclosure housing 1 llama, 6 sheep, 3 goats had an excessive accumulation of excreta. Three of the 4
shelter structures in this enclosure also had excreta covering the entire surface of the dirt floor such that the animals
do not have any floorspace in the shelters where they can avoid contamination of their wool/haircoat.
Contamination of the animals hair/wool with excreta may attract pests and puts them at risk of disease.
Cleaning of enclosures. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.To be corrected by 2/28/2014.
Accompanied on the inspection by the licensee and 2 AC VMO's. Exit interview conducted on site with the
licensee.
