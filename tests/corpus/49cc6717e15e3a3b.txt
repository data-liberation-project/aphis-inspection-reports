FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the first serval pen that contained an adult serval and two kittens there was the roof on the den that was sinking
in the center. The roof had warped making the edges bend upward. Also the catwalk was leaning and partially
falling over with a ramp attached to it. The ramp had stepping posts that were broken and were hanging side ways.
At the top of one of the door ways there was a piece of wood that was partially falling off exposing the pointy ends of
the wire paneling.
** In the fourth pen there were two servals. In this enclosure there was a catwalk that was warped where the ends of
the wood curled upward. One board had a nail that had come out of it exposing the head. There was also mesh that
was lining the walls of the enclosure that was coming down in which a cat could become entangled.
** In the fifth enclosure containing 2 servals there was mesh lining the fencing that was falling down or coming away
from the fencing allowing potential for a cat to become entangled.
** In the first kinkajou enclosure containing one kinkajou there were two areas of the caging that the wiring had
come undone and its pointy ends were exposed. These areas need to be repaired and secured to ensure the safety
and containment of the animals.
** In the fennec foxes enclosure on the right there were small pieces of cut out chicken wire that were scattered on
the ground. Also on the outside there was a beam of wood for the structure and a perch made of wood that had
degraded and needs to be replaced.
** In the fennec foxes outdoor enclosure on the left there is a wood beam that is falling on the mesh covering of the
enclosure that needs to be removed and repaired. This beam could possibly fall in and injure an animal or possibly
create a means to escape.
**In the kinkajous enclosure on the left there is a den box made of wood that has been chewed and soiled. The box
is in disrepair and needs to be repaired or replaced.The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.

SANITATION.
** In the first kinkajou enclosure that contained 1 kinkajou and the indoor and outdoor enclosure that contained 2
kinkajous there was an abundance of feces on the floor and on the playground toys. There was a foul odor and the
presence of several flying insects.
** In three serval enclosures there was an abundance of feces and a foul odor. There were also some enclosure
that contained soiled cardboard. The feces and soiled materials should be removed to minimize odors and pest.
Feces shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. When enclosures are cleaned by hosing or
flushing, adequate measures shall be taken to protect the animals confined in such enclosures from being directly
sprayed with the stream of water or wetted involuntarily.
