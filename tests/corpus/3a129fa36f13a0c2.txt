2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
**The written Program of Veterinary Care was not available for review at the time of inspection. The Animal Welfare
Act requires the facility to maintain and have a written Program of Veterinary Care available for review.
Unavailability of records for review as required by the AWA does not allow for evaluation of the program in order to
ensure adequate veterinary care is being provided to the animals housed at the facility. The facility must maintain
records as required by the AWA and have them available at all times for review.
