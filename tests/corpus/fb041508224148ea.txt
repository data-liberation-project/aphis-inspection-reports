INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Based on checklists provided by the facility for review, the facility completed a review of their program for humane
care and use of animals and the facility's animal facilities on 6/18/13 and 11/18/13. There were no reports of these
evaluations prepared and submitted to the Institutional Official. Both reports contained multiple issues, including
some of which were checked as significant, many of which were checked as problems on both reports. There were
no action plans for correction or dates for correcting each deficiency. The IACUC must prepare a report of their
semiannual evaluations to ensure that deficiencies are corrected in an appropriate and timely manner. The IACUC
shall prepare a report based on its semi-annual evaluations for the Institutional Official that identifies all deficiences
found, designates them as minor or significant and that contains a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with
dates for correcting each deficiency. Correct with the next semi-annual evaluation.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Two protocols (0607TJG-02 and 0607TJG-03) approved by the IACUC contain a method of euthanasia that is not
considered acceptable by the AVMA. Any method of euthanasia used should be AVMA approved in assurance of
being a humane and safe method of euthanasia or there must be scientific justification approved by the IACUC as
to why the method must be used. Methods of euthanasia must be AVMA approved and accomplish the humane
destruction of an animal. Correct by June 10, 2014.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocols 0607TJG-03 and 0607TJG-02 list the numbers of animals of multiple species to be used but does not give
a rationale for the appropriateness of the species and numbers of animals to be used in the teaching protocols. A
protocol must contain a justification for the species and the numbers of animals to be used to allow the IACUC to
appropriately review the protocol and assure that there will not be duplication and to assure minimalization of pain
and distress. All proposals to conduct an activity involving animals must contain a rationale for the appropriatenessof the species and numbers of animals to be used. Correct by June 10, 2014.
2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The facility currently has an arrangement with a consulting veterinarian to be their attending veterinarian. The formal
arrangement does not currently include a written program of veterinary care with regularly scheduled visits to the
research facility. A formal arrangement documented in writing is necessary to assure veterinary oversight over the
care and use of the animals at the facility. The formal arrangement between the facility and the part-time consulting
veterinarian shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the research facility.
Correct by April 30, 2014.
