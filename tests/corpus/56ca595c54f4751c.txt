Sec. 2.126 b
A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
***On Tuesday, February 17, 2016, between approximately 10:50 AM and 11:20 AM, a responsible person was not
available to conduct an inspection. The inspector called and was able to speak with the licensee. The licensee was
out of state and didn't have any other adult available for inspection. This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
To be corrected immediately.
