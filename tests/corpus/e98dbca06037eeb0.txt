* One plastic bottle containing Pyrantel wormer has no written directions on how this drug is to be given and at
what rate it is to be administered. In addition, a recorded expiration date was missing from the label. This drug is
intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and is therefore ready for use.
Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the contents and
dosage rates of the container can be known with certainty and not used past their expiration date. The effectiveness
of the dosage level and expected results could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated if the
expiration date is unknown. The licensee must ensure that all medications are labeled with dosing instructions
specific for the species of animals. In addition, an expiration date must be recorded on the label. Correct by
7/28/15.

animals including any offspring born at the facility. Correct by 7/28/15.
