2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
9 CFR 2.40(b)(3) requires that timely and accurate information related to animal health problems be conveyed to
the attending veterinarian.
A four-year-old female reindeer known as "Ruby" was observed to have a slightly swollen left eye that had a bluish,
cloudy appearance. A moist brown discharge was observed underneath the left eye. The animal was blinking and
squinting the left eye intermittently. Although the licensee had noticed the issue two days ago, the licensee had not
consulted the attending veterinarian.
Frequent communications with the attending veterinarian helps to mitigate the effects of adverse health conditions.
Untreated conditions can lead to painful situations and can impact the reindeer's overall health. Early intervention is
key. Eye abnormalities can affect vision and health of the reindeer, and can be indicative of disease or injury.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
