2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1235 on
27-Jun-18. I went to the licensee's house. I knocked on the door. No one answered. I honked my car horn. I then
contacted the licensee by phone. His voicemail was full and I was unable to leave a message. I waited 30 minutes
and then left the property.
End of report.
