Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A 12-week-old male red fox had an approximately 1-1.5 inch round area of hair loss with crusting on the front aspect of
his right carpus. Another 12-week-old male red fox had 2 irregular shaped spots, approximately ¼ - ½ inch long, with hair
loss and crusting on the top of his nose. A 6-week-old male red fox had generalized hair loss and crusting on the top of
his head, just above his eyes, with scabbing present.

The tip of the right ear of one male cavy was affected with fly strike. The cavy was observed to be flicking his ear during
inspection. The tip of the ear was hairless with thickened skin and split open with a wound. Bloody skin could be seen.
Flies were observed in the wound. The attending veterinarian previously prescribed methods to address fly strike however
the licensee had not recently applied the product.

Medical problems must be identified and communicated to the attending veterinarian so that a diagnosis can be
determined, and treatment implemented. Failure to observe medical problems and/or communicate those problems to a
veterinarian can result in prolonged pain, suffering, and even death. The facility representative must observe all animals
daily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with a veterinarian so that timely and accurate


information on problems of health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed.

Facilities, general.
On May 30th, 2021, one male wallaby escaped from its enclosure. The animal was missing for 48 hours before being
captured and returned. All outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be designed and maintained to
contain the animals.
3.126(b)

Facilities, indoor.
A strong ammonia odor was present in the hedgehog house and front room of the barn. Excessive ammonia odors can
cause eye and respiratory irritation leading to unnecessary animal pain and suffering for the animals living in the facility.
Indoor housing facilities shall be adequately ventilated by natural or mechanical means to provide for the health and well-
being of the animals at all times. Such facilities shall be provided with fresh air and ventilated so as to minimize drafts,
odors, and moisture condensation.

Facilities, outdoor.
The licensee has a red kangaroo, 2 Patagonian cavy, 3 African crested porcupines, and 2 zebu housed outside without a
perimeter fence surrounding the primary enclosures.
On or after May 17, 2000, all outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter


fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 6 feet high for non-
dangerous animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it protects
the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having
contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in
the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between
animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such fences less than 3 feet in distance
from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the administrator.
A perimeter fence, at least 6 feet tall, must be erected no less than 3' away from the primary enclosure to prevent
unauthorized persons and other animals from having contact with the animals held at the facility. This fence can also
function as a secondary containment in case an animal escapes from the primary enclosure. A perimeter fence variance
can also be requested.

Watering.
Two artic fox did not have water in their enclosure. When the licensee provided water both animals drank ravenously for
at least one minute. The lack of water can cause dehydration, distress, heat, and even death. The licensee must ensure
that potable water is provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. This was corrected prior to
the end inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
