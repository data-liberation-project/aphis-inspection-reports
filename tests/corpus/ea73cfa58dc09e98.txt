2.4 Critical

Non-interference with APHIS officials.
During the inspection, the licensee knowingly provided USDA Officials false information regarding the veterinary care for
certain animals and fraudulent documentation of a program of veterinary care. USDA Officials identified a female
Geoffroy’s cat with generalized hair loss on the left side of its body, a squinting right eye and a small, scabbed wound
within a dime sized area of alopecia over the right eye. The licensee stated that he had taken the cat to be examined by
the AV for the generalized hair loss a few months ago. He said the attending veterinarian attributed the hair loss to
behavioral issues associated with the loss of the animal’s male partner. Later discussions with the AV contradicted the
licensee’s claims; she had not evaluated the cat and the licensee had not contacted her regarding this animal. The
licensee stated that his attending veterinarian conducts regular site visits and that those visits usually take about an hour.
This was difficult to believe since the inspection with USDA Officials took approximately over 2 hours just to view all the
animals on the property. The attending veterinarian later denied that the licensee regularly requests annual site visits and
that she is usually called for the occasional animal wound or abnormality. Furthermore, the licensee stated that his AV
had observed an obese male jaguar several times and suggested that the solution was to cut back his diet. The AV
explained that she had been called to the facility one evening to evaluate an injured male lion and had never physically
seen an obese male jaguar. The licensee had mentioned in passing that he believed the animal was overweight, and she


suggested the first start would be to cut back his diet. No further follow up or thorough examination was conducted by the
AV. Ultimately, discussions with the AV revealed that she had not been given a program of veterinary care to review and
sign in over two years. The agreement as explained by the AV was that the licensee was supposed to alert the
veterinarian whenever he acquired a new species of animal that was not included on the current program of veterinary
care. She would then create a PVC specific to the new species. This review had not been conducted in approximately two
years. Therefore, the PVCs provided during previous inspections have been fraudulently provided to USDA inspectors for
a variety of species that the licensee has recently acquired. Furthermore, the licensee asked the AV if a veterinary student
were to create the PVC, would she feel comfortable reviewing it and signing off. The AV agreed to that suggestion but has
yet to receive a PVC to review.
Knowingly providing false information and fraudulent programs of veterinary care impedes USDA Officials ability to
accurately assess animal welfare as well as the facility’s ability to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals in its
possession. Not only are these actions in violation of this section, but they also impede the working relationship between
the licensee and the inspector. From this point forward, the licensee must cooperate with the inspection procedure.
2.40 Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During a follow-up discussion with the attending veterinarian, the AV admitted that she had not reviewed or signed any
programs of veterinary care for the licensee in over two years. USDA Officials reviewed the licensee’s program of
veterinary care for the species listed on the property – specifically the sections regarding the spotted hyena and the
prairie dogs. The licensee stated that the attending veterinarian had reviewed and created these documents for these
recent animal acquisitions. The suggested vaccination schedule included a yearly rabies vaccine; when USDA Officials
asked if the attending veterinarian was comfortable with him giving vaccines, the licensee replied “Yes.”
During the inspection, USDA Official identified a female Geoffroy’s cat with generalized hair loss on the left side of its


body, a squinting right eye and a small, scabbed wound within a dime sized area of alopecia over the right eye. The
licensee stated that he had taken the cat to be examined by the AV for the generalized hair loss a few months ago. He
said the attending veterinarian attributed the hair loss to behavioral issues associated with the loss of the animal’s male
partner. The licensee admitted that the eye abnormality was new and had not been identified previously. Later
discussions with the AV contradicted the licensee’s claims; she had not evaluated the cat and the licensee had not
contacted her regarding this animal. Furthermore, two geriatric female tigers were observed with ocular issues, neurologic
signs and slim body weights. The licensee was asked if a quality-of-life discussion regarding these two animals had taken
place with the attending veterinarian; the licensee did not respond. When asked if the attending veterinarian had been
contacted regarding an obese male jaguar, the licensee explained that she had seen the animal several times and simply
suggested cutting back the jaguar’s diet. The licensee further commented that he had reached out to other facilities
exhibiting the jaguar’s siblings and said that those siblings also had weight issues. The attending veterinarian later
explained that she had never physically examined a male jaguar but did admit that the licensee had asked her what he
should do for an obese jaguar. She suggested cutting back his diet but was never asked to conduct a physical evaluation
or thorough workup for the animal.
Most importantly, discussions with the attending veterinarian identified a complete lack of communication between the
licensee and the attending veterinarian regarding proper veterinary care, nutritional and supplementation requirements,
internal and external parasite control, and other aspects of animal care and use. The licensee does not have regularly
scheduled visits by the attending veterinarian to the premises and routinely disregards the AV’s medical advice. For
example, the licensee previously contacted the attending veterinarian regarding a limping cougar. The AV requested that
the licensee bring the animal into her clinic; however, the animal was never transported to the clinic. No follow up
information regarding the animal’s condition was communicated to the attending veterinarian. Additionally, the AV feels


that the licensee’s current facility is not conducive for performing proper routine physical examinations that would
necessitate sedation and immobilization. There are no squeeze chutes or small lock outs where an animal could be safely
sedated and evaluated. Conversely, the licensee is unable to transport the larger and more dangerous animals to the
veterinary clinic for necessary medical care.
An authentic & current written program of veterinary care was not available for inspection. Abiding by a program of
veterinary care that has not been reviewed and approved by the facility’s attending veterinarian withholds adequate
veterinary care from animals in the facility’s care. Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal
arrangements that include a program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor.
Additionally, the exhibitor shall assure that the AV has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary
care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. The exhibitor shall provide the availability of
appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services to comply with the provisions of this subchapter. A mechanism
of direct and frequent communication must be maintained so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal
health, behavior, and well-being must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

neck. There was not an identifiable and effective public barrier in the video.
USDA Officials showed the licensee an assortment of these social media photos with individuals handling big cats over
the age of 12 weeks. The licensee admitted that the facility occasionally uses volunteers with previous exotic animal
experience but could not provide any documentation of their previous experience or volunteer paperwork. One of the
more frequent volunteers was identified by the licensee as a veterinary student at the local CVM and had a provisional
permit to work under the licensee’s state permit. After speaking with admissions at the local CVM, this individual was
identified as an undergraduate pre-veterinary student with no formal veterinary training. The second frequent volunteer


has over 5 years of experience as a zookeeper at a USDA regulated facility. There was no paperwork identifying
experience requirements for these volunteers, their duties and responsibilities or any SOPs for handling and interacting
with the animals on the premises. The licensee also admitted that some of the individuals depicted in the social media
photos are former or current employees of other USDA regulated facilities but are not employees or volunteers for Single
Vision. Furthermore, the licensee allows family members, personal friends and other exotic animal exhibitors to interact
with dangerous animals over 12 weeks of age without being under the direct control of a knowledgeable and experienced
animal handler. At approximately 12 weeks of age, dangerous animals, such as tigers, lions, bears, and wolves become
too big, too fast and too strong to be used public contact.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so that there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public
with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of
animals and the public. The facility should ensure the well-being of both parties by not allowing members of the public to
handle potentially dangerous animals. Additionally, the facility’s volunteers and/or employees should be readily identifiable
and have the appropriate documentation showing their training/experience with handling dangerous animals.
Correct prior to the next public interaction.
3.125 Repeat

Facilities, general.
USDA Officials identified several enclosures in need of repair.
• There was an exposed metal fence sub-floor in many of animal enclosures on the property. Some portions of the fence
were flush with the sand/dirt while others left metal protrusions exposed due to the changes in substrate height.
Enclosures housing two new guinea singing dogs, two wolves, one spotted hyena, five ringtail lemurs, one jaguar and
cougar, one leopard, two African crested porcupines, two tigers, a jaguar and lion, and the two exercise yards have areas
in need of attention.


• An enclosure housing one coatimundi had a wooden platform where one of the edges had come apart from the 2x4
below. There was an exposed screw still in the 2x4.
• An enclosure housing one kinkajou had an exposed screw approximately 2 inches in length positioned down from the
wooden board above. The screw was meant to hold a climbing branch in place but the branch had broken free.
• An enclosure housing five ringtail lemurs contained a wooden platform that was separating from its base. The plywood
portion of the platform was deteriorating from exposure to the elements and animals. There were also two long
(approximately 2in) screws sticking out of the 2x4 portion of the platform.
• An enclosure housing one Geoffroy’s cat had a wooden platform with a worn away section in front of the den opening.
Portions of the wood 2x4 were completely scratched away leaving splintered holes.
• An enclosure housing a tiger and lion had a den box with a small bottom corner section of its plywood missing.
• An enclosure housing one black leopard had a den box with a section of its plywood roof caved in. The roof the den no
longer provided adequate protection from the elements.
• An enclosure housing two bears, one tiger and a lion had a loose door hinge on the door to the enclosure. The top two
hinges were still intact and two metal chains were being used as additional security measures; however, the door stood
slightly ajar.
• One of the two den boxes for two African Crested Porcupines had a small hole in the plywood that appears to have been
chewed away. Additionally, approximately 75% of the substrate of the enclosure had been dug away exposing the metal
wire subfloor. The openings of the wire were approximately 2in by 4in and posed an entrapment risk.
• An enclosure housing 3 silver foxes and 1 red fox had sections of the metal wire subfloor exposed due to the animals
digging. The openings of the wire were approximately 2in by 4in and posed an entrapment risk.
• The licensee currently houses an adolescent female spotted hyena within his personal residence. The animal has free


access to the home when the licensee is home. There are numerous dangers in a house setting that can cause harm
and/or death including exposed electrical cords and many chewing surfaces that could potentially become foreign body
concerns.
Exposed screws and defective wood pose injury hazards to the animals that have access to these defects. Loose door
hinges affect the enclosures’ integrity and its ability to safely contain the animals. The facility must be constructed of such
material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be
structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
Appropriate housing for the species must be provided and maintained to prevent injury or death to the animals possessed
by the licensee.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
USDA Officials identified two areas in need of additional cleaning. An enclosure housing two oriental small-clawed otters
had an accumulation of feces, mud and leftover food portions behind the den box. The two small holes in the enclosures
that acted as a drainage system were clogged and did not allow the accumulations to flow out during hose downs.
Additionally, an enclosure housing a Geoffroy’s cat had a build up of feces and leftover food products directly adjacent to
the den box outside of the enclosure fence. This had attracted numerous flying insects to the location.
All enclosures shall be kept clean to reduce odors, disease hazards, and reduce pests.
