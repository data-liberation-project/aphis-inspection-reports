A female Pomeranian (tag ID# 139) has a buildup of a dark brown material on her teeth. The material is encasing
at least half the surface of the upper canine teeth and the entire surface of the cheek teeth on both sides of the
mouth. The gums have become moderately reddened and are pulling away from the upper cheek teeth. This dog
also has a swollen area on the front side of her neck directly beneath the jaw.
Poor dental health can cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as, lead to further health issues. Overgrown
toenails could also cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as affect the dog’s natural gait.
The above mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the

3.1(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the building housing the Pomeranians, there are four enclosures constructed of metal and the metal has rusted.
The rust has caused the surface of the metal to become rough and to flake away. There are four dogs housed in
these enclosures.All of the enclosures housing the thirteen large breed dogs have fencing constructed of metal panels. The metal on
all the panels has become excessively rusty. The rust has caused the surface of the metal to become rough and to
flake away.
Excessive rust does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of the surface and may also affect the surface’s
structural strength. All housing facilities must be kept free of excessive rust. The licensee must replace the rusted
surfaces, or alter them in a manner, that eliminates the rust and allows for adequate cleaning and sanitization of the
surface and ensures that structural strength is maintained.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing five beagles is constructed of wire flooring. Piles of old feces are sitting on the wire and
trapped within the wire. The feces appear dried and have a grey color. The facility representative stated that the
feces are not removed every day. Buildup of old feces could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.
Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot cleaned daily. The licensee must remove all the
feces from the enclosure at least once every day, or more often, if the feces begin to buildup in order to promote the
health and well-being of the dogs.
Correction date: From this day forward
