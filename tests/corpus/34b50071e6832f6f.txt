RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
While reviewing the records it was noted that the following animals: 1 pot belly pig, 2 coatimundis, and 3 prairie
dogs, are no longer on the premise. However, there is no documentation present as to whom these animals were
sold / donated too. In speaking with Ms. Bardin, over the phone, she did tell me that the Canadian lynx had passed
away in Oct 2013. However there was no documentation on the premise at this time. All records need to be kept
current and accurate.
***To Be Corrected By: February 20, 2014 - This item still has time to correct.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
On the previous inspection (2/11/14) it was noted that the male lion and female cougar were extremely thin. The
attending veterinarian has been out to the facility since the previous direct noncompliance and evaluated the
condition of these two animals. In regards to their diets and feeding schedule, the attending vet has made
recommendations for this facility to follow. Due to the fact that the animals are still significantly thin, this will remain
a noncompliant item. The food shall be wholesome and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain the
animals in good health.
***To Be Corrected By: April 30, 2014 or until the attending vet determines that they are within their normal weight
ranges - whichever comes first.
An exit briefing was conducted with a representative of the licensee.
