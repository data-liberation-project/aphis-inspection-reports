The licensee stated that she uses Clorox to disinfectant guinea pigs enclosures, but does not use a detergent prior
to using the disinfectant. The use of a detergent is necessary to clean enclosures of organic matter before applying
the disinfectant. Lack of an effective sanitation program exposes the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards such
as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Correct by ensuring that all organic matter is removed with a detergent
solution prior to disinfection. An effective cleaning and sanitation program is necessary to minimize the risk of
