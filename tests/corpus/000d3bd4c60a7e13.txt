2.40(a) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The store employee could not locate or produce the program of vet care for review. When the facility has a
consultant arrangement with a vet there must be a written program of vet care and regularly scheduled visits to the
facility to assess the health and overall care of the animals. This documentation needs to be kept at the facility and
in a location that is easily accessible for review during the inspection process.
2.76(a) REPEAT
RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
*** The store employee could not locate the records of animals on hand or the recent acquisition records (mini pigs,
hedgehogs) or disposition records for animals that have been sold since last year. These records are an important
part of the record keeping requirement to track the movement of the animals. These records need to be maintained
in a timely and accurate manner and stored in a location that is easily accessible for review during the inspection
process.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** The sugar gliders for sale in the store are being housed in tiered enclosures. Tiered enclosures do not provide
sufficient space for adequate freedom of movement to allow the gliders to glide. Gliding is a normal postural
adjustment and these animals need to be moved to enclosures that allow this.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
*** In the main store area, the area around the sugar gliders needs to be cleaned. There are droppings on the
shelves below where food is stored and there is an un-used bird cage that is dirty with dust and debris. The area
needs to be kept clean to facilitate good husbandry and housekeeping practices. *** The area behind the sugar gliders in the back room needs to be cleaned as well as their exercise wheels. These
areas also need to be kept clean for the health of the animals.
