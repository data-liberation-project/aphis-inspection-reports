FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An eleven year old male Thomson's gazelle named "Fodder" was able to escape his primary enclosure. Fodder
sustained injuries which included two abrasions to the gazelle's legs and a jaw injury. The zoo's exhibit design team
inspected the enclosure thoroughly and found no obvious exhibit failures. The zoo determined that all gates were
closed and electric wire was on at the time of escape. All primary enclosure fences should be constructed in order
to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by October 20,2016
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Director Of Animals and Conservation.
