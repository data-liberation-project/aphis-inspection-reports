2.40(b)(3) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Animals housed in outdoor exhibits were not observed on 3 holidays when only one staff member was on duty, to ensure
that staff were not working alone outside. Daily observation of all animals is necessary to assess health and safety of
animals, and to communicate in a timely manner with the attending veterinarian if matters of health must be conveyed.
The facility must ensure that all animals are observed daily.

Correct from this inspection forward.
2.75(b)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Acquisition records for two opossums acquired on 10/16/21 were not complete, and lacked required information such as
address and additional identifying information (vehicle or drivers license) for the source from whom the animals were
acquired, and the record of animals on hand was incorrect, containing multiple previously deceased or released animals.
Exhibitors are required to keep these records to ensure that origin and disposition of animals in their care can be tracked.
The facility must ensure that this information is available at the time of inspection.



Correct from this inspection forward.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
A tree of approximately 4 inches in trunk diameter was in contact with the red fox enclosure fence, and multiple larger tree
trunks were adjacent to the coyote enclosure, potentially providing a route of entrance for wild animals. Facility
enclosures must be secure to prevent access by wild animals that could adversely affect the health and safety of the
animals on exhibit. The facility must maintain outdoor housing facilities to protect the animals from potential injury.

Correct by January 18, 2021.
3.129(a)

Feeding.
In the refrigerator designated for diets for the bear, multiple sweet potatoes with white fluffy growth on them, severely
bruised pears, and a crate of eggs past the expiration date of 11/21/21 were present. Food must be wholesome,
palatable, and free from contamination to ensure that it will maintain animals in good health. The facility must ensure that
the food fed to the bear is unspoiled and free from contamination.

Corrected during the inspection.
