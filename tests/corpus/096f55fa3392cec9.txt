3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Most of the enclosures in the outdoor facility contained greater than a day's worth of fecal material. In most of the
enclosures, it appeared that the amount of fecal material present made it difficult for the animals to avoid walking in
it. According to the licensee, the outdoor facility may have last been scheduled for the feces to be picked up on
Saturday. Floors made of dirt, gravel, grass or other similar material must be raked or spot-cleaned with sufficient
frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta. Hard surfaces with which the dogs come
in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent
accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. The licensee must remove the accumulated fecal material
from these enclosures and ensure that all excreta is removed daily from primary enclosures to prevent soiling of the
dogs contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. To be
corrected by: January 18, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
