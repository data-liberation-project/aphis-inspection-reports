ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The total of 4 animals were in need of veterinary care during this inspection. This includes:
1) Pen #46, A mostly black guinea pig had an opaque, white spot centered on the left eye, covering approximately
90%, the right eye had a small (approximately 10%) white spot near upper side and centered on eye, and all four
feet had overgrown toe nails.
The abnormal condition of the eyes described above can result from a variety of causes including injury and
disease. When left untreated, eye problems can result in impairment of vision, loss of eye, or potentially painful
conditions.
2) Pen #63, a white guinea pig had thinning hair on both sides of body.
3&4) Pen #66, two guinea pigs (one predominately tan with some white, second tan and white) had thinning hair on
both sides of body.
Caretaker reported treatment of the guinea pigs with hair loss approximately one week previously. There were no
records of guinea pigs receiving treatment or a diagnosis. Caretaker had not previously noted the guinea pig with
the white eyes. The licensee must establish and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat injuries and diseases. The guinea pig with the eye
problem needs to be examined by attending veterinarian and treated appropriately. Treatment records and
associated documentation of examinations or treatment need to be maintained for review by APHIS officials.

2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One animal was found in need of veterinary care at the time of inspection (as described above, guinea pig with the
eye problem). The licensee failed to identify the affected animal prior to USDA inspection. There was no
documentation to indicate that the licensee discussed any of the animals previously identified in need of veterinary
care with the Attending Veterinarian to ensure that appropriate measures were implemented to provide care for the
other animals. All licensees are required to use adequate methods for daily observation so that animals with health
problems are identified quickly. Additionally, there must be a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with
the attending veterinarian (AV) so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being are conveyed and proper care can be directed by the AV and provided by the licensee in an appropriate
manner. Failure to make effective daily observations to properly identify animals in need of care and then
communicate those findings to the AV in a timely manner delays care and results in unnecessary animal suffering.
Correct by ensuring that adequate daily observations are being conducted and that there is a mechanism for direct
and frequent communication with the AV from this point forward. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner's wife.
