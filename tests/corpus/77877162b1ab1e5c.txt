2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is not maintaining records of the number of animals on hand or the number of dead animals. A total of 255
adult guinea pigs, weanlings, and newborns were counted during this inspection.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.
