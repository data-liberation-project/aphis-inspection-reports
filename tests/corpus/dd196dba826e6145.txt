2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Poodle, mc#0A02601063, was observed in her enclosure shaking her head and scratching at both of her ears.
Upon closer observation both of her ears have a dark colored discharge causing some matting of the hair. The ear canal
was hard to visualize but the areas that could be seen were red and slightly inflamed. This could be a medical condition.
Upon further observation this dogs upper teeth on both sides have a heavy accumulation of plaque and tartar buildup.
Some of the back molars are completely encased. The lower back molars on both sides also have a heavy accumulation
of plaque and tartar. Dental issues can be painful and lead to other systemic health issues.
The licensee must have this dog seen by a veterinarian for a diagnosis and treatment plan.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
