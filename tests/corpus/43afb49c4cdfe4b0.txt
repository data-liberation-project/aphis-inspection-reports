FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Bananas were being stored outdoors, in an unprotected manner, while they were being ripened.
Several boxes of bananas were on a table behind the food prep kitchen, outdoors. There were items that needed to
be discarded underneath the table, such as empty feed bags, a cardboard box, and a stack of deteriorating laundry
baskets. Geckos were seen on tome of the bananas.
Food should be stored in a manner that prevents contact with vermin. Food storage areas should be free of debris
that could create habitat for vermin.
To be corrected immediately.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
