Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult white, tan, and brown guinea pig was observed to have a right eye that is markedly shrunken to the extent where
it is approximately 50% obscured by the third eyelid. The portion of the eye that is still visible was opaque and discolored
white/yellow/red.

In a separate pen, an adult black, tan, and white guinea was observed to have a right eye that is markedly dry with a
blade of straw and bits of grass adhered to it. The upper eyelid of this eye has two small spots of ulcerated skin and is
swollen in appearance.

In a subsequent discussion with the licensee, he stated that he had previously noticed the eye issues in both guinea pigs
but had not contacted the Attending Veterinarian regarding treatment.

Licensees are required to have a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with their Attending Veterinarian so
that timely and accurate information on animal health issues can be addressed. Failure to do so can cause the animals
pain or even lead to death when conditions are left untreated. Correct by having both animals examined by the Attending


Veterinarian so that proper treatment can be administered and by maintaining communication with the Attending
Veterinarian regarding all future animal health concerns.

Sanitation.
Two of the guinea pig enclosures had an accumulation of wet bedding and fecal material on the wire mesh directly under
the water spigots. The bedding surrounding the water spigots was also wet.

Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of feces or debris, including wet bedding.
Failure to do so can lead to illness if the guinea pigs avoid the water or have to stand in wet bedding in order to drink.

Correct by cleaning the areas under the water spigots and removing wet bedding as often as necessary.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
