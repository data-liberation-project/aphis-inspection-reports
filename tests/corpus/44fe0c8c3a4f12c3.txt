Two male goats a LaMancha and French Alpine were being treated for head wounds received as the result of a fight. The
Vetericyn spray being used expired May of 2019. The use of expired drugs is not an appropriate method to prevent or
treat injury or illness. The efficacy of these products beyond their expiration date is uncertain. Use of these drugs could
lead to failure to prevent or treat illness causing animal harm and suffering.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
-Two male goats a LaMancha and French Alpine were being treated for head wounds received as the result of a fight.
The Vetericyn spray being used expired May of 2019. The French Alpine goat also has a left ear which is swollen, crusty
and the tip of the ear is deteriorated in appearance. This ear was noticed by facility personnel yesterday. Treatment with
antibiotics was not started as no one at the facility felt comfortable giving a penicillin injection to the goat which was
requested by the facility executive director who was out of town. The goat was given 8 meloxicam pills at the direction of
the facility executive director. The condition of this goat was not communicated with the attending veterinarian. There
must be a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian and timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being must be communicated to the attending veterinarian.
Delays in proper treatment can lead to unnecessary suffering for this goat. The condition of this goat must be

communicated to the attending veterinarian and if necessary veterinary examination and treatment must be provided.

-There is an intact male LaMancha goat with hair loss on its sides and shoulders. The skin appears to be scaly. At the
time of the last inspection on 10-5-21 the inspectors contacted the attending veterinarian and the AV noted that she had
seen the goat recently and felt that its condition was improving. This goat’s condition has remained unchanged since the
last inspection conducted on 10-5-21. The facility executive director stated to inspectors that she has not communicated
the condition of this goat to the facility attending veterinarian. It has been three months since the time of the last
inspection and the attending veterinarian has not been aware of the unchanged condition of this goat. Issues such as this
may not need to remain unresolved and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is key in helping to
address the condition and prevent animal discomfort. The condition of this goat must be communicated to the attending
veterinarian and if necessary veterinary examination and treatment must be provided.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Executive Director.
