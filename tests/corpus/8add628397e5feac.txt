OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is not a sufficient perimeter fence around the enclosure housing ring-tailed lemurs. Lack of perimeter fence
does not protect the animals by restricting unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from having contact with
the animals housed at the facility. Also, without a perimeter fence there is no secondary containment system. A six
foot high perimeter fence must be provided for this enclosures to keep unauthorized people and animals from
coming in contact with the animals on exhibit and provide a secondary containment system in the event of an
escape.
