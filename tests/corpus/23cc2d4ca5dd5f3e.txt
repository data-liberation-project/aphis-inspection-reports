3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are several food receptacles being used to feed the dogs in the outdoor housing portion that have
accumulations of dirt and grime in and around the food bowl area. Dirty food receptacles can lead to an increase in
disease transmission. All food receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more
often to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease hazards. Correct by 10
November 2014.
