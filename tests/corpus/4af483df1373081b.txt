2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The licensee has not demonstrated adequate experience, knowledge and training to maintain this adult cougar. The
animal is currently handled by a two lead system using a primary handler and a secondary handler, with another
primary handler available by radio. The lead system is being utilized to move the animal from the enclosure to the
stage area, which serves as an exercise pen. The facility still has not completed training and gained experience
maintaining and handling adult cougars. Failure to handle the animal properly will increase the risk of harm to the
animal or to the public, or may lead to potential escape. This facility must either hire an individual who has the
necessary handling experience and knowledge, or obtain the necessary experience themselves before continuing to
maintain and handle the animal in this manner (by the lead system). This remains uncorrected.
(This was a focused inspection with the licensee, Joe Kovach, ACI and Dr. Hammel).
