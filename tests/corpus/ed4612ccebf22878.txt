3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the Jacobs sheep enclosure, two separate sections of wire fence were detached from the adjacent support post
leaving a section curling up with multiple exposed sharp points. One section was located next to the water trough,
and the second was along the fence line in the main pasture. The second area contained a splintered off board with
sharp points and a board close by had screws protruding with sharp points. A loose board was on the ground
aproximately 2x2x18 inches that had 4 exposed nails. These were potential sources of injury to the enclosed
animals. Fencing and other structures must be maintained in good repair to ensure the animals are safely contained
within their enclosure.
Licensee repaired all sharp points in this enclosure during the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
