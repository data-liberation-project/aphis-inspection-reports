2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility does not currently have accessible records which fully and correctly disclose the required information about
the monkeys that are owned. Records that include information about the acquisition of each monkey (date of acquisition
and name and address and USDA license number or Drivers License number/vehicle tag number of the person from
whom animal was acquired along with species information about the monkey) must be maintained to allow for legal and
medical tracing and identification of each monkey. The APHIS Form 7019 may be used to keep this information. The
facility shall make, keep and maintain records or forms that fully and correctly disclose all the required information
concerning each of the monkeys. Correct by 9/30/22.
3.75(a)

Housing facilities, general.
The door to the indoor housing portion of the sheltered housing at the house has had damage to the bottom of the
wooden door leaving a hole approximately 3/4 in wide x 6 inches long. This hole is large enough to allow snakes and
pests to enter the indoor housing. The licensee states that several snakes have been seen/caught outside this building
this summer. Snake bites are injurious and may even be toxic to the monkeys. The facility shall repair the hole in the door.
Correct by 9/4/22.


3.84(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
A couple of housekeeping issues are in need of attention.
*The AC vents in the indoor portion of the monkey housing at the house are dirty with lots of visible debris and dust
covering the vents which may restrict airflow.
*The outside portion of the three monkey enclosures on the side of the house facing west have an overgrowth of weeds in
the enclosure. The weeds are thick enough to make daily cleaning difficult and may attract unwanted insects such as
ticks.
Regular housekeeping of the buildings and grounds is necessary in order to protect the monkeys from injury, to facilitate
husbandry practices and reduce/eliminate breeding and living areas for pests. The vents need to be cleaned and the
weeds need to be controlled.
Correct by 9/30/22.
