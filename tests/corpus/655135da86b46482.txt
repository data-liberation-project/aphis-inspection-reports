3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the puppy section of the white building, the first enclosure has walls made of vinyl plastic. Along the back wall of
this enclosure the vinyl has broken into a sharp edge and has bent inward towards the female English bulldog and
her puppies. In the other section of the white building, one enclosure, housing three English bulldogs, has the sharp
ends of screws penetrating the dividing walls into the enclosure. In the barn, one enclosure, housing two English
bulldogs, has dividing walls made of vinyl plastic that has broken into a sharp edge and has twisted inwards towards
the dogs.
Sharp points and edges pose an injury risk to the dogs. All sharp points and edges must be removed or repaired in
order to eliminate the injury risk to the dogs.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.Throughout both the white building and the barn, most the rubber food pans have been chewed by the dogs. The
chewing has caused the edges of the pans to become torn, jagged, and allows dirt and grime to penetrate the
surface of the rubber. This damage does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of the pans. The rubber
food pans need to be replaced or altered in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization of the pans
every two weeks.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the barn and the puppy area of the white building there is an excessive number of flies on the walls of the
enclosures, in the bowls of food, and on the dogs. The presence of excessive flies increases the risk of food
contamination and disease hazards towards the dogs. An effective program of pest control must be established
and maintained to reduce contamination of animal areas by flies and other pests in order to protect the health of the
animals.
