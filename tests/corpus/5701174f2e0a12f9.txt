2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female golden doodle (microchip # 900164001503627) requires a teeth cleaning. At the time of the dog's yearly physical
the Attending Veterinarian (AV) indicated that the dog had tartar build up on her teeth and that she needed to have her
teeth cleaned. The licensee has not yet made any arrangements to have the dog's teeth cleaned. Tartar build up on the
teeth can cause infections of the gums and a painful mouth if not removed. The licensee must have make arrangements
with the AV to have the dog's teeth cleaned. Correct by November 4, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
