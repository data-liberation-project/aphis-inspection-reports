ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:40 pm on
12-APR-17.
I knocked on front door; no answer. I walked around to side door and rang bell twice and knocked again; no
answer. I got back in GOV and honked horn twice. I called licensee's number that was in ACIS and it had been
disconnected. I waited a little over 30 minutes and placed my business card in the mail box. Licensee called me
later that evening and gave me her new telephone number and hours that are most conducive for inspections. I
posted these in ACIS along with detailed instructions on how to find the premises.
