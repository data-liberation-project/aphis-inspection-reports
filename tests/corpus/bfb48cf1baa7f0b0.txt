ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** Inspectors observed a bottle of Gentamicin eye drops with an expiration date of September 2014, a bottle of
Conzol spray with an expiration date of March 2010 and a bottle of Cephalexin with no expiration date listed on the
label that was in a drawer with medications ready for use in the animals. Expired medications may be contaminated,
may not work as expected, and could harm the animals if used. All medications used on the animals must not be
expired. Licensee must ensure that all medications maintained for and used on the animals are not expired.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** Inspectors observed areas in need of cleaning and sanitization. The shelter buildings behind the house had a
buildup of hair and dirt on the back wall and underneath the enclosures. Also, the shelter building behind the house
had cob webs and hair accumulated under a shelf above the enclosures. The dog doors throughout the the facility
had a build up of dirt and oils on the surface leaving a brown residue. In order to protect the dogs from disease
hazards, to prevent the dogs from becoming soiled, and to facilitate good husbandry practices, hard surfaces which
the dogs have contact with must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least every two weeks. The licensee must
spot clean, sanitize and maintain all other surfaces as needed to satisfy generally acceptable husbandry standards.
3.1(f) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The south building used for whelping had a waste disposal pipe in disrepair. The outside drain pipe on the south
side of the building did not fit into the washdown properly resulting in waste contaminating the enclosure below the
drain pipe. The drain pipe is also leaking under the bottom washdown resulting in waste accumulating on the
ground. Drainage systems in disrepair can contribute to disease hazards, odors and pest. The licensee must repair
the drainage system.
3.4(b) REPEATOUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
** Two enclosures had igloo type shelters that are not large enough to allow the animals in the enclosures to make
normal postural adjustments. The enclosure with two Spaniels must have an additional shelter provided or a larger
shelter provided. The enclosure containing a Labrador type dog must have a large shelter provided. Shelters must
be large enough to allow each animal to sit, stand, and lie in a normal, as well as turn about freely. This was
corrected the day of the inspection.
3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
** Inspectors observed broken wire resulting in sharp points inside of no fewer than six animal enclosures. The
animals could come into contact with the sharp points causing injury. The licensee must remove, repair or replace
the wire and develop a maintenance plan to ensure that all enclosures are free of sharp points.
