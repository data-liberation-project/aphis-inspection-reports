2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female white Bichon (Microchip #103820126, DOB 06/23/09) has a section of discolored hair on the lower part of
her left front leg. Closer inspection revealed an approximately 2 centimeter irregularly shaped section of skin that
was mostly hairless. The skin in this area was mildly reddened with small dark spots on the surface of it. This
affected section of skin was also raised and felt firm in some areas and softer in other areas. The hair surrounding
this section of skin was slightly damp. The licensee stated that she had not consulted a veterinarian about the
condition of this dog's leg.
A female Shih Tzu approximately 8 years old (Microchip # 080-876-540) has moderately cloudy eyes. The
cloudiness is irregularly shaped and is present throughout each eye. There is a thick yellow-green discharge with
crusting present on the eyelids of both eyes. The licensee states that she spoke with her attending veterinarian on
January 30th, 2016 regarding this dog's eyes. The veterinarian prescribed an eye medication twice a day for five
days. The licensee states that they have not spoken with the veterinarian regarding this dog since January 30th;
however, they have continued the treatments as initially prescribed by the veterinarian. Although this dog was
initially evaluated by the attending veterinarian, its eye condition has not resolved and the animal needs to be
re-evaluated by a veterinarian to update the treatment plan. This dog also has a severe build-up of a thick, grey/tan
material encasing all of the upper and lower cheek teeth and nearly the entire surface of the canines and front teeth.
The majority of the surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized due to the excessive build-up of the grey/tan
material. All of the gums are moderately red and swollen and in some areas they are pulled back from the teeth.
A female Shih Tzu (Microchip #048-063-513) has cloudy eyes. The surface of the left eye is moderately cloudy and
there are blood vessels running across the surface of the eye from the white of the eye. The right eye is severely
cloudy and nearly the entire surface of the eye has a brown discoloration. There is mild amount of thick brown
discharge and crusting on the eyelids of both eyes. The licensee provided documentation that they noticed a
problem with the eyes on January 26th, 2016, but they have neither treated the animal nor have spoken to a
veterinarian regarding the eyes.
A male Bichon (Microchip # 004375805) has a cloudy right eye. The eye is mildly cloudy throughout the surface of
the eye. There is an excessive amount of clear drainage present on both the top and bottom eyelids. The hair isseverely wet and matted from the drainage. This dog also has a severe build-up of a thick, grey/tan material
encasing all of its upper and lower cheek teeth. The majority of the surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized
due to the excessive build-up of the grey/tan material. All of the gums are severely red and swollen and in some
areas they are pulled back from the teeth. In many areas of the mouth, the gums are bleeding and there is a creamy
discharge present along the gum-line. The licensee states that this dog has not been evaluated by a veterinarian.
Dental, eye and skin conditions such as these can be painful and/or distressful to the animal and may lead to further
health complications. All animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that
an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information,
including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the outdoor section of one enclosure in the "Female Building" the inspectors observed one female Shih Tzu that
was walking in a hesitant/shuffling manner. Physical inspection of the dog revealed no abnormalities and she was
placed back in her enclosure and walked with a normal gait while on the solid surface of the indoor section of her
kennel. When the dog returned to the outdoor section of the enclosure, whose floor is constructed of tenderfoot
flooring, she once again began to walk cautiously. As the inspectors watched, the dog's feet and legs began to fall
through the openings of the tenderfoot flooring. Feet and legs passing through openings in the floor could cause
injury to the dog.
Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from
injury and do not allow the dogs' feet and legs to pass through any openings. The licensee must house this dog in
an enclosure where the openings in the floor are not large enough to allow her feet and legs to pass through. The
licensee must ensure that all flooring in all used primary enclosures is safe for the dogs at all times.
