3.1(f) DIRECT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage
In the sheltered enclosure by the barn housing 1 adult German Shepherd and 1 adult Springer Spaniel, there is a
large area of brown standing water where the snow from the shelter's roof is melting into the outdoor portion of the
enclosure. This area is in front of the entryway to the indoor portion of the enclosure so that the animals have to
walk through it to get indoors. Both of the animals were observed as having muddy water on them. Water inside
the sheltered portion of the enclosure was noted as being frozen solid.
There is an immediate risk of injury or illness due to extreme nighttime temperatures to the dogs housed within, and
contamination to areas around the enclosure unless proper drainage or coverage with dry material is done. Animals
must be moved to a clean, dry area or an adequate means of drainage or coverage with dry material in this
enclosure must be completed by 18 January 2015.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
Two outdoor enclosures housing two dogs each and one sheltered enclosure housing two dogs had more than a
day's worth of feces present. The snow covering the ground in the smaller of the outdoor enclosures was brown in
color from the dogs tracking around the waste.
Failure to remove excreta daily from primary enclosures could increase disease hazards, pests and odors and lead
to soiling of the animals. Remove the feces from these enclosures and maintain daily removal of excreta in all
enclosures to reduce these risks and to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
3.30 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING. One outdoor enclosure and one sheltered enclosure housing 2 dogs in each had watering receptacles with water
that was completely frozen. The water receptacle in the sheltered enclosure had indentions in the ice that indicated
the dogs had been licking the ice in order to get hydration. The licensee indicated that fresh water was provided last
the evening before. In the case of the sheltered enclosure, he stated that water had been added on top of the ice in
the water bucket the evening before as well.
Frozen water can cause teeth to crack or break, can lower core body temperature, and does not provide for an
adequate source of hydration for the animals. Animals must be provided clean, potable, and non frozen water at
least twice per day for one half hour at a time in order to give the animals every opportunity to receive adequate
hydration.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
This was a focused inspection to check on the direct noncompliant item documented on the previous inspection
dated December 29, 2014.
