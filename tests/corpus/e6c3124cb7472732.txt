INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC only meets once a year (September 17, 2014 & September 16, 2015) to review the research facility's
program for the humane care and use of animals. The IACUC does however conduct inspections of one of the
research facility's animal facilities every 6 months. During this time some protocols may be reviewed, and there
may be some review & discussions of the facility's program of humane care & use of animals among the inspectors
during the facility inspection. These facilities inspections, however, are only performed by a subcommittee of 2 or 3
of the 15 IACUC members who eventually approve the subcommittee's facility inspection report. This does not
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct a required 6 month meeting, nor does it completely review the facility's
program for the care and use of animals.
The IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall review at least once every six months the research facility's
program for the humane care and use of animals. An agenda shall be sent to all IACUC members prior to the
meeting which would list the proposed activities that will be reviewed.

2.31(c)(2)INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
One of the registrant's PI has a project with black footed ferrets (that was approved in October 2015) that is
conducted at a nearby federal facility where these animals are studied and housed.
The IACUC has not made a site inspection of these animal facilities, including the animal study areas, during their
February 2, 2016 inspection. The registrant does not receive any inspection reports from the IACUC (if there is
one) at this federal facility to use as a basis for their evaluation.
The IACUC shall inspect, at least every 6 months, all of the research facility's animal facilities, including animal
study areas, where research is being conducted irrespective of who operates, and cares for the animals that the
facility (federal, private, state etc.) has. Alternatively, you may elect to accept the other facility's IACUC semiannual
inspection as a basis for your evaluation if the IACUC approves this method and is comfortable with that IACUC's
procedure of conducting inspections is complying with all applicable AWA regulations and standards.
