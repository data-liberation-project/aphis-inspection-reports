Veterinary care for dogs.
The adult dogs have not been vaccinated for rabies and they have not been sampled for fecal parasites in accordance
with a schedule approved by the Attending Veterinarian. Not having the adult dogs vaccinated against rabies and
sampled for fecal parasites doesn't ensure they are protected against various diseases or parasites that could infect them.
All adult dogs must be vaccinated against rabies and sampled for fecal parasites. Correct by 10/26/22.
