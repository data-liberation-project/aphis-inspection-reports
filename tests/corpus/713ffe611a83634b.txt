ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Many of the non-human primates were singly housed as approved by the IACUC in protocol addendum reviewed
yearly as required. A smaller subset of these were maintained in one section of a potentially multi-section enclosure.
Additional space must be considered as a possible source of enrichment to decrease self-injurious behavior.
Additionally, while every cage had multiple manipulanda, there was no indication that they were being rotated
weekly as described in the enrichment plan to assure novelty. The weekly enrichment log books had periods of
more than a week between notations. while these are additional to the daily enrichment they should be targeted
more frequently rather than less and must also provide novelty. The NHP interaction needs to be recorded to assure
the enrichment is effective.The physical environment in the primary enclosures must be enriched by providing
means of expressing noninjurious species-typical activities. Correct from this point forward.
An exit interview was conducted with the IACUC Chair, and representatives from facility VS and OAWA..
