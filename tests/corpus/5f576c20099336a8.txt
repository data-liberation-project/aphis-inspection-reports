3.6 Primary enclosures (a)(2) (x)
The sheltered building used as a whelping facility has flooring that is constructed of rubber coated, expanded metal.
There were 6 litters of unweaned puppies as young as 1 day of age, that were observed with their feet and legs
falling through the openings in the floor of the enclosures. The licensee had provided a rubber mat or heat pad that
covered a portion of the floor in some of these enclosures. However, there was nothing to prevent these young
puppies from moving to the uncovered portion of the enclosure where many of them had their feet and legs falling
through the openings in the flooring. Young animals that are not provided adequate support can result in an inability
to learn a proper gait and has the potential to cause injury. The licensee shall provide enclosures that have flooring
that does not allow the feet and legs of the animals to pass through any openings in the floor. TO BE CORRECTED

3.11(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
There was an excessive accumulation of feces in the outdoor portion of three enclosures. Both of the housing
facilities at the site are double layered with slatted flooring and wash downs for each level. Some of the fecal
material was dried and the accumulated material was both on top and in between the slatted floor openings. The
feces were so prevalent throughout the flooring that it was difficult for the dogs in those three enclosures to walk
around the outdoor portion of their enclosures without stepping in fecal material. The licensee stated that it had
been "quite awhile, not more than a week" since she had removed feces from the outdoor housing area due to the
winter weather conditions. Accumulations of feces in the enclosures increases the dogs' chances of coming in
contact with contaminated material and therefore poses a health risk for the dogs. The licensee shall remove feces
from the primary enclosures at least once daily. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 2/25/2015
