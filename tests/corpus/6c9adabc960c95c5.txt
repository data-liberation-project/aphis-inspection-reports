Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At time of this inspection the following guinea pigs were identified as needing veterinary care:

Near the front of enclosure # 64, a tri-colored (gray, beige, and white) adult female guinea pig housed with 8 other adults
was noted to be lying on her left side with a severely chewed right rear leg, and a chewed left rear leg. The right rear leg
had bones and tendons exposed and was being cannibalized by two other adult guinea pigs. This guinea pig appeared in
a moribund condition and was unable to move her hind legs. Upon removing the animal from the enclosure the left side of
her body appeared drenched with a hairless reddened area on the left hip area. The injured guinea pig was placed in an
empty enclosure and drank profusely for several minutes.

At the request of the USDA inspectors, licensee contacted the attending veterinarian and scheduled an emergency visit.
The attending veterinarian examined and treated this guinea pig on July 20, 2022.

A white newborn guinea pig in enclosure number 34 was noted to have a closed white eye. The guinea pig appeared to
be eating and drinking normally.


A weanling was found dead in the brown enclosure # 1 housed with 28 other weanling guinea pigs, This enclosure
housing weanlings lacked adequate floor space. A newborn guinea pig was also found dead in a blue enclosure housing
9 adults and 12 newborns.

Failure to conduct adequate daily observations and identify guinea pigs requiring veterinary care can prolong animal
health problems, delay treatment, and prolong distress and suffering. Correct by following the written Program of
Veterinary Care on file, adequately observe guinea pigs daily, separate guinea pigs with health problems, treat animals
according to the veterinarian's instructions and communicate with the attending veterinarian on problems of animal health.

Facilities, general.
Two tri-colored adult guinea pigs were noted to be loose and huddled under racks in the animal building. Brown
enclosure # 2 housing 32 weanlings was noted to have two detached and broken hinges on bottom of the front door with
only one loose wooden fastener on the right side to prevent the door from falling off. The door could easily fall off allowing
the weanlings to be injured from falling approximately 4 feet to the floor .

Housing facilities need to protect the guinea pigs from injury and contain the animals securely. Failure to do so can lead to
injury or death from falls to the floor from upper enclosures, escape from the animal room, or become trapped outside the
enclosure and unable to find water to drink. Correct by ensuring that primary enclosures are properly maintained, prevent
escape, and that loose guinea pigs are recaptured. Remains uncorrected.

Facilities, indoor.

Ventilation. Upon APHIS inspectors arrival to the guinea pig facility at noon, the outside temperature was noted to be 90
degrees Fahrenheit. Three windows and an overhead garage door were open in the guinea pig building. The glass
covering two windows was removed leaving only the window frames. APHIS inspector inquired with the licensee why the
doors and windows were open with an outside temperature of 90 degrees F., and he responded that he did not want turn
on the air conditioner because diesel was $6 a gallon and there haven't been any guinea pig sales for several weeks.

At 12:44 PM the temperature inside the guinea pig room was measured at 87.2. degrees Fahrenheit. Majority of the adult
guinea pigs appeared lethargic and were spread out in their enclosures. Several guinea pig were reluctant to move even
when doors of enclosures were opened. APHIS inspectors informed the second licensee that the temperature was above
85 degrees F. in the animal building and she turned the air conditioner on and windows and doors were closed. The
temperature dropped to 80 degrees F. within 20 minutes with the air conditioner running.

Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must be adequately ventilated to provide the health and comfort of the animals.
The ambient temperature must not rise above 85 degrees F. in the guinea pig room. Temperature was corrected on July
20, 2022.
3.28(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
Two enclosures to the right of the entrance door have unsealed wood surfaces on the inside of the enclosures. The top
enclosure was housing 37 weanlings and the bottom enclosure was housing 15 adult guinea pigs with 3 offspring.
Unsealed wood cannot be adequately cleaned or properly sanitized, retains odors, and allows the absorption of liquids
and moisture. In addition, unsealed wood can increase the risk of disease to the guinea pig housed within. Correct by
sealing all wood surfaces or covering wood surfaces with an impervious surface. Remains uncorrected.

3.28(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
Space. Insufficient space was being provided to guinea pigs housed in the following enclosures:

The top enclosure to the right of the entrance housing 37 weanlings measures 45.5 inches by 31 inches or 1410.5 square
inches of floor space. The maximum number of weanling guinea pigs in this size space is 23.

The bottom enclosure to the right of the entrance door housing 15 adults and 3 offspring measures 45.5 inches by 31
inches or 1410.5 square inches of floor space. The maximum number of adult guinea pigs in this size space is 13.

Brown enclosure # 1 housing 29 weanlings (28 live & 1 dead) measures 62 inches by 24 inches or 1488 square inches of
floor space. The maximum number of weanling guinea pigs in this size space is 24.

Brown enclosure # 2 housing 32 weanlings measures 62 inches by 24 inches or 1488 square inches of floor space. The
maximum number of weanling guinea pigs in this size space is 24.

The top wire cage with a black plastic tray housing 8 adults measures 32 inches by 20.5 inches or 656 square inches of
floor space. The maximum number of adult guinea pigs in this size space is 6.

Weanling guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams require at least 60 square inches of floor space each. Weanlings
weighing over 350 grams and adults require at least 101 square inches of floor space each. Inadequate space can
cause, stress, overcrowding, and aggression in animals. Licensee must ensure that guinea pigs are provided at least the

minimum amount of floor space per animal to prevent unnecessary stress, discomfort, or aggression. Correct by July 30,
2022.

Watering.
Three enclosures housing a total of 23 adult guinea pigs, 37 weanlings, and 3 newborns had water bottles with a dark
green algae buildup on the inside of the water containers.

A water bottle was empty housing 29 weanlings near the air conditioner unit. The water bottle was filled at the request of
APHIS inspectors.

The rack of enclosures numbers 48 - 52 housing a total of 38 adult guinea pigs and 22 offspring had accumulations of
dirty, wet bedding, fecal material and debris on the sides of the wire surfaces surrounding the PVC drainpipe for the water
nipples.

A tri-colored (gray, beige, and white) adult guinea pig in enclosure # 64 was not able to move her lower hind legs and was
not able to reach the water nipple to drink. Animals not able to drink can cause pain and suffering.

Water bottles and water nipples must be sanitized when dirty so that potable water is provided to guinea pigs to protect
their health and well-being. In addition, water receptacles must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. Failure to do
so can increase the risk of disease as well as possible avoidance of water. Licensee must ensure that guinea pigs have
access to potable water, have clean water receptacles, and that water receptacles are sanitized at least once every 2
weeks. Correct by July 21, 2022.

3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
Enclosure # 7 housing 10 adults, enclosure # 8 housing 10 adults, and enclosure # 13 housing 21 weanling guinea pigs
had accumulations of wet/soiled bedding and debris covering the lower half of these enclosures especially the area by the
water nipples. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation can expose the guinea pigs to disease hazards, to uncomfortable living
conditions, and health problems. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of
excreta, wet and soiled bedding, and other debris. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are cleaned often
enough to prevent this accumulation. Remains uncorrected.
3.31(b) Repeat

Sanitation.
Housekeeping. The floor underneath the guinea pig racks and enclosures had accumulations of spilled feed, hay, feces,
shavings, and debris, Accumulations of cobwebs, dust, and debris were hanging from the bottom of the racks and
enclosures, and lower wall surfaces behind the racks.

Ineffective cleaning and housekeeping can expose the guinea pigs to disease risks and health problems. Correct by
sweeping the floor especially under the racks and enclosures on a regular basis to remove spilled feed, hay, shavings,
feces, cobwebs, dirt and debris. Remains uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
