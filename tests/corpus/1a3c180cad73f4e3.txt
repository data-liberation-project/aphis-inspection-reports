PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The newer enclosure housing the Weeper Capuchin (within eyesight but geographically distinct from the group of
capuchin enclosures), does not meet the construction and maintenance standards for non-human primates.
-rusty wire used to patch holes or secure the chain link fencing in the corners had sharp wire ends exposed, both
inside and outside the enclosure.
-wire mesh attached to the outside and used to prevent the primates from reaching out of the enclosure had
exposed sharp points.
Exposed sharp points could injure nonhuman primates. The enclosures must be kept in good repair. Primaryenclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they: have no sharp points or edges that could injure the
nonhuman primates and protect the nonhuman primates from injury;
-the feeding platform is constructed of particle board, with a coating that has worn off which can no longer be
effectively cleaned and sanitized.
The feeding platform shall be constructed of material that can be readily cleaned and sanitized, or replaced when
worn or soiled.
Non human primate housing should be constructed and maintained to protect the health and well-being of the
animal. Rusted metal, sharp points and unsealed wood cannot be adequately cleaned and may pose a health threat
to the animal.
Corrected during inspection by moving the animal out of the specified enclosure.
