ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at
10:05am-10:50am on 08/25/2015.
Dr. Digesualdo and I arrived at Mr. Terranovas home facility at 10:05 am. The gates were closed and had a chain
around them. At 10:11am I called the cell phone of Mr. Terranova, he did not answer so I left a message stating we
were at the facility to conduct an inspection and would he return my call and I left my cell phone number on his
voice mail.
At 10:20am after receiving no phone call I sent a text to Mr. Terranova on his cell phone number and stated again
that we were at the facility to conduct an inspection and that his last itinerary received by the western regional office
of Animal Care showed no further exhibiting or travel after the 17th of August so that he and the animals should
have been back at the home facility or an updated itinerary should have been submitted to the western regional
office of Animal Care showing the changes to the itinerary and the time periods it covered.
Mr. Terranova I request you contact me by email or cell phone to let me know when you or your designated person
for inspection will be at the home facility and available for inspection.
Email address: donnovan.l.fox@aphis.usda.gov
Cell phone number: 903-570-1518
I also request that if you have not done so prior to receipt of this inspection report you send a current itinerary to the
western regional office of Animal Care with current information.
END OF REPORT.
