3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The alley-way of Whelping Building had an accumulation of shredded paper, fine wood saw dust, empty dog food
bags and debris. This can attract vermin, pests and other rodents as well as provide living and breeding areas for
them. As a result, this could affect the health and increase disease hazards for the five adult dogs and 13 puppies.
For the prevention of disease hazards, vermin, pests and other rodents, all housing facilities and food or bedding
areas must be free of accumulations of shredded paper, empty dog food bags, and other waste. Housing facilities
and food or bedding areas must be kept clean.
To be corrected by, 30-March-2018.
3.1(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Several enclosures, all housing eight adult dogs, have wood support posts for the divider panels. These wood
support post are covered with metal around the outside. The surfaces for the bottom portion of five of these metal
covered posts are excessively rusty, flaking and corroded away. These surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and
sanitized, thus increasing the disease potential. The structural strength of the surfaces is affected.
To maintain the structural strength and for proper cleaning and sanitization, all metal surfaces must be kept free of
rust. This will decrease the disease potential and ensure the metal surfaces are structurally sound.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Three wood dog shelters in the Main Kennel, housing 5 adult dogs, wood surfaces were excessively chewed and
scratched. This was around the dog doorways for the shelters and there was a hole scratched through one of the
wood walls. This exposes bare wood and does not allow the surface to be properly cleaned and sanitized. For readily cleaning and sanitation, these worn wood surfaces must be replaced or repaired.

3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The concrete flooring for six enclosures had an accumulation of fecal waste on the surface.
* Three plastic dog houses and a plastic divider in the Whelping Building had an accumulation of bird waste and
grey dust/debris on their surfaces.
This accumulation of fecal waste indicates that daily spot-cleaning is not taking place and could increase the
disease potential for the 13 adult dogs and 13 puppies.
For the prevention of an accumulation of feces and reduction of disease hazards, all hard surfaces with which the
dogs come in contact with must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b), at least every two
weeks or more often if necessary.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative and Randall Wagner (ACI).
This inspection report will be sent both regular and certified mail.
