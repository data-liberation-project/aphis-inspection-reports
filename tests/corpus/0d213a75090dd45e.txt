SANITATION.
A large number of flies were present inside the building used for food preparation and cold food storage. Although
two pieces of fly tape were hung in this building, the pest control program for this area is ineffective. Pests such as
flies may pose a health risk to the animals and may contaminate food products. An effective pest control program
must be established and maintained to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination
by pests in all animal areas and premises.
