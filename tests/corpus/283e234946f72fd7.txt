2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Currently there are not adequate puppy records to trace back the puppies sold. There are ID numbers assigned to
the puppies on the 7006 Disposition forms, however it is not possible to clearly determine who that puppy was born
to in the kennel records or 7005 forms. The Acquisition/On Hand 7005 forms are missing the name/address in the
'Acquired from' section and dates acquired information of the records for all dogs in the kennel.
Complete records must be kept and in a timely fashion in order to maintain proper management and care of the
regulated animals.
All Acquisition/On Hand 7005, and Disposition 7006 forms must be filled out completely and accurately. Puppy
records must be complete and accurate with the appropriate information and ID numbers.
3.1(d)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Currently there is no lighting in the facility that allows an inspection to be completed without a flashlight in the late
afternoon during winter hours. The only way to clean the kennel or conduct husbandry activities is with the use of a
head lamp by the licensee or other portable light source. During this inspection there were no other light sources
available to see the indoor facilities in any detail or to be able to look at the animals' conditions without using a flash
light.
It is important that a light source that is fixed within the kennel be provided to ensure that all animal husbandry
activities including proper cleaning and daily observations are carried out. With poor lighting it is possible to miss
any health issues that appear with the regulated animals and to miss cleaning all surfaces and floors thoroughly,
which can provide a source of disease or illness if left for long periods of time.
The licensee must install an adequate light source in the kennel that will illuminate all primary enclosures and theanimals within.

3.11(b) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is a buildup of brown grime located on all of the walls and around the doors in each kennel. Some of the
outside run walls have brown grime buildup around the kennel entry doors. There is a buildup of debris and grime
running along the edges of the floor and walls in each kennel, as this area is not sealed, and hair/feces/debris falls
into the cracks and is not readily removed from the enclosure.
All surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals must be cleaned and sanitized according to Sec 3.11
(b) in order to prevent the accumulation of excreta, debris and grime that can increase the risk of disease hazards.
All kennel surfaces, walls, floors, gates and feeders must be cleaned and sanitized regularly and at a minimum of
once every two weeks or as needed to keep the surfaces free of dirt/grime and debris.
