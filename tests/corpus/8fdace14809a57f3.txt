2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is not following the instructions from the Attending Veterinarian as written on the Program of Veterinary
Care form. The PVC states that puppies shall be vaccinated with bordetella at 6 weeks of age and for distemper at
6 weeks of age. The licensee is not vaccinating with bordetella, but is instead using a combination of medications
("tylan" "genecyin" and sterile water) in a nebulizer after the puppies are weaned. There are no written instructions
from the veterinarian concerning this treatment. A sample of some litter vaccination records during the inspection
demonstrated that no puppies that had reached six weeks of age had been vaccinated against distemper. One litter
of 3 Chihuahua puppies was vaccinated for distemper at 7 weeks of age. One Yorkshire terrier mix puppy was 8
weeks and 3 days of age and had not received a distemper vaccine. Written instructions not followed correctly may
cause harm to the animals. The licensee must correctly follow the written veterinarian instructions.
Adult, red female Cavalier King Charles Spaniel with chip number 13885624 has thick brown material coating the
upper (cid:28)"cheek"(cid:29) (premolars and molars) and canine teeth. The gum line is red and severely recessed above the
upper cheek teeth, especially over the left upper premolar teeth. The dog repeatedly tried to pull her had away
abruptly when her mouth was examined. These signs are consistent with dental disease. Dental disease can cause
damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat
normally, affecting the overall health of the animal.
Adult, brown female, Brussels Griffon with chip number 105851537 has a large amount of thick, dark debris in and
around the opening to the ear canals of both ears. This skin in these areas is red and thickened which appears to
occlude the ear canal. Ear problems can be caused by infection and other medical issues and can be painful.
The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian by the end of business on Friday,
August 1, 2014 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed. The licensee must document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the
inspector upon request.3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The support pipe for the outside flooring material of the northern-most enclosure on the east side of the east kennel
building is rusted. As a result of this rust the pipe is nearly rusted through. The structural strength of this pipe is
jeopardized and may no longer be able to support this enclosure.
Also, the lower end of a fence support pipe in one enclosure housing three Australian shepherds is rusted. The
structural strength of this pipe is jeopardized and may no longer be able to support this fence.
All surfaces must be maintained and free from excessive rust that affects the structural strength of the materials.
Correct by August 30, 2014.
