EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
* Two dogs are housed individually and are currently not being exercised individually by other means than
enclosure size . A West Highland Terrie (# 00-0723-CABC) measures 21 in. long requiring 10.2 sq. feet of floor
space for exercise. The enclosure measures 31 in. x 21 in. and only provides 4.5 sq. feet of floor space. A Scottish
Terrier (# 00-0753-EA7D) measures 20 in. long requiring 9.4 sq. feet of floor space for exercise. The enclosure
measures 31 in. 24 in. and provides 5.1sq. feet of floor space. Neither of these enclosures is large enough to
provide the required floor space for regular exercise (double the required floor space for that dog as in 3.6 (c)(1) for
these individually housed dogs. Licensee must either: move these dogs to enclosures that provide the required
amount of floor space to allow for exercise, allow for exercise by housing with other compatible dogs in appropriate
sized enclosures, or be provided the opportunity for regular exercise if they continued to be housed individually inappropriate sized enclosures.
