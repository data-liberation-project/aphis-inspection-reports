PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
3.53 (a)(4)
An adult rabbit was found solitary housed in an enclosure with wire flooring and floor space dimensions of 18 inches
by 14 inches (252 sq inches).The rabbit enclosure lacks a solid resting surface for the rabbit to sit on. Continuous
foot and hock contact with wire flooring, even when coated, can result in pressure sores and infections developing
on the feet and hocks of rabbits. A solid resting surface should be provided to allow the rabbit to move off the wire
floor as needed.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The above rabbit was found housed in a wire floored enclosure with floor space dimensions of 18 inches by 14
inches (252 sq inches). The enclosure does not meet current regulatory floor space standards for rabbits.
Inadequate floor space may result in the inability for animals to make normal postural adjustments and movements.
This may result in stress and injury to animals when attempting to move or exhibit their normal behavioral patterns.

SANITATION.
3.131 (a)
Dried bird excreta was found on one exterior side of the enclosure housing degus, guinea pigs and hedgehogs.
Bird excreta may contain pathogens that can infect other animals and make them sick. Bird excreta should also not
be allowed to build up on bird cages or other surfaces, as this results in insanitary conditions and possible disease
spread to other animals. The enclosure housing the degus, guinea pigs and hedgehogs also needs to be separatedby a longer distance or shielded from neighboring birds to protect from contamination by bird excreta.

SEPARATION.
3.133
Multiple adoption cats with visible upper respiratory conditions and ocular discharge were observed freely roaming
the pet shop area. There were also signs of loose cat stools observed in one litter box present in the main retail
shop area. Although these cats have been and are under veterinary medical treatment, they may represent a
source of disease spread to other animals and they should not be housed with nor allowed direct contact with
enclosures containing susceptible animal species.
Correct this day forward.
