2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:20 am on
08/15/2014.
I was advised earlier this week by the licensee that an authorized person would be available at the facility Friday
8/15, and arrived at 10:20 am on that day. Upon finding no one at the facility, the licensee, authorized person, and
facility number were phoned and voicemails left where possible from a location three minutes down the road (better
cell reception). I departed at 11:10 am, dropping by the facility to see if the authorized person had arrived in the
meanwhile.
