Feeding.
The food bowls of the two coati had soiled straw and old food/debris in the bowls. The bowls are not being cleaned often
enough to prevent contamination of new food.

Dirty food bowls can be a possible source of bacteria and health issues for the regulated animals.

The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health.

Watering.
There were two coati that did not have any water in their bucket located within the primary enclosure. The bucket had not
been tipped over as it was in a box that prevented it, and it appeared that water had not been provided since the previous
morning when chores were done over 24hrs prior.


One of the bowls used for water in the bobcat enclosure had a buildup of green algae in the bottom of the rubber bowl
filled with water.

The lack of water can be a source of stress or possible health issues if not provided often enough or in proper quantity for
the animals to drink appropriately to thier needs. The buildup of algea or unclean water containers can be a possible
source of bacteria or other health issues.

If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and
comfort of the animal. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

To be corrected: Water was added by the end of the inspection

Sanitation.
There is a bobcat in an outdoor enclosure that has an excessive amount of feces buildup on the one side of the pen.
There are old deer leg bones and debris throughout the primary enclosure. The buildup looks to be at least 2-3 weeks or
more in an approximate area of 12x12ft. There is a pile of old stuffed toys in the center of the enclosure that are wet and
dirty that need to be cleaned or removed.

The kangaroo enclosure has an indoor area where they are fed that had a buildup of thick brown dirt/grime on the wall
that has not been cleaned or sanitized often enough to prevent the buildup of the greasy material that the animals come in
contact with.


The buildup of dirt/grime on surfaces and excreta/old bones/debris can be a possible health hazard for the animals that
have contact with those areas.

Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. The surfaces that the animals come in contact
with should be cleaned/sanitized often enough to prevent the contamination of the animals within the primary enclosure.
