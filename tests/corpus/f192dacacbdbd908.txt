SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
At the time of the inspection, approximately 1:30 pm, the outdoor temperature is 94 degrees F with a heat index of
105 degrees F according to The Weather Channel. This area has been under a heat advisory from June 15, 2018
to June 17, 2018 according to the National Weather Service. According to Ottumwaradio.com, the area is under a
heat warning on the day of the inspection. The maximum outdoor temperature on the day of the inspection was 95
degrees F and occurred at approximately 3:55 pm according to weather underground.com and the previous 3 days
had high temperatures of 94 to 95 degrees F.
The facility has two sheltered housing buildings containing adult dogs and puppies. These are the only two
structures on the facility that house dogs and at the time of the inspection, the dogs had resided within the buildings
all day.
The first building, housing approximately thirty-one adult dogs, has an ambient indoor temperature of 91 degrees F
and a heat index up to 108.4 degrees F according to the Kestrel. The majority of the adult dogs are showing signs
of heat stress such as open mouthed breathing, an increased respiration rate, and heavy panting with their tongues
extended from their mouths.
The second building, housing approximately thirty adult dogs and forty puppies, has an ambient indoor temperature
of 94 degrees F and a heat index up to 109.7 degrees F according to the Kestrel. The majority of the adult dogs are
showing signs of heat stress such as open mouthed breathing, increased respiration rate, and heavy panting with
their tongues extended from their mouths. All the litters of puppies are spread out around their enclosures and one
four and a half week old puppy was observed to be panting and has an increased respiration rate.
Both buildings have windows or dog doors that are open and the second building has a fan running. The facility
representative stated that the animals are occasionally misted with water to help cool them. Excessive heat
combined with high humidity can have a dangerous or detrimental affect on the health and well-being of the adult
dogs and puppies.
The sheltered part of sheltered housing facilities for dogs must be sufficiently heated and cooled when necessary toprotect the dogs from temperature or humidity extremes and to provide for their health and well-being.
The licensee must reduce the heat and humidity inside both buildings to a level that is comfortable for the dogs and
puppies in order to protect their health and well-being.
Correction date: The temperature must be at a comfortable level for the animals inside both buildings by 5:00 pm
on June 19, 2018.
