Female Yorkie #40 was in a fight with another dog on 4/23/14. The licensee has documented this in his facility
records. He stated during this inspection that he noticed the dog had a wound on its right hind leg and her left eye
was swollen shut. The licenee did not contact the attending veterinarian but did begin administering injectable
penicillin to the dog once per day. He stated that the dog was initially "pretty down" but was able to eat and drink.
Today the dog's left eye is opaque with redness in the globe. There is also a dark 1 mm circle at 6 o'clock on the
cornea which appears to be a puncture would that has begun to heal. The licensee is not providing any treatment
to the dog's eye other than injectable penicillin. This dog also has a 4 cm circular open wound on the right thigh
area immediately behind its right knee. This wound is open, but is clean and has no active drainage.
*** This dog requires veterinary attention and must be examined by a licensed veterinarian to determine appropriate
treatment for this dog. Even though the current PVC for this facility does address common eye and skin problems
and treatment for these conditions, it does mention traumatic events such as a dog fight. Failure to provide
appropriate, prompt treatment recommended by a licensed veterinarian for this dog can result in un-needed pain
and suffering in the animal. Documentation of diagnosis, treatment, and plan must be maintained for examination
by APHIS officials.
Correct by having this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian by 5/15/14.

Female Yorkie #40 was found in need of veterinary care due to being in a fight with another dog on 4/23/14. The
licensee did find this problem and began treating the dog without guidance from the attending veterinarian. The
current Program of Veterinary Care for this facility does address common skin and eye problems with
recommended treatments for them but does not address traumatic injuries from fights such as these. The licensee
must provide frequent communication with the attending veterinarian for circumstances such as this. Failure to
provide communication can result in suffering or inappropriate treatment of animals at this facility. The licensee
must ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent communication to the attending veterinarian is provided for allfuture issues that are not specifically covered in the PVC.
