3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
9 CFR 3.31(a)(1) requires cleaning and sanitization of enclosures often enough to prevent accumulation of excreta
and debris.
All five enclosures at ground level had build-up of excreta and debris, as well as wet, soiled bedding. Funnels
underneath the water nipples were almost completely filled with debris.
Enclosures that have accumulations of excreta and debris can create stressful environments that can negatively
impact the health of the animals.
The licensee must have the primary enclosures cleaned and sanitized thoroughly. Correct by February 9, 2018.
This was a focused inspection. The health concerns noted previously as a noncompliance within the inspection
report dated December 13, 2017 have been addressed by the attending veterinarian.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Facility Representative.
