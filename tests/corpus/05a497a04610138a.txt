3.75(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several jagged edges / sharp points were observed protruding from the plastic boxes within the main Diana guenon
enclosure. Any surfaces that come in contact with nonhuman primates must be free of jagged edges or sharp points
that might injure the animals. The plastic boxes should be fixed or replaced to eliminate potential injuries to
nonhuman primates within the enclosure.
