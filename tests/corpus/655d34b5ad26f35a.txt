ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:10 am on
05/07/2014. Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the front door, after no answer I returned to my car and called
the number on file. I was prompted to leave a message. I stated that I was at the facility for inspection and I could
wait about 1/2 hr before I would need to leave. I asked that I receive a return call and provided my phone number. I
left the facility at 11:50 am. A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS Officials during an
unannounced inspection.
