ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30am on
08-FEB-18.
No answer was received at the door of the house or dog kennel, and no call was received answering the voicemail
left by the inspector after 30 minutes from initial contact. Lack of availability makes the inspection process
impossible. Licensees must ensure there is a knowledgeable facility representative available to conduct the
inspection during normal business hours. Correct by contacting the inspector to establish your optimal hours for
inspection and to provide additional contact methods as needed. Correct from this time forward.
