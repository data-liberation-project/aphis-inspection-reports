TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are 6 St. Bernard's that range in age from 5 months to 6 months old that do not have any ID. These dogs
have been kept back for breeding stock and are not recorded on their Inventory, nor is there any cage card or puppy
record to show where these dogs came from.
It is important to have proper identification on all dogs kept as breeding stock and provide their ID according to the
requirements in the AWA regulations and standards. Identification in the form of microchip, tag or tattoo is required
for traceability and management of the animals.
The licensee must provide proper identification on all dogs from 16 weeks of age and older in the form of microchip,
tag or tattoo according to AWA regulations and standards. All breeding stock should be put on the inventory as soon
as they are identified.

Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 16, 2016.
