2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Licensee's current Program of Veterinarian Care is lacking guidance on adult vaccination schedules for all
species of animals. It does not provide any guidance on treatments or medications for Squirrels. In addition, it is
missing key information for dosage, frequency of administration and route of administration for all medications. Not
having proper guidance for medications and vaccinations does not ensure that these animals receive adequate
veterinarian care. The Licensee must ensure that they have a detailed Program of Veterinarian care with specific
guidance for dosage, frequency of administration and route of administration for all medications or vaccinations that
will be used on all species within the facility.

2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current Program of Veterinarian Care states that the Licensee should be using Panacur/Fenbendazole for
intestinal parasites and Frontline for ecto parasites. However; the License stated that she was using Albon,
Ivermectin and Pyrantal for parasites. By using medications that are not listed in her Program of Veterinarian Care,
the Licensee is not allowing the Attending Veterinarian to have the appropriate authority to appropriately treat the
animals within the facility. It is the Licensee(cid:25)s responsibility to ensure that the current Program of Veterinarian Care
is being followed exactly as it is written by the Attending Veterinarian. Licensee must ensure that the Program of
Veterinarian Care is followed and that the Attending Veterinarian is given the appropriate authority to treat all
animals within the facility.
