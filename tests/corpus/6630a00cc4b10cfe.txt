FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility currently has a goat walk that is lined with cattle panel type fencing to ensure the goats are not able to
fall off. There are several areas where the wire has sharp points that stick out on the goats side of the walk way.
Some of these sharp points are at head and eye level. In addition, there are strips of wood ran along the flooring of
the walkway to ensure the goats are able to maintain their footing. However, there are several areas where the
wood has been chipped or broken off leaving screws exposed and protruding out of the flooring. The animal could
easily step on the screws and hurt their hoofs/feet. All areas of this facility must be maintained in good repair and
protect the animals from injury. All surfaces with sharp points must be replaced, repaired or resurfaced to ensure all
areas are maintained in good repair and do not allow injury to the animals contained therein.

WATERING.
On today's inspection, the inside of the goats' water receptacle was covered in green organic material. The facility
representative stated that the water receptacle was due to be cleaned. He stated that the receptacle is cleaned
every Thursday. However; it had not been cleaned prior to today(cid:25)s inspection. The facility representative took out a
scrub brush and scrubbed the water receptacle while the inspector was at the facility completing the inspection.
The facility representative used a scrub brush and water. The inspector did not see a cleaner or a sanitizer used on
the receptacle while she was at the facility. All water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized using commonly
accepted husband standards as often as necessary to prevent organic growth. A cleaner and a sanitizer must be
used during the cleaning process. In addition, potable water must be made available as often as necessary for the
health and comfort of the animals.

SANITATION.
The facility is currently using a three sided structure as shelter for their goats. Inside the structure there are several
bird nests and bird droppings on most of the solid surfaces. In addition, there are several piles of bird droppings on
most of the support beams within the structure. Birds can be carries of several communicable diseases. There is
an increased chance of these animals being exposed to the hazards without the facility having an affective pest
control program or affective program for cleaning and/or eliminating the droppings. This facility must ensure that
they establish and maintain an affective pest control program.
