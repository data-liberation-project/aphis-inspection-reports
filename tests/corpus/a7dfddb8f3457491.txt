ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30pm on
20-DEC-17.
I am arrived at the property at approximately 12;30pm on 12/20/2017 and met with the wife of the licensee. She said
her husband was unavailable and she had a prior engagement so no one was available to do the inspection at that
time. I confirmed the optimal hours of operation were still current. I then gave her my card and left the property.
