A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12.00 pm on
15-Aug-19.I arrived at the facility. There was no one there. I called and spoke with the licensee who stated she was
not available.
Please send written notification of optimal hours during which APHIS officials will be able to conduct an
unannounced inspection.
