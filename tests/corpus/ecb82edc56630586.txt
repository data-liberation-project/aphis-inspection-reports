2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 4-year-old female Yorkshire terrier named Dolly (m/c# 956000005268417) was repeatedly squinting her left eye.
The entire cornea was blue with a ring of red around the circumference and in the middle of the eye. The reddened
area in the middle of the eye was rough and dry and appeared to have a raised corneal lesion. The licensee stated
that he noticed the problem about 1.5 weeks earlier, but had not consulted a veterinarian about it. He had been
treating the eye topically twice each day with a dietary supplement called Silver Water, which is labeled for oral use
for immune system support. The label also stated that the product is not intended to treat, cure, or prevent any
disease. Eye problems can progress rapidly, can be painful, and can result in loss of vision. The licensee must
have this dog's eye evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis, must follow the veterinarian's treatment plan,
and must follow-up with the veterinarian if the problem does not resolve in a timely manner.
TO BE CORRECTED BY October 3, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
