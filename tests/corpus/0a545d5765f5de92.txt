2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Availability of Records.
***At the time of the inspection, the representative of the Licensee could not produce a copy of all of the documents
that are required under the AWA Regulations - specifically the written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). As a
result, the written PVC that a Licensee is required to have available at the time of an inspection could not be
reviewed.
Per this Section of the Regulations, all documents and records that are required to be kept under the AWA should
be available at the time of an inspection so the required records can be reviewed to determine the facility's
compliance with the provisions of the AWA. All licensees that are in travel status are required to carry copies of all
of the required documents while on the road so the documents can be made available for review at the time of an
inspection.
The travelling unit of the licensee that was inspected at the Franklin Fair in Greenfield, MA on 9/7/17 needs to have
a copy of the written Program of Veterinary Care.
Correct by 9/21/17.
NOTE – Inspection conducted at the Franklin Fairgrounds in Greenfield, MA with representative of the Licensee.
Exit briefing held 9/7/17 on-site with representative of the Licensee and in person with the Licensee at the North
Haven, CT Fairgrounds on 9/8/17.
