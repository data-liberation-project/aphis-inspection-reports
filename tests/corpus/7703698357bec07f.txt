ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1430 on
01-Mar-18. I went to the licensee's house. No one answered the door. I honked the car horn and then left a
message on the licensee's phone. I waited 30 minutes and then left.
End of report.
