2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs was not available during this inspection. A total of 273 adult guinea pigs, 37 weanlings,
and 88 newborns were counted during this inspection. The last inventory records maintained was on April 2, 2022 except
for weekly weanling counts. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by
identifying animal losses by decreased number of guinea pigs born or raised. The licensee must maintain records
containing the required information for animals which disclose the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired or
disposed of including births and deaths. Correct by July 15, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
