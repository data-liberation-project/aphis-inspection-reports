SANITATION.
The water bottle in enclosure 1 is leaking. Although there is no standing water in the enclosure, the bedding is very
wet which may be uncomfortable for the adult female hedgehog and her two young. Large amounts of water
leakage/accumulation can lead to injury or death. The water bottle needs to be repaired or replaced and the wet
bedding needs to be replaced with dry bedding. Correct today.

SANITATION.
Several housekeeping items need attention in the new hedgehog room:
*An electrical cord is hanging loose over and across one enclosure. If it sags into the enclosure, a hedgehog may
be injured biting on the cord.
*There is a large building up of cobwebs on the shelves holding the enclosures, the walls and the ceiling
components directly over the enclosures. Cobwebs trap dirt and dust.
*There are bird cages in the same room and a large amount of bird food debris and other debris has built up on the
floor under and around the cages. This debris may attract pests into the room the birds and hedgehogs share.
Some old dried mouse excreta was noted that hadn't been cleaned up.
The hedgehog room shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the hedgehogs from injury and to
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. Correct by 1/20/16.
