Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 0850 on 04 May
2022.

Upon arrival at the facility I rang the doorbell. I also called the contact number and made contact with the licensee. She
stated she was unavailable for inspection.
