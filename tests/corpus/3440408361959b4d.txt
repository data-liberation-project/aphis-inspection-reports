FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was an excessive amount of cobwebs, dust, and debris on the outside parts of enclosures and walls inside
the building. Outside areas of enclosures must be cleaned regularly and kept free from accumulations of dust,
debris, and cobwebs to decrease risk of vermin infestation, risk of sickness, and fire hazards.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation.
When the inspection was started, ammonia odors were strong enough that I could feel my eyes and throat burned
lightly due to the odor. A ventilation fan was turned on and by the end of the inspection odors had improved.
Strong ammonia odors can cause animals to get sick or do poorly. While maintaining temperatures between 60 and
85 degrees F, adequate air flow must be provided so that odors do not ever get to an uncomfortable level.
Increased use of the fan and also cleaning enclosures more often can help decrease ammonia odors.
