RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Some of the sale forms (APHIS form 7006) did not have the official puppy identification number recorded. The
puppy identification number must be recorded on APHIS form 7006 to help identify animals, document changes in
ownership, and keep track of animal shipments. Licensee must ensure that dogs and puppies are officially
identified.
