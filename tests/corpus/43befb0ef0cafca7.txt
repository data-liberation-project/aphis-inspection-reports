The record of animals purchased are still being kept in a log book. The log book does not include the address of the
person from whom animals were purchased or acquired. Licensee must keep records or forms which fully and
correctly discloses the name and address of the seller so that the information is available to track animal shipments
for health and regulatory purposes, document changes in ownership, and to determine if the breeder is licensed
with the USDA. APHIS 7019 forms were left with facility during this inspection to help maintain records.

An exit briefing was conducted with facility representative.
