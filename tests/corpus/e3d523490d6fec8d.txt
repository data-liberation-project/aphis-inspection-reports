Female Old English Sheepdog (microchip # 990_000002978192) has a heavily matted hair coat. The hair is matted into
thick clumps and sections and is located along the length of the dog’s back, the underside of the neck, across the hips,
along the backside of both forelegs, around the base of the tail and down both hind legs. The matted clumps located on
the underside of the neck are held tight against the skin.

One adult female Bernadoodle (microchip # 990_000002980201) has a heavily matted hair coat. Approximately 90% of
the dog’s body surface is covered in thick clumps of matted fur that contained a mixture of dirt and other organic material.

The most severe matted hair was located on the hips and down both hind legs and the head around the ears and eyes.
There were several tight matts on both ears where the inspector found it hard to differentiate between the ear skin and the
matt. The hair inside of the dog’s ears were matted with a dark brown to black organic material present.

Hair coats that are matted have the potential to cause skin irritation, pain and discomfort. Improperly groomed and un-
maintained hair coats can affect a dog’s overall health and well-being.

Hair coats must be maintained to prevent injury and illness to the dog. These 2 dogs must be groomed.
