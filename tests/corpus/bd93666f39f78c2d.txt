ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany an APHIS Official during the inspection process at 2:15 -
2:45pm on 03/09/2016. Nobody answered the door when I knocked and I called the number on file and left a
message. The licensee called back later in the day and informed me they were out of town.
