3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
The surface of the wooden flooring in five outdoor enclosures containing seven dogs is worn, cracked and
absorbing liquid. The licensee stated the flooring in the five enclosures have not been sealed.
The worn surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. This can create a disease hazard and affect the
health and well being of the dogs. The licensee must maintain all surfaces in the housing facility on a regular basis.
Surfaces of housing facilities including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility
that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
Four of the enclosures within the outdoor housing facility, containing six dogs, have an excessive build-up of fur,
excreta and/or soiled bedding within the enclosures. There is more than a day worth of animal waste that has
accumulated along the edges of the enclosures that are on the ground.
Not cleaning and removing animal waste daily can create disease hazards and affects the health and well-being of
the dogs. All enclosures must be spot cleaned daily to remove excreta, soiled bedding, food waste, hair, etc. from
the floor, wire fencing, and inside of shelters.
3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The north outdoor enclosure containing two adult Shiba Inu dogs has sharp wire points along the bottom southeastcorner of the enclosure that are protruding inward. The south outdoor enclosure containing an adult Samoyed and
Shiba Inu has a hole in the coated wire flooring that is large enough for a dog's foot to fall through. The wire is
broken and bent creating sharp points the dogs can come into contact with. This can create a hazardous situation
for the dogs. The licensee must ensure that there are no sharp points within the enclosures that could injure the
animals. All of these items were corrected at the time of inspection.
3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest control.
An excessive number of flies are present in and around all of the outdoor enclosures affecting 24 dogs. There is one
pest control device available for the entire outdoor housing area. The device is sitting adjacent to one enclosure,
however there are still an excessive number of flies within and surrounding the enclosures in the outdoor housing
area. An excessive number of pests can lead to disease hazards. An effective program for the control of insects and
external parasites affecting dogs must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of
the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
The male Samoyed (microchip 151336624A) listed under 2.40 (b)(2) on the June 30, 2015 inspection report has
been corrected.
