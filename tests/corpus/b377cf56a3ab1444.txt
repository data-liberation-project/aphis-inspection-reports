ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 p.m. on
05/19/2015.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the door and called the contact number. I left a message and waited for 30
minutes. The licensee later returned my call and provided more optimal times for inspection.
End of report.
