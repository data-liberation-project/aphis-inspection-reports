ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This facility had several wolf hybrids with missing hair and thickened skin over their tail heads. When the licensees
were asked about the hair loss they said it was due to fleas. When asked about the recommendations from the
attending veterinarian they explained their attending veterinarian had not examined the animals in about a year.
The licensees stated they had two veterinarians they were working with and were waiting to receive paperwork from
one of them. Both veterinarians were contacted. Both explained they were not the attending veterinarian and
neither had examined the wolves for hair loss recently.
There are multiple reasons for hair loss in animals. Parasites, ill health, and poor diet are a few of the causes. Hair
loss in any animal is a concern and should be evaluated by a veterinarian.
The licensees need to find an attending veterinarian to have the hair loss on the wolf hybrids and the overall health
on the remaining animals evaluated.
