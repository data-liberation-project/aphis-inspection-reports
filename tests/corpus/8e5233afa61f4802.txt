HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Rodent droppings were noted in several food storage areas including two storage barns and on a shelf located
above food storage containers and used for storing items for food preparation. No pest control was noted in these
areas. Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage,
contamination, and vermin infestation. An effective system must be in place to prevent vermin infestation and
potential contamination of animal food.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Four dogs in the upper kennels did not have adequate overhead protection from the elements, particularly rain
forecast for the day of the inspection. There is no overhead solid structure, the shade fabric is not solid to
adequately
protect from the elements and the dog houses do not provide adequate space to function as the sole primary
enclosure while protecting from the elements. Dogs and cats must be provided with adequate shelter from the
elements at all times to protect their health and well-being.
