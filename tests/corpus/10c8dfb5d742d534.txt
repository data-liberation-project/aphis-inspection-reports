2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs was not available for review during this inspection. Approximately 359 guinea pigs were
counted during this inspection including adults, weanlings, and newborns. Failure to maintain these records can make it
difficult to assess the health of the caviary by identifying animal losses by death or decreased number of animals born and
to track animals being sold. The licensee must maintain records containing the required information for guinea pigs which
disclose the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired or disposed of including births and deaths. Correct by July 10,
2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a family member.
