2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A tri-color adult Skinny breed guinea pig in Pen 31 in the
smaller housing room and a tan and black adult guinea pig in Pen 30 in the larger housing room were observed with a
mass under the chin. The masses were firm and movable and approximately 1 inch in diameter. The licensee had not
observed the health conditions in these animals, had not contacted the attending veterinarian, and was not administering
any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file addressed the condition and contained treatment options.
Swellings in the neck can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being of the
animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment
for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional animals if the
condition is contagious.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or communicate with the attending
veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
