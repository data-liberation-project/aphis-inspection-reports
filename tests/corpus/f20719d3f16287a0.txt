FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.
The wood beam in the center of the roof for the white tiger is rotting, and splitting and in need of replacement. This
beam is no longer structurally sound.
The gate between the rehab cage and the enclosure for the two gold tigers has a 3-4 inch gap on the side. This
area needs to be addressed to keep the animals from putting their paws and legs through.

SANITATION.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained. There were two large live fire ant mounds at the base of the enclosure fences for the
tigers. These mounds must be eradicated to provide protection for the animals. The area must be maintained to
avoid the formation of large mounds in the tiger's housing area.
