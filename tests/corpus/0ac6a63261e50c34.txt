OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
****In an outdoor enclosure, containing 4 adult dachshund, the barrel type shelters are not large enough to contain
all animals comfortably at the same time. These barrel type shelter structures are not large enough for all of the
dogs in this enclosure to be provided with shelter that allows them to sit, stand, lie and turn freely in a normal
manner. Adequate housing is important to provide all the dogs with protection from the effects of the wind, rain or
snow. The temperatures at this time of year are decreasing, making the housing even more important. The
licensee must ensure that the shelter structures are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit,
stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely.
