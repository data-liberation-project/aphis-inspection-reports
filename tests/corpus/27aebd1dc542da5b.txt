3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
There are 3 outdoor, primary enclosures, containing a total of 3 adult dogs and 5 puppies, that have wire mesh fencing
which is in disrepair. There are several areas of broken or bent wires and metal edges with sharp, protruding points at
contact level of the animals.

Outdoor enclosure containing one adult Weimaraner dog and her 3 puppies: The concrete flooring in this enclosure has
been cut around the base of a large tree and the space between is partially filled with rocks; however, there is an
approximately 6-inch wide and 5-inch deep hole/gap along one side of the tree due to an unfilled space.

Sharp, broken wires and metal edges within the enclosures could result in punctures or laceration wounds to the animals.
Holes or open spaces on the ground may cause leg or other injuries. Housing facilities for dogs must be in good repair,
and they must protect the animals from injuries and contain the animals securely. A system of facility repair and
maintenance must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
