3.80(a)(2)(9) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Surfaces inside the enclosures for non-human primates should be maintained so that they can be readily cleaned
and sanitized, and should be replaced or repaired when worn or soiled.
The following problems were observed at the time of inspection:
1.) Squirrel Monkeys - Extensive areas of missing and peeling paint from ceiling, metal perches, walls, and grating.
2.) Chimpanzees - Paint missing and peeling from metal grating that comprises the walls of the outdoor enclosure,
as well as paint peeling from the metal frames that hold the grating, and frame the doorways in the outside
enclosure. There is also evidence of some rust in these areas.
Non-human primates that are exposed to surfaces that cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected due to
deterioration, or that are exposed to debris from peeling paint or decomposing surfaces, could suffer ill effects to
their health and well-being. Surfaces should be maintained in good repair, free of debris, and such that they can be
adequately cleaned and disinfected.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The animal enclosures should be structurally sound, and maintained in good repair, so as to protect the animals
from harm. The following hazards were observed in animal enclosures:
1.) Inside the off-exhibit bat enclosure there was a dehumidifier with an electrical cord draped across the floor.
Electrical wires inside an enclosure present an electrocution risk. 2.) In the Eland off-exhibit enclosure there was chicken-wire around the top of the back wooden shelter area. The
wire had edges sticking out that were sharp and pointed, and could cause injuries to eyes or skin.
Enclosures should be maintained in good repair, and free from hazards that could cause injury.
These issues were cited previously in January, 2016, and have passed their correction dates.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Whereas the perimeter fence is in the process of improvement, and new fencing has been, or is in the process of
being installed, in several places inspected the perimeter fence still does not meet the requirements specified in
3.127 (d). The fence should be at least eight feet in height, due to the presence of animals defined as dangerous
animals, and it should prevent animals from passing under or through the fence, as well as providing secondary
containment in the event of an animal escape from its primary enclosure. The following shortfalls were noted:
1.) There are portions of the fence that fall short of the eight feet minimum height requirement. For example near
the camels, where the original fencing comprises part of the perimeter fence, sections measured were 71"(cid:29), 74"(cid:29),
80"(cid:29), and 90"(cid:29) in height in January, 2016, and no changes have been made in this area as of yet.
2.) Near the camels there are some gaps under existing gates that could allow animals to pass under the gates.
The gate referred to as the (cid:28)"Bison Gate"(cid:29) still has a six plus inch gap underneath, and the gates around the camels
still have six and seven inch gaps.
There are still contractors present working on the new fence, and it was not inspected in its entirety at the time of
inspection.
These observations are examples of where the perimeter fence does not meet the standards specified. The fence
should consistently meet the standards on both the inside and outside of the fence. This facility should have a
perimeter fence which adequately prevents people and animals from passing through or under the fence, and which
can also act as a secondary containment system for the animals on exhibit. This facility houses animals such as big
cats, bears, hyenas, and elephants, and therefore the perimeter fence should be at least eight feet in height, and it
should either fully enclose the whole premises, or the areas where these animals are housed, with a perimeter
fence measuring at least six feet in height for the other animals. There should be a separation of at least three feet
between the animals on exhibit and the perimeter fence, and it should preclude contact with people or animals. The
fence should be maintained in good repair so that it consistently meets the standards described here. Failure to
meet these standards could endanger the health and well-being of the animals in the facility.This is a repeat citation; it was previously cited in 2013, 2015, and January 2016.
This was a focused inspection on issues cited on the last inspection, and now past their correction dates.
An exit interview was conducted by phone with the Curator on 4/7/16.
