2.32(a) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Two incidents occurred on two separate dates within a colony of bats maintained at the facility. On August 5, 2016
it is documented that five bats died after animal care workers accidentally fed the wrong food. According to a facility
representative, laboratory personnel had not labeled the nectar containers and an incorrect food was given to the
bats. On November 18, 2016 it is documented that three bats died after the PI and graduate student forgot to
reopen the tunnel between the two animal enclosures which did not allow the bats access to their food for the last
half of the night. Properly trained personnel and instruction related to animal care, treatment and use are vital to
ensure that the animals receive proper care and optimal welfare. The research facility needs to ensure that all
personnel involved in animal care and use are qualified and appropriately trained and instructed on how to perform
their duties at all times. To be corrected from this date, June 22, 2017, forward.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
