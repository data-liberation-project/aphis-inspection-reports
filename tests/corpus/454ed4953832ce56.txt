2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Julius, an 11 year old male giraffe that was euthanized on 4/13/17 had experienced severe (pain scores >= 8 / 10)
since 2/26/2017 without adequate additional treatment or diagnostics for the escalating pain. The facility had
initiated a pain scoring system on 11/18/16 and his pain levels averaged 6.3 until the increase on 2/26/17. On
4/10/17, his pain score jumped to 9.5/10 and he was unable to lie down. His pain scores remained above 9/10 until
his euthanasia three days later. In the early am of April 13, 2017, Julius was found down inside the barn. Staff and
interim veterinarian attempted to get Julius back up on his feet but were unsuccessful and euthanasia was elected.
Necropsy results showed traumatic injuries including a torn infra-spinatus muscle in the left shoulder and old healing
injuries to neck. Both front feet had chronic overgrown hooves and complete rotation of P3 due to elongation of the
toes. Julius experienced escalating pain over the last 46 days of his life and pain score of >9.0/10 for the last three
days that was not adequately treated and caused him to experience significant pain, distress and protracted
suffering.
Assessment of the animals’ condition and response to therapy and appropriate alterations to the treatment and care
plan to alleviate pain and discomfort for the animal need to occur to prevent further pain and stress. Elevated pain
levels must be promptly and appropriately addressed.
Correct from this day forward.
3.133 CRITICAL
SEPARATION.
On March 27, 2017, “Ozzy”, a 15 year old female ocelot # 203035 was found dead in the exhibit. During
reintroduction of the male and female following her recovery from surgical amputation of her right front leg on
2/19/17, growling and swatting behaviors were exhibited in the shift hallway on the 25th and 26th. On the morning
of the 27th, growling again occurred and the male shifted into the exhibit. The female remained in the hallway and
would not enter the exhibit with the male. The animals were left together with access to exhibit and shift hallway.
Per the specimen report, in the afternoon, the male was observed to be “chewing on the head” of the deceased
female in the exhibit. There was evidence of a fight in the shift hallway. The female was deceased and had many
scratches and bite wounds, her amputation site was opened up and she was missing a 5 x 4 cm area of skin on top
of skull and right ear. Julius, the 11 year old male giraffe #208070 suffering from chronic lameness who was euthanized on April 13, 2017,
experienced antagonistic behavior from Jabari, the 7 year old male giraffe with whom he was housed. The necropsy
report states that Julius had been “harassed and been forced into the corner of the exhibit” the day before his death
and there were many previous instances of Jabari pushing and herding Julius around documented in his record.
Management had recommended on 3/16/17 that the giraffes be separated during the day. Separation occurred for
several hours a day but the intimidation continued. Necropsy results revealed a torn infra-spinatus muscle in the left
shoulder with deep hemorrhage and torn connective tissue. There were older healing areas on the left lateral neck
with evidence of previous trauma incidents.
Compatibility of animals may change following an illness, injury or surgery. Aggressive behavior towards an already
debilitated animal can increase stress and cause further injuries to the animal. Animals being reintroduced or who
are experiencing a chronic situation (pain, lameness) need to be closely observed for compatibility and separated if
needed to prevent discomfort, injury or death.
To be corrected from this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
This inspection report closes out the incients under review from IR #2016082568294028 dated 16 May 2017.
