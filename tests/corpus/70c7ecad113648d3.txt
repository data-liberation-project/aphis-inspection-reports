3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
In the fallow deer enclosure, there are several areas in a state of disrepair. In the main barn, there are multiple screws
protruding through the plywood on the back wall of the structure which have caused sharp points. In the same enclosure,
a piece of metal roofing material has been torn from the rear right corner of the spring house which has created an
approximately six inch by four foot gap in the roof. There is an additional 12 inch by 12 inch piece of metal roofing
missing from an area below the above mentioned gap. This area is covered by a wire panel but still contains jagged
edges which could cause injury if the deer were to step through the paneling. The spring house is built into the the hillside
which would allow the deer to have access to the gaps and sharp edges in the roof.
These areas of structural instability, sharp projecting objects, and detached roofing could cause injury or entrap the
animals.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain them. The facility must remove, repair, or replace the above mentioned items to ensure the
safety and well-being of the regulated animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
