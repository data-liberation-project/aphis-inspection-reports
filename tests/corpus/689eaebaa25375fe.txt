FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a wooden gate panel in the off exihibit tufted deer enclosure that is deteriorating. The wood panel has
deteriorated and pulled away from the support boards exposing rough edges and screw points. Facilites that are not
maintained in good repair can cause injury to the animals. The licensee must maintain facilities so that they are
structurally sound, protect the animals from injury and contain the animals. This was corrected at the time of
inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
