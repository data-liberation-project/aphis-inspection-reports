2.51(c)
FORM OF OFFICIAL TAG.
The same puppy number was listed on the Record of Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS form 7006) for different
puppies sold in 2015. Official tags or collars must be serially numbered so that animals sold have a unique number
identifying each puppy. No individual dealer shall use any identification tag or collar number more than once within a
5-year period. Failure to properly identify each puppy with a unique number makes tracking of animals more difficult.
Licensee shall ensure that all dogs and puppies sold are properly identified with a unique number.
