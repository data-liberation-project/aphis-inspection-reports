2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Shih-tzu (tag #199) has an abnormal cloudy appearance to both eyes. The licensee has been treating the
eyes with an over the counter medication called NFZ Puffer (nitrofurazone). While the medication is labeled for the
treatment of eye infections in dogs, the licensee has not had the dog's eyes evaluated by the attending veterinarian,
nor has the attending veterinarian approved the use of this medication. Abnormal eye conditions can be painful and
can lead to more serious problems such as infections or blindness if left untreated or not treated appropriately.
Consult the attending veterinarian regarding the condition of the dog's eyes and the use of NFZ Puffer to treat the
eyes. Follow all prescribed treatments or directions. Also, document and maintain written instructions from the
attending veterinarian regarding the use of NFZ Puffer. Correct by June 26, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
