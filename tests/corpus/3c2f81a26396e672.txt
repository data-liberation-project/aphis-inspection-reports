3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* No shade was observed in one outdoor enclosure housing one dog. Lack of shade can be stressful and could
lead to discomfort. Potential health risks exist if the dog becomes overheated. The licensee must ensure that there
is one or more separate areas of shade that is large enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect them
from the direct rays of the sun. Correct by 4/18/16.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Four enclosures housing seven dogs have excreta and dried fecal residue accumulating on 40 to 50 percent of
the cement flooring in three enclosures and 25 percent of the vinyl coated flooring in one enclosure. At least two
West Highland Terriers had soiling and staining of the hair coat on the legs and belly that is consistent with excreta
and fecal residue accumulating on the enclosure flooring. The affected flooring is located in outdoor and sheltered
housing. Daily removal of all excreta is necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces. Unsanitary living
conditions exist that could lead to potential contamination, soiling or caking of the hair coat. The licensee must
ensure that excreta and food waste must be removed from the primary enclosure on a daily basis to reduce disease
hazards, insects, pests and odors.
* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 4/4/16 were conducted with the licensee, Shawnee County
Law Enforcement, Angela DePoe ACI and Robert Bacon ACI.
