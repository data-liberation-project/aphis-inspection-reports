3.125(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 6/25/16 two ground squirrels were reported to have escaped from their enclosure. One ground squirrel was
found and had no adverse effects reported; however the other ground squirrel has not been accounted for. The lid
to the enclosure was reported to have not been properly latched upon discovery of the escaped animals. Escaped
animals' welfare cannot be assured by the facility. Enclosures must be maintained in a manner that contains the
animals to ensure that good welfare is provided for the animals contained.
Note: The facility unit recognized this incident and reported it to the overseeing ACUC. Measures have been taken
by the facility to prevent further occurrences.
This was a routine inspection of the animals and their facilities at CALS, SVM, and SMPH conducted on 3/28
through 3/29/2017. The exit interview was conducted with facility representatives on 3/30/2017.
