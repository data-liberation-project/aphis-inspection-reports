FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The cattle (2) have no shelter in their enclosure. Another enclosure containing different species of animals has
inadequate shelter space for the number of animals contained in the enclosure.
The animals must have shelter from inclement weather and sunlight that will accomodate all the animals at the
same time. One must consider size of animals as well as individual compatibilities when determining whether the
amount of space is adequate.
