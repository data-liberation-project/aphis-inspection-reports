ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****In the Zoo Barn pharmacy area there were expired medications were found upon inspection. Ten bottles of oral
antibiotics and 12 bags lactated ringers solution (fluid replacement) expired August 2014, one bottle of dewormer
expired May 2014, and one bottle probiotic supplement expired August 2013.
***In the Elephant Barn pharmacy, there were 7 boxes of Atropine Sulfate and 10 boxes of Neo-Poly-Dex that all
expired June 2013. These eye ointments were not being used at the time of inspection.
The use of expired medication is not considered acceptable veterinary practice and therefore inconsistent with
adequate veterinary care according to the Animal Welfare Act. Administering expired medication, can have a lower
efficacy and can be ineffective in the prevention and/or treatment of diseases and conditions. The Licensee must
ensure that all medications used on regulated animals are within the expiration dates.TO BE CORRECTED BY: 17

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the Zoo Barn that houses llamas and goats, the indoor section of enclosure # 16 had several holes, tears, and
rips on the back wall exposing the building's frame. This is the result of the goats chewing on it. This can be
hazardous to animals because animal limbs could get caught in these openings. Within the outdoor section of
enclosure #9, housing a young llama and several kids, there was metal wire covering the wood fencing surrounding
big tree within that area had several parts were broken leaving sharp, pointy edges that were in direct contact with
the animals. Four goats were chewing on this wiring at time of inspection. Sharp points and jagged edges can
injure the animals.
***Aoudad primary enclosure entrance gate was hard to open due to the gate interlocking mechanism being bent
and worn down. In the rear of the enclosure, the large climbing rock was a missing patch outer covering material, at
the base of the structure. Since the animals actively climb this structure, exposed jagged edges could be injurious
them. The licensee must ensure that enclosures and their contents are maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury.
This inspection was conducted on October 1 and 2 with facility representatives. The exit conference was conducted
October 2, 2014 with facility representatives.
