2.1(a)(1) REPEAT
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This business has had a packet delivered but has not sent in the required documents to become a licensed
exhibitor. The owner has, over the past years, been notified both officially and unofficially that they are required to
be licensed through USDA-Animal Care. The facility advertises the petting of the animals at this facility. Inside the
store associated with the facility, food is being sold for the feeding of the animals. Any person operating or intending
to operate as an exhibitor, must receive and maintain a USDA class "C" license. A person must be 18 years of age
or older to obtain a license. A person seeking a license shall apply on a form which will be furnished by the AC
Regional Director in the State in which that person operates or intends to operate. The applicant shall provide the
information requested on the application form, including a valid mailing address through which the licensee or
applicant can be reached at all times, and a valid premises address where animals, animal facilities, equipment, and
records may be inspected for compliance. The applicant shall file the completed application form with the AC
Regional Director. This facility owner has been supplied, on several occasions, all the required documents to apply
for a license.


2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is no responsible attendant available when the public buys the food inside the facility store, and goes outside
to feed the animals. This leaves an opportunity for the public or the animals to be put in harms way. A responsible,
knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public
contact.,
This inspection and exit interview was conducted by the ACI, with the facility owner.
