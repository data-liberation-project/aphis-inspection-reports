2.27(a)

Notification of change of operation.
Kalitta Air LLC did not have a site listed for JFK New York Airport on the registration at the time of inspection. 54 dogs
were transported on 5-January-2023 on flight K4815 from Zhengzhou, China (AWB #272-73025470 and AWB #272-
72852522) without an active site at JFK New York Airport. The registrant is required to notify the Deputy Administrator of
any change in address within 10 days of making such change.
3.14(c)(3)

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
54 dogs were shipped from Zhengzhou, China on flight K4815 (AWB #272-73025470 and AWB #272-72852522) and
were observed by inspectors in their primary enclosures after they were unloaded from the aircraft on January 6th, 2023.
These dogs were en route for approximately 16.5 hours; this does not include the time it took to load them onto the
aircraft in Zhengzhou or unload them off of the aircraft in New York. There were not any shipper’s certifications regarding
the last time food and water had been offered or specific feeding and watering instructions during transport attached to
any of the primary enclosures.
At the time of accepting a dog for shipment, the carrier must ensure that the consignor provides certification of the last
time food and water was offered and specific feeding and watering instructions for a 24 hour period. This information is


necessary to ensure that the animals receive food at least once every 24 hours, potable water at least once every 12
hours, and both as often as necessary for each individual animal’s good health. The certification and feeding instructions
should be clearly displayed on the carrier during transit. The airline must ensure that the consignor has provided this
information in writing to ensure that animals are adequately cared for while in transit.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Five primary enclosures containing dogs shipped from Zhengzhou, China on flight K4815 (AWB #272-73025470 and
AWB #272-72852522) were observed with sharp points in the enclosure. The food and water receptacles in these
enclosures were held on to the enclosure door by thin gauge wire. The Golden Retrievers in enclosures #8367, 8364,
8369, the Labrador Retriever in enclosure #8483, and the Pug in enclosure #8972 were able to pull the receptacles off of
the enclosure door. This resulted in the wire points protruding into the primary enclosure towards the animal contained
within. Sharp points may cause injury to the dogs housed in each enclosure. The interior of the primary enclosure must
have no sharp points and no protrusions that could injure the animal contained in it.
3.15(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
None of the 54 primary enclosures containing dogs shipped from Zhengzhou, China on flight K4815 (AWB #272-
73025470 and AWB #272-72852522) were marked on top or any of the sides with the words “Live Animals” in letters at
least 1 inch high. Clearly marking enclosures that contain live animals ensures that they are readily identifiable by
handling personnel and proper care will be taken when handling them. Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the
conveyance, each enclosure must be clearly marked on top and on one or more sides the words “Live Animals” in letters
at least 1 inch high.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
39 of the 54 primary enclosures, each housing one adult dog, did not have sufficient bedding to absorb and cover excreta
during a 16.5-hour trip from Zhengzhou, China on flight K4815 (AWB #272-73025470 and AWB #272-72852522). Many
enclosures were bedded with a thin layer of newspaper, which was completely soaked and shoved to the back or the front
of the enclosures. Some enclosures did not have any bedding visible. In all these 39 enclosures, the solid, leakproof
flooring was wet and there were accumulations of solid waste and each dog had direct contact with their excreta. The
dogs were in various states of soiled from wet feet to wet, soiled fur on feet, hind ends, tails, and chests. A strong
ammonia odor was present in and around approximately five enclosures. Direct contact with excreta for several hours
presents a disease hazard to the animals.
Carriers must ensure that primary enclosures with solid floors contain enough previously unused litter material to absorb
and cover excreta. The litter material must be of a suitably absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Two primary enclosures, each housing one adult dog, were not large enough to ensure that the animals contained could
stand in a normal position. A 3.5-year-old female Labrador Retriever in crate #8482, “Zella” (MC# 900239877798482),
could not raise her head all the way due to her head touching the top of the kennel. A 4.5-year-old male Labrador
Retriever in Crate #8672, “Ward” (MC# 900239877798672), could not raise his head at all above the shoulders; his back
was touching the top of kennel when in a normal standing position. The top of the plastic primary enclosure was observed
by inspectors to be flexing up and down with each of the dog’s motions inside.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs must be large enough to ensure each animal has enough space to turn
about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect and to lie in a natural position.


3.17(c)

Food and water requirements.
Seven primary enclosures containing dogs shipped from Zhengzhou, China on flight K4815 (AWB #272-73025470 and
AWB #272-72852522) did not have food and water receptacles securely attached inside their primary enclosures. The
following enclosures had at least one food or water receptacle pulled off the wire door and the receptacle were present on
the floor inside the primary enclosure:
Golden Retriever enclosures 8367, 8369, 8364, 8372; Labrador Retriever enclosures 8483 and 8679; French Bulldog
enclosure 8496. The French bulldog in enclosure 8486 had chewed apart his food receptacle and pieces were present in
the bottom of the crate. Food and water receptacles not securely attached inside the primary enclosure prevents the
containers from being filled from outside of the primary enclosure. This compromises the dogs’ access to food and water
during transit and could cause health issues in the dogs. Food and water receptacles must be securely attached inside
the primary enclosure and placed so that the receptacles can be filled from outside the primary enclosure without opening
the door.
3.18(c) Direct

Care in transit.
Three dogs were observed by inspectors as ill or injured immediately after arrival on flight K4815 from Zhengzhou, China
(AWB #272-73025470 and AWB #272-72852522):
-Male Pug “Hopper” (enclosure #8975, microchip #900239877798975) had an enlarged right eye protruding from the eye
socket. The sclera is red with prominent blood vessels. The surface of the eye appears dark in color, thickened and rough
in texture, and is opaque; the normal structures of the eye cannot be seen. The enlarged globe and thickening of the
surface of the eye are consistent with a chronic disease or injury. There is a focal area ~5mm in diameter of bright red
color on the thickened dark surface of the eye.


-Female French Bulldog “Taylor” (enclosure #8495, microchip #900239877798495) was observed by inspectors to have
several medical issues. When initially observed, she was lying down, quiet, and shivering in the back of her enclosure and
appeared to be breathing heavily. She did not stand or come to the front of the enclosure. When viewed outside of the
enclosure, she demonstrated increased respiratory effort. Her right eye had a small focal opacity, and her left eye had an
irregular surface with a creamy discharge present. She walked stiffly with an abnormal gait and there was a small red
wound on her left hind leg, which she was observed to hold up intermittently while standing. Her genitalia was swollen and
dark in color.
-Female Pug “Emma” crate #8980 microchip #900239877798980 was observed to be quiet and not moving around her
enclosure. She was not observed to stand. When she was removed from the enclosure by the intermediate handler, she
walked with an abnormal gait and appeared to have trouble bearing weight on her hind limbs. When bearing weight on
her right hind leg, it would often slip under her body, causing her to stumble or fall.
It is the responsibility of the transporter to observe the dogs as frequently as possible to ensure no dogs are ill, injured, or
in physical distress and to provide care accordingly. If a dog is obviously ill, injured or in physical distress, it must not be
transported in commerce, except to receive veterinary care for the condition.

This inspection was conducted with animal facility representatives. The exit briefing was conducted with an airline
representative by phone on 1/12/2023.
