2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The table at the booth contained two cages-one housed two infant marmosets and the other housed over 10 sugar
gliders. The booth employee attendant sat a few feet behind the table and was handling large parrots for beak trims
with a dremel tool, wing trims and other procedures. This required the attendant's full time attention and led to very
loud vocalizations by the birds. The sugar gliders had no pouches in their enclosure; there was simply a small clear
plastic feeding dish. The gliders were all trying to pile into this enclosure to hide/get away to a quiet area. The use of
pouches or some other dark nest type structure is normal for gliders as they sleep during the daytime. Several bird
species are natural predators and the loud noises can be distressful. In addition, the use of a dremel tool so close
to the mammals may aerosolize flora that may lead to problems in non-bird species. Handling of all animals shall be
done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress or
unnecessary discomfort. Correct today.

MOBILE OR TRAVELING HOUSING FACILITIES.
A cage housing two infant marmosets for sale was set at the edge of a table nearest the visiting public. During the
inspector's visit it was noted that while the employee was busy handling and treating large parrots, the public was
viewing the marmosets and sticking their fingers into the marmoset cage to pet the marmosets. Public contact with
the marmosets may lead to injury to the infant marmosets or to the public. There must be a barrier between
non-human primate cages and the public at any time the public is present or if the public is to have contact with the
non-human primates they must be under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler at all times
when the public is present. Correct today.
3.142(c)
HANDLING.
Two cages were stacked on a table at the corner. The visiting public walk past this table. The bottom cage, housing
multiple sugar gliders, extended past the edge of the table. On top of this cage was a smaller one that housed infantmarmosets. Both cages were of a collapsible type. Stacked cages and cages not securely on the table may be
knocked down or aside leading to injury of the animals. All enclosures used to transport and house live animals
shall not be stacked or handled in a manner that may result in falling. Correct today.
Exit conducted with facility representative.
Inspection conducted at the Nashville Exotic Pet Expo at the Nashville Fairgrounds.
