ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A female Maltese # 186 "March" was very thin with ribs, hips and spine clearly visible, her belly was rounded.
Her hair coat was also in poor condition with thin patches and rough fur. The licensee states that she had groomed
her in the past month and that she appeared to have lost more weight since the grooming. The dog was housed
with several other dogs and had access to dry food. She was moved into a separate enclosure and given a wet/dry
mixed diet which she began to consume. Due to her poor body condition but willingness to eat, there may be
underlying health related issues contributing to her weight loss. Her poor body condition should be communicated to
the attending veterinarian so that he has the ability to give adequate guidance on health related issues.
