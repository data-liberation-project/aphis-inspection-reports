PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(c) Additional requirements for dogs--(1) Space. (ii)
***Within the whelping building there is an enclosure, housing a female American Eskimo and her 6 puppies
(approximately 3 1/2 weeks old), that did not provide the dogs with enough space. The enclosure measured 44.5
inches x 30 inches providing a total of 9.27 ft.squared floor space. This does not include the floor area taken up by
the food and water dishes for available floor space. The adult female was measured at 27 inches. The required floor
space for this dog and her 6 puppies is (27+6)(27+6)/144 = 7.56 ft squared for the adult dog and 7.56 x .05 = .378
ft. squared for each puppy (6 x .378) = 2.27 ft. squared for all 6 puppies totaling a required floor space of 9.83 ft.
squared for all animals in the enclosure. Adequate floor space is required in order to ensure that the animals can
make normal postural adjustments and for their health and well-being. The licensee must remove these dogs from
this enclosure and/or provide them with an enclosure with adequate floor space. The licensee must ensure that all
animals are provided with adequate floor space at all times. To be corrected by: March 20, 2015.
