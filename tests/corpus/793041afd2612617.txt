PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On one of the Marmoset's enclosures, there are several areas of rust on the bottom border and flooring of the cage.
On the Grivet's enclosure, there is significant rusting along the base of the door into the enclosure. The extent of
the rust on the door is affecting it's integrity as there was visible degradation of the metal. Primary enclosures for
nonhuman primates must be kept in good repair for the safety of the animals.

Correct by repairing all rust-covered surfaces and damaged areas. Correct by May 4, 2018.
