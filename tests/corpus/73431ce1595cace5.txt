SANITATION.
Section 3.56(a)(1) Cleaning of primary enclosures: The floor of the hutches were wet with an accumulation of feces
in three enclosures housing one rabbit each and in one enclosure housing three rabbits. Wet floors and feces can
provide an optimal area for the growth of bacteria and mold/fungi which may cause the rabbits to become ill. The
hutches must be kept reasonably free of excreta for the health and comfort of the rabbits. The feces and soiled
bedding were removed during the inspection. The cleaning of the rabbit hutches must be improved.
