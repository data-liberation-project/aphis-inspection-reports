ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Eight individually housed nonhuman primates in one room and seven individually housed in another room do not
have visual contact with other nonhuman primates The enclosures in one room are arranged in a way that all
animals face one direction and in the other room the plexi-glass viewing plate between each cage has become
opaque so clear viewing of another animal would not be possible. Viewing other primates is an important part of
social needs of the animals especially when individually housed. Individually housed nonhuman primates must be
able to see and hear each other unless the attending veterinarian determines that it would endanger their health
safety or well being. CORRECT BY : 9--7-16

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
One male rhesus macaque was observed to have a fresh wound on his right arm . This animal has a long history of
abnormal behavior including SIB ( self injurious behavior ) wounds. Review of his medical record indicate he has
been treated for SIB wounds to his arm at least three times in the last five months. He was receiving food
enrichment at time of the inspection, however there were no other enrichment items noted inside his enclosure.
There is a notation in his medical record on 8/8/16 that his enclosure would be modified so he could perform a food
oriented task behavior which in the past has greatly decreased the self injurious behavior. The enclosure has not
yet been modified. Non human primates that show signs of being in psychological distress must be provided special
attention based on the needs of the individual species and in accordance with instructions from the attending
veterinarian . CORRECT BY : 9-2-16The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with facility veterinarians and staff.
