2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
Since the last full inspection of the non-human primate facilities (11/1/2016) there have been five incidents with
non-human primates that resulted in the need for wound closure (suturing) and partial digit amputations. Four of
these incidents occurred with macaques getting out of their primary enclosures due to human error or enclosure
failure. The macaque(s) were able to get out of their enclosure and then either sustained or caused injuries in the
course of uncontrolled interactions with other macaques housed in the same secure room. Incidents of primary
enclosure exits that caused injuries needing sutures and/or partial digit amputations occurred on 2/13/18 (1
macaque affected), 3/15/18 (1 macaque affected), 3/3/17 (1 macaque affected), and 5/24/17 (2 macaques affected).

One incident involved a marmoset getting its right hind foot closed in an enclosure door on 10/18/17 and 11/6/17.
Both incidents caused injuries to its right hind foot and required partial digit amputations of the affected foot. The
affected marmoset was observed on the inspection and found to ambulate without problem and adjustments to the
enclosures to prevent further incidents were observed.
Note: Affected animals were treated promptly by clinical veterinary staff. The facility previously identified these
incidents and reported them to the overseeing ACUC and steps to prevent future occurrences were taken.
This was an inspection of the animals and records maintained under the College of Letters and Sciences and a
review of the records pertaining to animals maintained under the WNPRC and the overseeing ACUC's records.
This inspection was conducted on 6/12 - 6/13 and the exit interview was conducted with facility representatives on
6/14/2018.
