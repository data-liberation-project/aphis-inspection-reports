HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During a public exhibition on May 18, 2016, a male lion cub named Atlas (aged 16 weeks, 2 days) was handled by a
member of the public on an open porch at the facility. Photographs of the incident show the animal being held off
the ground by a standing individual who grasped the lion(cid:25)s chest under the front legs. There was no harness or
leash on the lion. In one photograph the lion appeared to be struggling and pushing away from the individual holding
him. A gate into the facility from the public, two-lane road was open at the time of the incident with the gate being
approximately 140 feet from the porch and the road approximately 30 feet beyond the gate.
During public exhibition animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public.
The sixteen week old lion Atlas was of sufficient size and strength during the May 18, 2016 inspection to cause
harm to, or escape from, a member of the public. Animals of this size and age should have sufficient distance
and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public to assure the safety of both the animal and the
public.
Correct immediately for all future public exhibitions.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
