3.80(a)(2)(iii) Critical

Primary enclosures.
On June 22, 2022, an adult, male Olive Baboon escaped from his primary enclosure, bit an employee on the forearm, and
was euthanized. The baboon enclosure consists of an indoor portion and an outdoor portion. The baboons are locked
inside the indoor portion at night. The indoor portion has a keeper area that is accessed from an exterior door and also
has an interior door that opens into the outdoor portion of the enclosure. A facility manager entered the keeper area and
released the baboon from its indoor enclosure into the outer enclosure. When leaving, he neglected to close the throw
latch on the interior door or to engage the lock on the doorknob, allowing the baboon to enter the keepers' work area after
the manager left. Entry through the exterior door is via a digital keypad on the outside, but does not lock from the inside.
Therefore, the baboon was able to open the exterior door and leave the enclosure. Unsecured primary enclosures can
allow animals to escape, become injured, and/or injure other animals or humans. The licensee must ensure that primary
enclosures contain the nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening
by the animal.

NOTE: The licensee installed a throw latch on the outer door so that it cannot be opened from the inside.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
