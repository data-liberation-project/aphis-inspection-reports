2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The written Program of Veterinary Care for this facility is not current and lack specific information. The PVC was
last signed by the attending veterinarian in April 2015. Additionally, the sections addressing ectoparasites and
emergency care are blank. This written PVC must be complete and comprehensive enough that adequate
guidance for the veterinary care of the animals is on hand to ensure appropriate care for all animals at the facility.
Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current
practices at the facility and also does not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary
care to the animals. Correct this by developing and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary
Care.
