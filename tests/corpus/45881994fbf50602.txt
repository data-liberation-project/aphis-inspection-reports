2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***** The following medication was past the labeled expiration date: one bottle of injectible Pen-Aqueous antibiotic
with an expiration date of January 2013. This medication was on a table with other products that are currently being
used at the facility and was therefore ready for use. The use of expired medications is not considered to be an
acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. Expired drugs may not work as
anticipated, could become contaminated, and could harm the animals. The licensee must ensure that all
medications maintained for and used on the animals are not expired, are labeled, and are used based on the written
instructions of a veterinarian.
TO BE CORRECTED BY CLOSE OF BUSINESS THIS DAY (APRIL 22, 2015)
Inspection and exit interview was conducted by Katy Vernon, ACI and Bill Heine, ACI with a facility representative.
Note: Bedding was provided in the shelters in the outdoor enclosures.
