ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:15-1:45pm
on 18-DEC-18.
I tried to make contact at the facility. I honked my car horn and called the number on file to leave a voice mail. I
waited in the driveway for 30 minutes prior to departing the facility.
