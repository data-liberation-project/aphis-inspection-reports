There was a sow (#858) in room 6 of the farrowing area that had an injury to her right front leg. There was a scrape
approximately 3-5 inches long and 2 inches wide that had a yellowish color and was slick with a fluid, possible
infection or tissue fluid due to the irritation. There was a flap of skin hanging on the let and did appear to be a few
days old. The sow was also observed to be shaking her head continuously, tilting her head to the left and appeared
to have moderate discomfort with her head with some irritation in her left ear.
-There was a sow (#97) that had a swelling approximately 3-4 inches on her right knee that had an approximate 1
inch circular protrusion from the center of it that was pink/red in color. This was a previously treated abscess from
May 4th-7th 2015 and appeared healed at that time, however at this time this area has become misshaped with a
strange center around the knee area and has an issue that should be looked at by a veterinarian.
-There were three 3 month old pigs out of 150 pigs being moved to the nursery barn, that had facial injuries around
their eyes and noses covered with a thick brown crusty material. There were areas on their faces where the skin
was cracked, red and raw in appearance. There has been no treatment for these issues at this time and the
veterinarian has not been consulted or seen either health issue by the time of the inspection.
Untreated injuries can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort to the regulated animals, and left untreated can
become infected or cause chronic issues depending on the affliction.
The veterinarian must be contacted for proper diagnosis and treatment of any injuries or illnesses as soon as they
are observed, and/or the animals should be treated according to protocols set up by their attending veterinarian for
injuries/illnesses once they are observed.
Note: The attending veterinarian was contacted by the end of the inspection and preliminary treatment was provided
to all animals mentioned by the facility employee during the inspection.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 2 sows (#858 and #97) and 3 three month old pigs that had injuries that had not been observed ortreated until during the inspection.
The lack of thorough daily observations of all regulated animals can cause a treatable condition when caught early
to become unnecessarily painful and cause discomfort for the animal. Minor injuries or illnesses can then become
infected or chronic if left untreated for prolonged periods of time, depending on the issue.
There must be daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being and provided further, That a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Upon arrival at the facility there was a trailer being loaded with 150 three month old,12-15 pound pigs that were
being transported from the farrowing barn to the nursery barn down the road. The carts used to transport the pigs
(approx. 4' L x 3' deep x 3' W) from their current location to the trailer were over loaded 3 to 4 pig layers deep. At
the point of unloading a young employee was grabbing the pigs by the leg and tossing them into the trailer and
dropping them from his standing height, resulting in the animals falling 1-2 feet onto the floor. The pace this handler
was grabbing and tossing the pigs was so fast that the pigs dropped were unable to stand up and move out of the
way before the second and third pigs were dropped on top of them. This resulted in the squealing and thumping that
was heard in the lot that drew the inspectors' attention upon arrival. The second cart behind this one was also
loaded 3 pigs deep, however this older employee did unload the pigs properly by dropping them into the trailer at a
height that allowed them to stand and move out of the way before the next pig was put in, and they were picked up
by the body when moved.
The mass loading of the carts and handling of pigs from the carts into the trailer was corrected immediately for the
remainder of the loading of 150 pigs. The last 50-60 pigs had been transported in the crates in the appropriate
numbers resulting in only a single layer of pigs at a time. And they were set in the trailer properly and with enough
time to move. There were no injuries observed during the loading of these pigs during the inspection.
It is imperative that proper handling and transport of the regulated animals is observed in order to prevent any
stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort to the animals.
The licensee must make sure that all regulated animals are handled properly to prevent unnecessary stress or
possibility of injuries, and that all employees are trained to handle the animals properly.
To be corrected by: The NCI was corrected immediately during the inspection and from this day forward
Note: The licensee advised that proper handling training will be immediately provided to all employees and closemonitoring will be implemented from this day forward.

SANITATION.
There were several rooms in the farrowing and gestation barn that had an accumulation of clutter in the isle or in the
corner of the rooms. The clutter would consist of unused lights, buckets or hoses, and an unused feeder hanging
from the ceiling that needs to be removed.
Clutter in the facility alongside of the regulated animals can be a source of possible injury to the animals as they are
moved into or out of their stalls. Piles of clutter can also be areas for vermin to reside and be a source of disease to
the regulated animals.
All trash and clutter shall be removed or stored in appropriate areas to facilitate good husbandry practices and keep
the premises clean and in good repair.

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There is a problem with the lack of fly control methods being used in several of the farrowing rooms and in the 3
gestation barns. While the facility does occasionally utilize a spray to control the flies, currently the situation has
become increasingly worse with thick swarms of flies located near the cooling cells in the gestation barns and
moderate amounts near the doorways and the front stalls of several farrowing rooms. Currently, the fly control
methods are lacking and need to be reincorporated in regular maintenance of the facility. While there are several
mouse trap(PVC pipe bait holders) present throughout the facility, only approximately 1 out of 4 have any bait in
them, and there is evidence of large quantities of mouse droppings around the bait holders, cluttered areas and
along the walls. There was a block of mouse bait sitting on a windowsill approximately 3-4 feet from the feeding
trough of several sows. It would be very easy for that block of mouse bait to be knocked off of the sill and fall into
the trough where it would likely be eaten by the sows.Flies and mice can be sources of disease and other health issues if left unmanaged and in contact with the
regulated animals.
The facility must implement a continual program of pest management as needed, and keep mouse traps baited and
assure that the bait cannot come in contact with the regulated animals.
To be corrected by: June 15, 2015
Note: The mouse bait on the window sill was removed during the inspection
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative and by phone with the owner and facility
manager.
