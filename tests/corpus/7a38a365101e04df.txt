Watering
None of the dogs in the kennel had access to potable water. The majority of animals had no water at all, and the
remainder had water that was contaminated with straw and other debris. Multiple dogs drank enthusiastically as the
water pails were filled, with several drinking longer than 30 seconds without pause. Lack of water can have a severe,
negative impact on the health and welfare of animals, particularly in warm and/or humid weather. All dogs must have
continuous access to potable water, unless restricted by the attending veterinarian for medical reasons.
