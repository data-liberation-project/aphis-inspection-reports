ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult, black and white Shih-Tzu female named "Penny" and identified by tag number 150 has a right eye with an
abnormal appearance. The entire eye is cloudy with a blue-grey color. The eye also does not have a visible pupil.
The licensee stated that the problem with the eye was noticed this morning. The licensee also stated the dog has
not been seen by a veterinarian. During the inspection, the licensee removed the dog from the enclosure and
applied medicated eye drops to the affected eye. The medication being used is Ciprofloxacin Hydrochloride
Ophthalmic Solution 0.3%. This bottle of medication has an expiration date of November 2008.
The abnormal appearance of the eye could be an indication of injury, infection, or other medical issues. The
licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. Documentation should be available for all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended
treatment must be part of the documentation.
The usage of expired medication on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and
does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when
expired drugs are administrated to dogs could be drastically changed or not work as anticipated. The licensee must
ensure that all medications being used are not expired and used properly in accordance with standard veterinary
practices. The expired medication was disposed of at the time of inspection.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
To be corrected by: September 21, 2015.
