3.14(c) Repeat

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
The carrier did not obtain certification statements with the required information for dogs and cats transported between
September – November 2021. Upon inspection, the carrier stated they discontinued the use of certification statements,
thinking the forms were no longer required. The absence of these certifications does not assure that the animals will be
offered food and water at required frequencies when the animals are in transport.
Carries and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog or cat for transport unless the consignor certifies in writing to the
carrier or intermediate handler that the dog or cat was offered food and water within four hours preceeding delivery to the
carrier or intermediate handler. Instructions provided must be in compliance with 3.17 and provide the required
information for each dog and cat.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and facility representative.
