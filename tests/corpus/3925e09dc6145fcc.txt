ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****10-week-old English Bulldog puppies from the same litter (born December 12, 2013) had not received veterinary
care for a medical condition. Four of the six puppies had a wet, non-productive cough and repeatedly coughed
during the inspection. The licensee stated that she had not noticed the coughing and that the puppies had not
received any treatment. Untreated medical conditions can worsen, can be painful, and may be contagious to other
dogs in the kennel. The licensee must have these dogs examined by a veterinarian. The licensee must keep
records of the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care and must make these records available to the inspector
upon request.
****An adult Boxer named "Titan" had small areas of reddened skin and hair loss on his neck, chin, and chest. The
licensee stated that she was not aware of the current skin condition and that it looked like his previous case of
demodex "was coming back." She had medical records showing that this dog had been treated for demodectic
mange for 4 weeks beginning in October, 2013. Untreated medical conditions can worsen, can be painful, and may
be contagious to other dogs in the kennel. The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian. The
licensee must keep records of the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care and must make these records available
to the inspector upon request.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Live puppies and kittens
There were 7 weaned puppies under 16 weeks of age and from at least 3 different litters housed in the same
enclosure. These puppies did not have individual identification on them. Appropriate identification of dogs is
necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation.
The licensee must properly identify these animals.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: 1 MARCH 20143.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Wind break and rain break at the entrance
There were 5 plastic shelters, housing a total of 6 adult English Bulldogs, in the back row of outdoor enclosures that
did not have a wind break or rain break. Wind breaks and rain breaks provide additional protection for the dogs
from inclement weather. Dogs that cannot remain warm and dry can become ill, stressed, and uncomfortable. The
owner must provide wind breaks and rain breaks for all outdoor shelters at all times.
3.6(a)(2)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Protect the dogs from injury.
A primary enclosure, housing one adult English Bulldog, was constructed of chain link fencing that had been
compromised in several areas, resulting in holes that were large enough for the dog to stick its head through. The
dog pushed its head through the holes in the chain link fence several times during the inspection. Holes this size in
the fencing can result in injury and/or entrapment. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are
maintained so that they protect the animals from injury.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MARCH 1, 2014.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
