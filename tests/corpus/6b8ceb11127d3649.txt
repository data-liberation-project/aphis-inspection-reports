3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
During the inspection, of a facility housing 33 adult dogs, the inspector noticed quite a bit of buildup of dirt on the lip of the
feeders and at the bottom. When asked about sanitation schedule the licensee said that they power washed the feeders,
dog houses, and surfaces of enclosures once every six months. Buildup of dirt can attract bacteria, pets, and cause
diseases. The licensee must ensure that any used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles must be sanitized
at least once every two weeks.
