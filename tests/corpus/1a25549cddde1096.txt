FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence separating the Camel from the Giraffe is bent down from the animals pushing or pressing on it. The fence
also has protruding sharp points that could injure the animals.
The large utility poles used in the fencing, have chain link fence wrapped around them. The chain link at the top of
these poles is coming loose creating sharp points that may scratch, cut, or otherwise injure the animals.
Some of the areas of the tin used in the construction of the camel and giraffe barn are pulling away from the
structure and creating sharp edges. This is reducing the structural strength of the building.
The stairway that goes up the side of the outside of the Giraffe barn, leading into the Camel barn, is in total
disrepair. There are nails sticking out and pieces of wood missing. The railings are loose and very ricketty,
indicating the stairs are not structurally sound.
These areas of disrepair need to be replaced or repaired for the well being of the animals and to allow safe
inspection of the barn.

SANITATION.
(c) Housekeeping.
The space between the barrier fence and primary fence of the lion enclosure is grown up with high weeds. This
condition serves as a breeding space for rodents, vermin and other unwanted pests. The grounds need to be cut
and kept in a manner which facilitates the well being of the animals.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted by the ACI, VMO, and the facility representative.Additional Inspectors
