The plywood on top of the tiger's shelter box and resting platforms is very worn and beginning to splinter.
There are several nail heads protruding from the back resting platform for the 2 male cougars.One board on the
front resting platform has split and no longer appears to be structurally strong.These areas may cause injury to the
animals and must be repaired or replaced. Enclosures must be maintained on a regular basis to ensure they are
structurally strong and kept in good repair to prevent injury.
