ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:00 pm on
02-Aug-17.
The inspector arrived at the facility at 3:00 pm and knocked on the door and rang the doorbell. A neighbor arrived
and stated that the licensee was not at home. The inspector called the phone number which went straight to an
automated voice that stated the voice mailbox was not set up. The inspector drove to town in order to receive a
better phone signal and called the phone number at 3:11 pm and 3:26 pm and was not able to leave a message.
