FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are 4 white-tailed deer kept in an enclosure. The enclosure has no dry area in it. The deer have to walk
through puddles to get to their food or water. There is a large Maple tree in the enclosure that is used for the deer's
natural shelter that has no dry ground under it.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water.
Provide a method to eliminate the excess water in the enclosure so that the animals contained have dry access to
food, water and dry shelter. Standing water can cause growth of insect vermin and can be a vector for disease.
To be corrected by July 2, 2018.
