2.1(a)(1) Critical

Requirements and application.
The licensee holds an A licensee which only allows sales of puppies born and bred on the licensed premises. Currently,
the licensee has six puppies (three different breeds) listed for sale on a website with availability 4/2021-6/2021. There
were no breeding dogs on the premises this Spring, so there should be no puppies available for sale during this time
period. A different type of license is required to be able to sell puppies from other breeders. The licensee must not acquire
puppies from other sources and sell them without first getting a B license.
