3.1(f) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The facility provides the dogs with animal bones to chew in order to help maintain the dogs' dental health. In one
enclosure, containing two adult dogs, there is a large buildup of old and fresh animal bones. The buildup of bones could
attract pests such as flies and mice which could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

Housing facilities must provide for the regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of food waste, debris,
garbage, water, and any other waste. The licensee must eliminate the buildup of old bones from the dog enclosure in
order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The facility is not removing the dog feces from the enclosures on a daily basis. At least 5 outdoor enclosures, containing
an approximate total of 14 dogs, have a heavy buildup of old and fresh feces. The older feces are dried and appear white
in color indicating they have been there for some time. A buildup of feces could increase the risk of disease towards the
dogs.

Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily. The licensee must remove the old and fresh

feces from the enclosures and ensure all waste is removed daily in order to support the health of the animals.

To be corrected by: From this day forward feces must be removed from enclosures daily.
3.13(a)(2)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The program of veterinary care is missing how often the dogs will be physically examined by the attending veterinarian.
The licensee stated that the adult dogs are to be examined once every 12 months and the puppies are examined before
they are sold. This information is not documented in writing on the program of veterinary care. A complete program of
veterinary care, including the time frame that physical exams are received, is necessary to ensure the animals are
receiving adequate veterinary care and are being maintained in good health.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes how often the dogs will be physically examined by the attending
veterinarian. The licensee must add to the program of veterinary care how often the adult dogs and puppies are
examined by the attending veterinarian.

3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The program of veterinary care is missing the written preventative care and treatment plans to ensure healthy hair coats,
skin, ears, eyes, teeth and properly trimmed toenails. A complete program of veterinary care, including preventative care
and treatment plans, is necessary to ensure the animals are being maintained in good health and receive adequate

veterinary care should a concern be identified.

Each dealer, exhibitor, and research facility must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is
developed, documented in writing, and signed by the attending veterinarian that includes preventative care and treatment
plans to ensure healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin, and
teeth. The licensee must add these plans to the program of veterinary care.
