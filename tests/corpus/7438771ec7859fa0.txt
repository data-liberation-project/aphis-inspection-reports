FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the male black bear enclosure, a section of the bottom shelter wall is in disrepair. The wall is made of corrugated
metal and has a rusted, jagged edge that is accessible to the bear. This area of the shelter wall could potentially
injure the animal.
Repair or replace the affected section of the shelter wall.
The degu enclosure wire floor was in disrepair during the time of inspection. In two sections of the enclosure,
several of the wires were broken with sharp edges exposed or were completely missing. Two of the degus were
observed in a pan directly beneath the enclosure. The sharp wire edges could injure the animals. The missing
wires could allow the animals to potentially escape from the enclosure.
Repair or replace the affected areas of the wire floor.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The camel pen contained a substantial amount of standing water and thick mud during the time of inspection. The
camel was unable to walk from the shelter to its feeding area and water source with trudging through the mud and
standing water.
The Hereford bull and the llama pen contained a substantial amount of thick mud during the time of inspection. All
four of the Hereford bull's legs were observed to be muddy.
The pen containing the two pigs had a substantial amount of thick mud and some standing water during the time of
inspection. The pigs were unable to walk to their feeding area or water source without trudging through the mud
and standing water.While each of these animal pens had a limited amount of dry space, the majority of the pens were wet. Insufficient
drainage resulting with standing water and thick mud can cause foot and hoof problems for the animals.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water from the animal pens.

SANITATION.
In the Brown bear enclosure, one of the shelters was wet and soiled with excessive food wastes during the time of
inspection. The shelter is used as the primary feeding area for the animals as per the licensee. This shelter also
serves as one of two dens for the five Brown bears within the enclosure. Food wastes and soiled areas can harbor
disease. Additionally, the soiled shelter does not provide the bears with a second clean and dry den.
Remove all food wastes, clean the area, and repeat as necessary to prevent build up.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee on 11/5/19. An additional exit briefing was
