3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were at least 15 enclosures housing 33 dogs that had wood and or plastic that was chewed typically around
the egress doors on the wall surface. The amount varied from small areas to the entire surround. Some of the
edges were significantly chewed which created large holes/gaps in the wood. In one enclosure the hole/gap was big
enough that the dog(cid:25)'s head would fit through. All of the interior surfaces of the shelter portion of the "short runs"
were chewed or worn. In one enclosure the outside wall of the shelter was plastic attached to wood. Along the
bottom edge the dogs had chewed the plastic exposing the wood and started to chew on the wood. Several water
and food buckets had chewed edges. Some edges of the food and water buckets were freshly chewed and
appeared clean, and other areas had a buildup of dirt and hair.
Chewed and worn surfaces can not be readily cleaned and sanitized which can lead to disease hazards. All
surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The damaged and worn wood and plastic must be replaced or
altered in a manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces
remain in good repair at all times.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, ACI Bartels, and VMO Cole.
