SANITATION.
There is spilled feed, shavings, empty food bags, clutter and excreta on the floor just as you enter the facility. This
is also the location where food is stored. When objects were moved in this area, several black bugs were noticed to
be crawling around. The pests identified on today's inspection are a direct result of improper cleaning and the
availability of a food supply and locations for the unwanted pests to hide. The Licensee cleaned this area prior to
the exit briefing. The Licensee must ensure that there are methods in place to keep the building and grounds clean,
free of clutter and the accumulation of trash to prevent future pest issues and the contamination of food.
