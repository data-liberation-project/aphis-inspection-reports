2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection a degu was found to have an approximately 2.5 cm in diameter lesion in the middle of its
back. Based on the appearance of the lesion, the injury occurred more than a day ago. The licensee indicated that
he had not noticed the lesion prior to the inspection and had not been in contact with the attending veterinarian
regarding the injury. Appropriate methods to identify/observe sick, dying, and/or injured animals must be used to
ensure proper diagnoses and treatment of those affected animals in providing adequate veterinary care. A program
of adequate veterinary care must be in place to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries for the
health and well being of the animals housed in the facility. Ensure that all employees are properly trained to make
observations and report any and all animals that show signs of sickness and/or injury in addition to contacting the
attending veterinarian regarding the proper care of the animals.
