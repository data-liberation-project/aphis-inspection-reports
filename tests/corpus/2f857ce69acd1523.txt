WATERING.
There were accumulations of brown debris and staining on the automatic water valves and PVC water pipe. These
accumulations around the water valves and water pipe expose the guinea pigs to potential disease infections with
bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Water receptacles such as automatic water valves and water pipes must be kept
clean and sanitized whenever dirty and at least once every two weeks. Inadequate cleaning of the automatic water
valves and PVC water pipe can result in contamination of the guinea pigs in the same enclosure and located in
lower enclosures from those above. Licensee must establish and maintain a program to keep the water valves and
PVC water pipe sanitized when dirty, and must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by January 14,
2017.
