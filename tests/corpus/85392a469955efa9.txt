2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A goat with identification # 21135 was observed around 10:30 AM by the Animal Care inspectors. The goat
appeared to be very depressed, with its head and ears down, reluctant to walk, and breathing in a loud, heavy
manner. Records showed that this goat was under treatment for urinary calculi, and it may have been depressed in
part due to treatment with acepromazine that morning, which can have a sedative effect, but also helps to relax the
urinary tract and allow stones to pass. The regularly on-site veterinarian was on vacation for the current week, and
the off-site attending veterinarian was not scheduled to be there until the next day. Around 3:30 PM the goat was
examined again by the Animal Care inspectors, and it was found to be lying sternal, head flexed back toward its
flank, and vocalizing with most breaths, in a manner suggestive of pain and agonal distress. The veterinary
technician was summoned, and reported that she had recently treated the animal, but had been unable to contact
the attending veterinarian. Staff indicated they did not have an alternate emergency veterinary provider, and they
were unable to contact the attending veterinarian. The staff eventually decided to euthanize the goat, and around
4:15 PM the goat was euthanized by the staff on site. A veterinarian was never contacted prior to euthanizing the
goat.
Each research facility is expected to have in place a program of veterinary care that includes the availability of
emergency care. Allowing 21135 to suffer throughout the day without the consult of a veterinarian was not in the
best interest of the welfare of this animal.
Steps should be taken to ensure that emergency veterinary care is available at all times, as needed, in order to
safeguard the well-being of the animals on site.
Previous correction date: to have been corrected immediately.
2.33(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The staff made a decision to euthanize goat # 21135 due to the fact that it appeared to be dying and suffering. The
facility has a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP # 4655G-E1 Ver. 1.8) titled (cid:28)Emergency Goat Euthanasia(cid:29). ThisSOP requires that (cid:28)If an emergency euthanasia needs to take place, the Veterinarian is contacted for approval to
euthanize the goat(s).(cid:29) No veterinarian was contacted prior to the euthanasia of the animal.
SOP #4655G-E1 also states that following the use of the captive bolt gun, a secondary, adjunct method of
euthanasia (injection with potassium chloride or magnesium sulfate, in order to stop the heart) is applied. No adjunct
method of euthanasia was administered following the use of the captive bolt gun.
Guidance from a veterinarian and the use of appropriate methods to treat animals are crucial components of
veterinary care and are necessary to avoid and minimize pain and distress in animals. Staff at the facility should
ensure that procedures proscribed by the attending veterinarian in facility SOPs are appropriately followed.
Correct immediately.

MISCELLANEOUS.
Two rabbit primary enclosure doors in the infirmary area were found open and unsupervised. One rabbit was
present in each enclosure. The floor of one enclosure was approximately one foot off the floor and the second
enclosure was approximately three feet off the floor. Jumping or falling out of enclosures to the cement flooring
below could result in serious injuries or death.
Seven small wire enclosures holding one rabbit in each enclosure were found stacked on a cart waiting for blood
collection. The enclosures were not large enough to allow the animals to make normal postural adjustments and did
not appear to provide enough space to allow the animals to turn around. An employee at the facility stated that the
rabbits had been in the enclosures for 30 minutes while other employees were on a break. Two of the enclosures
contained accumulations of feces under the front feet of the animals.
Animals should be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible to prevent trauma, overheating, excessive
cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Enclosure doors should be secured to prevent
the animals from experiencing physical harm or trauma. Time spent in small enclosures used for pre-procedural
holding should be kept to a minimum in order to prevent stress and discomfort.
Correct immediately.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative. Additional Inspectors
