ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The male rhesus with the bald area above his right eye has not received any
diagnostic tests or treatment. Hair loss has many causes such as parasites, infection, injury and hormonal
imbalances. The attending veterinarian must evaluate the hair loss on the male rhesus so the animal may have the
appropriate diagnostic tests and/or treatment to prevent the bald area from expanding or spreading to other areas
on its body.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(3) Veterinary care: The male rhesus has a large bald spot above his right eye extending over the
top of his head on the right side. There is no hair loss on the left side of his forehead. No hair appears to be
growing back in the bald area on the right forehead. The licensee was not aware of the hair loss on the head of the
male rhesus and the veterinarian has not been contacted.
The animals must be observed daily to assess their health and well-being. Timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior and well-being must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so the animals
may receive the appropriate care. The hair loss on the male rhesus must be brought to the attention of the
attending veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The enclosure housing four fallow deer has three loose fence posts leaning
away from the enclosure on the side by the enclosure housing ten fallow deer. The fence posts must be properly
secured into the ground to maintain the height and structural strength of the enclosure fence to contain the deer. The upper and lower fence panels between the first and second loose posts are separating, creating a small gap in
the fencing. A deer may try to stick its head through the gap and get stuck or injured. The fence panels must be
reattached to prevent injury to the deer.
