ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Once again there is no program of veterinary care available for review at either site. Licensees stated they have
changed veterinarians and the veterinarian has not made a premise visit in the last year. This was also a problem
on the inspection dated 4/21/14. Another blank copy of the program of veterinary care was left with the licensee.
The program of veterinary care must be available for review at time of the inspection and the veterinarian must
make regularly scheduled visits to assure that adequate veterinary care is provided.
