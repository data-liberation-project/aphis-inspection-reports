Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The following animals were identified with unaddressed medical concerns:

Three Golden retriever puppies (tag #707 female, #521 female, and possible tag #577 male) have a large amount of
diarrhea with blood on the floor of their enclosure.

Four Golden retriever puppies (tag #599 female, #758 female, #600 female, and #596 female) have a large amount of
diarrhea with blood in their shelter. Golden retriever #599 was also observed coughing continuously while being observed
by the inspectors.

Male Golden retriever (#576) has a severe hacking cough. The puppy appears dirty and unkept as well as lethargic and
depressed. The inspector heard the puppy coughing uncontrollably until it vomited. The puppy then began coughing
again.

Female Shiba Inu (#340) has an abnormal condition of the left eye. The eye appears enlarged and bulging outward from
the eye socket. The eye is cloudy and blue in color and the white of the eye is reddened. Discharge is located along the

hair beneath the eye. The dog also has a thick buildup of brown tartar covering the entire surface of the upper and lower
cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth. The gums are slightly reddened.

Female Pomsky (#706) was coughing and sneezing continuously as it was observed by the inspectors. The inspector
also observed the dog shake its head numerous times after coughing and sneezing.

The inspectors asked the licensee about the sick animals and the licensee stated that his kennel manager was on
vacation and he had just arrived at the facility the previous night. He also stated that he did not know what was going on
at the facility and he did not know how long the puppies had been exhibiting signs of illness. The licensee then said that
he did not know if the kennel manager had been aware that the puppies were ill and could not locate any written
documentation that the illness had been identified.

In addition, upon arriving at the facility, an inspector spoke to an employee who stated that she had told the licensee there
was a coughing puppy in the kennel, but the licensee had said the puppy would be fine and did not need to go to a
veterinarian.

Failure to ensure that health problems are identified on a daily basis and failure to communicate these issues with a
veterinarian in a timely manner may result in unnecessary suffering and even the death of an animal.

Each dealer shall maintain programs of veterinary care that include daily observation of all animals to assess their health
and well-being and direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to a veterinarian. The licensee must ensure that all health issues are

identified on a daily basis and these issues are communicated to a veterinarian in a timely manner.

2.50(a)(2) Repeat

Time and method of identification.
A male Golden retriever puppy (DOB 06/01/21) has no form of identification. The puppy's pen mates are wearing collars
with identification tags, but this particular animal has no collar with a tag or any other form of identification. Identification
is necessary for APHIS officials to identify animals and trace their movements.

A class "A" dealer must identify all dogs under 16 weeks old by the use of an official tag, a distinctive and legible tattoo, or
a plastic-type collar containing the required information. APHIS Officials also accept microchips or written identification
attached to the enclosure (cage cards) for puppies under 16 weeks old provided that these puppies are maintained in
distinct litters and provided that the cage card contains all of the required information. The licensee must apply an official
form of identification to the puppy and the licensee must ensure that all dogs are properly identified at all times.
2.126(a)(2)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The licensee could not locate required documents including the Program of Veterinary Care for review by the inspectors.
Numerous sick dogs were identified during the inspection and failure to provide required documents such as the Program
of Veterinary Care interferes with APHIS official's ability to determine if these dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer shall allow APHIS officials to examine records required to be kept by the Act and regulations. The licensee
must ensure that all required documents are available for inspections and presented to the inspectors for review.

3.1(a) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
In at least ten enclosures, containing a total of approximately thirty adult dogs. The enclosure gates are not properly
fastened creating gaps large enough to allow a dog's head and neck or leg to be placed through. Gaps large enough to
allow a dog to place it's head, neck and/or leg through could cause the dog to become entrapped as well as injure the
animal.

In one enclosure containing six puppies, the shelter contains a large piece of carpet as bedding material. All four edges
of the carpet have been excessively scratched and shredded resulting in a mass of tangled strings. Damaged carpets
could cause injury to the dogs should they consume the carpet strings or should the puppies' toes become entangled in
the mass of strings.

One enclosure, containing one adult female Chow Chow and three puppies, has raised plastic flooring. The sections of
plastic flooring are not secured together properly and as the adult dog walks around the enclosure the sections of flooring
would raise up and snap back down. The unsecured flooring could cause a puppy's foot to become pinched or trapped
resulting in injury.

Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury. The licensee must ensure that
all gates are properly latched and the raised plastic flooring is properly secured. The licensee must also ensure that the
carpet squares are maintained in good repair in order to protect the dogs from injury.

3.1(c)(1)(ii) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
In one shelter, accessed by one adult Corgi, the sharp ends of screws have penetrated through the shelter wall and are
located at the level of the dog.

In one enclosure containing one adult Boston terrier, there is a metal strip that has detached from a post and bent
outward creating a sharp point at the level of the dog. The licensee moved the Boston terrier to a new enclosure at the
time of the inspection.

Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs.

Housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges. The licensee must alter the sharp points in a manner
that eliminates the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all
times.
3.1(f) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The waste from the sheltered building and covered outdoor enclosures runs through a concrete drain in the floor that
disposes of the waste directly outside the building. The drain pipe running out of the building has been attached together
using what appears to be tape. The tape has come apart and the waste is leaking out of the pipe creating a large pool of
feces, hair, urine and other waste material on the immediate outside of the building. Several large piles of feces, hair and
other waste material are also located along the outside of the sheltered housing building. The pooling of the waste is
creating a strong, foul odor of fecal material.


Drains and drainage areas that are not properly maintained could result in a buildup of waste that could attract pests,
create odors, soil animals, and increase the risk of disease hazards.

Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All
drains must be properly constructed, installed, and maintained. The licensee must alter all the drain in a manner that
moves the pool of waste away from the exterior of the sheltered building. The licensee must ensure that all drains are
working properly at all times.
3.4(b)(4) Direct Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.
The ambient temperature for the area has fallen below 50 degrees F at night and according to the Weather Channel the
temperature for the area was 46 degrees F at 7:03 AM the morning before the inspection and was forecasted to fall to 45
degrees F the night of the inspection. The temperature is also scheduled to fall to a low of 38 degrees F by the end of the
week. The following concerns were identified:

Two adult huskies have straw used as bedding material in their shelter which is completely wet, dirty, compacted into
thick layers and contains a powerful smell of ammonia which caused the inspectors sinuses and throat to burn. The
inspector had difficulty pulling the layers of bedding material apart as they were sealed together with wet fecal material.
As the layers separated, a white mold was seen on the bedding material. The affected bedding material is located near
the shelter's access door and the dogs must walk across it to enter and exit their shelter. The dog's have no access to
clean and dry bedding material.

At least four adult dogs and seven puppies have no bedding in their shelters or the bedding consists of a handful of straw.

At least four of these puppies were determined by APHIS Veterinary Medical Officers to be ill.

Failure to provide the dogs with clean, dry bedding material when temperatures are below 50 degrees F does not ensure
the animals can remain comfortable during cold temperatures which could have a negative impact of their health and well-
being.

Shelters in outdoor housing facilities must contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 °F.
The licensee must ensure that each shelter contains clean, dry bedding material whenever the temperature is below 50
degrees F.
3.6(a)(2)(v)

Primary enclosures.
The outdoor runs of the whelping building are covered by a tarp to provide shade for the dogs. After rain storms which
had occurred the previous evening, the tarps are now holding large pools of water, and are continuously dripping water
into the enclosures. At least four enclosures, containing a total of approximately eighteen adult dogs, are affected by the
dripping water and the dogs are at risk of being wetted each time they enter the outdoor sections of their enclosures. One
of these enclosures, housing six Pomskys, is dripping water so quickly that nearly the entire floor has become wet and the
hair on the feet and legs of the dogs is wet. Failure to keep the dogs dry may have a negative impact on their health and
well-being.

Primary enclosures must enable the dogs to remain clean and dry. The licensee must alter the tarps in a manner that
stops the water from dripping into the enclosures and eliminates the risk of the dogs becoming wet. The licensee must
ensure that all enclosures enable the dogs to remain clean and dry at all times.

3.6(a)(2)(x) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
All of the enclosures in the whelping building, housing approximately 111 adults and 87 puppies, have non-compliant
flooring. The floors are constructed of composite boards that are approximately 3 to 4 inches wide, but the gaps between
the boards are wide enough that the legs of puppies and adult dogs will easily fall through them. The inspectors observed
the feet and legs of numerous puppies pass through the openings in the floors.

A small female Pomsky with a poorly healed broken leg is housed on this flooring and she cannot move about with a
normal gait and was observed by the inspectors to walk on three legs at times. Her legs are small enough to easily pass
through the floor openings and combined with her inability to normally ambulate, makes this type of flooring especially
dangerous for her.

The non-compliant flooring had been identified by inspectors months previously, but the licensee has only attempted to
correct the flooring in a few enclosures.

Openings in the flooring that are large enough to allow the dogs' feet and legs to pass through could cause serious injury
to the animals and affect their ability to move about in a normal manner.

Primary enclosures must have floors constructed in a manner that does not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any

openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the floors in a manner that will not allow the feet of the dogs to pass
through. The licensee must ensure that all flooring is safe for the dogs at all times.
3.9(b) Repeat

Feeding
One adult dog has moldy, caked food located inside it's metal dog feeder.

Three enclosures, containing a total of twelve adult dogs, have an excessive amount of wood shavings mixed into their
food. The dogs cannot consume the food without potentially consuming the wood shavings.

Contaminated food may interfere with a dog's desire to eat and its ability to receive adequate nutrition which could result
in poor body condition, illness, and other serious health issues.

Food receptacles must be located so as to minimize contamination. Measures must be taken to prevent molding, caking
and deterioration of the feed. The licensee must remove all contaminates from the feeders and ensure the dogs are
provided with clean and uncontaminated food at all times
3.12 Repeat

Employees
APHIS officials identified eleven NCIs during the inspection including dogs in need of veterinary care. The facility currently
has approximately 2 staff members including the licensee to provide care for 261 dogs. The facility's kennel manager had
sent a letter to APHIS stating that he has resigned from his position and is no longer employed at the facility. The facility
does not have enough employees to maintain compliance. Failure to have a sufficient number of employees to maintain
the facility in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act could have a serious impact on the health and well-being of the

animals.

Each person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations maintaining dogs must have enough employees to carry out the
level of husbandry practices and care required. The licensee must ensure he has a sufficient number of employees to
maintain the facility and dogs in a state of compliance at all times.
3.13(b) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee stated that all the dogs at the facility had received a veterinary exam from a licensed veterinarian the
previous week, but could present no medical records documenting the required exam information including the exam
results for each animal.

During the inspection, numerous sick dogs were identified. The inspector requested all medical records including
vaccination and deworming documentation for the sick animals, but the licensee stated he did not know if there were any
records and did not know where they would be located.

Failure to create and maintain medical records interferes with APHIS official's ability to determine if the dogs are receiving
adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. The
licensee must keep medical records which include the identification information of the dog and the information for any
exams, treatments and care, and any procedures performed.

This inspection was conducted with the licensee.
