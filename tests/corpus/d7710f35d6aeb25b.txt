OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The facility’s perimeter fence includes a brick and mortar wall, livestock fencing and single wire fencing with black
tarps. The front gate of wrought iron, single wire fencing and livestock fencing allows spacing that allow entry to
unauthorized humans or animals the size of dogs. These defects in the perimeter fence compromise its purposes to
protect the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility. Additionally it functions as a secondary containment system for
the animals inside. The perimeter fence must be at least 6ft in height and restrict unauthorized persons and animals
the size of dogs, skunks and raccoons from going through it or under it and having contact with nonhuman primates.
Construction plans (and/or variance requests) must be completed by February 29th, 2020.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility’s perimeter fence and main gate includes a brick and mortar wall, livestock fencing, chain link fencing
and single wire fencing with black tarps. The brick and mortar wall is less than 8ft. The enclosure for the two
wallabies includes a portion of the perimeter fence as part of their enclosure fencing. Additionally, the single wire
fencing with black tarp is not constructed in a manner that keeps out unwanted animals and persons, or acts as a
secondary containment system. The perimeter fence protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility.
Additionally it functions as a secondary containment system for the animals. The perimeter fence must be at least
8ft in height for potentially dangerous animals and restrict unauthorized persons and animals from going through it
or under it. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside wall or fence of the primary enclosure to prevent
physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and outside the perimeter fence.
Construction plans (and/or variance requests) must be completed by February 29th, 2020.
