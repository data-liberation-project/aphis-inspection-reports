FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The camels are contained in a back holding pen of about 50' x 100'. These twelve camels do not have any artifical
or natural shade. At the end of the event, the animals had access to the main arena and there was no shade there
either. The camels shall have sufficient shade by natural or artificial means to allow these animals kept outdoors to
protect themselves from direct sunlight. For the well-being and health of the animals, a system is needed to ensure
that adequate shade is provided at each travel location.
