2.126(a) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
On March 2, 2022 at 1200pm we made contact (in person) with the licensee at the facility in order to conduct a routine
inspection.

The licensee was home at the facility, however he advised us that he was not able to take time for an inspection due to
having chores on the farm and preparations for cement the next day, and that he had 4 helpers waiting on him after lunch.
We asked if we could do a focused inspection on the four big cats, however he stated that he has done nothing with them
today as he just got home at 5am and the records were not caught up due to him being gone. The licensee stated he
would prefer to have the inspection another day since he had no one else available to do the inspection. He stated that
his daughter does the chores when he is gone and that he did not have the key to get into the big cat area. The daughter
would not get out of work until after 5pm and there was no way to see all of the cats from the front gate.

The licensee was advised that this would be considered a refusal if he could not conduct the inspection or provide
someone that could. The licensee advised that he understood but that he was too busy on this date, and had no way to
get into the big cat area anyway.


The licensee was advised that he needed to have someone available for inspections M-F during normal working hours,
and to keep a spare key on the property or a way to get into the big cat area if he did not have a spare key in case of
emergencies or inspections.

The licensee did provide optimal hours for himself between 10am-2pm M-F, if he was on the farm. We were able to get a
phone number and optimal hours for the daughter and was advised the only time available would be before 8am and after
5pm M-F, due to her work schedule.

To be corrected by: From this day forward

This inspection(refusal) and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
