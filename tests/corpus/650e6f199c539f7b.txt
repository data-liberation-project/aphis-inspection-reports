Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
The carrier accepted 17 adult dogs for transport between February – March 2022 without the consignor’s certification in
writing that the dogs had been offered food and water 4 hours prior to delivery to the registrant for transport. Upon
inspection, records were incomplete, missing the times and dates for the corresponding certifications statements for each
dog. In addition, the carrier disclosed the accompanying documents have not been securely attached to each primary
enclosure during transport, but stored in a folder upon receipt.
The absence of these certifications does not assure that the animals will be offered food and water at required
frequencies when the animals are in transport. Failure to securely attach the required documents to each enclosure
prevents the carrier from knowing what guidelines to follow for the specific needs of animals on hand. Assure certifications
that animals are offered food and water during the 4 hours prior to delivery are securely attached to their enclosures in a
manner that makes them easily noticed and read.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
