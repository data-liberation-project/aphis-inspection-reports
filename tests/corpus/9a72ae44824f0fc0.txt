3.7(b) Critical

Compatible grouping.
The wolf/hybrid dog, Kira, has previously demonstrated aggression towards other animals. According to documents
reviewed by USDA inspectors, on July 19, 2020, two female wolf/hybrids, Luna and Kira, were removed from their primary
enclosure and were paired together in a new primary enclosure. This pairing resulted in an aggressive incident that
resulted in extensive wounds to both animals.

Luna, a female wolf/hybrid, had a wound on the top of her head behind her right ear. The dark female wolf/hybrid named
Kira had a deep laceration below her right eye and through the lower eyelid. These wounds were caused by the
aggression of each of these animals against each other while they were housed in the same enclosure. Veterinary care
was provided on July 20, 2020 for both animals. At the time of inspection, the wounds on both animals had healed. Luna
and Kira are no longer housed together.

Dogs that are housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. Any dog exhibiting a vicious or overly
aggressive disposition must be housed separately.



Licensee had addressed this item by separating the two dogs and placing them in separate enclosures, prior to this
inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the President.
