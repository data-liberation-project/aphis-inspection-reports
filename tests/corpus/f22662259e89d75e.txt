3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Although the side walls of the enclosures measured approximately 7 inches in height, during the inspection, there were 5
guinea pigs observed to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The enclosure must contain the animals. The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times
and does not allow them to escape.
3.28(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
One of the guinea pig enclosures (Pen 34 housing 24 guinea pigs) had an approximately 5 inch area of the side wall
where the wires were bent creating an opening with sharp points.
Wires with sharp points along enclosures can cause injury to the guinea pigs and can lead to escape if the enclosure
walls are not high enough to contain the animals.
Primary enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury
3.31(b) Repeat

Sanitation.


There was debris and dirt coating the windowsills. There were numerous spiderwebs hanging from the ceiling over the
open guinea pig pens.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors, and
may contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
