ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Welsh Corgi (049*617*410) the inside of the right ear flap was red. The area around the ear canal was
thickened and red with some small open lesions. The thickened area centered around the ear canal and extended
out about 1.5", making the entire area about baseball size. The outside edge of the thickened area had some small
lesions with a red discharge. The licensee was not aware of the dog's condition prior to the inspector pointing it
out. This dog's condition could be due to an injury, infection or a variety of other veterinary medical conditions. The
licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding this dog's condition in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this
information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
