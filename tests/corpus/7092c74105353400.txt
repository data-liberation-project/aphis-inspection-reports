Sharp points or edges
****
Inside a female black handed Spider monkeys indoor enclosure there are sharp points and/or edges . There is an
opening in the wire fence, large enough for the monkey to stick her hands through. This opening has sharp points
from the cut section of the wire. There is a piece of twisted wire, used to secure the wire fencing, with the pointed
ends pointing inward into the enclosure. There is a metal strap on the resting platform that has become unattached
and has created a sharp point and edge. These sharp points and edges could cause injury to the animal. The
licensee must repair, remove or replace these items and ensure that all enclosures are free of sharp points or edges
that may injure the animals.
