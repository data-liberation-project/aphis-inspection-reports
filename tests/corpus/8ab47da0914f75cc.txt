This was a focused inspection on the NCIs from the report done on February 18, 2014.
The male Yorkie #315 was treated by the attending veterinarian and appears in good after the dental procedure.
The licensee has gone through his entire stock of regulated animals and rated their dental condition and has a time
table planned to get the teeth done as needed starting with the most severe cases. The licensee will work to get
dogs in need of dental care done on a quarterly basis.
All dogs that had matt issues have been trimmed and look very good. The licensee went through his entire stock
and trimmed multiple dogs that had hair over their eyes or were of any question.
All other citations from the previous report have been corrected.
