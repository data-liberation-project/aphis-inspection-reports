SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Three flying squirrels were housed in an inappropriate enclosure during the time of inspection. The entire enclosure
measured approximately 20 inches long by 28 inches wide by 4.5 inches tall. There were five divided areas within
the enclosure measuring approximately 5 inches wide by 20 inches long by 4.5 inches tall. The animals were
housed within one of the five divided areas. The animals have been housed in this enclosure for approximately 2
months as per the facility owner. This enclosure does not allow the flying squirrels to express species typical
behaviors.
Place the animals in an enclosure that will allow for species specific behavior to provide for their well-being.
