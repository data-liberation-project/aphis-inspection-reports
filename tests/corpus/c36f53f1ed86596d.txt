2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
When reviewed on May 3, the written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) did not include the kangaroo, prairie dog,
fennec fox and pigs. The PVC is necessary in order to plan out preventive health care, emergency provisions,
oversight on husbandry and other issues pertinent to the welfare of the animals, and must cover all regulated
species at the facility. Failure to maintain an updated Program of Veterinary Care could be detrimental to the
well-being of the animals, since this plan outlines and clarifies standards of care.
The PVC has been updated and currently includes these species. The PVC must be maintained to include all
species and relevant veterinary care plans.
Correct from this point forward.
2.75(b)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records do not include the acquisition information on three reindeer sold in January.
The record of animals on hand is not up-to-date. The kangaroo, prairie dog, fennec fox and mongoose have not
been included.
Records enable the inspection process and provide traceability of animals, which can help protect their welfare.

Records must be updated and maintained for all regulated animals at the facility.
