ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection two animals were noted in need of veterinary attention:
*One male camel #1191 was standing at the camel ride loading area with a saddle blanket and saddle on his back.
During a check of the saddle gear it was noted that he flinched/jumped and/or turned his head to the right when a
hand was placed at the junction of the saddle and the saddle pad at his right shoulder area indicating that the area
may be painful. He did not display this reaction to touch of the corresponding area on the left side. After the saddle
was removed the haircoat over both shoulder areas, over the top of the shoulder and over the lower back where the
saddle rests was noted to have a very light almost white discoloration to the haircoat. The medical history reviewed
shows he has had issues with sores and calluses in these areas in 2013 and 2014 that were treated. There was no
documentation of any abnormalities noted or treatments of these areas in 2015.
*One male chimp #1213 was noted to have multiple open superficial red areas/sores from ¼ inch to ½ inch in
diameter on his face around and above the nasal area and on his left front shoulder area. The care staff reported
that they thought he was picking at the scabs in these areas that he had when he arrived at the zoo in June. Keeper
and medical records do not document any lesions or scabs present in these areas or any diagnosis/treatment plan.
All problems of animal health, behavior or well-being shall be identified through daily observation and conveyed to
the attending veterinarian to allow for the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat
diseases and injuries. A veterinarian needs to examine the two animals identified for diagnosis and treatment if
necessary. Correct by 8/30/15.
Exit conducted with undersigned and additional facility representatives.
