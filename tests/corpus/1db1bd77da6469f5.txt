3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There was a metal feed receptacle used to feed the two adult dogs in the raised enclosure. This feed receptacle
was excessively rusty and pitting on the sides and feeding area. The excessively rusty and pitting surface can
prevent required cleaning and sanitization. Thus, increasing the disease potential for the dogs.
All metal surfaces must be maintained and kept free of rusty. This will allow for required cleaning and sanitization.
Therefore, reducing the disease potential for the animals.
To be corrected by, 30-May-2016.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* All the enclosures had hog and plastic flooring. The flooring had an accumulation of fecal waste. In areas, the
fecal waste was smashed into the holes of the flooring. This indicates daily spot-cleaning is not taking place, and
could increase the disease hazards for 12 adult dogs.
All hard surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized often enough for prevention of an accumulation of fecal
waste and reduce disease hazards for the dogs.

3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The raised enclosure had one feed receptacle and water receptacle used to feed and water the two adult dogs
housed in the enclosure. The feed receptacle had debris, brown food waste and hair on the surface. The watering
receptacle had an accumulation of green algae on the sides. This indicates the feed and watering receptacles arenot being cleaned often enough. This can increase the disease hazards.
All feed and watering receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized more often for prevention of an accumulation of
debris, food waste, algae and hair. This can reduce the disease hazards for the animals.
To be corrected by, 23-May-2016.
