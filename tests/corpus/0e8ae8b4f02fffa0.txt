FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
On inspection, the perimeter fence on the West side of the lower and upper pasture for 7 adult bison and 2 bison
calves was determined to be in disrepair and insufficient. The alleyway between the enclosure and perimeter fence
had dense grass, bushes, and trees growing in the area and gave the appearance it had not be maintained in
months. The foliage not only blocked the view of the perimeter fence in certain areas but also misshaped the fence.
Multiple bottom sections of the chain-link perimeter fence were bulging outward and had even caused the
separation of the metal pipe framework. There were several areas in the fence that were bent and had separated
from the metal pipe framework. One drainage area under the perimeter fence had such significant erosion that an
approximate 18 inch gap was present between the bottom of the perimeter fence and ground. The perimeter fence
is next to a wooded area and walkway where families with small children commonly come. Since the other sides of
the perimeter fence were well kept, an employee was asked about the cause for this side(cid:25)s lack of maintenance.
Their response mentioned lack of manpower, resources, a small alleyway that would not fit their mower, and a
broken attachment often used to clear foliage in a narrow space. The perimeter fence is vital in protecting the
enclosed animals from exposure to diseases in the wildlife and protecting the public from injury. The perimeter
fence must also serve as a secondary containment system for the bison. The fence as is will not restrict animals or
children from contact with the bison nor will it serve as a functional secondary containment system. Repair or
replace the perimeter fence so that it will restrict animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the bison.
A work order from the Acting Park Supervisor was made available to the VMO as a good faith effort to show
progress will be made to correct this noncompliant item in a timely manner.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Acting Park Supervisor.
