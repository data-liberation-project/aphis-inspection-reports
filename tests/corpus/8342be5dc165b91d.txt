2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the circus performance a llama was brought into the ring on a lead line. The handler could not get the llama
to do the intended behavior, and he began to repeatedly hit the llama with a whip. The llama was very distressed,
pulling back on the lead line, ears flat back, and spitting at the handler.
Animals should be handled in a manner that does not cause unnecessary stress or discomfort. The licensee had
taken corrective action - reprimanding the handler, and removing the llama from the next performance - prior to
being approached by the inspectors. The licensee must ensure that all animals are handled in an appropriate
manner in order to protect their well-being.
To be corrected from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
This inspection occurred at the Garden Bros Circus performance in Murray. KY.
