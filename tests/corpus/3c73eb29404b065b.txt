3.78(d) Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.
There is a large wooden post and a large tree limb that have fallen onto the perimeter fence, behind the grivet enclosure,
which have caused the fencing to bow inward.
Areas of the perimeter fence which are in a state of disrepair impact the integrity of the fence and can potentially allow the
entry of other animals.
Perimeter fences must be constructed so that they prevent entry of unauthorized persons or other unwanted species.
Correct by removing the post and tree limbs from the perimeter fence.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
In the fallow deer enclosure, there are still several areas in a state of disrepair. There is a section of chain-link fencing,
close to the nonhuman primate housing, that has a significant bow causing the deer fence to stand approximately 4-5 feet
tall. It appears that something may have fallen on the fence and caused it to lose tension resulting in the bowing. On the
spring house, two pieces of metal roofing material have been torn from the back of the building which has created an
approximately 18 inch by 4 foot gap in the roof. There is an additional 12 inch by 12 inch piece of metal roofing missing
from an area below the above mentioned gap. This area is covered by a wire panel but still contains jagged edges which


could cause injury if the deer were to step through the paneling. The spring house is built into the the hillside which would
allow the deer to have access to the gaps and sharp edges in the roof. The other small building, in the same enclosure,
has several rusted roofing panels which are becoming detached from the structure.
In the fox enclosure, there are several pieces of broken wood and debris scattered on the ground.
Enclosures with gaps, sharp edges, compromised fencing, or broken materials can allow for the entrapment, injury,
escape, or death of the animals.
The facility must remove, repair, or replace the above mentioned items in the fallow deer and fox enclosures to protect the
animals from injury and contain them.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
