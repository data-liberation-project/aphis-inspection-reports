2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
During the fall exhibition season one opossum and one raccoon were exhibited in their housing enclosures along the
facility's nature trail. The barrier between the public and the animal enclosure (chain link type fencing) is not sufficient to
assure the safety of the animals and the public. Large rocks were placed on the ground about 3 feet from the enclosures
with small low vegetation inbetween the rocks and the enclosure along with a sign for the public to stay back. However
the public could easily step over the rocks and up to the enclosures or lean over and touch the enclosures. Contact
between the public and the animals may lead to injuries to either or both. During public exhibition there must be sufficient
distance and/or barriers between the animals and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of the animals and
the public. Correct by March 5, 2023.
2.134(a)

Contingency planning.
The facility has not yet completely developed and documented a contingency plan. A contingency plan is necessary to
provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of the animals in the event of an emergency
or disaster which could reasonably be anticipated and expected to be detrimental to the health and well-being of the
animals. The facility shall develop and document a contingency plan. Correct by March 5, 2023.


3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The opossum and raccoon enclosures constructed in 2022 are not currently surrounded by a perimeter fence. A perimeter
fence at least 6 feet high and three feet from the enclosures is necessary to restrict unwanted animals and unauthorized
persons from having contact with the animals and to act as a secondary containment system for the animals. The facility
shall ensure that the outdoor housing facilities for the opossum and raccoon are enclosed by a perimeter fence at least 6
feet tall and 3 feet in distance from the enclosure. Correct by March 5, 2023.

This inspection was conducted with two facility representatives and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
