disposition of animals used or co-mingled with animals used in regulated activities. There were no records of
acquisition for 31 rabbits that are currently on exhibit to the public. Records containing the required information for

WATERING.
***The enclosure housing approximately 50 fallow deer had dirty water receptacles. There was a buildup of green
debris on the interior surface of the receptacles along with green debris floating on top of the water. Water
receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in order to ensure that the animals are provided
with clean, potable water, to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain adequate hydration. Water
receptacles should be cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
Inspection and thorough exit briefing were conducted with facility owner.
