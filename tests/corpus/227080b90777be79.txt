3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care is missing the number of dogs to be sampled for intestinal parasites. Testing for
intestinal parasites is important to ensure the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care that is developed, documented in writing and signed
by the attending veterinarian and includes a plan for sampling for intestinal parasites. The facility must consult the
attending veterinarian and add a plan for the sampling of intestinal parasites, including the number of animals to be
sampled, to the Program of Veterinary Care.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class "A" license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 07-May-2022 or the Applicant will forfeit the application
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next relicense inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing license until it expires.
