3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**Several cages in building #2 are rusted on the wire mesh comprising the front part of the cages. There is also a
large amount of rust on the support posts holding the row of cages off of the floor. Excessive rust can potentially
decrease the structural integrity of the cages and can be difficult to clean and sanitize.
The enclosures and support structures must be maintained in good repair or replaced to protect the rabbits from
injury, to contain them, and to keep predators out.
This noncompliant item was previously cited on the inspection report dated 8/8/2015.
