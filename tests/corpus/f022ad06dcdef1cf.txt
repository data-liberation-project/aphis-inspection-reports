2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
Two "warming room" attendants were located outside of the solid side, goose neck trailer (Warm room). These
attendants were continuously busy checking in animals throughout the day at the table in front of the warm room and
then were moving animals too/from the auction block (10am-6pm). At no time was an identifiable/and or any attendant
present to observe activities/well being of animals inside the "warm room" while auction attendees (average 15-30 people
at a time) where looking at the animals. Due to the crowd outside the "warm room" and a formed line at the entrance,
there was also no physical way for the two attendants to monitor the animals (ferrets and capybara's) located in transport
enclosures residing outside the "warm room" on both sides of the "Warm room" entrance. Auction attendees were seen
to insert fingers into ferret cages, move cages off of upper shelves, and touch animals. Responsible and identifiable
employees must be knowledgeable, available and visibly present at all times during periods of public contact to
minimize/prevent issues caused by touching, moving enclosures or removing animals from the enclosures and to
observe the well-being of the animals.

* To be corrected from this day (3/23/21) forward and prior to the next auction.
2.132(d) Critical

Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.

A wallaby was accepted at the Exotic Animal auction and sold. The owner from IA that brought the wallaby is not currently
USDA licensed. The sale of exotic animals requires the owner of the exotic animal to be licensed and in good standing
with the USDA. Before accepting exotic animals for sale, auction owners/facility shall ensure that the presenting owner
has a valid, current, unsuspended USDA license.

To be corrected from this date forward 3/23/21 and prior to the next exotic auction.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
Accumulations of dusty, unused items were within the reach of three kinkajous. Accumulations of unused items create
clutter, minimize the ability to clean and could cause injury or issues if tangled in or chewed on. Licensee must ensure
that areas animals are placed are kept free of excess items and appropriate husbandry practices followed to minimize
health issues.

* To be corrected from this day forward (3/23/21).
3.137(d)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
Twelve all wire enclosures (containing three ferrets each) were stacked on top of each other (3 high). These wire
enclosures did not have solid bottoms to prevent excreta leakage into other enclosures which could soil the animals,
contaminate food/water and spread disease. All primary enclosures used to transport live animals must have a solid
bottom and absorbent material or an under enclosure tray to prevent leakage, contamination of feed, soiling of animals
and minimize/eliminate disease issues.


* To be corrected from this day (3/23/21) forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
