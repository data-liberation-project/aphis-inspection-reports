2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility lacks specific guidance for the care of animals. The
PVC states that the method CO2 euthanasia will be follow the AVMA Guidelines with no details on its use at the
facility by personnel. There is no specific guidance in the PVC for the method of euthanasia to be used by the
facility, including its use, equipment, and personnel trained to perform euthanasia for guinea pigs. Specific guidance
and training in the procedure for euthanasia by the attending veterinarian is required to ensure animals are
humanely euthanized according to the latest AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animal (2013 edition).
Additional specific guidance is required for the Program of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate
guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and does not
ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct by developing
and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for the guinea pigs. Correct by April 1, 2016.
