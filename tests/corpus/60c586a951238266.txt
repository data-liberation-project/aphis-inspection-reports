2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
While reviewing records at the Primate Center it was noted that since July 2014 there have been two incidents of
non-human primates escaping due to technician error that led to injuries requiring surgery (partial digit amputations)
or primary closure of wounds. Two animals were affected. Also, it was noted that there have been three incidents
of mis-pairing non-human primates due to technician error that caused injuries requiring primary closure. Four
animals were affected. In order to prevent further escapes and mis-pairing of animals, the research facility must
ensure that personnel always handle animals as expeditiously and carefully as possible.
Note: The facility previously identified these incidents and has implemented corrective actions to prevent and
minimize further incidents.
Correction: Ensure corrective actions are properly followed.
This was a routine inspection of CALS and the Veterinary School and a focused inspection at the Primate Center
conducted on 1/21/2015 through 1/23/2015.
Exit interview conducted with facility representatives.
