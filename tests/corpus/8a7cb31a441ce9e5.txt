CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A large feeder attached to the wall in the sheltered housing kennel used by 6 adult dogs had evidence of caked on
feed, dirt build up, and as well as bird droppings in the top of the feeder. Feeders must be sanitized at least every
two weeks to prevent the accumulation of dirt, food waste etc. A clean food receptacle is necessary to ensure
optimal health and prevent the spread of disease.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Two bird nests were seen directly in the sheltered housing kennel being used by 6 adult dogs. Evidence of bird
droppings was seen on the wall and in the top of the feeder. Several other bird nests were noted in the building
containing the kennel of the dogs. An effective program to control pests including insects, external parasites, birds
and vermin must be established to promote the health and well being of the animals and reduce contamination by
pests in the animal areas.
