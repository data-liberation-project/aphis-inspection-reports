FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A section of livestock panels that extend halfway into the stream are not properly secured. The green panels that
are in the water are fastened together with only orange twine. The end of the green panel that is going up the bank,
has not been secured or fastened to anything. This allows the panel to be easily moved inward which can create an
opening large enough for the three female reindeer to escape.
Failure to secure the panels does not ensure the reindeer will be safely contained. Using orange twine alone to tie
the panels together, does not provide the adequate strength needed to ensure the reindeer will be properly secured.
The enclosures must be constructed with a material appropriate for the animals involved.
To be corrected by: June 15, 2016.
