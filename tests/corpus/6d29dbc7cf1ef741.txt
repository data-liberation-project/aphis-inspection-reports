2.1(a)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
Records show the acquisition of chinchillas on 10 occasions in 2019 (5/14, 6/8, 6/16, two different acquisitions on
7/5, 8/2, 8/12, 8/18, 10/11, and 10/12). When asked about these acquisitions, the licensee stated that some were
for use as breeders at their facility, but the majority were re-sold wholesale. The licensee currently holds a valid
Class A license. By definition, a Class A licensee (breeder) means a person subject to the licensing requirements
and whose business involving animals consists only of the animals that are bred and raised on the premises in a
closed or stable colony and those animals acquired for the sole purpose of maintaining or enhancing the breeding
colony. Business that includes the purchase and resale of animals require a Class B USDA license. The licensee
must not purchase and re-sell animals from other sources without first obtaining this Class B license. Failure to
maintain the appropriate valid USDA license makes the tracking of animals and maintenance of the license,
including proper renewals of that license, difficult to impossible. Correct this by not buying and re-selling animals
until a valid Class B license is obtained.
Correct from this day forward
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A grey standard female chinchilla in cage #B2L4-31 was found with the left eye completely crusted closed. The
yellowish crusting over the eye was so severe that the eye was not able to be opened or observed.
An ebony male chinchilla in trailer 4 with cage card labeled (NCE Eb Male 2) was found with its left eye swollen shut
and a clear discharge running down its face. A piece of bedding was also stuck to the lower eye area. The eye
was not able to be observed because of the severe swelling and closure of the eye lids.
A beige colored chinchilla was found dead in its enclosure in the first holding room from the office area. This animal
was rigid and cold to the touch. A grey standard chinchilla was found in row 33 upstairs appears unthrifty. The haircoat on this animal is roughed
overall and it was reluctant to move around the enclosure. Both eyes of this chinchilla appear swollen with the left
more severe than the right. The facility employee stated that the male had “beaten-up” this female. The facility did
restrict access of the male to this female but have not contacted the attending veterinarian or started any treatment.
A note on the feeder states (male beatup 2-12-20).
The facility is currently treating at least 20 chinchillas for an eye health concern. The attending veterinarian has
given written guidance to follow for these conditions. The facility failed to identify the above animals listed with eye
conditions. The chinchilla that was noted as being "beat-up" by the male was not communicated to the attending
veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was contacted by phone on 3/24/20 and stated that the licensee should
follow the written guidance from his visit on 2-14-20. Facility employees stated that daily observations are
completed in the morning every day when feeding is done. They stated that treats are given to the animals in small
feed containers and the animals come to the front of the enclosures and are able to be observed. These daily
checks were completed before this inspection.
The health issues identified above are significantly impacting animal health and well-being. Daily observation of
these animals is not effective and health issues are not being identified within a timely manner. It is the licensee’s
responsibility that daily observations are completed appropriately and effectively. Additionally, there must be a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure all health issues are
addressed within a timely manner, to include the animals identified above.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility has no records of adult animals on hand. The facility is currently maintaining a total count of animals
born on the premise. The facility is not maintaining records on breeding stock/adult animals. Complete and
accurate records are necessary to facilitate tracking of the animals and compliance with other aspects of the AWA.
Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning animals, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her
possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that
dealer or exhibitor.

3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR. The facility is currently using open widows and fans as ventilation methods but there is still an excessive amount of
dust and odor within the facility. The fans and windows were covered with a layer of dust, hair and organic material
build up. About half way through the inspection (2 hours), both inspectors felt itchy eyes and scratchy throats as a
result of the current lack of ventilation, ammonia and dust content within the facility. The lack of cleaning these
fans and screens significantly decreases the air flow and directly contributes to the odor within the facility. Lack of
adequate ventilation can lead to health problems in the animals. Correct this by providing proper ventilation in the
facility.

3.129(b)
FEEDING.
Over 75% of the enclosures have a moderate to excessive amount of rust on the self-feeders where food is
dispensed. The facility is currently dealing with an eye issue that the facility stated was highly contagious. They
currently use a method of breeding which allows one male access to multiple enclosures that contain females.
Several animals have been previously identified as needing treatment and additional animals were identified as
needing treatment on today’s report. Rust cannot be effectively be cleaned or sanitized. Using feeders that cannot
be properly cleaned within an environment that allows multiple animals exposure to the same feeders may
contribute to the speed of the current eye issue. The licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are kept clean
and sanitary at all times to minimize disease hazards. Rusty feeders cannot be properly cleaned to promote the
health of the animals and must be repaired or replaced.

3.131(a)
SANITATION.
This facility is dealing with an eye issue that the facility stated is highly contagious. Several surfaces of the
enclosures containing animals are not properly cleaned. In addition, the sanitization protocols in place do not
promote sufficient cleaning when dealing with a contagious health issue. Over 25% of the enclosures have a
moderate to excessive amounts of rust on the pans at the bottom of enclosures. In addition, many of the enclosures
have a buildup of excreta and/or urine soaked bedding under the top layer of the fresh bedding. A facility
representative was asked about the cleaning and sanitization protocols. She stated that they use a scraper dipped
in bleach water to remove all of the wet bedding at the bottom of the enclosures and then place fresh bedding back
into the enclosure. Rust cannot be effectively cleaned or sanitized. In addition, insufficient cleaning and sanitization
may be contributing to the odor and health issues within the facility. The licensee must ensure appropriatecleaning/sanitization methods for all enclosures are instituted.
Correct By: 4/7/2020
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The lack of overall cleaning and sanitization of the facility is contributing to the ammonia smell and dust content in
this facility. Over 50% of the enclosures that are not currently being used have not been cleaned. There is molding
food in some unused enclosures, a layer of hair and/or dust buildup in over 50% of unused enclosures, used
bedding and feces in walkways of the animal areas, and a thick buildup of dust, hair and debris on the top of all
enclosures. Failure to maintain acceptable cleaning can contribute to disease hazards. The licensee must ensure
that all premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals from disease hazards
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
