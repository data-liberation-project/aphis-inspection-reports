3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
An eight foot high fence on 300+ acres functions as primary enclosure fencing for aoudad, black buck, eland,
lechwe, oryx, wildebeest, water buffalo, zebra and a camel. There is no additional fencing functioning as a perimeter
fence for these animals at the facility.
A perimeter fence at least 6 feet high and sufficient distance (at least 3 feet) from the primary enclosure fence is
required to keep animals and unauthorized persons out and/or from having contact with the animals. The perimeter
fence also functions as a secondary containment system for the animals in case of escape.
For the safety of the animals and to help ensure their protection from injury and harm, a perimeter fence must be in
place or approval obtained from the Administrator.
