2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female coatimundi was observed by inspectors to be licking and biting at her left front leg during inspection. The
area she was licking and biting was missing hair and slightly red. She was also seen scratching her back leg at
times. The problem reportedly had not been noted by animal care staff prior to inspection. Signs observed in this
coatimundi suggest that it may be itchy or uncomfortable. To be sure that the condition is not contagious and
causing pain/discomfort, the Attending Veterinarian must observe and make treatment reccommendations for this
coatimundi. Promptly communicate any animal health problems to the Attending Veterinarian to ensure that
appropriate treatment is provided at all times.
