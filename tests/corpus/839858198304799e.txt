3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The shelter for the farm animals, including a llama, several goats, and a miniature horse, is too dirty. In the shelter,
the entire cement floor is covered with a few inches of moist manure. The animals cannot bed down without
becoming contaminated. This exposes the animals to disease hazards. Excreta shall be removed from primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize
disease hazards and to reduce odors.
