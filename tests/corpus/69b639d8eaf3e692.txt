ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care states that the attending veterinarian will visit the facility on an annual basis.
The last visit occurred in March 2013. Regular visits to the facility by the attending veterinarian are required, at least
annually, to ensure provisions for the maintenance of adequate veterinary care and to facilitate any recommended
changes in animal husbandry or veterinary care as directed by the attending veterinarian. The licensee states that
the attending veterinarian will be visiting the facility July 1, 2014..
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dog #133, an adult female Schnauzer "Shai" housed in pen 12 was noted to have numerous fleas crawling in the
inguinal and ventral abdominal areas.
Dog #114, an adult female Dachshund "Penny" housed in pen 1 was seen biting repeatedly at her left rear leg.
Upon examination the area was damp and numerous fleas were seen crawling in the inguinal and ventral abdominal
areas.
Dog #153, an adult female Shih Tzu "Pinky" housed in pen 9 was noted to have numerous fleas crawling in the
inguinal and ventral abdominal areas. A light colored dog, extensive areas of dark flea dirt were identified through
out the skin. Slight matting of the hair was seen along the back, abdominal and inguinal areas and the licensee
stated the mats were the result of chewing at fleas.
The licensee has been administering injectable praziquantel to her dogs for the treatment of tapeworms. The dogs
have probably acquired these internal parasites from continuing flea infestation on the premises. The licensee
stated that she obtained the medication from her veterinarian, however, the use of this product is not included in the
program of veterinary care and the bottle was not labeled for dispensing by the licensee. This product requires a
prescription for use in dogs and should be labeled appropriately by the prescribing veterinarian to meet industry
regulatory and safety standards .At the last inspection the facility program for the control and treatment of fleas was noted to be ineffective. The
licensee has not yet consulted with the attending veterinarian to review the efficacy of the current program for
external parasite control and the fleas appear more numerous. An effective program for parasite control must be
implemented to prevent discomfort and illness related to fleas such as anemia, flea transmitted diseases and
tapeworms.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
