2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following two guinea pigs require veterinary care:
(1)(cid:9)In enclosure 196 (housing 8 adult guinea pigs with their offspring) a female tri-colored guinea pig (white, tan, and
dark gray) has a line of thickened skin with no hair from the top of her head behind the left ear, down the neck, and
to the top of the left shoulder.
(2)(cid:9)In enclosure 61 (housing 8 adult guinea pigs with their offspring) a female white guinea pig with gray/black
markings on head and rump has hair loss with red inflamed skin behind both ears on the back of her head, down
her neck, and along the sides past both shoulders.
The licensee told the APHIS officials that he had treated the guinea pigs for hair loss on Saturday, but there are no
records of these guinea pigs describing the hair loss, receiving any diagnosis or treatment. When the APHIS
officials identified these guinea pigs, the licensee moved the guinea pigs to a new enclosure. The licensee informed
the APHIS officials that he had not seen guinea pigs before with similar skin conditions. Hair loss, thickened skin,
and red inflamed skin has many causes such as parasites, infection, and other medical problems. The guinea pigs
must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment, and resolution of the
condition, must be documented and made available to the APHIS official upon request. Correct by November 19,
2016.
3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Enclosures numbered 45, 46, and 48 (each housing 8 adult guinea pigs with their offspring) have broken, bent, and
detached wire on the lower edge of the wire mesh above the plastic lumber on the left side of the enclosures. The
broken, bent wires are at the height of the heads of the adult guinea pigs and may cause injury to the animals. All
enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury and to
contain the animals securely. The enclosures must be repaired or replaced to prevent injury to the animals and toprevent escape. Correct by November 23, 2016.
This inspection was conducted with the owner and exit interview was conducted with owner's wife.
