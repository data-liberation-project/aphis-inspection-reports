OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At the time of inspection, two gibbons were found in an outdoor enclosure with no access to their inside quarters.
The temperature was at 45 degrees with constant precipitation that began the day before. The animals appeared to
be seeking warmth and were huddled together. Outdoor facilities for non human primates must provide adequate
shelter from elements and have access to heated quarters when the temperature falls below 45 degrees.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of inspection, a gibbon was housed by itself with no access to other non human primates for interaction.
Non human primates are encouraged to be housed in social groups to promote the psychological well-being of the
primate. A single housed non human primate plan must be implemented by the attending veterinarian to explain the
basis of this exemption and must be reviewed and updated every 30 days.
