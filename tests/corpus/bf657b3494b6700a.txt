Personnel qualifications.
On July 21, 2022 animal ID#R1-00009 had a procedure performed which included general anesthesia. This animal is
assigned to IACUC approved protocol #680. The protocol referenced an SOP for this particular procedure, however the
SOP did not contain guidance for anesthesia and therefore utilized the anesthetic guidelines described in the protocol.
The protocol states that anesthetic monitoring would be performed every 15 minutes including core temperature and
respiration. The surgical records reviewed during the inspection did not contain any temperature or respiration entries.
Procedures conducted using animals must be performed in accordance with IACUC approved protocols and referenced
SOP‘s. The facility must ensure that personnel are conducting procedures in accordance with IACUC approved
protocols and SOP’s. In addition, personnel must ensure that procedures are performed in a manner which is in
alignment with protocol/SOP’s. The facility is correcting this issue by implementing an enhanced training program .

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
