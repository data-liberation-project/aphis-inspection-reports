3.6(c)(1)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are 6 dogs in an enclosure that does not provide them with enough floor space. The enclosure was measured
at 78.5 inches x 33.5 inches which gives these dogs 18.3 square feet of available floor space. All six dogs were
measured to be approximately 17.5, 18, 17, 18.5, 16 and 18 inches in length. The minimum required floor space for
these dogs is (17.5+6)2+(18+6)2+(17+6)2+(18.5)+(16+6)2+(18+6)2/144 = 23 square feet. The enclosure was short
by 4.7 square feet.
Adequate floor space is required in order to ensure that the animals can make normal postural adjustments and for
their health and well-being. The licensee must provide all dogs with an enclosure that meets or exceeds the
minimum square footage requirement.
