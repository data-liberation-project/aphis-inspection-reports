Primary enclosures.
For two enclosures on the outside portion housing 5 adult smaller dogs (shih tzu's and a poodle cross), the floor was
made for medium-sized dogs and these 5 smaller dogs' feet were seen passing through occasionally. The licensee had
other enclosures available with smaller mesh and moved the affected dogs. Mesh that allows dogs feet or legs to pass
through could cause injury. Ensure that the flooring is constructed in a manner that does not allow dogs' feet to pass
through any openings.

Maintain correct from this day forward.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility is in the process of transition to having a new attending veterinarian. Records and documents indicate
adequate veterinary care is being provided, however the program of veterinary care will need to be approved and signed
by the new attending veterinarian. An up to date written program of veterinary care signed by the attending veterinarian is
needed to help ensure adequate veterinary care is available to the animals at the facility. Ensure that the program of
veterinary care is updated and signed by the new attending veterinarian.
