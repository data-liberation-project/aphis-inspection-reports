(b) Shelter from inclement weather The shelter currently provided for the deer has a roof and one wall. The shelter
is not adequate to protect the deer from wind and the cold. In addition, there are no natural barriers to provide
protection from the wind and the cold. Current temperatures in this area have been fluctuating into the 20's and
30's (Fahrenheit) at night. Prolonged, unprotected exposure to these temperatures may cause discomfort, illness or
death. Adequate shelter to protect the deer from inclement weather must be provided. Correct by February 11,
2015.
