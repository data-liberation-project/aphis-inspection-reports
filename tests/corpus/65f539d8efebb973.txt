SANITATION.
*** One enclosure housing two adult rabbits is excessively dirty and requires cleaning. This enclosure contains
metal wire flooring over wood structural supports. In the corners of this enclosure, there is a build-up of and caking
feces and hair. Additionally, the catch pans below the enclosures have an excess of feces that require removal and
cleaning. This is a potential disease hazard for the rabbits and does not satisfy accepted cleanliness standards.
Correct this by cleaning and maintaining these enclosure in a sanitary condition.
