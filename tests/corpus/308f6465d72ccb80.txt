ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of inspection, the exhibitor had a written non-human primate (NHP) environmental enrichment plan.
Currently, the facility does provide environmental enrichment for their non-human primates. However, the
opportunities for foraging and task-oriented feeding methods for their baboons and rhesus macaques were limited.
Additional enrichment, such as other cage complexities that are noninjurious for NHPs involved, should be utilized
to encourage normal species specific behavior.
