2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC did not conduct appropriate reviews of animal activities for all protocols to ensure that investigators are
following the approved protocol. The inspectors reviewed five of the eleven active protocols. The principal
investigator for one protocol did not follow the approved protocol. The medical records indicate that acepromazine
was used as a pre-anesthetic drug instead of the IACUC approved xylazine. The protocol states that the animals
will be monitored twice daily for four weeks post-surgery. The records indicate that the animals were monitored
once daily for two weeks then intermittently twice the next week. Also, the protocol states the surgical site will be
washed daily for two weeks. The records indicate the washing occurred at 9, 10, 13, 21, 24, and 28 days
post-surgery. The IACUC must conduct continuing review of all activities involving animals in order to ensure that
all animal activities are conducted as stated in the approved protocols.
Correct from this date forward.
2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The facility houses a total of 2532 cattle of which 908 were inspected. Of the animals inspected, inspectors
identified the facility failed to communicate problems of animal health to the attending veterinarian regarding a 250
pound calf diagnosed with coccidiosis. The calf, part of a pair along with its mother, were part of a study that
included 289 pairs plus 116 yearling heifers and 20 bulls. The pair were separated from the herd and housed in the
treatment area near the office building. On August 31, 2017 the calf was examined by a veterinarian and placed
on a treatment regimen of amprolium, once daily for five days, and an oral electrolyte solution. Treatment with
amprolium was stopped on September 5, 2017.
On inspection at 11:45 a.m on September 7, 2017, the calf was dehydrated with sunken eyes and tented skin and
was also weak, lethargic, and unable to rise when prompted. The facility verbally confirmed they had not contacted
the attending veterinarian to notify him of the calf’s condition and no additional treatments had been implemented.
At approximately 4:00 p.m, the facility informed the inspectors the calf had died. Illnesses that are not treated may
be painful and can lead to prolonged suffering, other veterinary health problems, and death. All sick and/or injured
animals must be examined by a veterinarian and adequate veterinary care provided.Correct from this date forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
