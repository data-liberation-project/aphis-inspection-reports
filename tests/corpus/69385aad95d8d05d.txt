***** At time of inspection the white poodle in the main kennel building located in the last pen on the north side of
the building was displaying signs of having injured its right front leg. It held its leg up off the ground and was
unwilling to
bear any weight on it preferring to hop on three legs rather than limp and bear any weight on the limb.
This poodle needs to be seen by a veterinarian for an evaluation and to determine a course of treatment for this
animal.
