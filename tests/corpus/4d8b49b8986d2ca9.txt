PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The IACUC minutes dated 10/20/2015 include discussion regarding an animal that died as a result of entrapment
associated with a chain securing an enrichment device. It was found that a device with an obsolete design had been
used in the animal(cid:25)s primary enclosure. That device had enough unprotected chain length for an entrapment
accident to occur. Immediate changes to the enrichment plan were to include fastener length in the maximum chain
length left unprotected by a PVC sleeve, and to make the enrichment storage area accessible to only the behavioral
sciences group to ensure that only approved toys and other enrichment devices are dispensed for animal use.
Environmental enrichment is an important part of housing non-human primates. Design of enrichment devices must
involve careful scrutiny for safety for use with these animals; they can cause harm if not carefully constructed and
monitored with use to ensure they have not become unsafe.
The facility must ensure that all enrichment devices are safely constructed and maintained in order to protect the
non-human primates from injury. This NCI was corrected prior to the time of inspection.
A progress report on the comprehensive alopecia study was reviewed.
The inspection was conducted by Drs. Gwynn Hallberg and Heather Cole on January 12-14, 2016 and was
accompanied by facility personnel. The exit briefing was conducted on 1/14/2016 with facility personnel.
