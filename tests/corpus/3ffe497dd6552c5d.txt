2.5(d) REPEAT
DURATION OF LICENSE AND TERMINATION OF LICENSE.
- The drive through area of the park is currently open for visitors, but is not an approved site. Site 002 (drive
through site) is not a valid site and must be in complete compliance with all aspects of the Animal Welfare Act prior
to being used for regulated activity.
2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The information for "Handling Dangerous Animals" has not been completed and sent to the regional office. The
qualifications of the employees and addressing the other issues listed on the form are of utmost importance. The
drive through section of the park contains potentially dangerous animals, such as a rhinoceros and a tiger, which
were not on the original license. Individuals lacking knowledge and experience with dangerous animals might
negatively impact the health and welfare of the animal through improper husbandry. The licensee must provide the
regional office with written documentation regarding the experience and knowledge of the individuals who handle
these animals. This information must be submitted and approved by the Western Regional Office before this site
can be approved for regulated activity.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- At the time of inspection the drive through area of the park had members of the public driving their cars and
opening their windows. The giraffe was observed lowering his head and the public were opening their car windows.
There are park employees present in the giraffe's enclosure but they were working on the fence and their backs
were to the public. There were no park employees that were monitoring public/animal interaction. A responsible,
knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public
contact.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The border fence for the drive through area is leaning sharply in several areas, and one section has a fallen tree
leaning on it. Fencing in this condition is not secure, nor is it safe for the enclosed animals. The fences must be
repaired and maintained at all times.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- The east side of the giraffe enclosure did not have proper, sturdy perimeter fencing outside of the enclosure fence
itself. There is a house and other buildings in this area, very close to the giraffe enclosure. This property does not
belong to the facility. There is an outer fence with several gaps separating this area from the giraffe enclosure.
However, the gaps had been filled with t-posts and orange mesh fencing. This is not sufficiently sturdy or secure
enough to serve as a proper perimeter fence. Without a proper perimeter fence, unauthorized members of the
public could reach the giraffe enclosure fencing and potentially enter the park as well. An adequate perimeter
fence must be constructed here and kept intact, both to prevent unauthorized access and to serve as a secondary
containment for the animals.
