2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Multiple protocols currently being used with regulated animals have been modified to include a change in the principal
investigator of the protocols as a new director/investigator for the program/protocols has been hired. This includes the
following protocols: FAT-HG, EH, GH, GPH, PIH, RHTP, RE, SPR and VH. The inspector observed teaching procedures
from the protocols being conducted on regulated animals during today's inspection. The change in the principal
investigator of a protocol is considered a significant change in ongoing activities and must be reviewed and approved by
the IACUC. This has not yet been done. IACUC review and approval of all significant changes to a protocol is necessary
for the IACUC to determine that the proposed significant changes meet the Animal Welfare Act requirements. The IACUC
must review and approve all proposed significant changes regarding the care of and use of animals in ongoing activities
including the change in principal investigator. Correct by 11/30/22.
2.31(e)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The principal investigator has not updated the current protocols to include a complete description of the proposed use of
the animals. This affected the following protocols: FATHG, EH, GH, PIH, RE, and VH. During today's inspection the
inspector observed the students practicing intramuscular injections in a horse using saline. None of the current protocols


included a description of this practice. The protocols that included injections simply stated 'injections'. They did not include
a description of what would be injected (saline as was observed or only medically necessary injections) or a description of
how many procedures/injections would be performed per animal. All protocols shall include a complete description of the
proposed use of the animals to allow the IACUC to provide appropriate review and oversight. For teaching protocols a
complete description should include a description of the procedures to be performed by the students and address
concerns that may affect the well-being of the animals such as the number of procedures to be performed on each
animal.
In order to be compliant the protocols listed must be modified to contain a complete description and thereafter approved
by the IACUC in order for animals to be used in protocol activities. All protocols to conduct an activity involving animals
must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals. Correct by 11/30/22.
2.38(l)(1)

Miscellaneous.
The facility has not yet documented a contingency plan. The attending veterinarian stated she has a file started with
information to use to put the plan together but has not yet done so. A contingency plan is necessary to provide for the
humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of the animals in the event of an emergency or disaster
which could reasonably be anticipated and expected to be detrimental to the good health and well-being of the animals.
The facility shall develop, document and follow an appropriate contingency plan. Correct by 12/31/22.

This inspection was conducted with the veterinary technician and attending veterinarian and the exit interview was
conducted with the attending veterinarian.
