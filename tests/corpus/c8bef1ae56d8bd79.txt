SANITATION.
During this inspection it was noted that a wild woodchuck had gained access to the North American Porcupine
enclosure. This is a cement walled, pit type, of enclosure that has a cement bottom and is filled with dirt. The
woodchuck gained access in some way and now burrowed into the dirt. The fact that this woodchuck is wild there is
a possibility of disease transmission. This animal will need to be removed from the exhibit.
