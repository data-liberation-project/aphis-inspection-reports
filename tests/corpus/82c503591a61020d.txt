Facilities, general. Structural strength.
The larger enclosure housing 4 alpacas, 4 sheep and 12 goats had a small damaged area on the fencing located to
the right of the water tub when facing it. A few of the metal wires are broken leaving a larger opening in the fence
and sharp wires present. A similar damaged area is also present on the smaller enclosure housing 3 sheep. This is
also located to the right of the water tub and a larger gap and sharp points are present there as well.
These areas may result in injury to the animals due to the sharp points and/or gaps where an animal could get its
head caught. Repair or replace damaged areas to ensure structural strength, to contain the animals and to protect
the animals from injury. Correct by April 17, 2014.
