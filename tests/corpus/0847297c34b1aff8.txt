3.14(d) Critical

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
The Center for Disease Control representative at Dulles International Airport (IAD) reported a dog named "Toby" arrived
in a carrier too small for its size. The representative reported as being 21"L x 16"W x 15"H and too small for "Toby”
because it could not rest comfortably with its injury. According to the representative, the "dogs right front leg was fixed in a
straight position and the dog was writhing and crying while trying to change its position but could not."

Turkish Airlines transported a dog from Iran to Dulles, VA in the USA in a carrier too small for the size of the dog and
caused the animal unnecessary pain and distress. Carriers must not accept a dog for transport in commerce in a primary
enclosure that does not meet the requirements outlined in Section 3.15 to ensure a comfortable transport for the animal.

Turkish Airlines must implement procedures to ensure dog primary enclosures presented for transport meet the standards
in Section 3.15 and that the animal can be transported safely and comfortably without causing suffering or injury.
3.18(c) Critical

Care in transit.


On May 5, 2021, a Center for Disease Control (CDC) representative at the Dulles International Airport (IAD) sent me an e-
mail stating that the importation of a dog would be placed on a medical hold. The dog came into IAD on Turkish Airline
flight TK07 as excess baggage (presumably checked planeside in Iran). Upon examination by representatives from
Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the dog was in a carrier too small for its size. It was also noted that the dog could
not move due to possible injuries to its legs and was vocalizing as if in distress. The flight parent told officials that the dog
was being imported to repair the injuries. However, no medical statement was presented to support such claim.

The dog “Toby” was taken to Turkish Airlines cargo facility. The intermediate handler, Worldwide Flight Services, was
instructed by CBP to take the dog to a licensed veterinarian for examination. This was required before CBP would release
the dog to the owner. “Toby” was seen by a veterinarian on May 6, 2021 to evaluate its injuries. It was determined that the
dog did have 2 fractures of the right front leg.

Turkish Airlines authorized the transport of an injured dog in violation of the regulations and failed to ensure the dog would
receive veterinary care upon arrival at its destination. Turkish Airlines must not transport any dog that is ill, injured or in
obvious distress for the welfare of the animal. Additionally, Turkish Airlines must implement procedures that will ensure an
injured dog is being transported for the purpose of receiving veterinary care.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Regional Cargo Manager at Dulles International Airport.
