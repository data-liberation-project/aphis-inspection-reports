2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Two recent incidents involving safe handling of animals have occurred:
Upon a review of the records it was discovered that Koko the gorilla is being taken out of her enclosure on a leash
for walks on the grounds. The premises does not have an intact perimeter fence, but has had a variance regarding
the fence, due to other security measures in place, to ensure the safety of the animals. In the event that Koko were
to become distressed it would not be possible for the handlers to control such a large and powerful animal, and this
puts Koko at risk of harm. Koko should not be walked on a leash outside of her enclosure unless a secure method
can be devised where she is not at risk of escape and/or harm. To be corrected from this time forward.
Upon review of records it was discovered that on 3/9/17 Koko was given 1/2 a tablet of NoDoz (caffeine tablets) by
Koko's owner, reportedly to treat a headache. Koko has a documented history of anxiety and cardiac issues, and
the attending veterinarian expressed concern about this incident, when he was contacted. Giving medications
without consulting the attending veterinarian could be hazardous to the animal's well-being. Koko is on several
prescription medications and herbal supplements, and over-the-counter medications could also have unforeseen
drug interactions. The attending veterinarian should be consulted prior to administering medications from this time
forward.
3.75(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Whereas some repairs have been made, there are still some areas in the primary enclosure for the male gorilla
where there is chipping and missing paint.
The ceiling above the small yard that comprises part of the outdoor enclosure has peeling paint, and the wood
appears to be deteriorating, and this could allow particles to fall into the enclosure.
All surfaces must be maintained and/or replaced on a regular basis. Failure to maintain and/or replace surfaces canimpede cleaning, create hazards, and otherwise put the health and well-being of the animals at risk.
3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At the time of inspection evidence of rodent infestation was apparent in the kitchen. Rat feces were found on the
floor behind appliances, and a stack of small clean blankets had fallen behind a freezer, and there was evidence of
rodents chewing this material, in addition to feces. Staff also expressed concern about rodents entering animal
enclosures. Although an exterminator company was on site in September and November, 2016, there is evidence of
a current and significant rodent infestation which is not being adequately addressed.
The presence of rodents can pose a risk of disease, and cause distress to the animals. Measures should be
initiated to remove access to all sources of food and bedding to the rodents within the buildings, via strict
housekeeping practices. The facility should additionally institute an effective rodent abatement program.
To be corrected by 5/13/17.
This inspection was conducted with facility representatives.
Final exit briefing by phone with Associate Director on 4/14/17.
