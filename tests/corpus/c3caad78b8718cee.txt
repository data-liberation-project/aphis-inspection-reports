FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A rabbit housed in one primary enclosure uses a hole to access the enclosure next to it. The rabbit has worn the
hair off of its back as it squeezes through the hole. It would be possible for this rabbit to become trapped while
attempting to squeeze through the hole and become injured. This enclosure needs to be repaired in order to
contain this rabbit in order to prevent possible injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two goats and two sheep were running loose on the property at the time of inspection. The property is located
close to a road and animals that are loose could possibly access the road and become injured or even killed. These
animals must be placed in an enclosure that can adequately contain them. The fence for an enclosure housing two
pigs is leaning and the wire is bent. This fence needs to be repaired in order to ensure that these animals are
contained.

WATERING.
An enclosure containing two goats and one sheep had no water receptacle. This was a temporary enclosure for the
animals and they had been placed in the enclosure the night before. A small ditch of water was in the enclosure. A
source of fresh clean water must be provided for these animals. Unclean water could be contaminated with fecal
material which could lead to internal parasite problems. It may also not be as palatable which could cause the
animals not to consume enough for optimal health. Provide these animals with a source of fresh, clean water.
