CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The kennel facility consists of two sheltered buildings. The first sheltered building has indoor and outdoor ground
enclosure portions. During the inspection all seven exterior enclosure portions on the first building contained more
than one days waste material. The dealer stated the outdoor enclosure portions had last been cleaned
approximately two weeks prior. Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures daily to prevent an excessive
accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs contained in the primary enclosures, and to
reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
