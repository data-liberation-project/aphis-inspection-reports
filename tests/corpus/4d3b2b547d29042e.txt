2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
The facility uses collars and tags as their form of official identification for dogs over 16 weeks of age. There were 3 dogs
over the age of 16 weeks that were being identified by the official number that was assigned to them at birth on a cage
card. Cage cards are not an acceptable form of official identification for dogs over 16 weeks of age. An acceptable form of
official identification (listed below) is necessary for APHIS officials to positively identify animals for inspection and to
properly trace their movements.
All live dogs over the age of 16 weeks shall be identified by an official tag affixed to a collar around the animal’s neck, by
a legible tattoo marking approved by the Administrator, or by a microchip placed under the dog’s skin. The licensee must
apply one of these forms of identification to the three adult dogs. The licensee must ensure that all dogs have the correct
type of official form of identification at all times.
