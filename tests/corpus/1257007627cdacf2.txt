FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Interior surfaces. There are still large areas of bare wood on the floor in the guinea pig building where the white
paint is worn or scratched off. The paint on the wooden floor is not holding up to daily activity such as cleaning,
feeding, maintenance, and water spills. The interior building surfaces such as floors must be constructed and
maintained so that they are substantially impervious to moisture and can be readily sanitized. Licensee has
purchased a roll of linoleum to cover the floor in the guinea pig building, but has not installed the product yet.
Unsealed floors and surfaces are difficult to clean and sanitize, which can lead to disease hazards for the guinea
pigs. Correct by ensuring the floor where bare wood is present is resealed or covered with an impervious surface so
that it can be repeatedly cleaned, sanitized, and from which won't retain odors or absorbed moisture.
Remains uncorrected.

WATERING.
The following enclosures have chewed plastic water bowls with holes:
1) Row # 2 left side, enclosure # 2 housing 20 weanlings.
2) Row # 3 left side, enclosures # 1 housing 14 weanlings.
3) Row # 3 left side, enclosure # 4 housing 9 adult guinea pigs
4) Row # 5 left side, enclosure # 3 housing 7 adult guinea pigs.
Chewed water bowls with holes are difficult to clean and sanitize, which can lead to disease hazards for the
animals. Water bowls that cannnot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn, chewed, have
sharp edges or holes. Correct by September 25, 2019.
