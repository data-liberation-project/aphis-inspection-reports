3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the large dog kennel there are seven cages with moms and puppies that have doggie doors where the cages
extend into the garage of the building. In three of these cages, excessive feces had built up to the point where the
adult dogs and puppies had no other option but to step in their feces if they wanted to step into the portion of the
cage that extends into the garage. In these cages, the feces was caked onto the grate. Feces build-up like that can
cause the spread of disease including but not limited to fecal parasites. Excreta must be removed from primary
enclosures daily and cages must be sanitized every two weeks and more often if necessary to prevent the
accumulation of excreta. Correct immediately.
Note: The German Shepherd (Animal # GS230) that was cited under 2.40 (b)(2) from the last inspection was
evaluated. The licensee was able to provide documentation showing that treatment had been completed since the
last inspection. The compatibility issues cited under 3.7 (b) from the last inspection appear to be resolved.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
