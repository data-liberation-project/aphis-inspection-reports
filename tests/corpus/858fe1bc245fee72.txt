2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* There was an adult, female, brown and white Shih Tzu ("Sugar" #035-794-634) who was not placing any weight
on her hind left leg as she moved around her enclosure. The top of her left hind paw had a swollen, red-purple
lesion which was approximately one inch in diameter and had very little hair on it. The licensee stated she had not
noticed that the dog was limping on that leg. "Sugar" also had a thick, yellow-green discharge partially covering
both eye globes and appeared to be squinting slightly in the left eye. The licensee stated she was treating the eyes,
but upon inspection, it was discovered that the medication she was using expired in August 2011. Limping
combined with the swollen lesion indicates that the dog's foot is likely painful and could be infected. Using an eye
medication which expired three years ago could be ineffective and may even be harmful to the dog's eye.
* There was an adult, male Shih Tzu ("Bam Bam" #477-90A-7436) who was barking/coughing repeatedly during the
inspection. The dog's bark/cough sounded more like a muffled honk. The licensee stated she had not heard the
strange sound prior to the inspection. A strange coughing/barking sound could indicate the dog may have a
medical condition which could be contagious to the other dogs in the kennel.
The licensee must have "Sugar" and "Bam Bam" examined by a licensed veterinarian by 15 August 2014 in order to
obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(b) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(b) Condition and site.
There were areas of clutter and trash both inside the housing facility and in the food storage building. The storage
area inside the housing facility had stacks of old newspaper, empty bottles, rags, tools, hardware, and other
material not pertaining to the care of the animals. The storage building had multiple empty dog food bags. Areas of
clutter and trash offer habitat for rodents and prevent adequate cleaning and sanitization of the facility. The licenseeshall ensure all animal areas inside of housing facilities are kept neat and free of clutter, including trash, equipment,
and stored material not pertaining to the care of the animals.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements.(2)(i)
There were 3 enclosures on the indoor portion of the second, adult housing facility that had 9 x 3 inch openings cut
out of the coated wire panels at the front of the enclosures. These openings were made to insert self feeders that
have been removed exposing sharp metal points of wire. Two of the dogs were observed narrowly fitting their head
through the openings. These sharp points could injure the dogs. The licensee shall ensure that all of the enclosures
at the facility are free from sharp points or edges. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 8/15/14
3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(d) Pest control.
There is evidence of rodents in the first sheltered facility. There were droppings along the base of the floor and in
the corners of the floor of the storage area. Rodents can transmit disease. The licensee shall incorporate an
effective pest control method to remove pests from the facility.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
