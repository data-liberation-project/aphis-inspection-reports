2.40(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Medications were ordered by the veterinarian 3 weeks ago but not yet delivered. The delay in obtaining medications
and services (laboratory, radiology, histopathology, etc.) is due to the prolonged time and process needed to get the
purchase order approved by the finance/purchase office.
A more efficient method and quicker system is needed in order to get medications that are required to treat or
prevent illness and disease, so as not to prolong the animal's discomfort, pain, and/or suffering.
To be corrected by April 15, 2017.
2.131(e)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The fans in the camel/aoudad/deer shelter building were not working when the zoo personnel tried to turn them on.
During hot days it is important to adequately ventilate the shelter by natural or mechanical means in order to
minimize the risk of overheating of the animals, and to prevent discomfort and health issues which may affect the
animals.
To be corrected April 15, 2017.

maintained on a regular base to prevent flaking rust.To be corrected by April 15, 2017.
