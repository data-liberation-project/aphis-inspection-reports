ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is an adult brown female Cocker Spaniel (microchip number 0A01480637) that is excessively matted. The
dog is matted around the head and face, limbs, back and hindquarters covering approximately 75% of the body.
The matted hair is balled and is tightly adhered to the skin. Matted hair can trap dirt, debris, and moisture and cause
pain and discomfort. It can foster skin infections and hinder the animal's ability to move or defecate normally. The
licensee must remove all matted hair and establish an effective program for coat maintenance for the health and
well-being of the dog.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage and waste disposal.
There is stagnant water approximately 1/2" deep in areas mixed with fecal material and other waste under the
majority of primary enclosures in the large indoor housing facility. The liquid waste is becoming moldy and there is a
thin film visible on the stagnant areas. An excessive number of gnats and other small flying insects are present
around the stagnant liquid. Unsanitary living conditions exist that could lead to potential disease, contamination orhealth risks. The potential for insect and pest infestation exists when animal waste and urine is not removed in a
timely manner and continues to collect under the dogs. The licensee must provide for regular and frequent removal
of animal waste, water and other fluids for the health and well-being of the dogs.
