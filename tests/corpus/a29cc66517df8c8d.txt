ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Four pigs were seen to have skin problems. Their skin was thickened and scaly. Two pigs had reddened areas and
were seen scratching on a post. The attending veterinarian has not been notified of this problem in the pigs yet.
Skin problems, if not treated or managed can become irritating and painful and could also be contagious to other
animals in the facility. Abnormal and itchy skin problems such as observed must be promptly reported to the
attending veterinarian so that a diagnosis and treatment plan can be made to relieve the pigs of any discomfort.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The licensee reported that a rabbit escaped from an enclosure about a month ago and has not been located since.
Some enclosures have an open area on the top and it may have jumped out. Enclosures that allow rabbits to
escape do not ensure their wellbeing. The open areas on the top could also allow predators to enter. Enclosures
must be constructed to safely contain the rabbits and to keep predators out.
Ensure enclosures are safe for the rabbits by 2/26/2016.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative. This was a focused inspection of the animals and animal
facilities as the licensee had a prior obligation to attend to prior to the records review.
