ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the bears den there was one bear observed before entering the den lying on the floor, with its winter coat,
panting and salivating excessively. When we entered the den it stood up but continued to pant and salivate. There
is a concern of the animal's health because she was panting heavily and salivating with her winter coat. In order to
avoid health risk issues of the animal related to the clinical signs observed the attending veterinarian should
examine the animal. Correct within 24 hours.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Joe the chimpanzee is allowed to be fed peanuts by the public. The method in which management instructs the
public to feed him is by throwing the peanuts into his enclosure giving some people opportunity to throw the peanuts
at Joe. Management stated that they warn the kids that if they throw peanuts at Joe, then Joe will throw peanuts
back. When Joe throws the peanuts back he also throws dirt and shows aggression. The option of placing a feeding
tube was discussed but due to a previous incident would not be safe to use again. Management should have a
safer method for the public to feed Joe without throwing peanuts which could possibly cause injury to the animal or
cause behavioral stress. During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to
the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing
public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by June 12, 2014

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
In the bears den the temperature registered on the ceiling as 150 degrees F and the floor as 79 degrees F
measuring with a Raytek gun at approximately 11:00 am. While we were inside of the den we could feel the heat
from the ceiling which was made from a metal roof without insulation. There was no cooling apparatus inside the
den. The bear that was in the den was observed before we walked in the den laying on the ground and once we
came into the den she got up but was panting heavily. When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's
health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may
never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity, and time that is detrimental to the animal's healthor well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age, species, breed, overall health status, and
acclimation. Correct immediately.
3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In Joe the chimpanzee's enclosure the platform to the far left of his enclosure that was rusted. Also there was
post that is stabilizing a platform that is excessively rusted and could break causing the platform to fall down.
***The bonnet and rhesus macaque's primary chain link fencing was rusted.
The furniture and surfaces should be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or
that affects the structural strength of the surface. Correct by June 19, 2014
3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The toys in the lemur, bonnet macaque, rhesus macaque and chimpanzee primary enclosure were soiled and
worn. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens,
and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility--that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be
replaced when worn or soiled. Correct by June 19, 2014
3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the primary enclosure for the bonnet and rhesus macaque there was a lot of feces on the platform that had not
been cleaned that appeared to have been there more than a day. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates
come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards.
3.84(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***In Joe the chimpanzee primary enclosure there was a plastic lettuce bag on the ground. In the stall next to Joe's
indoor enclosure there was clutter and discarded items that was attracting flies. Premises where housing facilities
are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect
the nonhuman primates from injury, to facilitate the husbandry practices and to reduce or eliminate breeding and
living areas for rodents, pests, and vermin. Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste, and
discarded matter. Correct June 19, 2014.3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***In the stall next to Joe's inside enclosure and to the left of the entrance there was a dirty cage with towels and
flies swarming, An effective program for control of insects must be established and maintained so as to promote the
health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. Correct by June 12, 2014.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** In the bear's and tiger's, Special and Kryptonite, enclosure there was a hole at the primary fence line that could
allow the entrance of small mammals that could potentially transmit disease to the bears and cause illness. The
bears and tigers, Misha and Sultan, also have holes that need to be filled within their enclosures that they could fall
in and injure themselves.
***In the bears primary enclosure there is a cement pool with exposed rusted wire that could potentially injure the
animals.
***In the primary enclosure's for the tigers', Misha, Sultan, Kryptonite and Special, has platforms that were
scratched up and jagged pieces of wood were exposed that could potentially cause injury to the animals.
***In the black leopard's, Jack, primary enclosure the primary fence was rusting and broken along the entrance of
the den. The fence could potentially continue splitting if the rust continues up the chain link allowing the animal to
escape.
***In the coati mundi and the black leopard's primary enclosure the wood platforms were degraded and in disrepair
which could eventually break and fall causing injury to the animals.
***The fencing post running along the floor of the grey foxes primary enclosure is rusted and pitted. The rust and
pitting has compromised the integrity of the fencing and could allow escape of the animal.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by June 19, 2014

SANITATION.
***In the grey fox enclosure there was a lot of feces in the enclosure. Excreta shall be removed from primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize
disease hazards and to reduce odors. When enclosures are cleaned by hosing or flushing, adequate measures
shall be taken to protect the animals confined in such enclosures from being directly sprayed with the stream of
water or wetted involuntarily. Correct by June 7, 2014.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***Outside of the bears enclosure within their perimeter fence there were old discarded items (old tires and used
wire) and trash on the ground. Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from
