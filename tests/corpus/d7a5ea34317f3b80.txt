SANITATION.
Item Housekeeping 3.131 c
At the time of inspection the area that is used for cleaning of the animal cages and then the room that stores the
clean cages had areas of the walls that were peeling paint. Peeling paint is not maintaining the area in good repair
and in addition the paint chips if they fall into the cages can contaminate the clean cages.
Facility needs to repair the areas of peeling paint so that the areas are maintained in good repair and there is no risk
of contamination to clean cages.
