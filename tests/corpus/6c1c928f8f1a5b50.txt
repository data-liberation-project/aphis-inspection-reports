Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During the inspection, a juvenile gray, tan, and white guinea pig was observed to be separated from the rest of the
animals in the enclosure and slower to move. While the other guinea pigs moved away from the front of the enclosure
when the Inspector approached, this specific animal stayed close to the front of the enclosure and seemed to have a
quieter demeanor than the other guinea pigs. Upon closer observation, this animal was noted to have markedly smaller
eyes that only had very narrow slits of the eyelids. The animal did not appear to react to any visual stimuli and appeared
to have a duller mentation than the other guinea pigs.

The facility representative stated that neither the animal's quieter, isolated behavior nor the abnormalities observed in
both eyes were noticed in this animal previously and the Attending Veterinarian had not been contacted regarding this
animal.

Licensees are required to observe animals on a daily basis to observe health and well-being and must have a mechanism
of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being is conveyed to the Attending Veterinarian. Failure to do so can cause the animals pain, distress, or even death


when left untreated.

Correct by having the guinea pig examined by the Attending Veterinarian.
3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
Three of the guinea pig enclosures had an accumulation of wet bedding and fecal material on the wire mesh directly
under the water spigots. The bedding surrounding the water spigots was also wet.

Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of feces and debris, including wet bedding.
Failure to do so can lead to illness if the guinea pigs avoid the water or have to stand in wet bedding in order to drink.

Correct by cleaning the areas under the water spigots and removing wet bedding as often as necessary.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
