3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
There was a white spray bottle labeled permethrin spray kept on top of the food storage container within the sheltered
building. The storage of this substance on top of the food container increases the risk of contact with the dogs' food and
the dogs' risk of harm if it was accidentally ingested. The applicant must ensure that all substances that could be toxic to
dogs but are required for normal husbandry practices are not stored in the food storage and preparation area.
3.1(f)

Housing facilities, general.
Within the sheltered building, there was a plastic bag being used for trash storage which was not in a leak-proof container
with a tightly fitted lid. Not keeping trash in a leak-proof container with a tightly fitted lid can increase the risk of odors,
pests and other disease hazards. The applicant must ensure that trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage
and food preparation area are leak-proof and must have tightly fitted lids on them at all times.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The applicant was using a USDA Form 7002A as well as a state form for the facility’s Program of Veterinary Care (PVC).
There were discrepancies between some of the information contained on the two forms and both differed from the
documented vaccination and deworming schedule maintained for the puppies at the facility. For example, it was indicated


on the state form that the parvovirus vaccine frequency schedule for dogs would occur at 6 weeks, 9 weeks and 12 weeks
of age and then revaccination would occur annually; the USDA form indicated that the parvovirus vaccine would be
administered at 5 weeks and 7 weeks of age and then revaccinated annually. However, according to vaccination records,
the parvovirus vaccine had been given to the dogs at 4 weeks and 6 weeks of age and then annually. The applicant must
consult with the attending veterinarian to develop a complete and accurate written program of veterinary care that
addresses the requirements for adequate veterinary care, reflects the practices at this facility, and is signed by the
attending veterinarian. The written program of veterinary care will ensure that there is accurate communication between
the applicant and the attending veterinarian and ensure that all routine care, including medications and vaccines, provided
to the animals by the applicant are done with the direction and knowledge of the attending veterinarian.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by January 15, 2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
