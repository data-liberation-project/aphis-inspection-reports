PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the whelping building one enclosure contained a mother and puppies. During the inspection, the pups were
observed by inspectors crawling and trying to walk around the enclosure. The coated wire flooring had openings
large enough that their feet and legs passed through the wire flooring. Flooring that allows feet & legs to pass
through any openings can be stressful & could lead to possible injury to the puppies. The risk of potential injury to
the feet or legs exists if the puppies cannot or have to struggle to bring its feet or legs back through openings in the
flooring. Wire or expanded metal flooring must be small enough so that no feet or legs can pass through any
openings in the flooring. Licensee must ensure that all the enclosures with pups have flooring that will not allow
their feet and legs to pass through. During the inspection, licensee added additional material to cover the coated
wire material not allowing the pups feet to pass through.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee.
