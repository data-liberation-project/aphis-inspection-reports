Handling of animals.
During this inspection, seven dogs were observed loose on the property (the licensee’s one Borzoi, two Basset Hounds,
one Poodle, one Irish Deerhound, one deaf Great Dane, and an employee’s Pembroke Welsh Corgi). No attendants were
in close proximity to most of the dogs during the frequent human interactions. The Great Dane was observed closely
interacting with a family having a picnic on the public grounds. Two sets of patrons were observed interacting with the
Borzoi on public grounds. One of the Basset hounds snarled at a patron in a public area, who possibly had accidentally
stepped on him. The Corgi was observed attacking one of the Basset hounds in a public area while the inspector was
leaving the premises. The facility does not provide attendants for the interactions between the humans and dogs. The
facility has been advised multiple times to contain the pet/guardian dogs to a non-public area while the facility is open to
the public.
One group of three patrons were observed interacting with a loose mature male kangaroo with no attendants in the
vicinity.
Two loose pigs were observed on the property. A group of three patrons was observed attempting to interact with one pig
yet there were no attendants in the vicinity.
Three employees were identifiable and present on the property but were conducting routine husbandry duties instead of


serving as attendants actively monitoring the animal-people interactions. Not providing adequate oversight of animal-
people interactions can result in injury and/or illness for the animals and/or the people. Per the regulations, a responsible,
knowledgeable, and readily identifiable attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact. Correct by

Outdoor housing facilities.
Public barriers around two enclosures housing one ringtail lemur and one white faced capuchin were inadequate and
allowed potential access to or by the public. Not providing adequate barriers puts the animals and/or the humans at risk of
injury and/or illness. Per the regulations, fixed public exhibits housing nonhuman primates, such as zoos, must have a
barrier between the primary enclosure and the public at any time the public is present, in order to restrict physical contact
between the pubic and the nonhuman primates. correct by 17Feb2023.
