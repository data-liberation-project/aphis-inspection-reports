Primary enclosures.
On the door entering the baboon night enclosure, areas of exposed wood were noted on the outside surface and along
the edge where the hinges are attached. Inside the night enclosure, the concrete block is exposed and unsealed in
multiple areas. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that all surfaces in contact with the nonhuman
primates can be readily cleaned and sanitized.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The facility had a new vervet infant born approximately one month ago. Although the facility does have an environmental
enhancement plan for their primates, considerations for the new infant had not been added or approved by the attending
veterinarian. Certain primates must be provided special attention regarding enhancement of their environment, based on
the needs of the individual species and in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


In the off exhibit holding area behind the nonhuman primate enclosures and adjacent to the perimeter fence behind the
baboon enclosure, there are two very large piles of construction debris composed mostly of chain-link fencing, fence
paneling, and other materials piled up approximately 6 x 4 x 50 feet.
Grass, weeds, and other plants were overgrown around the entire facility.
Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste, and discarded matter, including buildings and
surrounding grounds in order to protect the nonhuman primates from injury. Weeds, grass, and bushes must be controlled
to facilitate cleaning and reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents, pests, and vermin.

Facilities, general.
A barrier fence surrounding the viewing area of the domestic farm animal section of the facility had multiple sharp points
of wire protruding through the hog panels used to patch several holes in the bottom of the barrier. The animals in this
section are kept within several separate smaller primary enclosures within this section of the facility. Several baby goats
were noted outside of their enclosures, making the barrier fence part of their primary enclosure.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.
