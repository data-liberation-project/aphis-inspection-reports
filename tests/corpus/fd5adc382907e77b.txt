FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the southern corner of the deer enclosure, near the red building, an interior section of the primary enclosure fence
has been damaged by several, large fallen trees and their branches. The trees have crushed the fence fabric down
to the ground thus leaving this section of fence structurally unsound. The trees should be removed and this interior
fence repaired to maintain it in good repair and to ensure structural strength.
Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: DECEMBER 1, 2018
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
