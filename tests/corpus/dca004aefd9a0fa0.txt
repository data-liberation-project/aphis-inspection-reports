3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces. (3) Cleaning. The inside washdowns of the lower kennel have an excessive accumulation of excreta
and food waste which is attracting flies. Surfaces that are not cleaned and sanitized when necessary can promote
pathogen harborage and insects can spread diseases. Washdowns under the primary enclosures must be cleaned
and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent the accumulation of feces and food waste, and to reduce disease
hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
