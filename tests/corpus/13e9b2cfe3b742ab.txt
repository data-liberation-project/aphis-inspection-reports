OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is insufficient protection from the rain, wind and cold in the spider monkey and lemur enclosures. The
shelters provided and observed during the inspection are plastic dog houses without doors, with an infrared radiant
heater set approximately 2-3 feet from the sides of the enclosures, and facing the openings of the shelters. There
was also no additional bedding observed inside the shelters for the spider monkeys. Although this inspector
detected some heat reaching the side of the enclosure, in the event of wind, rain and significantly cold ambient
temperatures, this set-up will not be adequate to protect the nonhuman primates. Exposure to the elements, wind,
rain and cold temperatures without adequate shelter may cause discomfort and injury to the nonhuman primates.
The shelter must safely provide heat to the nonhuman primates to prevent the ambient temperature from falling
below 45 [deg]F (7.2 [deg]C). The enclosures must be safely altered to protect the spider monkeys and lemurs from
the elements including the wind, rain and cold.
