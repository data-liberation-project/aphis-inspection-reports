HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The primary enclosure for the llama's, muntjac, pig's, goat and sheep still does not have a barrier fence. These
areas have a floating attendant that monitors three pens at one time. The attendant can't be present at three petting
sites at one time to monitor the publics interaction with the animals. These areas should have constant monitoring
by an attendant because the public can easily get to the enclosure fence and put their hands or other objects
through the enclosure.
A potion of the wolves' enclosure's barrier fence consists of plastic fencing. This fencing was down in some areas
which would also allow the public to gain direct access to this exhibit. This area does not have an attendant to
monitor the public.
The right corner of the grey fox enclosure area also has a gap in the barrier fence, where the public can pass
through and not only gain access to the fox, but also the wolves.
The swing gate (which serves as a portion of the barrier fence) at the tiger/lion exhibits is not locked. This gate shall
be kept locked to prevent the public from passing through and gaining direct access to these dangerous felines.
All enclosures must have a barrier fence that is at least 3 feet from the enclosure on all sides to protect the animals
and the public from injury.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The male patas monkeys night house appears not to have had any corrections since the last inspection, and
continues to have water damage to the ceiling with wood that is deteriorating, rotting and falling apart. The water
damage and rotting wood is affecting the structural strength of the ceiling and the building is not being maintained in
good repair. The damaged ceiling maybe allowing rain water into the enclosures which may be wetting the animals.
The constant moist conditions have allowed mildew and mold growth which can be hazardous to the animals health
and well-being. The ceiling must be repaired or replaced, and maintained to ensure that the building is structurally sound and kept
in good repair.
3.75(d)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is no light in the male Patas monkey night house. The light in the other females Patas night house is not
functional. The male night house area is very dark and cannot be inspected adequately to determine compliance
(or non compliance) with the applicable husbandry requirements, as well as to assess the condition of the
deteriorated/moldy wood that is currently present. The female night house also cannot be adequately inspected to
determine compliance (or non compliance) with the applicable husbandry requirements.
Housing facilities shall have adequate lighting for carrying out the husbandry requirements in accordance with the
regulations as well as assessing the condition of the building materials.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The enclosure for the 2 ringtail lemurs does not have a lockout/keeper area. The enclosure is designed with only a
door that swings outward. The keepers must use this entrance daily to clean & feed the primates. If these primates
should get past the keeper when they enter or leave they will no longer be contained. The behaviors of this species
of primate increases the chances of this happening.
Enclosures shall be constructed so that they contain the primates securely and prevent escape.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The metal shelter roof in the goat exhibit has deteriorated and now has several holes. The holes are numerous &
large enough that if all 6 of the goats were to seek shelter at one time during the rain, some (if not all) will get wet.
This structure shall be repaired or replaced so that all of the animals can remain dry during inclement weather.
