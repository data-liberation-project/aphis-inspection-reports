3.53(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
Numerous rabbit enclosures have excessive rust on the metal urine guards. In approximately 5 of the enclosures, the rust
is so severe that portions of the urine guard are missing, leaving rough and jagged edges. The rust and rough edges
prevent thorough cleaning and sanitization as well as are a potential source of injury to the rabbits. Primary enclosures
shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect rabbits from injury.

3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
One cattle enclosure, housing 4 steers, has poor drainage. There is approximately 3 inches mud at the entrance of the
animal’s shelter. Several puddles of water can also be observed. Excessive water can negatively impact animal health,
leading to injury or feet issues. Additionally, animals should be able to access food, water, and shelter without having to
walk through excessive water and mud. Facilities are responsible for developing a suitable method to rapidly eliminate
excess water.

3.127(b)

Facilities, outdoor.


One sheep pasture, housing 22 sheep, does not have a shelter structure present. There is no protection from wind, rain,
or snow. A lack of shelter can lead to animal discomfort and impact their overall health and well-being. A natural or
artificial shelter appropriate for the species shall be provided and large enough to afford all animals protection from
inclement weather and to prevent discomfort.
