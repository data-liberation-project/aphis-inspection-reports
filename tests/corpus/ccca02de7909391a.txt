2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs was not available for review during this inspection. Approximately 441 guinea pigs were
counted during this inspection including adults, weanlings, and newborns. There was only one inventory dated 5/28/22,
recorded on the 2022 calendar with an inventory for the guinea pigs. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult
to assess the health of the caviary by identifying animal losses by death or decreased number of animals born and to
track animals being sold. The licensee must maintain records containing the required information for guinea pigs which
disclose the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired or disposed of including births and deaths. Correct by July 10,
2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a family member.
