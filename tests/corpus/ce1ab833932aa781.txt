ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
On July 11, 2017 a blacked faced lamb was observed to be non-weight bearing on the right rear limb. This animal
was initially examined on July 7, 2017, and treated that day. The lameness was classified as slight at that time.
There has not been any further examination or treatment for this animal.
On July 12, 2017 a black bovine was observed to be lame on the right front limb and a white bovine was observed
lame on the left front limb. One of these animals was toe-touching when they attempted to move and the other was
extremely reluctant to place weight on limb when walking.
There also were numerous swine with wounds and injuries to the head, neck, shoulder, and flank areas. These
included animals that were lame because of the injuries. None of these animals were under treatment at the time of
the inspection.
Injuries that are not treated may be painful and can lead to prolonged suffering, infection, and other veterinary care
health problems.
These animals must be examined by a veterinarian and adequate veterinary care provided.
Correction: July 14, 2017
2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Although the facility has records of daily monitoring of temperature, humidity, feed and water checks, the records
were unclear on documentation of daily observations of the animals health at the facility. APHIS Animal Care
inspectors observed health/medical issues during the inspection which were not documented nor conveyed to the
Attending Veterinarian (AV).
Additionally, in some instances, heath issues were documented in these records but not conveyed to the AV.
Failure to adequately observe animals on a daily basis and failure to communicate promptly with the attending
veterinarian may be detrimental to the health of the animals and cause unnecessary pain and distress as necessary
treatment is delayed. Daily observation of all the animals to assess their well-being and direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian regarding health issues is necessary to ensure that the animalsreceive timely and adequate veterinary care. A more detailed system should be in place to ensure that all animals
are observed daily and the attending veterinarian is notified when necessary.
To be corrected from this date forward.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
AG GUIDE Chapter 6 page 61
On July 11, 2017 APHIS Animal Care inspectors observed numerous animals in the feedlot area demonstrating
various stages of heat distress. Some of the animals were exhibiting symptoms of severe heat stress including open
mouth breathing with tongue protruding, excessive drooling, and increased respiratory rate. Failure to alleviate the
impact of threatening climatic conditions (in this case high heat and humidity) can lead to animals that are unable to
maintain a safe body temperature which is stressful and can lead to medical problems including heat stress and
death.
When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken
to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal must not be subjected to any combination of temperature,
humidity, and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as
the animal's age, species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation.
Correction: The facility must have an appropriate heat stress mitigation plan in place prior to environmental
conditions conducive to heat stress in their animals.

SEPARATION.
Ag Guide Chapter 11 page 149
Several pigs were introduced and housed together a few days earlier. A large percentage of these animals had
numerous scratches, scrapes and wounds on their head, neck and bodies. APHIS inspectors witnessed many fights
among the co-mingled swine. Animals that are housed in the same primary enclosure with other incompatible
animals are at risk for injury and stress from fighting. In some cases more dominant animals will limit access of the
incompatible animals in the enclosure to necessary resources such as food, water, etc. All animal housing systems
should attempt to minimize aggression and competition especially at mixing. The facility must ensure that animalshoused in the same primary enclosure are compatible.
To be corrected from this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
