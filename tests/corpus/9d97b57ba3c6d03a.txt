2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two male Yorkshire terriers had excessive matting on the chest, abdomen, and legs. Although the underlying skin
appeared healthy, hair mats can lead to moisture retention and development of skin infection, and are a potential source
of discomfort to the animals. Mats should be removed as often as needed to prevent any health complications. The
facility must institute a program of haircoat maintenance to ensure there is ongoing appropriate care for all dogs. Both of
the male terriers must have all mats removed.

3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
There is a large, deep crack in the cement floor of the outdoor portion of a run housing four adult dogs. The crack has
been partially patched but there are multiple exposed sections. Unrepaired damaged areas like this are a potential
source of injury to the animals, and also cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. The damaged area must be
repaired. Alternatively, the facility could avoid housing animals in this particular run.
Facility corrected at the time of inspection by moving animals to a vacant run.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
