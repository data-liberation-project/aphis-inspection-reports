The written program of veterinary care on file is not complete. There is no written guidance from the attending
veterinarian for parasite control for the rabbits. The licensee stated during the inspection that she uses ivermectin
for the rabbits. The program of veterinary care must include specific guidance from the attending veterinarian on
parasite control for the rabbits including the name, concentration of the medication, instructions for use, dose
frequency and route of administration. Sufficient detail is needed on the written program of veterinary care to
provided adequate guidance to the licensee the maintain the health of the animals. Correct by November 17, 2016.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
One of the gates to the perimeter fence for the Patagonian cavy is still only 4 feet in height. An extension was put on
the second gate, but there are two large gaps on either side of the extension. One gap is 10 inches by 29 inches
and the other gap is 6 inches by 29 inches which could allow unwanted animals to enter the area. The perimeter
fence including access gates must be at least 6 feet in height so that it can protect the Patagonian cavy in the
facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from entering, and so that it can function as a secondary
containment system for the animal in the facility.The gates must be replaced or repaired so that they are at least 6
feet in height. Remains uncorrected.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the president of the facility.
