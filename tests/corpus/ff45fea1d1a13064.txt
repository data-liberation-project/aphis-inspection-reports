ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The male prairie dog was above ground during the inspection and was observed
with hair loss on his face between his eyes and ears, and on his neck behind his ears. The hair loss was about an
inch in length on the dorsal (top) area of his neck and extended down both sides of his neck. There was also a little
hair loss on the ventral area of his neck. One of the two female prairie dogs came briefly to the entrance of one of
the burrows during the inspection and was observed to have hair loss on her body. None of the prairie dogs have
been seen or treated by the veterinarian for hair loss. Hair loss may have many causes such as parasites,
infectious, nutritional, and may be a sign of a more serious health concern. The prairie dogs must be evaluated by
the veterinarian to provide appropriate veterinary care. Correct by having the prairie dogs evaluated by the
veterinarian. The licensee must document and maintain records of examination, treatment and outcome for future
inspections by APHIS officials. Correct by February 24, 2017.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(c) Drainage: The following areas have an accumulation of mud and water.
1) The enclosure housing 2 cattle, 2 yak and equine has a very muddy area with large puddles of water in front of
the water receptacles.
2) The enclosure housing 3 cattle, 4 sheep and equine has a very muddy area with large puddles of water in front of
the water receptacles.
Animals should not have to walk through mud/water to get to their drinking water. Walking through mud and water
may cause hoof problems such as foot rot. The drainage must be improved to rapidly eliminate excess water to
prevent muddy conditions and to protect the health and comfort of the animals. Correct by May 1, 2017.
