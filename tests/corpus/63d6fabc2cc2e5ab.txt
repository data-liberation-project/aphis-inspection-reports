2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two adult female buffalo (back tag #723 and #722) were severely under weight (emaciated). The animals’ ribs are easily
visible from a distance, despite being covered by a thick coat of fur. The animals neck, spine and hip bones were
prominent. The hip bones were sharply defined and the muscles of the rump were sunken in. The muscles of the back
legs small and underdeveloped. The bones of the shoulder blade were visible. The hump over the top of animals’ neck
and shoulders was narrow with flat sides. The animals were alert and were observed to be eating and drinking. The
auction owner stated that the animals had been consigned for auction the night before (February 26th) and that the vet
had not been contacted about these animals.
Animals who are severely underweight may suffer from weakness, loss of muscle, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances,
and compromise of the heart and other vital organs. Animals who are severely underweight may be unable to withstand
the rigors of travel to and from the auction, and may be more susceptible to infection.
Correct by providing adequate veterinary care to support animal health and wellbeing. Following the inspection, the
attending veterinarian was contacted and examined the animals. Correct by February 27th at 6PM.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. This inspection report only documents the Direct
noncompliance seen.
