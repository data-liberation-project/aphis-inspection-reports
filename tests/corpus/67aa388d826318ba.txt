3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In all of the enclosures affecting all of the cats there was a buildup of brown grime on the floors and walls of the
enclosures, and hair, litter, dust and cob webs on most of the other surfaces within the indoor facility. The licensee
stated she spot cleans daily, but it has been a few weeks since the last time they were sanitized. There was an
obvious smell of ammonia consistent with urine inside the building.
The lack of cleaning and sanitizing within the facility can cause disease to be harbored, attract rodents and pest,
and cause odors that could affect the respiratory systems of the animals. The licensee must clean and sanitize the
surfaces in accordance to 3.11(b) at least every two weeks or more often as necessary for the surfaces in contact
with the animals and all other surfaces of the housing facility when necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards and practices.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and ACI Bartels.
