2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
-During the inspection a facility representative stated two bites occurred. One involving Odie, a coatimundi, jumped up
and bit a young girl on the hand as they were walking out of the exhibit. On another occasion Gene, a brown collard
lemur, bit a young girl’s hand. I was informed that both members of the public did receive medical attention.
-The outdoor primate exhibit does not have a public barrier along the north side where the public walkway is. The public
can reach through the fence and have contact with the primates along this area, and the primates do reach out and make
contact with the public.
-The public barrier along the public side of the bobcat consists of one strand of rope attached to fence posts
approximately 18 inches from the enclosure. The public can reach through and under the rope barrier and make contact
with the bobcats.

During public exhibition steps must be taken to provide sufficient distance and or barrier between the animals and the
public to assure the safety of the animals and the public and so this does not repeat.

To be corrected from this day forward.

Facilities, general.
During the review of medical records from the attending veterinarian. Marquee, an 8-year-old female Ringtail lemur, was
able to make contact with the adjacent primate through the mesh wire separating the two enclosures and was fighting.
Marquee received a laceration on the hand. Marquee has recovered.
Housing facilities must be constructed of such material that protect the animals from having contact with adjacent animals
and being injured. Areas where animals can make contact with the adjacent animals and become injured must be correct
to protect them from injury, so this does not repeat.
To be corrected form this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
