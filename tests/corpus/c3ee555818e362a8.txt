2.31(d)(1)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol # 2015-04 (category D) lists three publications to demonstrate that the PI has considered alternatives to
procedures that may cause pain. The protocol, however, does not provide any written narrative as to the methods
and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available (databases search, date range of the search,
keywords, etc).
The protocol form that this registrant uses clearly states that the search must include the databases searched, date
of the search, period covered, and keywords used. This was not done in this case.
This information is required for all projects that may involve more than momentary pain or distress to the primates.
