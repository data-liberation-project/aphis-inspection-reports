ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee was unable to provide the written program of veterinary care at the time of the inspection. The written
program of veterinary care conveys the attending veterinarian's expectations for routine preventative medical care,
emergency veterinary care, and euthanasia for regulated species housed at the facility. The facility should ensure
that said written program of veterinary care is available for review during APHIS Animal Care inspections.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal roof providing shade to the 1 female camel was in disrepair in some areas. Parts of the metal roof were
loose and hanging down, exposing the camel to sharp edges in several places. The roof needs to be properly
maintained and must be in good repair to prevent injury to the animal in the enclosure.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
