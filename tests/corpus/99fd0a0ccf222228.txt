Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
"Shere Khan", a 15 year old male tiger, is notably thin with prominent hips and vertebral processes. Per the licensee, the
tiger has a good appetite and is eating approximately 15-20 lbs. of food per day. However, "Shere Khan" has not been
properly evaluated by a licensed veterinarian in over a year. Older tigers are susceptible to a number of health
conditions, such as kidney failure and arthritic changes, that can have a significant impact on health and welfare. This
tiger must be examined by a licensed veterinarian, and treated appropriately for any underlying health condition that might
be affecting him.

Facilities, indoor.
The tigers are being held inside a barn, with no climate control other than opening the outer roll up doors. The doors were
closed as the inspection began, and then opened to allow access. Temperature inside the building, near the tiger cages,
was then recorded as 92.3 F. With the animals being held in travel cages, there is really no opportunity for them to cool
themselves. Temperature extremes can have a significant impact on the health and well being of animals. The indoor
temperature must be maintained at a level conducive to health.


3.126(b)

Facilities, indoor.
The tigers are being held in a barn, with very poor ventilation unless outside doors are opened. During the inspection,
even with the roll up doors open, there was a very strong rancid odor present. Poor ventilation has a negative impact on
respiratory health and general comfort of the enclosed animals. Indoor facilities must have sufficient ventilation to
maintain health and prevent discomfort of the animals.
3.127(d) Direct

Facilities, outdoor.
There is no perimeter fence at this facility. The tigers are being kept inside a barn with roll up doors. Access to the barn
is through the roll up doors or side door, and the only effective method to ventilate the barn is to raise the doors. When
the doors are up there is no fence or other security measure to prevent unauthorized access to the animals. If an animal
were to escape its cage, there would be nothing to prevent it escaping into the surrounding area. The current setup is just
not at all appropriate to house and care for dangerous animals. The lack of security and the absence of any secondary
containment measure is a constant, ongoing potential threat both to the animals and to the surrounding community.

Space requirements.
The tigers are being held in travel cages. Per the licensee, this is the manner the animals have been housed since at
least March 2020. The licensee has a temporary exercise pen which can be raised and used to provide periods of
exercise, but this pen was not up at the time of inspection. The tigers were pacing and appeared agitated during the
inspection, which can be an indication of stress. Travel cages do not provide sufficient space for the animals to move
comfortably, exercise, or make normal postural adjustments. This can have a dramatic, negative impact on the health


and well being of the animals. These effects can range from physical impairment to mental/emotional distress.
Appropriate, permanent housing must be available for the animals.

Sanitation.
There were numerous flies in the barn, with no obvious methods of pest control. The floor beneath and around the cages
had many live maggots. Pest control is essential to maintain the health of the animals. Flies and other insects are a
source of contamination of feed, enclosures, and the animals themselves. A proper and effective pest control program,
including thorough cleaning and sanitation, must be implemented.
