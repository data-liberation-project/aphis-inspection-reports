2.33(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
In an enclosure housing four adult white-tailed deer (numbers 4151, 4153, 4155, 4156), two of the deer have multifocal
areas of hair loss along their backs and sides. The APHIS inspector and a staff veterinarian witnessed one of the
unaffected deer pulling out the hair of an affected deer. There are no records showing that this issue has been observed
by caretakers or reported to the veterinary staff.
Effective daily observations allow the facility to assess the health of the animals, including any injuries, behavioral
problems, or compatibility issues. Timely reporting of new conditions is important to prevent worsening of any problems
and ensure proper care. The facility must observe all animals daily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of health, behavior,
and well-being are conveyed and so that the medical conditions of the animals can be evaluated by the veterinarian.
To be corrected by 24 November 2021.

Sanitation.
-There is an accumulation of feces in the veterinary teaching horse shelter structure that covers more than half of the floor
space and has built up along the walls of the shelter. There is also a large pile of feces and deteriorating hay that has


been raked up for collection but remains within the enclosure.
- There is an accumulation of feces in the veterinary teaching cow shelter structure that covers more than half of the floor
space.
-There is an accumulation of feces in the veterinary teaching sheep pen that covers a majority of the shelter floor and
enclosure. There is also a large pile of feces and deteriorating hay that has been raked up for collection but remains
within the enclosure.
-There is an accumulation of feces in the veterinary teaching sheep barn pasture that covers a majority of the shelter
floors and enclosure, especially around the feeders.
-There is an accumulation of feces in the ARBL sheep pen that covers the entirety of the shelter area and more than half
of the enclosure.
-There is an accumulation of feces in the middle stallion pen at the Equine Repro Lab in front of the shelter and around
the feeding area.
-There is an accumulation of feces in the teaching mare pasture at the Equine Repro Lab that covers a majority of the
floor of both shelter structures and surrounds the feeding area.
Accumulations of excreta are especially of concern when they occupy an animal's shelter structure or interfere with its
access to food and water sources. These areas also attract pests and can play a role in disease transmission. The
registrant must ensure that excreta be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination
of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and odors.

This inspection was conducted from 11/16/2021 to 11/18/2021 and the exit interview was conducted on 11/22/2021 with
facility representatives.
