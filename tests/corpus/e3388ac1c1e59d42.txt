2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 1,194 adult,
weanling, and newborn guinea pigs were counted during this inspection.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Facilities, general.
Although the enclosure walls measured at least 7 inches in height, during the inspection, three guinea pigs were observed
to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the building. The licensee stated the enclosure walls
sometimes flap down allowing a guinea pig to escape.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to


access food and water.
The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times and does not allow them to escape.
Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.28(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
The openings in the plastic coverings housing the water nipples were chewed with sharp edges in approximately 1/3 of
the enclosures.
Sharp edges in openings around water nipples can cause injury when the guinea pig approaches to drink water.
Primary enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
