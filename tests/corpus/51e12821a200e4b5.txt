ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is male, white tiger named "Casper" (date of birth 6/04) with an open wound on the inside of the left front leg
that is about two inches by three inches in size. The skin around the wound is red and swollen and the skin is pulled
back exposing red tissue in two places. Casper was seen licking this wound. The animal also has a moderately thin
body condition with mildly protruding hip bones and vertebrae. This animal was acquired on 10 July 2014.
According to the licensee, he was thin and had cuts and sores on his face and legs at that time and she had
documented those problems. The attending veterinarian evaluated the tiger on 25 August 2014. No treatment
guidelines were given to the licensee at that time. No treatment for the skin or wounds has been given to this
animal. The licensee gave deworming medication to the animal on 14 September 2014. because of the thin body
condition. The licensee states that the animal has not gained weight as she expected after the deworming
medication was given. The attending veterinarian has not evaluated this animal since the initial exam in August.
Skin wounds can become infected and be painful for the animal. Also, a thin body condition can indicate other
medical problems occurring in the animal. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian
by close of business on 9 October 2014 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis for the thin body condition and
skin wound is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
document the outcome of this consultation, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, and
make it available to the inspector upon request.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The panel fence of the llama enclosure housing four llamas has areas of bent and protruding metal bars. Some of
the protruding metal bars are pointed inward toward the animal enclosure at foot level and at head level by the
feeder. Enclosures that are not kept in good repair can lead to injuries in the animals.
***
There are areas in the fence of the goat enclosure with holes large enough that at least three small goats were seen
outside the enclosure. One goat was seen in the "alley way" behind the goat enclosure and the other two were seen
in the hay rack adjacent to the next enclosure. The "alley way" behind the enclosure where these small goats were
seen has fencing with sharp points and access to the land outside of the facility. Animal housing facilities that do notsecurely contain the animals can lead to injuries or loss of the animals.
***
The licensee must ensure that the facility is constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the
animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
There is a coin operated food dispenser for public use in front of the enclosure housing 28 Jacob's sheep and two
Barbados sheep. The clear container allows for visualization of the food contained within. There is caking and
discoloration of the food at the bottom of the food container. The food dispenser was covered with plastic at the time
of inspection because the licensee is concerned about water getting into the container. Deterioration of food for the
animals can lead to contaminated food and decreased nutritional value. The licensee must ensure that food shall be
wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all
animals in good health. To be corrected by 11 October 2014.
The non-compliant item listed under Adequate Veterinary Care on the previous inspection report - 2.40(b)(2) has
been corrected.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
