ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****
A tan female French Bulldog "Fatty" (139) had a raised, reddened, swelling area in between its toes on her front left
paw. The tissue in between the toes was swollen, missing fur and it was displacing the normal configuration of the
toes. The raised, abnormal appearing area on the foot could be the result of injury, infection or a variety of
veterinary medical conditions which may be painful. The licensee must consult with veterinarian in order to ensure
that accurate diagnoses are obtained and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Veterinary care from the 1/15/13 inspection for the French Bulldog has been addressed.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
