SANITATION.
*** The enclosure housing 1 male and 1 female serval had an excessive accumulation of debris (dried blood, food
debris, dirt, excreta etc.) on and in the housing structure and on a plastic chair. These dirty objects come into
regular contact and pose a health risk to the animals. An excessive accumulation of waste can increase insects,
pests, and odors, and may harbor pathogens and play a role in disease transmission. These surfaces should be
cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard husbandry practices.
