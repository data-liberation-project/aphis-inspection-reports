SANITATION.
Two of the enclosures housing rabbits had a buildup of excessive feces on the wire floor of the cages. This buildup
of feces can be a source of disease, odor and pest control issues as the weather becomes warmer. These cages
need to be cleaned. Clean these cages more frequently to prevent the accumulation of excessive manure.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosure housing the mini-cow and zebu is completely covered in standing water and mud. In addition to this,
the shelter is full of feces with no dry bedding. There is no dry place for these animals to lie down. These animals
need access to dry area to keep them comfortable.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The shelter for the enclosure housing the mini-cow and the zebu contained an excessive buildup of fecal material.
When the animals lay down in this shelter their coats can become contaminated with this fecal material. They can
then ingest this material while grooming. Ingestion of fecal material can lead to parasite and disease problems.
This shelter must be cleaned on a more frequent basis to prevent possible health issues for the animals using it.
