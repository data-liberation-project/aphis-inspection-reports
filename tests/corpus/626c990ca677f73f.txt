PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The marmoset enclosure had a heating pad with an unprotected electrical cord lying on the floor of the enclosure.
This cord had small scratches and nicks on a few areas of the vinyl wire coating which suggest the marmoset may
have played with it in the past. Additionally, there was an electrical cord connected to a fan hanging outside of the
enclosure but located within reach or contact of the marmoset. Electrical cords within reach of marmosets creates
the possibility for injury or electrical hazards to the marmosets. A facility system must be in place to ensure primary
enclosures are maintained so that they protect the animals from injury.
