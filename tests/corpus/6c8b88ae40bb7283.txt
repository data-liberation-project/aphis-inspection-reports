Facilities, general.
During the inspection, the staff at the facility stated that there have been multiple cases of predation on their prairie dogs
over the past two years, both by birds and bobcats. Employees have seen birds of prey and bobcats on facility grounds
and bobcats have been seen on trail cameras set up near the prairie dog enclosure. The medical records for the prairie
dogs also show a history of predation. The facility has a one-acre enclosure that contains approximately 40 prairie dogs
and is surrounded by a 2.5-foot-high chicken wire fence. There are no deterrents on the fencing or covers over the top of
the enclosure.
Failure to provide an enclosure that protects the animals from predation can lead to injury or death of the animals.
The outdoor housing facility for the prairie dogs must be structurally sound and constructed in a way that protects the
animals within from injury. A corrective plan with a reasonable timeline for completion must be developed.
To be corrected by 10 January 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
