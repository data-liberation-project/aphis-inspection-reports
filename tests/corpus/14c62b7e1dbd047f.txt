ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- An adult female camel was observed with a broken halter fastened only around her neck. The halter was no longer
over her nose or behind her ears. The halter hung from the neck creating a loop which could become hooked on
fencing, trees, or other objects. At the time of the inspection, there had been no attempt to remove the broken
halter from this animal. The licensee stated the halter had been that way for about a week. All animals must be
observed daily for problems of animal health. These problems must be frequently and directly addressed to best
provide for their health and well-being. The licensee must observe animals daily for problems.
