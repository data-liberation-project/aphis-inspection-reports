3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There were 4 enclosures housing approximately 55 guinea pigs and their offspring that had fecal material
consolidated into a wet pad on the floor area especially around the automatic water valves. Hay was present on top
of the wet pad. The accumulation of debris, feces, and wet bedding exposes the guinea pigs to potential infections
with bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Too much feces and liquid waste is accumulating between the cleaning interval.
Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of
excreta, wet bedding , and debris. Correct by June 14, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
