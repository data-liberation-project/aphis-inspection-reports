2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1200pm on
07/22/2014.
Multiple attempts have been made to contact this licensee with negative results. I stayed for 30 minutes in the
driveway calling the licensee on the numbers provided. The home phone has now been disconnected and the cell
phone is set to not take any messages. The licensee has never returned any phone messages or tried to make
contact with this inspector and has not been inspected once since he became licensed. This licensee has actively
refused to communicate with the inspector to allow an inspection and has continually made no effort to work out any
arrangements for future inspections. Attempts have been made on multiple days and times with no results, and the
licensee has not communicated any 'optimal times for inspection' options after repeated messages and 'attempted
inspections' requesting this information. This is the fifth attempt at an inspection since his Pre-license August 1,
2013.
Please contact this inspector at 618-315-3649 ASAP in order to sort out optimal times for inspections.
