FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.
The pelleted food for 6 juvenile rabbits was being stored in a plastic trash container with no lid. The storage shed
where the container was located was cluttered with equipment and various supplies and there was an accumulation
of rodent feces over the entire visible surface of the floor of the shed. No evidence of rodent control could be seen
in this storage shed and there is a potential for contamination of the rabbit food by the rodents since the food is not
in a container with a tightly fitting lid.
Contamination of food and bedding by rodent pests poses a risk to the health of the animals due to potential
disease transmission and to deterioration of the food such that t may not adequately meet the dietary needs for the
rabbits.
Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against infestation
or contamination by vermin.
The plastic trash container was replaced with a new container with a tightly fitting lid during the inspection.
Improved housekeeping and pest control in this food storage shed should be implemented by 8/1/2015.
Accompanied on the inspection by the Facility Maintenance Director. Exit interview conducted with facility
representatives and AC VMO, Tracy Thompson, DVM, on 7/30/2015.
