HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The marmosets have been moved into a new enclosure. This enclosure has three doors and two sides that are
exposed to the public. The two sides have overlapping wire mesh present that does not allow the public direct
access to the primates. Two of the three doors are covered with plexiglass. However, the other door is only covered
with a ¼(cid:29) mesh. This does allow for the public to have direct access to these primates. To ensure the safety of the
primates and the general public this door will need to be addressed.
