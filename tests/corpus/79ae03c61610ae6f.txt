2.1(b)(1) Repeat

Requirements and application
The capuchin monkey, Elvis, is not at the licensed facility. He has been kept at the licensee's home since the pandemic
shutdowns began. There was no notification to the Agency of the move. The home site is not covered under the license.
A license is issued to specific persons and for approved sites. The licensee must notify Animal Care at least 90 days prior
to a substantial change in business, such as location of the animal.
Keeping Animal Care informed as to the location of the covered animal allows for the required unannounced inspections
to ensure compliance with the Animal Welfare Act.
2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) states that annual fecal exams will be done to screen for parasites. The
last documentation of a fecal test was on 5/31/2019.
A written PVC is required for consulting veterinarians to ensure plans are in place for routine husbandry, routine health
care, and emergency care. This is especially important for exotic species like nonhuman primates. The PVC must be
followed as written, demonstrating that the Attending Veterinarian (AV) has appropriate authority to ensure adequate
veterinary care.


The licensee made on the day of inspection a veterinary appointment for 3/11/22. The appointment is not with the
previous AV. A copy of a blank PVC is being sent with this report so the new veterinarian can complete it.
Correct by close of business on 3/18/2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
