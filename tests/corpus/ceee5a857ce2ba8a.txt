FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Dogs at the facility were able to gain access into the wallaby enclosure resulting in the wallabys death. The dogs,
owned by the facility owner, were able to enter the indoor wallaby building through the entrance door. The door was
closed, but the dogs forced it open as per the facility representative. All animal housing facilities must be
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to prevent unauthorized animals from entering.
Note: An new entrance door was placed on the wallaby building.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The camel enclosure has a drainage issue. A section (approximately 10 ft by 3 ft) of standing water and mud is
present along the entire entrance to the camel's inside barn access. An additional section ((approximately 20 ft by
10 ft) of thick, saturated mud is present adjacent to the standing water, extending out into the enclosure. The camel
must walk through the mud and standing water to gain access to its shelter, food, and water receptacles. The
standing water can serve as a breeding area for insects. The mud is a potential hazard to the camel.
Assure the camel enclosure has adequate drainage to prevent standing water and thick saturated mud.

2. A pile of hay mixed with feces is present in the outdoor area of the reindeer enclosure. This pile is the result of a
couple of days worth of cleaning the indoor area for the reindeer. Additionally, excessive feces are present on the
ground of the indoor area for the reindeer. The pile could potentially provide a breeding area for insects and other
pests. Excessive feces are a potential health hazard to the animals.
Remove the pile from the reindeer enclosure. Clean and disinfect the reindeer indoor area.

SANITATION.
Excessive flies are present in and around the enclosures containing 2 reindeer and 1 camel. The camel was
observed moving his head back and forth as it was attempting to shoo the flies. The male reindeer had no fewer
than 10 flies on his legs. The reindeer also attempted to shoo the flies. There are several fly strips around the
enclosures, however; they are not sufficiently controlling the fly population in these areas. Flies can carry diseases
that affect animals.
Implement provisions to effectively control the fly population in the animal areas.
