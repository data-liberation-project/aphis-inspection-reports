HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The barrier for the two serval's enclosure consists of a black vinyl-coated chain mesh as the keeper gate has been
removed at time of this inspection. The mesh is not properly supported and gives excessively when pushed against.
This barrier needs to be repaired or replaced to assure the safety of the animals and the public.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The buried black-coated chain mesh is exposed at time of this inspection around the shelter area and side of the
enclosure for the crested porcupine. The mesh needs to be buried again so that the animal will not get injured and
the dig barrier remains intact and structurally sound.
