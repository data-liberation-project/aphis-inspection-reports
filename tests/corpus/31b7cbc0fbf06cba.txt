2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On 9/18/2022, a rhesus macaque enrolled on protocol #0222-010-25 was restrained in a primate chair and transported to
the lab for an experimental session. The investigator working with the macaque did not monitor the animal continuously;
he subsequently forgot that the session was running and left the facility for the evening. The IACUC approved protocol
states that experimental sessions are limited to a maximum length of 8 hours a day and that restrained animals are
monitored continuously for physical and mental well-being.

Animal care staff noticed that the animal was not present in its enclosure the morning of 9/19/2022 and contacted the
investigator immediately; he returned the animal to its home enclosure. Deviation from the IACUC approved monitoring
practices and increasing the duration of the experimental session constituted significant changes to ongoing activities that
did not undergo IACUC review and approval. Animal use activities must be conducted in accordance with the IACUC
approved proposal and any changes to ongoing activities involving animals must undergo IACUC review and approval
prior to implementation.

This incident was voluntarily reported to USDA and corrective measures had been implemented at the time of inspection.

Miscellaneous.
A rhesus macaque was restrained in a primate chair from 1:50pm on 9/18/2022 until approximately 8:30am on 9/19/2022.
The animal was able to move his head and limbs within the device, but ultimately experienced continuous physical
restraint for more than 18 hours. This animal was not handled as carefully as possible; failure to return the animal to its
home enclosure at the conclusion of the experimental session resulted in the prolonged restraint of a conscious animal.
Animals must be handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause behavioral stress or
unnecessary discomfort.

This incident was voluntarily reported to USDA and corrective measures had been implemented at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
