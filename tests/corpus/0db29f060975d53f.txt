CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
Three rabbits used for public handling at a petting zoo were found to be housed with chickens, goats, and kittens.
The licensee stated that this was temporary as the adjacent pen where the rabbits are typically housed had been
treated with lime earlier in the week and they didn't want to move the rabbits or chickens back into that pen yet. The
licensee did state that the rabbits are allowed to run in the enclosure with these other animals from time to time.
Rabbits should not be housed in the same primary enclosure with other species due to the high potential for injury in
rabbits as well as disease transmission from the rabbits to other animals.
Rabbits shall not be housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species of animals unless required for
scientific reasons.
The rabbits were moved to an elevated rabbit hutch during the inspection.
Corrected on site.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
