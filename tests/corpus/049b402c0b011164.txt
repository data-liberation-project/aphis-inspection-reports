Primary enclosures.
In the outdoor enclosure for the ringtail lemurs on the end closest to the building, there were holes in the decomposed
granite that extended below the dig barrier. These holes pose an entrapment hazard for the two ringtail lemurs housed in
the enclosure. The floors of nonhuman primate enclosures shall be constructed and maintained in a manner that protects
the nonhuman primates from injuring themselves.
