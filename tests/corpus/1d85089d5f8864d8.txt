3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary enclosures. The four rack pens with a total of 20 enclosures housing a total of 226 guinea pigs still have
rusty wire on the front side by the automatic water receptacles. Primary enclosures must be kept in good repair to
protect the guinea pigs from injury, contain them securely, and constructed of smooth material which is impervious
to liquids and moisture. The rusty wire by the water valves and PVC drain pipe must be repaired or replaced so that
the wire can be repeatedly cleaned and disinfected, will not retain odors, or expose the guinea pigs to disease
hazards.
In addition, there is wire with protruding ends on the inside of front door to enclosures numbered 2 through 20.
Primary enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.
The wire with protruding ends on the front doors to enclosures 2 - 20 must be repaired or replaced so that there are
no sharp or protruding points that could injure the guinea pigs.
