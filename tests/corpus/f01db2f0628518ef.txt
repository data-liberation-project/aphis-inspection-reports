PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The lower level of the facility contained multiple primary enclosure cages that had areas of wire which was rusted to
a point that it can no longer be cleaned and sanitized effectively. About 10% of these enclosure surfaces are in this
condition. Some of the rust has advanced to a point that structural integrity of the wire is affected. This wire must
be evaluated and repaired or replaced if needed in order to prevent possible injury to the rabbits caused by failure of
this wire and to also along these enclosures to be properly cleaned and sanitized.

SANITATION.
All five rabbits housed in one enclosure had damp fur and feet. It was explained to the inspector that these rabbits
became wet during the cage cleaning process. Measures must be taken to avoid the wetting of rabbits during the
washing process. The damp conditions of the fur and hocks can lead to dermatitis of these areas which can cause
these animals discomfort.
