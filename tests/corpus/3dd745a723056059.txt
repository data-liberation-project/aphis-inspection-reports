INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility's records document that the last IACUC review of the program for humane care and use of animals was
conducted in March 2017, which was 12 months ago. If the program is not reviewed frequently enough, then
conditions that do not promote the welfare of the animals at the facility could go unnoticed and uncorrected. The
registrant must review, at least once every six months, the research facility's program for humane care and use of
animals, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A--Animal Welfare, as a basis for evaluation.
No regulated animals present at time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the program director.
