2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care approves the licensee to euthanize dogs in case of emergency but does not provide
instruction on how to do so. The licensee states that she uses xylazine followed by succinylcholine intramuscularly
to euthanize dogs in cases of emergency. Succinylcholine is not an approved humane method of euthanasia for
dogs according to the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. Inappropriate methods of euthanasia can result in distress
and/or pain to the animal and can be a safety hazard. If the attending veterinarian intends to approve the licensee to
euthanize animals in the case of emergency, the program of veterinary care must document this. This
documentation must minimally contain information regarding what constitutes an emergency and when it is
appropriate for the licensee to euthanize animals, dosing of medications (route, concentration, dose, etc) and
instructions for confirming death. The licensee must ensure that all animals are euthanized according to accepted
methods. This must be corrected before any dogs are euthanized.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two lower sections of metal fence support posts are rusted with jagged edges and are showing signs of flaking
metal. Also the lower corner of one enclosure gate is rusted that has resulted in this corner section is missing.
Rusted surfaces can create rough jagged edges, prevent required sanitization, and can affect the structural
strength. All surfaces must be maintained to prevent excessive rust. Correct by 14 May 2016.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The plastic threshold and the plastic strips on the inside of one shiba inu enclosure are chewed resulting in
roughened surfaces. Also, the top plastic portion of one egress door is hanging down into the doorway and is
chewed with a roughened surface. Roughened surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces must
be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by
14 May 2016.3.9(b)
FEEDING.
There are at least 6 self-feeders being used in one sheltered housing building that have a build-up of food residue
and grime on the interior surfaces in contact with the food. Dirty food receptacles can contaminate the food and
affect the nutritive value of the food. If self-feeders are used, the licensee must keep them clean and sanitized them
in
accordance with 3.11 b. Correct by 21 April 2016.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an excessive accumulation of feces on the elevated floor on the outdoor portion of one enclosure.
According to the licensee the feces from this enclosure was last cleaned two days ago. There was also an
accumulation of feces caked in the holes of the elevated flooring, especially where there are wooden supports
under the flooring material. Also there was an excessive accumulation of feces in two outdoor housing enclosures.
The licensee stated these enclosures were raked three days ago. Accumulation of excreta can soil the dogs,
increase disease transmission, and attract flies and other pests. Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures
on a daily basis. Correct by 15 April 2016.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO and Kendall
Lundy, ACI.
