2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
On April 8, 2015, this facility did not have a person available so an animal welfare inspection could be performed.
Lack of availability for an unannounced inspection makes it impossible to evaluate if the facility is in compliance of
the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct for all future unannounced inspections.
