*****The area where the animals are housed was dirty and cluttered. The room had not been cleaned to the
standards as prescribed for in the required husbandry practices. There was clutter outside the bottom portion of the
chincilla enclosure as well as the hedgehog enclosure. The room contained an excessive amount of clutter which
would not allow for proper cleaning of the area. The room and the areas around the animal enclosures should be
cleaned on a regular basis; remove all clutter items and unnecessary items in the area so that the room area can be
readily cleaned and sanitized in an appropriate manner.
