2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
New born tiger cubs were move by the caretakers without notifying the attending veterinarian which resulted in the
possible rejection of the cubs by the mother and eventual death of the cubs as explained by the AV.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
behavioral stress or unnecessary discomfort.
A new neonate protocol has been implemented by the AV in order to deal with future birth of animals and to reduce
the possibility of animals dying.
It has been corrected at this point.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Due to soil erosion there is a large gap under the fence dividing the llama and ram enclosure. The animals are
exposed to the sharp edges and points of the chain link along the bottom of the fence. The gap may entrap the
animals feet and legs if they slip under the fence, or the points may cause injuries.The housing facilities shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
The exposed chain link shall be extended and buried as not to cause a hazard to the animal.
The camel/deer/aoudad exhibit still has an area along the one of the sides where the shelter roof & gutters continue
to have leaves, ferns, dirt, a small tree, etc, which continues to clog the drainage system. This also puts extra
weight on the gutters (as well as the roofs).
This roof shall be cleaned and maintained in a clean fashion to prevent vegetation buildups on the roof structure to
prevent additional structural weight/stress, as well as to facilitate drainage and keep the enclosures dry.
There is a dried tree limb with evidence of termite infestations hanging over the jaguar enclosure. If this tree limb
should break off and fall onto the top of this enclosure it may damage or break the mesh.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION. Cockroaches, crickets, ants, etc., where again seen alive under the pallets in the feed storage area in camel barn.
The rodent boxes were observed to be empty or with very small amounts of bait.
A safe and more effective program for the control of cockroaches and rodents shall be established and
maintained. The areas should be cleaned more frequently in order to remove old feed and hay.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
