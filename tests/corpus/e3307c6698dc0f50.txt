ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection, an adult 6yr old white female Westie ((cid:28)Wynne(cid:29)) had 'weepy' pink lumps protruding from between
the toes on both the right and left front feet. This female also had a large buildup of brown material on the molars,
causing plate-like ridges with areas where the gums were pulled away from the teeth, leaving pockets where
bacteria/infection can reside. A 10yr old male Yorkie (Blake) had an excessive amount of wet fur around his mouth,
upon inspection he had very deformed upper molars that were twisted in the gums, with the one on the right having
a large amount of dark brown/black material built up and pulling away from the gumline. Both of these dogs and
several others at the facility had nails that were in need of trimming as they were quite long and sticking over the
wires of the flooring in some cases.These are all medical conditions that could affect the health and well-being of
the animals. These conditions must be evaluated, diagnosed and treated by the attending veterinarian.
All medical conditions should be attended to according to the attending veterinarians directions, and/or seen by the
attending veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment as soon as the condition is observed in order to keep a
treatable condition from becoming chronic and to decrease the pain and discomfort for the regulated animals.
The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian for any medical issues and promptly carry out the treatments
for those conditions where treatment is prescribed. Toe nails need to be trimmed in a timely manner in order to
prevent the nails from getting too long.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The walls and doggy doors of the outside runs have an accumulation of brown/black grime material where there is a
lack of cleaning and sanitization. While the run floors are cleaned daily, the walls and doors are not cleaned or
sanitized properly to prevent the accumulation of grime buildup. There are some areas along the walls inside the
primary enclosures where there is a buildup of brown/black grime and debris that is not being cleaned or sanitized,
and the food receptacles are not being cleaned and sanitized at least every 2 weeks as there is a buildup of debris
inside the metal ledge in all of the feeders.
The lack of proper cleaning and sanitization of surfaces that come in contact with the animals can be a vector for
disease and parasites and can be a potential for health issues.
Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks
using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards
