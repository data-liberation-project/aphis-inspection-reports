SANITATION.
There are three enclosures for the six sugar gliders. The hide boxes for the animals are excessively chewed and/or
the tops have a buildup of excreta. The boxes that are excessively chewed need to be replaced and the soiled
boxes need to be cleaned or replaced. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to
prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
