3.6(a)(2)(9)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The floors, walls and doors on the outside portion of the primary enclosures were moderately worn. The primary
enclosures in this area are constructed of primarily of coated wire. The wire coating has been worn or chewed off
over portions of the floors, walls and doors. In the majority of these areas the exposed wire is rusted. These areas
of the kennel are no longer in good repair. The areas where the coating is damaged provide crevices that material
can become entrapped preventing adequate cleaning and sanitization. Additionally, the rust which has formed over
the exposed wires also prevents them from being readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by repairing or replacing
these damaged areas. All surfaces in contact with the dogs must be readily cleaned and sanitized in accordance
with Sec. 3.11 (b) of this subpart, or be replaceable when worn or soiled.
