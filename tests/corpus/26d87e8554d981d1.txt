RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* Official USDA record of animals on hand (other than dogs or cats form 7019) had 28 different animals recorded
but there were 40 different animals counted by the inspector. The records were four sheep, six goats and two zebu
cattle short. When the records and animals currently at the facility do not match it makes the records incomplete.

facilitate the ability to trace these animals. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all
animals at all times at their facility. Correct by 4/9/17.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two separate areas of missing, splintered wood were observed on the back wall of one outdoor sheltered building.
In addition, an estimated two inch wide by six inch long hole was observed on the back wall of the same outdoor
sheltered building. Lastly an estimated three inch gap was observed along the back wall of the same outdoor
sheltered building. Three goats are in contact with the affected areas. Deterioration of wood surfaces can affect
the structural integrity of the enclosure. If splintered wood is accidentally ingested, it could have a negative impact
on the health of the animals. The licensee must ensure that outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 3/23/17.
#########################
* Baling wire, woven wire fencing and galvanized cattle paneling all have protruding wires with sharp points
extending inwards towards the animals in multiple spots. Some of the protruding wires were observed to be at the
animal's eye level when standing in a normal position. Nineteen different species of animals are in contact with the
different protruding wire spots all located in outdoor housing. Protruding wires with sharp points could cause
potential injury to the animals. Potential injury to the head area or body could have a negative impact on the
animals. The licensee must ensure that outdoor housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury. The licensee must remove all protruding wires with sharp points or alter them in a manner that
eliminates the risk of injury to the animals. Correct by 3/23/17.3.131(a)
SANITATION.
* Excreta was observed accumulating on the interior floor area of two outdoor enclosures housing nine animals.
Removal of excreta from the enclosure on a regular basis is necessary to prevent an accumulation excreta. It
indicates unsanitary living conditions exist that could increase the risks of disease transmission, which can
negatively affects the health of the animals. Accumulations of excreta can potentially create odors, serve as an
attractant for flies, insects and other pests. The licensee shall remove excreta from the primary enclosures as often
as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained theirin and to minimize disease hazards and to
reduce odor. Correct by 3/16/17.
* The facility inspection done on 3/9/17 and the verbal exit briefing done on 3/13/17 were conducted with the
licensee.
