ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:45 am on
08-Nov-18.
I arrived at the facility at 11:45 am. I called the owner in which she stated she would be available in the afternoon. I
explained that I was unable to wait until then and that this visit would be considered an attempted inspection. I left
the premises at 12:00 pm.
