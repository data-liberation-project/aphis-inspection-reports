3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the dog exercise yard, there is a gap between the gate and the adjacent support pole. The gap is wide enough
that a larger dog could get a nose or paw into the gap, and then there is a possibility of injury if the paw or nose is
pulled out quickly, or gets stuck. Adjacent to the gate, there is small horizontal metal post that extends partially into
a smaller gap between two parallel vertical bars, and can potentially catch a paw and cause injury. According to
facility personnel, there have been no injuries noted after dogs have been in the play yard, but a system of
maintenance must be in place to ensure that the housing facilities protect animals from injury.

SANITATION.
*In one of the magnums adjacent to the pig magnum and across from the kangaroo housing, the bottom support
pipes of the cage had areas of missing paint and had rusted.
*Kangaroo transfer cage (attached to a rolling base) had multiple holes in the bottom where debris and excreta
could fall through and get trapped between the vari kennel and the rolling base.
*Vari kennel for temporary holding of agility dogs had rust on 75% of the front door.
Rust and areas that trap debris are not able to be readily cleaned and sanitized in order to minimize disease
hazards. Enclosures and premises must be kept in good repair to allow effective cleaning and sanitizing. A system
of maintenance must be in place to ensure that the enclosures are kept in good repair and can be readily cleaned
and sanitized.
