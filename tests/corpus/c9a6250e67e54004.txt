2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
On March 9, 2022 a 26-year-old female chimpanzee briefly escaped from an indoor primary enclosure. Facility staff
attempted to shift 4 chimpanzees from one indoor room to a neighboring indoor room. Once the animals had shifted, staff
members locked the door between the rooms and conducted a visual check of the empty room and saw no animals.
Then, one staff member entered the apparently empty room to begin cleaning. Unbeknownst to the staff member, one
female chimpanzee was still lying in a hammock overhead, unseen. Once the staff member had entered the room to
begin cleaning, this chimpanzee climbed out of her hammock and exited the bedroom, entering an adjacent interior
hallway which is not an animal living space. All staff members were able to exit the area and close all of the necessary
doors to prevent further movement of the animal. The facility’s animal escape protocol was activated and the animal was
safety sedated and returned to a primary enclosure. The staff members and the animal were both unharmed by the
incident, and staff members were subsequently re-trained on animal shifting and relevant safety protocols.
Animals who escape from their primary enclosures may be stressed, injured, lost, or may cause injury to nearby humans.
Correct by January 5th, 2022 by ensuring that animals are handled as carefully as possible, and in a manner that
prevents escape and does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. The facility
corrected this issue prior to the inspection.



This inspection was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian, the Head of the Behavior Department, and the Head of the
Husbandry Department. The exit briefing was conducted with the aforementioned personnel and the Clinical Veterinarian
and the CEO.
