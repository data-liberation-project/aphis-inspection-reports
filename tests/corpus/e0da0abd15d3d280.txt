Time and method of identification.
Three puppies (one Pyrenees and two Cocker spaniels) less than 16 weeks old did not have any type of individual
identification. Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory,
disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must properly identify each puppy with a microchip,
tatoo, or collar.

3.6(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
Seven puppies in a total of four enclosures (pens #9, 19, 20, and 38) in the holding facility only had 1-4 inches of head
space. Adequate head space is necessary to provide enough room for the puppies to comfortably make natural postural
movements. The licensee must ensure that the interior height of each primary enclosure is at least 6 inches higher that


the head of the tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position.
