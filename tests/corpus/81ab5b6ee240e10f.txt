ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection, a wolf named "Squishy" was observed shaking its head, standing with a right head tilt, and
scratching at the right ear. The animal displayed one of these signs every 30-45 seconds while being observed. The
licensee said she believed it was a sign the animal wanted attention. No veterinarian was contacted about the
wolf(cid:25)'s condition and no treatments were started. The signs displayed in this animal are a classic indication there is
some irritant in the animal's right ear, such as an infection or debris. Failing to provide appropriate methods to
diagnose and treat the animal(cid:25)'s condition resulted in the continuation of the problem while causing discomfort to the
animal. Additionally, the animal may cause secondary trauma to the ear and ear canal while trying to scratch at the
afflicted area. Correct by having the animal examined and treated by a licensed veterinarian.

2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee failed to recognize that a wolf (described above) was displaying abnormal behavior that is most likely
the result of a medical condition and did not report it to a veterinarian. Daily observation must be provided to all
animals to assess their health and well-being, and a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with a
veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on problems are conveyed. By not identifying and
reporting the abnormal signs displayed by the wolf, the animal remained untreated and in discomfort. Correct by
contacting a veterinarian about the wolf(cid:25)s condition. Furthermore, ensure all animals are adequately observed daily
to assess health status, and all problems identified are reported to a veterinarian in a timely and accurate manner.
Correct this day forward.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee did not have a record of disposition for a wolf hybrid that was on hand during the last inspection (dated
05 December 2014). The licensee stated that this animal is now a pet. Accurate animal records regarding births,deaths, acquisition and disposition are used to help evaluate the facility's animal care program and for animal
tracking for ownership and health care concerns. Every exhibitor must make, keep and maintain records or forms
which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning animals purchased, acquired, owned, held,
leased, or otherwise in his or her control, or were transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of by that
exhibitor, including any offspring born of any animals while in his or her possession or under his control.
The absence of disposition records impedes the inspection process and makes animal tracking difficult to
impossible, which is especially important in the event of a disease outbreak. The licensee must keep and maintain
accurate records of acquisition and disposition for all covered species.

3.56(b)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
One rabbit enclosure housing one rabbit had bedding that was excessively wet that requires cleaning. The licensee
stated that enclosures are cleaned and soiled bedding is removed and replaced with new bedding every 2-3 days or
as often as the licensee believes is necessary. The door entrance to 2 of the rabbit shelters in 2 different
enclosures are significantly chewed on the edges. The inside of one of these shelters also has areas of chewed
wood on the back wall of the shelter. This back wall is also warped inward from what appears to be water damage.
Bedding must be removed and replaced as often as necessary as required by this section to allow the animals to
stay clean and dry. Wooden surfaces that have significant chew damage cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized
and should be repaired or replaced to facilitate adequate cleaning and sanitation. Enclosure with significant damage
such as warping walls may have to be completely replaced to ensure this cleaning and sanitization can be
accomplished and to ensure the enclosures adequately contain and protect the animals.

3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The front of the outdoor portion of the brown lemur enclosure is made of a metal panel frame and braided chain link
type metal interior. This metal is rusted over at least 90 percent of this front section. Surfaces that come into
contact with non-human primates may not be excessively rusty, as this can affect the structural strength of surfaces
and prevents the required cleaning and sanitization of enclosures. Any surface that comes in contact with the
nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that
affects the structural strength of the surface. Correct this by ensuring that these areas are repaired or replaced and
that all surfaces that come in contact with the individual are constructed and maintained in a manner that allowsthem to be readily cleaned and sanitized and are removed or replaced as needed.
Correct by: 17 April 2015
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following areas were found in need of repair or replacement:
1. An area of chain link fencing for 2 adult tigers (named Hank and Crystal) was found pulled loose from the
structural supports. This area is an approximately 1 foot long section in the back right corner of the enclosure
where the bottom structural support rail meets the chain link fence wall.
2. The barn housing the African crested porcupine has two areas of wall that has been chewed, leaving 2 holes in
the walls of the enclosure.
3. The enclosure housing one adult pig has an approximately 12 inch wide section of coated metal wire attached to
the bottom of the left enclosure wall (that appears to be previously buried metal wire) running the distance of the left
wall of the enclosure. This wire is now above the ground and only attached to the lower wall on one side.
4. One enclosure housing 2 adult black bears (one male, one female) has a broken/loose section of 4X4 wire that
makes up the wall between the two enclosures they can access. There is also a section of metal flashing that runs
along the bottom of the door to this enclosure that is now loose and bent outwards.
5. The gate to the yard housing the male camel is broken on the lower left corner. This gate is made of chain link
with metal tubing framing. The metal tubing is rusted and broken on the bottom left corner of the gate.
6. The metal feeder for the kangaroo and Patagonian cavy is coming apart at the seams on the top and there is a
loose edge near the left front. This has created sharp areas on this feeder that are a potential injury hazard to the
animals.
All of these areas are in need of repair or replacement. They are all areas of potential injury or escape. The facility
must ensure that all animal enclosures are maintained to adequately contain the animals and protect them from
injury.

3.127(c) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The primary enclosure for an adult male Syrian brown bear was extremely muddy with no available dry area, apart
from the den box, in the enclosure. The ground of the 12 ft. by 12 ft. (approximately) enclosure was completely wet
with a mixture of stone, gravel, mud, and water. The animal(cid:25)'s feet would sink several inches into the ground as itstepped. The animal(cid:25)'s feet, lower sections of legs, and belly were wet and covered in mud. The licensee stated the
animal usually has access to another similar adjacent enclosure which was significantly drier, but she was cleaning
the enclosure and locked the animal to the one side. The licensee reported the animal was only confined to the
completely wet enclosure side for a couple of hours while she cleaned but was interrupted by the inspection. The
drier adjacent enclosure also housed a female Syrian brown bear. Because the licensee did not want the two bear
mating, she had to separate the two bears. This would mean the licensee would have to keep the female in the den
box while giving the male full access to both enclosures and an additional den box in order to provide both bears
with a dry area while also separating them. Bears must have access to a dry clean space. The inability to get to dry
areas can be very distressing. Constant environmental moisture not only can promote infections but also affects the
animal(cid:25)s ability to thermoregulate and keep clean. Correct by ensuring there is suitable method to rapidly eliminate
excess water from the enclosure. Correct by 3/17/2015.
***The licensee removed several wheelbarrows of wet bedding added additional clean bedding to this enclosure.
This was corrected at the time of the exit interview.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence is currently inadequate and does not function as a secondary containment system. Although an
8 ft. high perimeter fence is present surrounding the facility, there were eight large mature trees within 3 feet of the
perimeter fence that had no preventives to stop an animal from climbing the trees and leaping over the perimeter
fence. Additionally, there were piles of building material and animal husbandry items leaned up against or near the
perimeter fence that could be used as elevated platform to jump over the perimeter fence. The presence of these
materials against the fencing effectively reduces the height of the perimeter fence. A substantial perimeter fence
that is maintained in good repair and not less than 8 feet in height is required for all outdoor housing facilities that
contain potentially dangerous animals. Perimeter fencing protects the animals in the facility by ensuring in the event
of an accidental escape there is a secondary containment mechanism to prevent the animal from leaving the
property and endangering public safety thereby placing the animal(cid:25)'s life in jeopardy. Correct by removing all
building materials and other debris that are in close proximity to the perimeter fence and altering trees in a manner
to ensuring the perimeter fence can adequately function as a secondary containment system.
