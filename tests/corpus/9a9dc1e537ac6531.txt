Contingency planning.
A contingency plan has not yet been developed at this facility. Dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers
must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation,
housing, and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster (one which could reasonably be anticipated
and expected to be detrimental to the good health and well-being of the animals in their possession). A plan must be
developed documented and followed and employees trained on the plan. CORRECT BY : 2/25/2023

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The owl monkey previously housed with the lemur is now housed alone. The current environmental enhancement plan
does not address special considerations for individually housed non-human primates. Individually housed non-human
primates that are unable to see and hear non-human primates of their own or compatible species require special attention
within this enrichment plan in order to promote psychological well-being. The facility must develop and maintain a written
enrichment plan that provides special considerations for non-human primates requiring special attention. CORRECT BY:
