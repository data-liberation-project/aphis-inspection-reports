PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were 26 weanling guinea pigs housed in an enclosure measuring 42" by 27.5 " or 1155 square inches of floor
space. The maximum number of guinea pigs allowed in that enclosure would be 19 based on the size of the
enclosure and the weight of the weaned guinea pigs.
Insufficient space can lead to aggression, undue stress and creates conditions in which promotes the spread of
disease. Weanlings weighing up to 360 grams require 60 square inches of floor space per animal. Licensee
separated the weanlings into two enclosures at time of this inspection.
Licensee must ensure that adequate space is provided for the animals. The space provided must be sufficient for
each guinea pig contained to make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Sufficient
space will decrease the likelihood of aggression, stress, and risk of disease. Correct from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
