Four chinchillas were observed to have unresolved eye problems today:
**Chinchilla #118 (cid:19) had crusty material covering and sealing closed its left eye. The licensee removed the crusty
material and we observed the eye had a thick pale discharge and the area around the eyeball was missing hair, was
reddened, and appeared swollen.
**Chinchilla BD-X-531 - was unable to open its right eye due to crusty material around it. The left eye was pale in
color instead of the normal dark color.
**Two Chinchillas (No ID's, located in back section - south) - The right eye of both chinchillas had a crusty material
around it and the eye was not easily visualized.
These chinchillas were observed in the previous inspection (April 6, 2015). The licensee reports to have followed a
five day treatment prescribed by a consulting veterinarian but has not communicated to the attending veterinarian
that the eye problems remain unresolved. When a prescribed treatment fails to correct a problem that an animal
has, the licensee must promptly notify the attending veterinarian so that the animals can be evaluated and adjust
the treatment plan per the veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations. Failure to treat unresolved health problems under the
guidance of the attending veterinarian can cause animals to remain in pain and may allow sickness to spread to
other animals in the building.

The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian to have the affected animals evaluated and to have a
treatment plan documented and ensure that the plan is carried out. Documentation of the treatment plan and that it
is being followed may be requested by inspectors in future inspections. 2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In evaluating which animals have received treatment since the last inspection the facility could not locate chinchilla
#118. Chinchilla #118 was listed in the April 6, 2015 report as needing to be evaluated by a veterinarian. The
facility was not sure if #118 remained at the facility. We searched the enclosures and found chinchilla #118 and
found that its left eye had problems. There were no enclosure markers or notes indicating that the facility was
aware that it needed treatment. Lack of close daily observations does not ensure that a sick or injured animal will
receive veterinary treatment if needed. The facility must develop and maintain a routine of daily observations of
each animal. The facility must be in direct communication with the attending veterinarian promptly when animal
health problems are observed or when prescribed treatments do not resolve an animal(cid:25)s problem.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility still has 210 chinchillas housed on 1 inch by 1 inch metal wire flooring. The large holes do not provide
an acceptable flooring surface for the chinchillas since the holes are much larger than the feet of the chinchillas.
This wire spacing can increase the risk of injury to the chinchillas' legs and/or feet. More appropriate flooring
surfaces must be provided that do not have gaps large enough for the chinchilla's feet to pass through to protect
them from injury.
During the inspection, the licensee stated that a couple of chinchillas had gotten out of their enclosures. It was
determined that both escapes occurred in the stacked enclosures in the first room and involved one female with one
baby in enclosure numbered #6 on the top row and one male in enclosure # 151 located in the middle row. The
doors of these enclosures were open with a notation of (cid:24)missing(cid:25) on the cage card. These three animals remain
loose in the building and have not yet been recaptured. Loose animals may become injured or lack access to food
or water. Enclosures must be secured in a manner that contains the animals to ensure their safety and well-being.
NOTE: This was a focused inspection to check on the direct noncompliant items documented on the previous
inspection dated April 6, 2015. Chinchilla #131 and #505 documented under 2.40(b)(2) and 2.40(b)(3) have been
addressed.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
