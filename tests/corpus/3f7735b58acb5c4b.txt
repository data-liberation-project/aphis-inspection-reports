WATERING.
Several plastic water receptacles in the main hoofstock enclosure were empty of liquid and contained what
appeared to be a greenish yellow hardened organic material on the bottom and partway up the sides. Some of
these organic areas had scratch marks on them. The licensee stated that the source is well water. Unclean water
sources can harbor bacteria and insects, and can affect the health of any animal that drinks from it in a negative
way. Water receptacles be clean and remain free of algae, waste, or any other form of harmful material, or be
replaced if adequate cleaning is not possible. Correct by
