ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****Two dogs had eye problems that needed to be seen by a veterinarian. The right eye of an adult, female English
Bulldog named Sydnie (m/c# OAO 1673800) had a cloudy cornea, redness in the conjunctiva, and a thick discharge
from the eye The right eye of an adult female English Bulldog named Valentine (m/c# OAO 2021913)had a cloudy
cornea and a thick white discharge. This dog has had ongoing problems for several months with that eye and
responds to treatment, but the problems reoccur when treatment is stopped. The Attending Veterinarian told the
licensee that eye may need surgery if problems contineued but the licensee has not returned the dog to the
veterinarian despite the reoccuring problems. Eye problems can be painful, can progress rapidly, and can result in
loss of vision. The licensee must have these dogs examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment.
****Two dogs had skin problems that needed to be seen by a veterinarian. An adult, male English Bulldog named
Mr. Wuffles (m/c# 000FCC5E3) had a 2 inch by 4 inch lesion on his face. This area had lost some hair and the skin
was reddened and seemed greasy. The Attending Veterinarian had examined this dog on 5/23/15 and noted skin
problems at that time. Her recommendation was to treat the dog with chlorhexidine and cephalexin when these
conditions occurred. The dog was currently being treated with only chlorhexidine and did not seem to be improving.
An adult, female English Bulldog named Krispy Kreme (m/c# OAO 1673967) had a 6 inch in diameter area over her
rump that was missing some hair and had red, greasy skin. The licensee was treating the lesion with only iodine.
Skin problems can be painful and can be an indication of an underlying medical condition. The licensee must have
these dogs examined and treated by a veterinarian.
