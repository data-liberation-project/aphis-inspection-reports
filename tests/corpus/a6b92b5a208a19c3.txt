Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The records are incomplete. Counts of animals on hand, born, and euthanized are not recorded. Complete and accurate
records give an overview of animal health, and are needed to evaluate and achieve optimal animal welfare. Licensee
shall make, keep, and maintain records which correctly disclose animals on hand, and those which are born, transported,
sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by licensee. Correct by November 15, 2022
3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
Some of the enclosures are too dirty. Wet shavings, moisture and fecal material has collected at the end of some of the
enclosures near the lixits. The Guinea pigs must go into the dirty area to drink water, exposing the animals to disease
hazards. Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or
debris. They also must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks in an approved manner. Correct by November 15, 2022
