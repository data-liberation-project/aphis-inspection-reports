ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A North American porcupine had a problem with its right eye. The eyeball could not be visualized. There was a
pale crusty material around the right eyelid. The facility noticed the issue with the animal, but had not contacted
their veterinarian prior to the time of inspection. Eye problems can be painful if not appropriately treated.
The animal's eye must be evaluated and treated as per the veterinarian's recommendation.
Note: Prior to the exit briefing, the licensee contacted their veterinarian to arrange treatment for the animal.
