2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
On August 09, 2022, a 2 year old child was bitten by a goat in the petting zoo. The individual goat could not be identified,
and the entire herd was subsequently placed under rabies quarantine for 10 days prior to release on August 19, 2022.
During public exhibition, all animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and the public, to
ensure the animals' safety and the public. Should an animal bite a member of the public, there is a risk to the public, and
risk to the animal of euthanasia for rabies testing. The facility must ensure that animals safety is not compromised during
feeding and or petting while on exhibition.
Correct from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
