Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Several puppies being housed in holding facilities had not received appropriate veterinary care for their health problems.
*Two Labrador mix puppies (ID# 106 and 107) and one male German Shepherd puppy (no ID) were lethargic, had body
condition scores of 3, were coughing and were visibly dehydrated as evidenced by skin tenting.
*A black LabraDoodle puppy (m/c# 992000000344338) was lethargic and had significant diarrhea with blood.
*Three German Shepherd puppies (#201, #203, and one with no ID) had hair missing around their eyes. Puppy #203
also was missing areas of hair (at least 1 inch in diameter) on its back and right side with dried blood in these areas.
*A female Cocker spaniel puppy (#20-160) had a large red protrusion in the corner of its left eye. There was some
yellow discharge from the eye that extended into the fur under the eye.
Untreated medical conditions can worsen, can be painful, and may be contagious to other dogs in the kennel. The
registrant must have these dogs examined by a veterinarian, must follow the directions for treatment, and must maintain
medical records for examination by the inspector.
