2.31(c)(4)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
o The IACUC was unaware of an incident in which a rabbit was euthanized for a broken back and no review or
investigation was conducted to determine cause and mitigation.

o The IACUC was unaware of a series of significant adverse effects of new test articles, which resulted in the early
euthanization of twelve rabbits due to more pain and discomfort than anticipated, per the consulting research veterinarian.

The IACUC must be engaged in the animal care and use activities of the research facility to ensure that protocols are
being followed properly, that adverse events are reported to the IACUC in a timely manner, and that these events are
reviewed and investigated if warranted, with mitigation strategies developed to avoid repeat events. If these duties are not
performed, unnecessary pain and suffering can result.

Per the regulations, the IACUC shall review, and if warranted, investigate concerns involving the care and use of animals
at the research facility resulting from public complaints received and from reports of noncompliance received from
laboratory or research facility personnel or employees. Correct by August 15, 2022.


3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
The hallway for the four swine rooms was unclean and had feces and shaving present. The mats in the hallway were
contaminated with feces and shavings, as were the boots stored in the hallway. The young Yucatan room was
excessively soiled with feces and wet shavings. Fecal material was present on the walls of the room as well as on the
primary enclosure caging and the shavings. Unsanitary conditions for the animals and personnel present in the facility can
lead to disease transmission and disease risk for both the animals and the personnel. Per the regulations, excreta shall
be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease
hazards and to reduce odors. Corrected during inspection.
3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The primary enclosures housing 13 dogs were unclean and had layers of brown grime and hair present. Although daily
cleaning of waste was being conducted, the cleaning and sanitization of the enclosures was inadequate. The hallway
entry to the dog rooms had mats and boots contaminated with fecal material. Unsanitary conditions for the animals in the
facility can lead to disease transmission and disease risk for both the animals and the personnel. Per the regulations,
excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily to prevent soiling of the dogs contained and to
reduce disease. Corrected during inspection.

This inspection was a site approval inspection.

This inspection (07July2022-11July2022) and exit interview (11July2022) were conducted with the facility representatives.
