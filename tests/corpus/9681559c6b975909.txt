ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1300 on
13-Dec-16.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the front door. I then called the contact number provided, left a message
and waited for 30 minutes.
