ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:30 AM on
07-Dec-16.
Called both phone numbers, no answer. Left a card on the door to call me. Licensee called and was away at a
meeting. The licensee gave me better days and hours of availability and a secondary person whom she designated
to conduct inspections.
