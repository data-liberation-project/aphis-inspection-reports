Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 898 adults, 71 weanlings and 132
newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records for the number of adult and weanling
guinea pigs for the last three months. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the
caviary by identifying guinea pig additions and losses by deaths or decrease numbers of animals born or animals kept for
replacement breeders, and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their humane care and use.

The facility must maintain complete records containing the required information which fully and correctly discloses the
guinea pigs held, owned, and disposed of including births and deaths. Remains uncorrected.
3.26(d) Repeat

Facilities, indoor.
Interior surfaces. The front wooden wall by the ladder still is not covered or sealed with an impervious surface. Indoor
surfaces that are not impervious to moisture can absorb moisture and liquids, retain odors, and do not allow adequate
cleaning and sanitization of room surfaces. Correct by sealing or covering the front wooden wall so that the surfaces can
be repeatedly cleaned and sanitized, won't retain odors, and do not permit the absorption of liquids and moisture.
Remains uncorrected.

3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
There is a buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the solid portion of the plastic sides, floors, and on wire
surfaces around the self-feeders of enclosures. The buildup of organic material such as this makes disinfectants
ineffective. Inadequate cleaning and sanitization exposes the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards such as bacterial,
fungal, and viral diseases. Correct by ensuing that enclosures are cleaned often enough to prevent a buildup of organic
material. In addition, enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Remains uncorrected.

This inspection was conducted with a family member and exit interview was conducted with licensee.
