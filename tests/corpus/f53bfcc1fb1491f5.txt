ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were several drugs on the premises including gentamicin, flunixin and oxytocin. These drugs had no written
directions or indications for use. All drugs on the premises must be labeled with target species, dosage and
indications for use or written directions must be included in the program of veterinary care or in an attachment.
This is to help ensure that these drugs are used in a safe and effective manner for the animals in which they are
used. The program of veterinary care also states that rabies vaccine is to be given to most animals at the facility on
a yearly basis. It was unclear if this is being done. The program of veterinary care must be reviewed by the facility
veterinarian and zoo management to make sure that all veterinary recommendations are being followed.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The male goat has exceeding long toes. The left front foot had toes that were beginning to curl. Long toes can lead
to joint problems as the animal compensates by altering their gait. These feet need to be trimmed to prevent these
issues for this goat.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure housing three pot bellied pigs has several sections of fence that have been pushed up by the animals
in the enclosure. There is an electric cord not currently in use lying in the pig enclosure. An enclosure housing one
camel has a gap in the fence large enough for the camel to stick its head through. The reindeer fence has been
repaired but has several wire points protruding. The enclosure fence for a pen of goats is pushed down where the
goats have been standing on it. The fence housing the male goat bent severely as it was head butted by it. These
enclosure fences need repair or replacement to adequately contain the animals enclosed in them. Animals can
become injured while attempting to push under or through gaps in fencing. Wire points can cause eye and faceinjuries. Repair or replace these enclosure fences. Remove or shield this electric cord.
Correct by: The male goat enclosure by 6-17-17. The remaining enclosures by 8-14-17.
