3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The dog runs have raised beds which are made of plastic frames and vinyl type webbing. Two of these are
excessively worn with frayed webbing along the edge and/or deeply chewed plastic corners. These areas could
harbor bacteria as they are hard to clean when damaged this way. These beds need to be repaired or replaced so
that all surfaces can be easily cleaned and sanitized.
To be corrected by 4-5-16.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
