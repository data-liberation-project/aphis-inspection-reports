2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A 6 year old black white and tan Yorkshire Terrier with the ID tag number 137 had a health condition requiring diagnosis
and treatment in consultation with the attending veterinarian. There was a moderate build-up of hard brown material on
the surface of the canine, cheek, and front teeth especially along the upper part of the teeth near the gum line. The gums
did not appear red or swollen and the dog was in good body condition. The medical records indicate the veterinarian
hand scaled the teeth in October 2020 but a physical exam on 4/21/21 did not include any abnormalities documented.
The Program of Veterinary Care on file did not address the condition or provide any treatment options. The licensee had
not observed the condition and had not contacted the attending veterinarian.
The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This condition
could be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally, and may result in spread of bacteria to other parts of the
body such as liver and kidneys which can negatively impact the overall health of the animal.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate the dog and determine an appropriate plan
for diagnosis and treatment.
