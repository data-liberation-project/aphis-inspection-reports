3.53(a)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General
***The floor of the rabbit cage has 1x1 inch openings. The feet of the chocolate satin rabbit and two black and white
spotted lop-eared rabbits housed in this cage can pass through easily. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a
manner that protects the feet and legs from injury. The floor of the rabbit enclosure must be modified to reduce the
size of the openings to prevent the feet of the rabbits from passing through.
3.56(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***The is a buildup of feces in in the back right corner of the Flemish rabbit's cage. There is also old feces and straw
that have collected between the metal mesh cage floor and a floor board within the cage. Primary enclosures must
be kept free of excreta and debris to provide the animal with a clean living environment and prevent exposure to
disease hazards. Excreta and debris must be removed from the primary enclosures at a frequency that will prevent
the build-up of material and to ensure the rabbit is maintained in in a reasonably clean cage for its health and
comfort.
3.75(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The pan in the bottom of the lemur cage is showing excessive wear and is moderately rusty. The structural
strength of the pan does not appear to be affected. Surfaces that come in contact with non-human primates must be
free of excessive rust. Since the lemurs do come in contact with the pan at times, the surface must be rendered free
of rust to facilitate cleaning and sanitation.
3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL. ***The resting wood board perch has a buildup of brown material and hair from more than one day. Hard surfaces in
which non-human primates come in contact with must be spot cleaned daily to prevent a buildup of debris, hair, and
excreta. The perch must be cleaned daily to prevent build up and to ensure surfaces that come in contact with the
animals are not contaminated.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The gate for the goat enclosure is loosely attached on one side with metal clips.
Gates must be secured in a manner that prevents unauthorized persons from entering the animal enclosure. The
gate must be more effectively secured for the safety and containment of the animals.
**Highland cow I Zebu: On one end of the gate, a set of 4 rungs of board fencing are attached to a wood support
post and extends beyond the post but does not attach to the metal support pole that secures the gate.The
unattached boards leave a gap between the fence and the gate, approximately 2 inches wide. A single chain or
twine secures the ends of the gate. The gate is still not designed in a manner that would secure the gate properly.
The gate must be secured so that a person cannot dislodge it and gain entry into the enclosure and to prevent
animals from escaping.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Pest Control
Fresh rat holes were observed in the area along the perimeter fence line behind the coati and arctic fox enclosures.
No rats were seen at the time of inspection. Rats harboring in areas near animals pose a disease hazard. A safe
and effective pest control program is necessary to ensure animals are not exposed to pests and the diseases they
may carry. Measures already implemented to control the rodent population must continue at an appropriate
frequency to prevent recolonization. Additional practices must be implemented to minimize rodent attraction to the
area and harborage.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses over 50 animals including regulated and non-regulated species. There some non-compliant
items that have still not been adequately corrected. Based upon non-compliant items related to cleaning, sanitation,
and maintenance there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the husbandry
responsibilities of the facility on a daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of employees to carry out the day
to day husbandry duties and maintenance on the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is needed to ensure
that cleaning, maintenance, and pest control duties are performed at an appropriate frequency for the number of
animals housed at the facility.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owners.
