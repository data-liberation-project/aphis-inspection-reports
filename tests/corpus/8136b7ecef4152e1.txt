HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the wolf hybrid pen, chain link fencing is buried under a layer of dirt to prevent digging. The wolf has exposed a
section of this chain link in one corner of the pen. This chain link is elevated above the ground, and is a potential
source of injury or entrapment to the enclosed animal. The facility must cover this exposed chain link flooring, and
must maintain the enclosure in good condition to protect the welfare of the wolf.
