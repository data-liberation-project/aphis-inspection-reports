SANITATION.
There is a lion enclosure in the northwest corner that contains a large pile of moldy feces and pieces of old
carcasses directly in front of the water trough. The most direct route to the water trough is through the pile of feces.
Within the enclosure, a lion, identified as "Hope," has a large, open, healing wound on the bottom of her rear foot
that is currently being treated by a veterinarian. Heavy accumulation of feces and rotting carcasses are unsanitary
and pose a contamination risk to the wound. Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards. To be
corrected by March 15th, 2018.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There are several down trees throughout the park, notably in the western most petting zoo enclosure containing an
Aoudad and 2 llamas and in the safari park near the cougar enclosures, where several species of hoofstock roam.
The trees are still wrapped in chain-link fence and wire that has become loose and are easily accessible to the
animals in the enclosures. The loose wire and fencing pose an entrapment hazard and can cause other injuries.
The grounds must be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and facilitate
appropriate husbandry practices.
There is a dilapidated duck hunting blind near the pond in the safari area that is accessible to the animals in the
enclosure. The structure has begun to collapse and poses an injury hazard to any animals that go in or near it. The
grounds must be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and facilitate appropriate
husbandry practices.
