Handling of animals.
The licensee has three adult brown bears, two juvenile brown bears and two adult black bears. The three adult brown
bears are housed in separate metal barrels that measure 4’ wide by 5-6’ long. The two juvenile brown bears are housed
together in one metal barrel that measures 4’ wide by 5’ long. The female black bear is housed in a metal barrel that
measures 4’ wide and 5-6’ long. All six of these bears are locked into these metal barrels with no ability to move out of the
barrels if desired. At the time of inspection, these bears were awake in their barrels with no access to food or water.
Additionally, the climatic temperatures were 34 degrees F.
Bears that are awake and locked into these metal barrels are in a state of unrelieved suffering as they have no ability to
move out of the barrels, no access to food and water and have limited ability to self-regulate temperatures during winter
weather conditions. Bears that are awake during their hibernation period and housed in metal barrels are susceptible to
hypothermia as the metal barrels are not insulated and provide no warmth.
Handling of animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
All animals must be handled in a manner that does not cause physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Appropriate
space, housing, food, and water must be provided to these bears to relieve undue suffering.

Facilities, general.
There are 2 cutouts on the front of the male, brown bear's barrel enclosure. The front of the enclosure is made of metal
grate. These cutouts have sharp points along the edges.

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained
in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

The cutouts in the front of the male, brown bears enclosure must be repaired to prevent injury to the brown bear enclosed.
3.125(c)

Facilities, general.
There are 4, 5 gallon buckets of chicken pieces being stored in the pole barn with no lids, or covers. This chicken is being
fed to the cougars.

Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration,
molding, or contamination by vermin. Refrigeration shall be provided for supplies of
perishable food.

Food supplies must be stored in a manner which protects them from deterioration or contamination by vermin to ensure
the food is wholesome, and palatable.

Space requirements.
The licensee has 3 adult brown bears, 2 ,two year old juvenile brown bears, and 2 adult black bears. Three of the adult
brown bears are locked in metal barrels that measure 4' wide by 5-6' long. The two juvenile bears locked in together in a
metal barrel that measures 4' wide by 5' long. The female black bear is locked in a metal barrel that measures 4' wide by
5-6' in length.

Enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal
postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Inadequate space may be indicated by evidence of
malnutrition, poor condition, debility, stress, or abnormal behavior patterns.

The metal barrels that 6 of the 7 bears are housed in are too small to allow the animals to move freely or make normal
postural and social adjustments. The bears cannot change position or turn around without contorting their bodies due to
the lack of space in the barrels. Appropriate enclosures must be provided to the bears to alleviate undue suffering.

Feeding.
Two of the adult brown bears, and the two juvenile brown bears were noted at time of inspection to be awake and moving.
No food is being offered to these bears. The food chute for the cougar has a large deposit of blood and fat coating it.


The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health. Animals shall be fed at least once a day except as dictated by hibernation, veterinary
treatment, normal fasts, or other professionally accepted practices.

The bears must be fed daily, or at a minimum when they awaken from hibernation/torpor to ensure they maintain an
appropriate body weight to sustain them through the winter, and to alleviate suffering. Clean the food chute used to feed
the cougar as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the food fed to the cougar.

Facilities, outdoor.
The licensee has 3 adult brown bears, 2, two year old juvenile brown bears, and 2 adult black bears. Three adult brown
bears are locked in metal barrels that measure 4' wide by 5-6' long. The two juvenile bears are locked in together in a
metal barrel that measures 4' wide by 5' long. The female black bear is also locked in a barrel that measures 4' wide by
5-6 ' long. One enclosure housing two cougars has two shelters. When approaching one cougar walked out of an
enclosure that had soaking wet bedding. The high temperature for Portland, IN on the date of inspection was 34 degrees
F.

Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall
be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.

Metal is unforgiving, and creates an environment around the bears that is too cold for the current outdoor temperatures.

An appropriate shelter must be provided to the bears to alleviate the state of unrelieved suffering. Clean, dry bedding
must be maintained in the shelter for the cougar to afford it comfort in cold weather.

Watering.
Two adult brown bears and the two juvenile brown bears were noted to be awake and moving at time of inspection.
Water is not being offered to these bears. The water for the cougars is mostly ice and very little, approximately 1 cup,
water is available to them.

If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and
comfort of the animal.

Potable water must be offered to the animals daily to sustain the health of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
