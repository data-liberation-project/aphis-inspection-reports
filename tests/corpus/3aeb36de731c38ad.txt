3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The shelter structure in the camel enclosure is in disrepair. The wall of the shelter has a piece of plywood that
has been knocked down. The support posts have been chewed on and whittled away leaving it not structurally
sound. The corners of the tin roof have been bent and ripped leaving sharp edges at a level accessible to the
camels which may allow the camels to become injured. There is one tin panel that is lifting or buckling on the
structure. The shelter shall be repaired, all sharp edges and broken wood removed from the enclosure to protect the
camels from injury.
***The latch for the back gate of the camel enclosure is not functional. The fence has pulled away from the gate
leaving a gap too wide for the latch to catch around the fence post. The gate is currently held closed by one chain.
This does not fully secure the gate. The gate entrance shall be repaired to completely secure the gate.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The two "shelters" provided for the camels are not constructed to sufficiently protect the camels from the cold.
On the first shelter there is only one wall which is composed of one sheet of plywood laying down lengthwise
affording a 4 ft high wind break. There is two feet of open space above this plywood and nothing provided on any
other side of the shelter. The second "shelter" similarly has a sheet of plywood on its' side and no other sides to the
shelter. The slanted roof of this structure is suspended above the plywood leaving a gap of open space
approximately 4 ft leaving the windbreak only 4 ft high.
The design of these structures is insufficient to provide adequate protection from the wind, rain and cold.
Extended exposure to extreme temperatures may lead to discomfort and/or illness. Adequate shelter shall be
provided to protect the camels health and well-being.3.127(c) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The side of the camel enclosure that has the feeding area is still very muddy. It is not currently possible for the
camels to access their water and feed without walking through the mud and water. There is a concrete pad just
before the opening in the fence leading to where the camels are fed. The camels walk across this pad to get to the
food. There is a layer of wet, slippery mud at least a foot deep in some areas on top of this concrete pad.
The slippery mud and standing water present safety and health hazards that may allow the camels to become
injured or develop foot diseases and lameness.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water to prevent the camels from being subjected
to these conditions and protect their health and well-being.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
