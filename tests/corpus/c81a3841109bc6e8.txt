3.56(a)(3)
SANITATION.
The manure under the rabbit cages is excessive on this inspection and needs to be cleaned out and disposed of
properly. If primary enclosures are equipped with wire or mesh floors, the troughs or pans under such enclosures
shall be cleaned at least once each week. Leaving large amounts of fecal matter under the enclosures is an
attraction for vermin and insects.
