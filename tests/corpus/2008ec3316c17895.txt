ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was an adult, female Yorkshire Terrier (#0A0 178 4873) that was slighlty squinting her right eye which was
nearly covered in a crusted, yellow discharge. The licensee stated she had not noticed the dog had a problem with
its eye until it was pointed out by the inspector. The licensee wiped the crusted material from the dog's eye and
applied an antibiotic ointment (Terramycin). The licensee stated that's what she was told to do by her veterinarian
for eye problems. However, there was nothing included in the Program of Veterinary Care (at the time of
inspection) which stated those instructions by the veterinarian. Squinting and excessive discharge could indicate
that the dog may have an eye condition which could be painful or quickly get worse. Numerous different things can
cause these types of clinical signs and a proper diagnosis is required to determine the appropriate medication. The
licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is
obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this
information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: 2 August 2015. The licensee acknowledged this date during the exit interview.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There was an adult, female Yorkshire Terrier with the microchip number: 0A0 178 4873. This identification (ID)
number wasn't listed as the ID number for any of the dogs on the list of dogs on hand. Multiple attempts were made
to determine if there was a second microchip in the dog but none was ever recognized by the licensee's scanner. A
call to the microchip company revealed that the chip was purchased in January 2014 but was never registered.
Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with
certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. The licensee must record an accurate ID number for this dog
on the list of dogs on hand and ensure that all other dogs at the facility have accurately recorded numbers.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: 31 July 2015. The licensee acknowledged the correction date during the exit interview.3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was a general lack of cleaning in a couple of the buildings housing the dogs. The grooming/treatment room
had dirt, dust, and debris in two of the corners of the room which were only a few feet from where several animals
were being temporarily housed. The window adjacent to the grooming/treatment table had an accumulation of dead
flies in front of it which measured nearly an inch deep. There were cracks and tears in a couple spots on the
linoleum floors where waste, hair, and debris was accumulating. Although the dogs aren't coming into direct contact
with these areas, unsanitary conditions in the buildings where they are housed increases the risk of disease
hazards. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of the housing facilities (including the areas that do not come in
contact with the dogs) are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry
standards and practices.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: 30 August 2015
The inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted by Dr. Owens (VMO) and Dr. Leisner (VMO) with the
licensee. The licensee was given all three correction dates during the exit interview and she acknowledged those
dates.
