SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The adult male bear named "Papa" was noted to have nails on the front claws that were frayed and splitting.
Evaluation of the bear exhibit and enclosures showed no objects such as logs or branches or any other rough
surfaces on which the bears can make normal postural scratching/digging actions necessary to wear down the
nails. The one log in the exhibit enclosure has a smooth surface. The facility needs to provide some rough surfaces
for the bears for scratching/digging. Correct by Sept. 24, 2015.
The older female bear "Honey" cited on the last inspection report has been seen by a veterinarian and is currently
being assessed for treatment.
Inspection conducted by Katherine Campbell, ACI, Susanne Brunkhorst, VMO and animal caretaker.
