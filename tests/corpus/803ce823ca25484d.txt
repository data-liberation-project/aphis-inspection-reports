2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female giraffe, Jane, has a severe angular deformation of the fetlock of the left forelimb. She has had a moderate
angle for many years thought to be from an old injury. She is now reluctant to bear weight on that leg, and is shifting
her weight back onto her hind limbs. Her comfort level has recently and quickly deteriorated to this level and she is
visibly uncomfortable and reluctant to move.
The Attending Veterinarian (AV) had not yet been notified of this change.
Daily observation of each of the animals is required so any problem or negative change in condition can be promptly
reported to the AV to be addressed. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment helps improve treatment results
and/or minimize suffering.
Correction: The AV must be notified immediately to evaluate Jane's condition. Note: The AV is scheduled to look at
the giraffe today, 10/23/2018.
This inspection and an exit interview was conducted with the ranch manager. An additional briefing was conducted
on 10/23/2018 by telephone with the licensee.
