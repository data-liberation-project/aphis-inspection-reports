FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength. There is a large gap under a wooden door in the guinea pig room. Housing facilities for guinea
pigs must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair, to contain the animals and to restrict the entrance of
other animals. Correct by closing the gap under the wooden door to prevent rodents and other pests from entering
the guinea pig room.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The guinea pig enclosures had fecal material consolidated into a wet pad under fresh hay inside the enclosures.
There was brown scale and staining on the sides of several enclosures. The enclosures were last cleaned 1 1/2
weeks ago. Too much feces, liquid waste and staining is accumulating between the cleaning interval. The
accumulation of feces and wet bedding exposes the guinea pigs to potential infections with bacteria, fungi, and
parasites. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an
accumulation of excreta, wet bedding, and debris.
