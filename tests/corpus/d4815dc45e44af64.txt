SANITATION.
Pest control.
Both mascots were being harassed and bitten by numerous flies, especially Ralphie V ("Blackout") who had several
bleeding areas on her back and right flank. Large numbers of flies were observed on both animals' legs and the
mascots were swishing their tails constantly and twitching their heads and muscles to try to move the flies away.
The facility is currently only using a fly spray applied periodically by the care staff to the animals to reduce this
problem but it is not effectively controlling the pests.
Excessive flies can create stress on the animals by swarming of their head and legs, cause painful bites, and may
transmit diseases.
A safe and more effective program for the control of pests, especially biting flies, shall be established and
maintained at both housing locations.
To be corrected by 8/6/2015.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the Caretaker, Director of Ralphie Handler Program, and AC VMO,
Tracy Thompson, DVM.
