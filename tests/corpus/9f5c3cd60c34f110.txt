ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*The licensee has a written program for flea control directed and signed by the attending veterinarian in July 2014.
The licensee stated that she is following this flea control program. Numerous fleas were identified during random
observations on the following dogs housed outdoors:
Pen #2 cream colored female dog "Dolce" was examined and noted to have numerous live fleas, was observed to
be scratching and had a small, crusted lesion on the neck under the jaw and mild inflammation with reddened skin
on the rear legs. The licensee stated that this dog experienced hot spots periodically and was receiving topical
treatment for the lesions.
Pen #12 gray female dog "Sonya" was examined, noted to have numerous fleas and was observed scratching.
Pen #12 black/white female dog "Ellie" was examined and noted to have numerous fleas.
Ineffective flea control resulting in large numbers of adult fleas harbored on the dogs and in their environment can
cause physical discomfort, result in tapeworm infestation, anemia, infection and contribute to medical complications
such as hot spot formation in sensitive dogs. The current flea treatment and prevention program should be formally
reviewed with the attending veterinarian to evaluate effectiveness and potential availability of new product
selection/upgrades. Correct by: November 21, 2016.
*Expired deworming medications were stored in the nursery where ten puppies and two adult dogs were housed
during this inspection. A bottle of Pyrantel Pamoate expired July 2016 and a bottle of Praziquantel injectable expired
October 2015. Out of date medications may lose efficacy and become unsafe for use. Using expired medications is
incompatible with the standard of care required to demonstrate adequate veterinary care under the Animal Welfare
Act. This non-compliance was corrected during the inspection by discarding the expired medications.
2.75(a)(1)(ix)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The animal inventory records had not been updated to reflect the death of the dog "Sweetie" and the donation of
three other dogs. The dates and method of disposition (died/donated) were not documented in the records. Records
shall fully and correctly reflect the disposition of any dog acquired or held by the licensee. This non-compliant itemwas corrected by updating the records during this inspection.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal door frame to Pen #1 housing one dog "Delilah" is excessively rusted and deteriorated at the top with
resulting holes. The bottom of the door frame on the left side as viewed from the exterior has deteriorated where a
clamp is attached and also has a hole in the metal. Housing facilities for dogs must be structurally sound and kept in
good repair. Excessive rust impedes cleaning and continued deterioration of the door could compromise
containment of the animals. This non-compliant item was corrected during the inspection by removing the dog to a
complaint enclosure.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with Drs. Moore and Pannil, the licensee and her friend.
