ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
One macaque ( RA 1982 ) on an active study was observed to have generalized alopecia and diarrhea, Review of
the clinical records indicate that this animal has experienced two episodes of collapse and was treated with IV fluids
by a technician. The veterinarian present at time of the inspection said she was notified many hours after the
episodes and has not seen this animal in over 2 weeks. There is no notation in the clinical record that the diarrhea
or alopecia is being addressed. Clinical records that contain results of the physical exam and treatment plan are
important to ensure adequate veterinary care is provided. Although daily observations may be done by someone
other than the veterinarian a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and
accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian.
