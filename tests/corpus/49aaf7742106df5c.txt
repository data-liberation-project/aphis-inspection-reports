2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The indoor building housing skunk was having spray insulation added to the walls. There are animals currently
being housed in the building. Windows and doors were open and fans were running; however, there were no
measures used to protect the animals from the aerosol drift. The aerosol could cause physical harm or unnecessary
discomfort as well as potentially contaminate the food and water. The licensee must remove the animals from the
area or implement measures to protect the animals.
The licensee corrected this at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
