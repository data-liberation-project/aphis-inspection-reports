3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Although some improvements in sanitation are noted, the facility still requires cleaning and organization. The room
for the hedgehogs has clutter, dust and debris present. Equipment and supplies fill one side of the room making the
area difficult to clean. In addition, discarded items and animal equipment awaiting cleaning are present on the
ground in front of the animal building. The equipment is being kept in unsanitary conditions, and could potentially
contribute to disease hazards and pests within the facility.
The animal housing room must be cleaned to remove clutter, dust and debris. In addition, equipment and supplies
must be properly cleaned, organized and stored to facilitate proper husbandry practices. The licensee must also
ensure that all unwanted items are properly discarded and removed from the property, and that the premises are
kept clean in order to minimize odor and pests.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 7/18/16, 9/11/17, 12/11/17 and 3/14/18.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
