Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Ulcerative lesions with crusting were seen on the distal ear tips of two Patagonian cavies. Fresh blood was also present
on the left ear of one of the cavies. Several flies were seen swarming around the ears of both animals, as they constantly
swatted and rubbed to offset the irritation and discomfort. Though the facility representative stated yesterday’s daily
observations found no abnormalities, the lesions observed during the inspection suggested an ongoing irritation.

Three adult Aoudad sheep were identified on inspection with pronounced forelimb lamenesses. The first lame Aoudad
noted in the enclosure was reluctant to stand, electing to crawl along the ground instead of standing upright. Once
standing, a marked, minimally weightbearing lameness was identified on the right forelimb, making it difficult for the sheep
to walk. Two additional Aoudads were observed with weightbearing forelimb lamenesses as they walked across the
pasture. The facility representative stated none of the affected animals were lame yesterday, yet they were unable to
confirm when daily observations were completed the day of the inspection.

Failure to observe all animals daily can result in deterioration of the animal's health, particularly when daily routine
observations are not clearly established. Daily observation of all animals shall be done to assess their health and well-


being. Timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being noted during daily
observations must be communicated to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate veterinary care can be provided.
2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
While observing at least 12 separate groups of patrons moving throughout the zoo during a full day of inspection, neither
inspector could locate any readily identifiable attendants present during public interactions with the animals. Unattended
periods of public contact and feeding of animals at the following locations were observed: goats (3 areas), llama (1 area),
zebu (2 areas), sheep (3 areas), camels (2 areas), deer (2 areas). In questioning the facility representatives, they stated
most of the employees had to assist with a haybale delivery and were redirected elsewhere at the facility. The remaining
caretaker staff was not sufficient to oversee both husbandry and public feeding interactions.
The lack of attendants present during times of public contact increases the risk of injury to patrons and/or animals. A
responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of
public contact.

Facilities, general.
An approximate 30 feet section of the back side of the zebra primary enclosure fence had three loose and/or broken poles
that allowed the fence to sway back and forth, approximately 35 degrees inward and outward. Though the facility
representative stated the fence damage happened one week prior, the loose poles no longer structurally support the 8-
foot-tall fence in a manner that adequately prevents potential escape of, or injury to, the zebras.

An approximate 10-foot-wide section of the front fence of the primary enclosure housing the peccaries was no longer


vertical and leaned outward about 30 degrees. The structural integrity of this section of fence was compromised and
allowed for potential escape of, or injury to, the peccaries.

Compromised structural integrity of primary enclosure fencing can provide a route of escape or injury to the animals
contained therein. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
