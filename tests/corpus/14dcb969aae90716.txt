Sanitation.
The front room housing 1 opossum and 1 skunk is cluttered with various items on the floor and countertops. One side of
the room has an accumulation of children's toys and other items. One wall has a significant buildup of brown
grime/organic material on the walls and along the baseboard due to the opossum enclosure being against that wall. A
number of flies are present in the room.

Accumulations of dirt, trash, and other debris and clutter can be a disease hazard to animals, can create noxious odors,
and can be a breeding ground for vermin. Excessive clutter can hinder husbandry practices and make it difficult to clean
and monitor for the presence of vermin.

Trash should be placed in designated areas, the premises kept clean, and clutter minimized.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
