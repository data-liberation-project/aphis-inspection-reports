ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:40pm on
29-OCT-19.
Upon arrival I knocked twice on the front door. After there was no answer at the door, I called and left a voice
message on the contact number provided. Additionally, I waited 30 minutes for someone to arrive and/or respond.
