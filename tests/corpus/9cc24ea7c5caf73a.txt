2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The program of veterinary care provided was incomplete. It did not list veterinary care procedures for all the
regulated species present at the facility within the past year (bushbabies were listed, but not sheep, rabbits, or
cattle). Furthermore, information was not provided about when reglarly scheduled visits by the attending
veterinarian would be made. A vague program of veterinary care can contribute lack of approprate and timely
treatment for ill animals. There were, in addition, no written provisions for emergency care in this document.
Research facilities employing a consulting veterinarian must have a written program of veterinary care listing all
regulated species and documented regularly scheduled visits to the research facility. To be corrected by 2/26/2014.
2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During inspection of the bush baby facility several bottles of expired medications were found mixed with unexpired
drugs. This included antibiotics and a topical spray expired for more than 30 days. Expired medications shall not be
used for the treatment of regulated animals as they can cause unintentional illness. Expired medications must be
clearly labeled as expired and separated from current medications, or properly disposed of.
3.75(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were at least two ceiling lights in one of the rooms of the bush baby facility with a coating of black film
material that was peeling off. As one of these lights was located over a corner of a bushbaby cage, pieces of the
black film material could fall off into the cages and cause injury to the animals (ingestion etc.). Housing facilities for
nonhuman primates must be kept inn good repair and must protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by
2/26/2014.
There was an electrical outlet in a room of the bushbaby facility that was missing a cover. As water is often used in
cleaning the facility, this could present a hazard to regulated animals or laboratory staff. Housing facilities fornonhuman primates must be kept inn good repair and must protect the animals from injury.To be corrected by
3/12/2014.
The exit briefing was conducted with the Director of ORI.
