FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The small fox enclosure currently housing two red fox is not surrounded by a perimeter fence. Also, the enclosure
housing the raccoon is only partially surrounded by a perimeter fence. Lack of perimeter fencing does not prevent
unauthorized people or unwanted animals from having access to the animals housed within. Also, lack of a
perimeter fence cannot function as a secondary containment system. A 6' perimeter fence must be established to
be used as a secondary containment system and to ensure there is no unauthorized contact with the foxes and the
raccoon to protect the safety of the animals and the public. Correct by September 30, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
