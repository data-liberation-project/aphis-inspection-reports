FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is an incomplete perimeter fence at the facility. The licensee was granted a temporary perimeter fence
variance that has expired. The license was able to place the fence posts, however due to winter weather conditions
he was unable to complete the perimeter fence in the allotted time. Lack of a complete perimeter fence does not
prevent unauthorized people or unwanted animals from having access to the animals housed within. Also, lack of a
complete perimeter fence cannot function as a secondary containment system. The bear enclosure must be
completely surrounded by a perimeter fence. Correct by June 30, 2016.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with the licensee and Jessica Rivera, ACI and Kimberly Miller, ACI.
