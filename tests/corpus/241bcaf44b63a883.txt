CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
The two shipments of dogs on Air Waybill numbers 729BOG77968693 & 779BOG78430240 did not contain a
written certification on the enclosures that the dogs offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery to the
carrier.
Carriers must not accept a dog or cat for transport in commerce unless the consignor certifies in writing to the
carrier that the dog or cat was offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery to the carrier or
intermediate handler. The certification must be securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure in a
manner that makes it easily noticed and read.
The certification must include the following information for each dog and cat:
(1) The consignor's name and address;
(2) The tag number or tattoo assigned to each dog or cat under Sec. Sec. 2.38 and 2.50 of this chapter;
(3) The time and date the animal was last fed and watered and the specific instructions for the next feeding(s)
and watering(s) for a 24-hour period; and
(4) The consignor's signature and the date and time the certification was signed.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
The dog enclosures for shipments on Air Waybill numbers 729BOG78430240, 729BOG77968693, &
729MDE78494430 only had the words "Live Animal" on the side(s) of the enclosures. None of the enclosures had
these words on top of the enclosures.
Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it is clearly marked on top and on one or more sides
with the words ``Live Animals,'' in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high, and with arrows or other markings to indicate
the correct upright position of the primary enclosure3.14(e)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
Two of the three enclosures under Air Waybill # 729BOG77968693 were two small to allow the two dogs in each
enclosure to make normal postural adjustment inside.
Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats must be large enough to ensure that each animal contained
in the primary enclosure has enough space to turn about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in
a natural position.
