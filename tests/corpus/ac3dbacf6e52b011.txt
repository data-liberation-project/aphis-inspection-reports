FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
One approximately 7 month old tiger is being housed in a chain-link enclosure that has a top on it. Part of the top is
covered with a fiberglass roof. The enclosure is surrounded by a privacy/perimeter fence that has large trees around
it. To protect the animal from excessive wind/rain, a wind/rain block needs to be added to the sides of the enclosure
that face the prevailing winds. Adding this protection prevents any potential discomfort for the animal, but should still
allow adequate airflow.
