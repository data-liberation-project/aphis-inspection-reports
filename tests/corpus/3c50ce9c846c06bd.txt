TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
(a) Identification
*** The licensee had a tattoo code approved by the APHIS Administrator. This code, as well as an individual and
unique number, is required to be distinctive and legible on all adult dogs to ensure proper and appropriate
identification. There were at least two adult Golden Retrievers that had a two-digit identifcaition number but the
tattoo code could not be visualized at all on the dog. Appropriate and unique identification is required in order to
ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements. If
using a tattoo as a method of identification, the licensee must ensure both the official, APHIS assigned tattoo code
as well as a unique number, are legible on each adult dog.
3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
*** There were at least four enclosures housing a total of 10 dogs which had shelters with inadequate wind/rain
breaks at the entrance. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the past 36 hour
low for the area was 6 degrees F and a wind chill of -9 degrees F. The entrances to these igloo type shelters were
not off set and were approximately only 10-11 inches long. Since it's a short, open, straight entrance into the
shelters, with no flaps or doors, the dogs are not adequately protected from the elements. The dogs need effective
wind and rain breaks on their outdoor shelter units to protect them from the elements and help keep them dry. The
licensee must provide adequate wind and rain breaks at the entrances of all the outdoor shelter units.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
****
There were at least 8 enclosures housing 10 dogs in outdoor enclosures without adequate bedding. According to
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the outdoor air temperature for the past 36 hours, in thearea was 6 degrees F for a low and wind chill was -9 degrees F with a temperature of 19 degrees F at the time of
inspection. There was only a minimal amount of bedding material inside the shelters.Some of the dogs were housed
indivually. Some of the shelters had most of the floor exposed while others had a thin layer of bedding that was
fairly evenly distributed on the floor with parts of the floor easily seen. Housing dogs in enclosures without providing
a sufficient source to keep them warm increases the risk of stress, hypothermia, illness and discomfort. The
licensee must ensure enclosures contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50
degrees F. Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees F or lower.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
