2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
** I arrived at the facility with Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission at 2:00 pm. The facility had a "for
sale" sign at the front of the premises. I called the facilities number and it was not in service. The gate was unlocked
and the premises appeared abandoned. We waited to see if anyone would arrive. We left the facility at 4:30 pm. A
responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 pm on
09/17/2015. A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection
process.
