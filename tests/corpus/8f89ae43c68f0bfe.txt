Time and method of identification.
Adult F yorkie #138 is missing her identification tag. Proper official identification is required to help manage and record
health records of animals at the facility. Ensure that her tag is found, a new tag is made, or if a new number is assigned
that records clearly show what her old number and new number are.
2.75(a)(2)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Two dogs #132 and #135 were donated in 6-30-2021 and the disposition was noted on APHIS 7005, however a
disposition form (APHIS 7006) was not completed for the disposition. The Record of Disposition of Dogs and Cats form
(APHIS 7006) is required to be completed and maintained by the facility for any dogs that are sold/traded/donated.
APHIS disposition records are required and can be important if animal health tracing needs to be completed.
3.6(a)(2)(x)

Primary enclosures.
The outside runs have slatted floors with some openings that are 1 and 1/16 inch by 2 inches. Occasionally a female
shitzu's and female teddy cross's hind feet would slip through the slat. Also, five enclosures have litters of puppies that
have solid floor mats but a portion of the floor is 1x1 inch mesh and the dividers are incomplete to prevent the puppies
from accessing the 1x1 inch mesh when they get bigger (the dams were observed to keep them on the solid portion


throughout inspection). Floors that allows adult dogs' feet to pass through and mesh that puppies can access could
cause injury. Ensure that the outdoor slatting does not allow dogs' feet to pass through any openings in the floor and
ensure that the dividers are complete and in place to prevent puppies from accessing the 1x1 inch mesh flooring.
