2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A black and white guinea pig in the mammal room was noted to have a 1 cm diameter area of brown crusted
material above its left eye. The licensee stated that facility staff had observed the crusted area prior to inspection
and had been providing first aid. The attending veterinarian had not been contacted prior to the inspection. This
crusted material may be an indication of an underlying health issue that could compromise animal welfare. Timely
and accurate information on problems of animal health must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian to ensure the
provision of adequate veterinary care.
Corrected on 9/21/18. The licensee contacted the attending veterinarian regarding the guinea pig and scheduled a
veterinary evaluation.
This inspection and an initial exit interview were conducted with a facility representative on 9/19/18. A
supplementary exit interview was conducted on site with the licensee on 9/21/18.
