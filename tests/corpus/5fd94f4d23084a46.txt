ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In enclosure #45, male yellow/white/black guinea pig has received trauma to both the right and left external ear.
Closer observation reveals that both ears are heavily damaged and appear to be nearly missing. The area around
both ears are reddened, bloody and have open wounds. A hairless area stretches from the guinea pig's right eye,
across the ear, along the neck and shoulder ending in the right flank area. Within the hairless area are sections of
raw, open wounds along with dark scab-like material. The bare skin appears slightly reddened. The licensee
moved this guinea pig to it's own enclosure at the time of the inspection.
In enclosure #24, female orange/white guinea pig has a large round growth on the bottom side of her neck. The
growth is slightly reddened, mostly hairless, firm, felt hot to the touch and has a circular, crusty, dark red area
located on it's surface.
In enclosure #19, male black/yellow/white guinea pig has a hairless area across the rump. Within this area are
multiple wounds. Some of the wounds appear reddened, dry, and have a crust along their edges. One wound is
raw, dark red, and damp.
In enclosure #51, female black/yellow/white guinea pig has a thin body condition. The animal's shoulder blades and
ribs could be easily felt with very little fat covering them. This guinea pig also appears to have an abnormal
appearance to her eyes. A thickened area is present at the front of the right eye and the left eye appears to slightly
bulge outward from the skull.
In enclosure #59, female black/white guinea pig has a large, firm growth on the underside of the neck and the front
left foot and toes are severely swollen.
In enclosure #8, female black/brown/white guinea pig has a large growth on the underside of the neck which felt firm
to the touch.
In enclosure #9, female black/brown/white guinea pig has a large, firm growth on the underside of the neck. The
growth is slightly reddened with areas of hair loss.In enclosure #32, female black/brown/white guinea pig has an abnormal appearance to the right eye. The eye
appears cloudy with a circular, red area in the center.
In enclosure #82, female black/white guinea pig has a grey colored discharge located in the front of the right eye.
The right eye appears cloudy with a small amount of a brown, crusty material attached to the eye lids.
In enclosure #52, female black/white guinea pig has a grey colored discharge located in the front of the left eye.
The left eye appears cloudy with brown, crusty material attached to the eye lids. The hair beneath the eye appears
wet.
Open wounds, abnormal growths and poor eye health could cause pain and discomfort to the animal as well as lead
to further health issues. Poor body condition could indicate an underlying health issue.
The above mentioned guinea pigs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to
develop an effective treatment plan. The licensee must provide adequate veterinary care to all guinea pigs at all
times.
To be corrected by: The licensee contacted a licensed veterinarian and established an appointment at the time of
the inspection.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee has records for the adult guinea pigs at the facility, but does not have any acquisition records for the
juvenile guinea pigs. The only records kept for juvenile guinea pigs are disposition records. Failure to keep
complete acquisition records does not allow for a detailed count of the number of guinea pigs housed on the
property at any given time and fails to provide the required acquisition information from guinea pigs acquired from
another source.
Records of acquisition including the name/address of the person whom the animals are acquired from, the date
acquired, and the number of animals must be kept for all guinea pigs at the facility and records must be kept for any
offspring born of the guinea pigs housed at the facility. The licensee must create and keep accurate acquisition
records for all adult and juvenile guinea pigs housed at the facility.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In enclosure #24, there is a dead juvenile guinea pig that is mixed into the bedding material. The 25 live guinea
pigs in the enclosure were observed running across the top of the flattened body of the deceased guinea pig.
Failure to remove deceased animals from the enclosures could cause the bedding to become soiled as well as
increase the risk of health hazards towards the animals.
Provisions shall be made for the removal and disposal of dead animals, waste, bedding and debris. The licensee
must ensure that dead animals are identified and removed from enclosures in a timely manner.
To be corrected by: The licensee removed the dead animal from the enclosure at the time of the inspection.
3.28(c)(1)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Enclosure number 3 is housing at least 10 adult guinea pigs and 10 weaning age guinea pigs. The enclosure is
49.5 inches long and 27.5 inches wide creating a total of 1,361.25 square inches of space. Each adult guinea pig
weighs between 2.2lbs and 2.6lbs and require at least 101 square inches of space each. This results in a total of
1,010 square inches of space needed for the adults. The 10 weaning age juveniles need at least 60 square inches
of space each. This results in a total of 600 square inches needed for the juveniles. Total floor space required to
house these adults and juveniles is 1,610 square inches. Failure to provide the minimum floor space can cause
overcrowding of the enclosure which could have a negative impact on the animals.
Each guinea pig shall be provided a minimum amount of floor space in the enclosure as indicated by the Animal
Welfare Act regulations. The licensee must ensure that all guinea pigs are provided the minimum amount of floor
space in order to avoid overcrowding and to support the well-being of the guinea pigs.

3.29(d)
FEEDING.
The facility uses metal self feeders to provide food to the guinea pigs. The exterior of the metal feeders are being
sanitized every two weeks, but the licensee stated that the interior of the feeders are not being sanitized. Failure to
sanitize the entire food receptacle could increase the risk of health hazards towards the animals.
All food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitized at least once every two weeks. The licensee must ensure that
the interiors of all the self-feeders are sanitized once every two weeks in order to support the health of the animals. To be corrected by: June 26, 2019
3.31(a)(1) DIRECT
SANITATION.
The facility has approximately 85 enclosures housing adult and juvenile guinea pigs. In at least sixteen of these
enclosures, containing at least 282 animals, the flooring is completely covered in compacted brown colored feces,
food and debris leaving no clean floor space for the guinea pigs. In at least eight of these affected enclosures,
containing at least 150 animals, the flooring is also covered in liquid creating a wet, sludge-like material that is
causing the guinea pigs to become soiled.
At the time of the inspection, the licensee was able to move guinea pigs housed in two of the wettest enclosures to
clean enclosures and he was also able to remove wet/soiled bedding from another enclosure and add clean/dry
bedding.
There is also a buildup of dark brown dirt and grime on the interior walls of the majority of the enclosures and the
ceilings of the enclosures are covered in cobwebs, bedding, feces and debris.
Buildup of dirt, grime and debris could increase the risk of disease towards the animals. Allowing the guinea pigs to
become soiled could have a negative impact on their health and well-being.
Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and debris,
provided that the enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks. The licensee must clean the enclosures
as often as necessary to ensure the guinea pigs do not become soiled and to eliminate the buildup of feces, dirt,
grime,debris and any other disease causing agents.
