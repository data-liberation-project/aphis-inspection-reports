2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was no current written program of veterinary care available for review at the time of the inspection. The
facility changed their attending veterinarian and the new veterinarian had not as yet provided their written program.
The written program of veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the
attending veterinarian in regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that the
written program of veterinary care is completed by the attending veterinarian and is available for review during
USDA inspections.
