NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
The licensee was reluctant to allow the inspection to occur and was antagonistic and belligerent from the first
moment. He initially stated that he wasn't going to do the inspection but when asked if he was refusing he said he
wasn't refusing and allowed the inspector to come on the property. The licensee continued with argumentative and
agitated complaints and arguments and would not listen or desist from ranting and complaining about the inspector
and USDA. The licensee's attitude was hostile, insulting, and antagonistic. When the inspector entered the primate
facility there was an odor of urine, feces, and a musty smell. When the inspector put on a face mask and started to
ask questions about disease monitoring the licensee became more agitated and insulting and would not listen to
anything the inspector had to say. The inspector indicated to the licensee that their behavior was interfering with the
inspection. The licensee told the inspector to leave.
