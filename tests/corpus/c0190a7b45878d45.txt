2.40(a)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection it was noted that Koko, the 46 year old female lowland gorilla, has been experiencing
episodes of lethargy and inappetence for approximately one month. Marked muscle atrophy has been noted in the
medical records. Caregivers describe her as lethargic and depressed, but with some good days and some bad
days.
The attending veterinarian assembled a team to immobilize Koko on 6/21/17 in order to perform a diagnostic
work-up, which was strongly recommended by the attending veterinarian in order to determine whether Koko may
have some treatable underlying cause for her decline. The procedure was cancelled with the parties involved
(owner / exhibitor and attending veterinarian) disagreeing on the appropriateness of the timing. As of the day of
inspection on 7/5/17, the recommended diagnostic testing had not been completed in order to determine possible
underlying causes for Koko’s recent decline. Additionally, Koko has recently been experiencing unexplained
episodes of twitching and stupor that the attending veterinarian believes may be medication-related, and there has
been some documented confusion regarding adjustments to drug regimens. The attending veterinarian stated that
he sees Koko’s condition as stable at the moment, but there are many unanswered questions about her recent
decline and new symptoms.
Animal exhibitors shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care, to include diagnostics and careful oversight of medications. Failure to follow the attending
veterinarian’s instructions could be detrimental to the health and well-being of the animals.
The exhibitor shall ensure that the attending veterinarian is able to closely monitor Koko’s status from this time
forward, with compliance with the veterinarian’s recommendations. The exhibitor shall work with the attending
veterinarian to develop a clear plan regarding Koko’s current condition, and possible diagnostic and treatment
options and recommendations, with this plan to be available for inspection by 7/14/17. Adherence to this plan
should be closely followed and documented. The attending veterinarian must be given appropriate authority, so as
to make the best decisions regarding adequate veterinary care, in order to safeguard the welfare of the animals on
site. This was a focused inspection on veterinary care.
The inspection was conducted on 7/5/17 with the Associate Director of Research and Care. An exit interview
occurred via teleconference on 7/6/17 with the owner / exhibitors, the Associate Director of Research and Care, and
the two USDA inspectors who conducted the inspection.
