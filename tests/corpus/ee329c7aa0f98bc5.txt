FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-During the cleaning of the female fisher #985112005255670 externally attached den box, a block was used to
cover the entrance and the lid was closed. When the worker returned and opened the lid to place the bedding in, the
block had been worked free. When the block was moved the fisher ran up and out of the den box. During the
attempt to capture the fisher it ran up and over the perimeter fence and has not been recovered.
-All animal enclosures must be constructed in such a manner that contain the animals from escaping. A program of
identifying and correcting the fisher den box; and other areas of future potential escape routes, must be corrected in
a timely manner to ensure the containment of all the animals and to ensure this noncompliant item does not repeat.
-To be corrected by: January 19, 2016
Exit interview was conducted with facility representatives
