HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor runs on the northeast side of the building appear to have shifted and are lower than the runs next to
them. When the dogs are outside in this area, these runs move and shake more than other runs on the building
suggesting that they are not as stable. If not stabilized, these runs could possibly fail or break and allow escape or
injury to animals. Ensure that all runs are stabilized and maintained in a manner that protects the safety of the
animals.
