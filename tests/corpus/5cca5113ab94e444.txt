Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee has 7 adult zebu that have severely overgrown hooves. Some of the hooves are starting to curl up at the
end. The angle at which the limbs contact the ground has been changed due to the severe overgrowth of the hooves.

Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

Hooves must be trimmed regularly to prevent the possibility of permanent bone changes, pain and improper gait.

Handling of animals.
The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development reported a bite incident to the inspector on September
13, 2022. A goat at the facility bit a child on Sunday, September 11, 2022. The child was seen by a physician and
treated for the bite wound. The physician reported the incident to the Michigan Department of Health. The facility is
unaware of which of the three goat pens, housing a total of 64 goats, the bite incident happened as there are not

attendants to oversee interaction with the goats, and no public barriers to prevent contact with the goats.

During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals
and the public.

There must be sufficient distance, barriers, or attendants that can control and observe public interaction with animals to
assure the safety of the animals and the public.

Facilities, general.
There is a fence made of cow panels that is used to lock the camels near the barn so that employees can mow the
pasture. One of the cattle panels has pulled away from the post and is no longer attached to the top and middle of the
post. This leaves an approximately 3' gap between the fence and post.

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Housing facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to ensure they are contained
while the pasture is mowed.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the head keeper.
