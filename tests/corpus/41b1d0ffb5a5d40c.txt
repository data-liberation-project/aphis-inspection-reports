HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Unattended public contact and feeding of animals was noted in three areas of the facility:
-A patron was observed approaching two zebra at the drive-through fence next to the lion enclosure. The patron
reached out to the zebra through the fence.
-Three groups of patrons were observed in the petting zoo area feeding and patting the goats.
-Three groups of patrons and two individuals were observed in the barn area feeding the goats, deer, antelope, and
alpacas.
Unsupervised public contact and feeding of animals can pose an injury risk to the animals and the patrons. A
responsible, knowledgeable and readily-identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during
periods of public contact. Correct from this day forward.

The cooler in the food prep room contained spoiled produce held in unsanitary conditions. Spoiled or unwholesome
apples, artichokes, grapes, mangoes, leafy greens, and pineapples were contained on shelves and crates
contaminated with brown grime and white filmy material. Unwholesome, unpalatable and potentially contaminated
foods can cause illness in animals receiving these materials. Note: Licensee completely emptied the cooler and
pressure washed it before the conclusion of this inspection.
3.129(b)FEEDING.
Food receptacles for the mature giraffes, the kangaroos/wallabies, and the barn enclosure housing goats and young
alpaca were coated in brown grime and excessive dust and dirt. Unsanitary food receptacles can serve as disease
reservoirs for the animals eating from them. Food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times. Correct
by 4/5/18.
