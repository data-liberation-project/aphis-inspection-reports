FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** On April 20, 2015 a ferret was found dead in its enclosure. It became stuck between the back wall and the
removable wire floor in an apparent attempt to get out of the cage. The removable wire floor became wedged in
place preventing the ferret from becoming unstuck. The facility found the back corner of the track that holds the
removable floor to be slightly warped allowing the wire floor to drop out of the track when manipulated. The cage
must be maintained in good repair to prevent injury. At the time of this inspection the facility has already repaired
and modified all existing ferret cages to prevent a recurrence of this problem, thus correcting the noncompliance.
The exit briefing was conducted with Dr. Sutherland, Associate VP of ARP, Senior Clinical Veterinarian and Director
of IACUC.
