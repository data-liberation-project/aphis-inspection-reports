ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1230 on
12-JUN-17. I went to the licensee's house. The person that came out informed me that the licensee was out of
town and no one was available to do the inspection. I told him I would try again another time.
End of report.
