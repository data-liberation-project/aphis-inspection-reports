3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***
An outdoor enclosure, containing 2 dogs, had shelters that were dirty. When questioned the licensee stated that it
had been last fall since they have been cleaned. The dirt and grime build up on the outside of these shelters can
become a disease hazard. The licensee must clean these shelters. The licensee must ensure that all hard
surfaces with which the dogs come into to contact with are spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two
weeks or more often if neccessary.
