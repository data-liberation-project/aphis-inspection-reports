ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1140 on
09/23/2014.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the door and honked my horn. I also called the contact number available to
me and waited for thirty minutes.
End of report.
