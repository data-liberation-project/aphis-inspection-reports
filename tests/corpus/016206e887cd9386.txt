2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
A review of disposition records of this Exhibitor indicated that an unregistered facility sells or receives compensation
in the form of adoption fees for rabbits.
The records included copies of APHIS Form 7020, "Record of Acquisition, Disposition or Transport of Animals
(Other Than Dogs and Cats)" for rabbits and for which the "Sold" box was checked. On these photocopied forms,
the Seller box contained "Urban Organic Supply" while the Dealer License number was listed as
"91-C-0138/325396." These numbers are the exhibitor license number and Customer Identification number (CID),
respectively, of Kirsty Lee LLC. The address for Urban Organic Supply was listed as the same address for this
Exhibitor.
These activities are restricted to licensed Dealers, as defined by the Animal Welfare Act. Only Kirsty Lee, LLC, dba
as Birthday for Bunnies, is licensed by the USDA as an Exhibitor. Urban Organic Supply is not registered or
licensed in any way with the USDA and should not be using the license or CID of Kirsty Lee, LLC.
Registration and licensing as a dealer is essential for the USDA to monitor and regulate entities engaged in these
activities to assure the health and well-being of animals held, bred and sold by such entities.
The Urban Organic Supply entity must be licensed as a dealer prior to sales of these animals.
Urban Organic Supply must terminate sales of rabbits until licensed from this point forward.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not have a back-up veterinarian listed to cover for such times when the
attending veterinarian AV is unavailable. The Facility Representative stated that the AV was out of the state or
country at the time of the inspection.Additionally, the PVC lists "Cervical dislocation" and "*See attached AVMA guidelines" as a method of euthanasia.
There were no guidelines present in the binder or at the facility. Without written instructions that provided details
including the weight range and without the attachment, there is insufficient information to support this method as
acceptable method of euthanasia.
The medication supply must be monitored to ensure that expired medications are discarded so that they are not
inadvertently used for the animals. Expired medications may not have the potency necessary for treatment of a
medical condition. The lock box or other devices used to store medications should be kept closed and must be
protect medications from adulteration that can adversely impact the animals when used.
The PVC must be completed to provide instruction to facility personnel for adequate veterinary care.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015, 4/12/2016, 9/6/16 and
4/5/2017.
3.52(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Due to construction on a neighboring property, a large section of the fence was removed. The fencing panels were
stored against the side of the building. Additionally, the gate was not able to be closed or latched, reportedly due to
swelling of the wood. The gate was held partially closed with a wire, but the gap created would be large enough for
a dog or other predator to enter. This wire was relatively thin and it is questionable whether it would be strong
enough to resist enough pressure to prevent entry. Additionally, there was a gap of approximately 5" under the gate
by the hinge side nearest the building.
Failing to maintain the fence and gate would allow predators access to the animals.
Correct by keeping the gate and fence in proper working order and the gate closed.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 9/6/16 and 2/22/17.
3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two primary enclosures had damage to the upper rear corners of the cages. These damaged areas had resulting
sharp points and gaps. The sharp points could cause direct injury to the rabbits. If the damage to the edge
continues, the gaps could widen resulting in escape of the rabbits or entrapment of a body part, which could lead to
injury or death of the animal.The facility was cited under this regulation previously cited on reports dated 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015,
4/12/2016, 9/6/2016, 12/28/16 and 2/22/17.
3.53(a)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Many of the cages have floors of wire that is not supported. The floors bounce when the animals move around,
especially the larger animals. The floors of a cage holding a larger black and white rabbit was bent with ridge-like
projections causing an uneven surface. This uneven surface could cause discomfort of the animal resting on them
due to uneven distribution of body weight and pressure or cause injury of the animal. Excess movement and slant of
the floors can be hard on the animals' legs, and the movement can fatigue the metal, causing it to break as
occurred with the cage of the gray rabbit.
A system of evaluation, maintenance and replacement of the primary enclsoures must be in place to protect the
animals from injury or discomfort.
This noncompliance was previously cited on 22 February 2017.
3.53(c)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two primary enclosures housing rabbits did not meet the minimum floor space.
One cage contained 6 rabbits weighing 4.4 pounds on average. The cage was approximately 30" x 36", or 7.5
square feet of floor space. The total minimum floor space required for these rabbits is 24 square feet.
One cage contained 4 rabbits weighing 2.75, 2.75, 3.0 and 3.0 pounds. The cage was approximately 24" x 30", or 5
square feet of floor space. The total minimum floor space required for these rabbits is 24 square feet.
The Facility Representative weighed the rabbits using their scale.
Each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be provided a minimum amount of floor space according to the
Animal Welfare Act regulations. Housing rabbits in inappropriately-sized enclosures may stress the animals. This
limited housing space can lead to increased susceptibility to disease, incompatibility, and fighting. Rabbits must be
housed in enclosures with the minimum required floor space for their health and well-being. The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 11/30/2015, 4/12/2016, 9/6/2016, 12/28/2016 and
2/22/2017.
3.54(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
The feeders of three primary enclosures had feces in them. The feeder of one female and litter contained nothing
but feces and no feed. All rabbbits huddled around the feeder when inspecting the feeder and all competed to eat
when food was provided.
The feeder in one of these primary enclosures had caked feed on one end.
Care must be taken when using self-feeders to ensure they are clean, in good repair, and that the food is not
allowed to spoil. Damp, caked feed may mold, becoming unwholesome and unsafe for the animals. Fecal
contamination may spread disease, such as from coccidia. If the feeders are subject to tipping, the facility must
assure that the rabbits are fed at least once daily and assure that the rabbits receive adequate nutrition to maintain
their health. Additionally the feed must be of sufficient quantity to meet the normal daily nutritional requirements.
A system of feeding and feeder maintenance must be in place.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 4/12/2016, 9/6/2016 and 4/5/2017.
3.55 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
Upon arriving at the facility, three primary enclosures holding a total of 6 rabbits each had empty water bottles.
When filled by the Facility Representative, the rabbits immediately started drinking and the four paired competed for
access to the lixit. The rabbits continued to drink after the water bottles were refilled, with one rabbit drinking for
approximately 15 minutes. These rabbits were obviously thirsty and access to water had been limited.
A sufficient amount of potable water must be provided to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.
Corrected for these rabbits at the time of the inspection. Sufficient potable water must be provided daily from this
point forward.
3.125
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A light fixture containing four fluorescent light bulbs was located adjacent to primary enclosures containing pregnant
females and females with very young offspring. While a metal mesh guard was in place, pieces of glass could fallinto the cages and could lead to injury to the rabbits should a bulb be broken.
A means of protecting the animals from potential bulb breakage must be used.
