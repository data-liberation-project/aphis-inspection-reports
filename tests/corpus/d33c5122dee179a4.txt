2.33(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
During communications with 5 employees across different university animal units, regarding with whom they would
communicate if their animals had a veterinary care concern, not one indicated that they would contact the Attending
Veterinarian (AV) or AV staff with animal concerns. This included 3 unit managers, 1 faculty member and 1 researcher.
They each indicated that they would call someone other than the AV, such as the Field Services Unit, a clinician on call, a
private veterinarian, or some other entity. Upon phone contact with one of the listed private veterinarians to be contacted
regarding equine concerns, the private veterinary hospital indicated that they had not provided services to NCSU since
December 2000.

The lack of the required direct and frequent communication between staff conducting the AV-delegated daily observations
of animals and the institution’s AV is pervasive. Per the regulations, each research facility shall establish and maintain
programs of adequate veterinary care that include: Daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being.
Provided, however, that daily observations of animals may be accomplished by someone other than the AV; and
Provided, further, That a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior and well being is conveyed to the AV. Correct by 11Aug2021. The AV


has begun correcting this lapse by developing new SOPs outlining the role and authority of the AV and the requirements
for direct and timely communications from whomever is performing daily observations to the AV.

Facilities, outdoor.
One pasture containing 5 horses at RCEF had no shelter or shade of any type. The temperature was recorded to be 95
degrees F, with a reported heat index of 105 degrees F.

Lack of adequate shade can cause significant heat stress and physical distress to animals housed outdoors. Per the
regulations, when sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort of the animals, sufficient shade by natural or
artificial means shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight. Correct by
18August2021.
3.129(b)

Feeding.
Multiple grain feeders in the Finishing Barns of the Swine Teaching Animal Unit (TAU) were thickly coated in dark grimy
material. The facility staff indicated that the feeders are only cleaned according the “all-in/all-out” method in which they
manage this herd.

Unsanitary feeders can be a source for infection and disease transmission. Per the regulations, food receptacles shall be
kept clean and sanitary at all times. Correct by 18August2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
