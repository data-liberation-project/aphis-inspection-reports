MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on13-Jun-19 at 12:00pm.
I arrived at the address listed in the file as the site address at 12:00pm and I knocked on the door. There was no
answer. I called the single number in the file and left a message. I waited for an hour at the address. There was no
return phone call and no one arrived at the site. I called the phone number again and again, left a message stating
that there would be an attempted inspection recorded. I left at 1:10pm.
