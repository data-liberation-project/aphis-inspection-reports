3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Most the floor space in seven enclosures was excessively soiled with wet bedding. A lack of clean, dry bedding can
cause animals to get sick and does not provide for their comfort. To prevent excessively soiled enclosures, ensure
the enclosures are cleaned more often and that clean dry bedding is available for the guinea pigs all times.
