2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection, there is no written program of veterinary care. A written program of veterinary care is required to
ensure that there is an expectation about the care provided to all animals. Failure to establish and maintain a written
program of veterinary care can decrease the ability to ensure optimal care of the animals.
A written program of care must be established and maintained so that the licensee has a plan for providing adequate
preventative care and treatments as necessary.

2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection, there are several bottles of expired medications comingled with unexpired medications in a bag
used for travel during offsite exhibitions: Flunixamine (exp. 10/2017), phenylbute injection 20% (exp. 04/16), Vitamin B12
(exp. 06/17), Dexium-SP (exp. 07/17), Dormosedan (exp. 08/2014), Solu-Delta-Cortef 500mg (exp. 04/2009). The use of
expired medications is not considered to be a safe or appropriate method to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed. The animals may experience pain and distress
due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or due to unexpected side effects.


The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
To be corrected by 20 July 2021.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee does not have records for acquisition and disposition of any of the animals. Records containing the required
information for animals disposed of or acquired for use in regulated activities, including those offspring born on premises,
are necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their humane care and use.
The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition and disposition of all animals that fully and correctly
disclose the required information.

2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
The facility is set up so that guests can buy food and feed the animals. Currently the park uses employees that are
engaged in other job roles (cleaning, and concession sales) to act as attendants for times of public contact with the
animals. Due to the number of animals that are fed interactively at the park there is no way for the employees to watch the
animals while conducting their other job roles. Lack of an attendant during public contact may lead to human and/or
animal stress and injury.
A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present during periods of public
contact.

Facilities, general.
-In the enclosure called, “Camel Pen,” containing one camel, two yaks, one water buffalo and six goats, there is a
temporary fencing panel wired to the east side of the pen with rusted wire, which has sharp points protruding toward the
animals.
-In the enclosure called, “Miles’ Pen,” containing one capybara, two alpacas and twenty-seven goats, there is rusted wire
with sharp points twisted around the fencing in several places, protruding toward the animals.
Loose wire and sharp points pose a hazard for animals. All enclosures must be constructed and maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury.

3.125(c)

Facilities, general.
In the feed storage structure containing the feed for all animals on premises, there is one open sack of pig feed and one
open bag of aspen bedding shavings. At the time of the inspection, flies are present and in contact with the pig feed.
Improper storage of feed and bedding can cause contamination, which can cause illness in the animals.
Ensure all supplies of food and bedding are stored to adequately protect them against deterioration, molding or
contamination by vermin.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

Watering.
The water receptacles in every enclosure, affecting all animals on premises, have a coating of brownish-green film on all
interior surfaces and contain cloudy, brown water with plant material and debris floating on the surface. The facility
representative told the inspector she could not recall when the water receptacles were last cleaned. Contaminated water


can cause illness and be unpalatable to animals.
Potable water must be accessible to all animals at all times or offered as often as necessary for their health and comfort,
and water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.
To be corrected by 14 July 2021.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
In the four upper pens which are accessible to one axis deer, two bison, two yaks, five zebu, two cattle, one Asiatic water
buffalo, one dromedary camel, 41 goats, four donkeys, one capybara, 18 llamas, seven alpacas, and ten sheep, there is
an excessive accumulation of feces covering the majority of the open and sheltered areas. The facility representative
stated that the pens are scraped down and the dirt replaced four times per year and that excessively soiled areas are
cleaned weekly. Feces accumulation attracts pests and increases the likelihood of disease for the animals.
Excreta must be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and reduce hazards and odors.
To be corrected by 13 September 2021.
