HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the "Gestating Building", the first enclosures on each side of the walkway have a section of wood flooring
against the wall. There are six dogs housed in these two enclosures. The dogs in these enclosures have chewed
and scratched on the wood. In one enclosure this damage by the dogs has exposed the heads and bodies of the
nails. This damaged wood is not readily cleaned and sanitized.

Along the outside of the "Gestating Building" there is a wood board attaching the top of the outdoor fencing of the
enclosures to the wall of the building. In two of these enclosures, containing at least six dogs, the wood has been
chewed and shredded by the dogs. This wood board that has been chewed and damaged by the dogs cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. All the damaged wood and other surfaces that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced or repaired when worn. The licensee must also establish a
maintenance plan to ensure that all wood and other surfaces remain in good repair and are readily cleaned and
sanitized.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the "Gestating Building", the enclosure fronts and sides are made of vinyl plastic. In all twelve enclosures,
housing at least thirty dogs, the vinyl plastic fronts and sides have a buildup of dirt and grime on them. In three
enclosures, housing at least eleven dogs, the access doors are made of vinyl plastic and have a buildup of dirt and
grime on them. A buildup of dirt and grime can increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs. The
licensee must ensure that all used primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks, and more often
if necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt, grime, food waste, excreta and any other disease hazards.Correction date: July 14, 2015

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the "Grower Building" the interior walls and the dividing walls of the enclosures are covered in small insects that
the licensee referred to as "pit flies". The licensee said that the insects had just shown up in the last few days.
There are six adult dogs and twenty-three puppies housed in this building. Infestation of insects could be a health
hazard to the dogs and contaminate their food and water. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective
program for insect and pest control so as to promote the health and well-being of the dogs and to reduce the risk of
contamination by pests in animal areas.
