Facilities, general.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that a refrigerator unit was being used to store a box of yams and a box of
bananas. The back wall, and the grates, of this unit had a black mold present. When I opened the door I noticed that it
was not working. It was warm inside. The box on the top shelf was filled with black and moldy bananas. The box on the
bottom shelf was filled with yams. We were informed by the staff member that these were just purchased and were the
extra that could not fit in the primary refrigerator unit. All food items need to be stored in a manner that protects them
from deterioration and molding. And since yams are a perishable food item they need to be stored in a working
refrigeration unit. To ensure that the food being fed to the animal collection is of good quality, this situation will need to be
addressed
