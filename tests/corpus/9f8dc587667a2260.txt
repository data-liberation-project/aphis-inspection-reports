PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One ring-tailed lemur was housed in a bird cage approximately 4 feet tall with floor space approximately 3' x 2'.
This cage does not allow this animal to make normal postural adjustments with freedom of movement typical for
the species. During this inspection the animal was observed doing continuous back flips suggestive of stereotypical
behavior. This animal needs to be provided with a larger enclosure that allows it to satisfy its normal behavioral
needs.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor enclosure housing two camels and one zebra, sections of fence are curling along the bottom and
have
broken wires protruding inwards. In other areas, patches have been placed to fix holes but sharp points are still
protruding. These points could injure an animal. There are additional areas along the fence that have wire sagging
from the top horizontal pipe. This could allow an animal's head to become stuck or cause injury to an animal.
These
areas of broken fencing must be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury.

The gate for the outdoor enclosure housing two camels and one zebra has a broken horizontal rail which has
become
detached and is laying on the ground. This broken gate could allow animals to escape or become injured. The gate
must be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by: May 6, 2016.
The indoor cage for one raccoon was severely rusted on all corner posts. There are sharp edges on the rusty
corner
posts of this cage which could injure the raccoon. These areas of rusted caging must be repaired or replaced to
protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by: May 6, 2016.3.130
WATERING.
The water bowl for the two bobcats behind the clinic was extremely dirty. At the time of this inspection, the water
was
brown with a group of flies swarming over something stuck on the bowl divider. Water receptacles must be kept
clean and sanitary. This bowl needs to be cleaned and a method for ensuring clean water is provided to the
animals
as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals needs to be implemented.

SANITATION.
In the barn housing three kangaroo and one wallaby, insulation material for the ceiling and walls was shredded and
hanging down over the primary animal enclosures and over the exercise area for these four animals. The animals
had access to an equipment storage area which has a lot of clutter and debris laying on the floor, as well as paint
and
chemicals. Trash containers which were accessible to the animals were full to the top and a wild rodent was noted
in
this area. Trash must be properly disposed of and maintenance supplies must be stored off the floors and away
from
the walls to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. Animal access to this area must be prevented to
prevent injury or ingestion of these materials. To be corrected by: May 6, 2016.
