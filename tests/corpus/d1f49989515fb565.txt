This was a focused inspection to address the 2.40 (b) (3) from the July 20th, 2016 inspection of 12 goats and one
sheep. The Attending Veterinarian had visited the facility twice since the original inspection. The ACI spoke with the
Veterinarian after this inspection and was told the animals had been given injections for their condition and are now
in a healthy condition.

This inspection and exit interview was conducted by Brenda Pietrosante, ACI and Lisa Macelderry, VMO, with the
facility representative.
