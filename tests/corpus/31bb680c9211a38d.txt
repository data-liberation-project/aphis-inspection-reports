2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
The African Crested Porcupine are housed in an exhibit with solid walls that are approximately 3 feet tall. The height of
this exhibit does not prevent a member of the public from reaching over the wall and contacting the animals. There must
be sufficient distance and/or barriers to prevent public contact with the animals to ensure the safety of the animals and the
public.

Housing facilities, general.
The fire hose hammock used in the holding area for the Orangutans has one strap that is broken and has numerous
frayed threads. The hole created by the broken strap has created a hole that may allow an arm or leg to become trapped
and the frayed threads may be caught on digits resulting in injury to the animals. Furniture-type fixtures or objects must
be sturdily constructed and must be strong enough to provide for the safe activity and welfare of nonhuman primates. The
hammock must be removed, repaired or replaced and must be strong enough to provide for the safe activity of the
Orangutans.
