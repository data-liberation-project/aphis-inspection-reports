RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The USDA ID on the dogs does not match up with the numbers recorded on the APHIS Form 7005. Dog with ID
#16 is a male, but on the forms is noted to be a female. It is unclear which dog, Ellen or Sunrise, is #10.
Five of the nineteen APHIS forms 7006 are missing puppy identification numbers. Date of birth, sex, breed, and
description of the of the puppies are recorded, but their ID numbers are not included.
Accurate records are necessary to trace animals in the event of a disease outbreak. Licensee shall make, keep,
and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required information.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Three Great Danes are housed in a stall with wooden walls and a dirt floor. These surfaces are not impervious to
moisture and therefore cannot be effectively cleaned or sanitized which may expose the dogs to disease hazards.
Indoor floor areas, walls, and other surfaces in contact with the animals must be impervious to moisture.
