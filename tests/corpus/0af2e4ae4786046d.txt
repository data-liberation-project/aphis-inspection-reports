Contingency planning.
The facility does not have a written contingency plan. Contingency planning is essential for protecting animals in the event
of emergencies. Correct by 10/15/22 by documenting a contingency plan in accordance with the requirements in the
Animal Welfare Act, and by training employees on the contents of the plan.

Facilities, outdoor.
3 red kangaroos are contained in a large enclosure with 8-foot-tall chain link fence. The perimeter fence around the
kangaroo enclosure is made of wire farm fencing and is approximately 4.5 feet tall. The facility is in the process of
constructing a new kangaroo enclosure which will have an 8-foot tall perimeter fence, but the new enclosure is still under
construction and is not yet in use. A perimeter fence must be strong and tall enough to prevent entry of unauthorized
people and animals, and to act as a secondary containment system in the event that an animal escapes from its primary
enclosure. Correct by maintaining a perimeter fence around the kangaroo enclosure that is at least 6 feet tall and 3 feet
away from the kangaroo primary enclosure, or by obtaining a variance from USDA. A perimeter fence must also be
maintained around any existing or new exotic animal enclosures in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations.
