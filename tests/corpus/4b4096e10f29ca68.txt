FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The rabbit barns do not have solid external walls, the lower portion of the walls are chicken wire to promote
ventilation. In the research barn, two to three areas of the chicken wire were damaged, created 4-6 inch gaps.
These gaps potentially allow predators to enter the barn and the facility needs to be enclosed to minimize the
entrance of predators. A system of maintenance should be in place to ensure that gaps are identified and repaired.

SANITATION.
The sheltered housing facility - Barn 1 had a significant crack in the concrete floor in the walkway next to the rabbit
enclosures. The floor is no longer in good repair and the crack is large enough to trap fecal material, which
prevents effective cleaning of the facility. The facility should ensure that the premises are kept clean and in good
repair to facilitate housekeeping and husbandry practices.
