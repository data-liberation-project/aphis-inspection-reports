HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The deer enclosure has an area that allows the public to approach the enclosure fence and feed the deer grain.
There is no employee in the area for this public contact. A 2-3 year old buck is housed in this area and gets
aggressive during rut. Grain and corn have be found in other animal areas from members of the public throwing it
into the other animal enclosures. The grain may not be appropriate for the other animals that encounter the feed.
An employee needs to be present for public contact or the barrier erected to prevent the public from coming into
contact with these animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the education area the animals are housed with sliding glass door fronts for access. The hedgehog enclosure
was unlocked and the public had access to remove the animal or open the front of the enclosure as no employee(s)
was in the area to monitor their actions. The enclosures must contain and protect the animals from possible injury,
escape or theft.

3.127(c)FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the Possum, fox and raccoon enclosures the mulch was excessively wet and the animals had very little surface
area that was dry. Wet bedding/mulch should be removed and fresh dry bedding/mulch provided. "Loki" the silver
fox is on medication for allergies. A wet or damp environment is not conducive for the health and well being of the
animals.
