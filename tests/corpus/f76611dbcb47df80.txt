FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an observation window overlooking some of the shift doors of the orangutan enclosures including the door
between the outdoor yard and the indoor off exhibit enclosures. This window allows the keeper staff to see as they
operate the mechanical door and to observe the movement of the animals when they are shifting and moving
through the doors. This window has been worn and partially obscures the ability to see the door clearly. The facility
placed a work order to replace this window in October 2015 however as of the date of the inspection this window
still has not been replaced. The decreased ability to observe the animals near the mechanical door could lead to
injury. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals
involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair
to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected 12 May 2016.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives, Michael Tygart, VMO and Margaret A
Shaver, VMO in attendance.
