2.33(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***The facility did not perform adequate daily observations of a beagle and failed to identify a swelling on the dog’s
forelimb.
During a walkthrough of the indoor kennel, APHIS inspectors discovered a mass on the right forelimb of a 9 year old
male beagle, ID #1680C, on April 11, 2017. The swelling was on the back of the right forelimb, above the carpal
pad. The skin, visible through the hair, was reddened, inflamed and contained at least two visibly erosive areas with
a small amount of blood-tinged discharge. The area of swelling/redness was approximately three centimeters in
diameter. Upon digital palpation by APHIS inspectors, a movable mass approximately the size of a grape was felt
under the skin. The swelling appeared to be painful to the touch and the beagle attempted to pull his leg away
during examination of the swelling.
The beagle underwent an unrelated surgical procedure on March 27, 2017 and although this animal has
been receiving daily follow up care for that condition, there is no documentation or record indicating the forelimb
swelling was noticed prior to the APHIS inspection. As a result, veterinary care for the forelimb had not been
provided.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. Failure to properly observe and communicate health problems can result in prolonged pain and suffering and
the increase risk of development of serious medical conditions. The facility must conduct appropriate daily
observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in a timely manner and
appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
After the inspection, the facility provided immediate veterinary care and performed diagnostics for the swelling on
the beagle’s forelimb.
3.75(c)(2)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the primary enclosure, 10B, housing one male Cynomolgus macaque there was a plastic barrel in disrepair.
The rim of the barrel was worn, frayed, and had a roughened edge.
***In the primary enclosure, West side 19A, of one female Cynomolgus macaque there was a plastic barrel in
disrepair. The hole on the side of the barrel had roughened, ragged edges.
Surfaces which cannot be readily cleaned nor sanitized can trap debris, bacteria, or other harmful organisms which
may pose a disease or health risk to the animals. The surfaces of housing facilities-including perches, shelves,
swings, boxes, houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures or objects within the facility-must be constructed in a
manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned, sanitized, and maintained on a regular basis
or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.
The facility removed the barrels from the enclosures at the time of inspection.
Inspection was conducted on April 11-13, 2017 with facility representatives.
This exit briefing was conducted with facility representatives on April 13, 2017.
