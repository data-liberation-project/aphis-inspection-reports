2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
One attendant could be readily identified in the animal areas of the facility. While other employees were present,
they could not be readily identified. In the primate area, the one attendant was unable to adequately monitor at
least 35 patrons observing, interacting with and/or feeding the 40 primates housed in 9 enclosures. No attendants
could be identified when patrons were observed interacting with and/or feeding the zebu, zebra, fallow deer, goats,
rabbits, foxes, alpaca, and llamas. Insufficient monitoring of interactions with animals can result in injury to people
and/or animals. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all
times during periods of public contact.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
Food being held in a refrigerator was moldy and unwholesome (peaches, mixed fruits and vegetables, open canned
canine/fox food). The refrigerator had standing water in the bottom and the interior was coated with a layer of
brown debris. Unwholesome food can cause significant illness in animals. Upon recheck of the refrigerator later in
the day, it had been completely emptied and was being cleaned at that time. Correct by 7-8-17.
Pizza and french fries were present as part of the diet provided for a prehensile-tailed porcupine. Prehensile-tailed
porcupines are herbivores and these foods are not consistent with the species' normal dietary requirements and can
cause illness. Per this section, the diet shall be prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size,
and type of animal. Correct by 7-8-17.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The building where dry, canned and refrigerated foods were stored was unkempt and disorganized. Hay, bedding
materials and dry food were scattered on the floor. Dust and debris were noted on the food bins, containers, and
storage cabinets throughout the area. Disorganization and uncleanliness in food and bedding storage areas can
impede the facilitation of the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart and can attract pests. Correct
by July 14, 2017.Perimeter fence variance remains under review.
This inspection (7/6 - 7/7/17) and exit interview (7/7/17) were conducted with the facility representative.
