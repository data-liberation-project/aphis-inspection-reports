2.33(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
The facility is not performing daily observations for the breeding colony of white-footed mice on weekends and holidays. In
the daily observation logbook, the animal care technician did not document any observations on July 3rd-July 5th or July
10th-July 11th. The colony manager stated that daily observations of the animals do not occur on weekends unless a
study is being performed; there are no studies being performed at this time.
Daily observations allow the facility to assess the health of the animals, including any injuries and/or compatibility issues.
Daily observations also allow any observed concerns to be communicated to the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner. The facility must observe all animals daily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent communication
with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of health, behavior, and well-being are
conveyed and so that the medical conditions of the animals can be evaluated by the veterinarian.

Separation.
In the room housing the white-footed mouse breeding colony, multiple tanks contain mice with injuries to their tails. In
Tank 1, one mouse has abrasions along its tail and dried blood at the end. In Tank 2, three mice are missing


approximately half of their tails, one of which appears swollen. The ends of those tails are reddened and scabbed. In Tank
8, one mouse is missing approximately half to three quarters of its tail. In Tank 14, one mouse has abrasions along its tail
and the tail is bent in two places. Another mouse in Tank 14 is missing half of its tail. The colony manager stated that
there is a history of compatibility issues, especially between males. There are injuries on both male and female mice at
the time of inspection. The facility has separated these animals in the past; however, this has not been done recently.
Housing incompatible animals together can lead to injury or even death. The facility must ensure that animals housed
together are compatible.
