HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
1. The barrier fence in front of the leopard enclosure is in need of attention. There is an area of fence that is in front
of the leopards holding area. This fence is approximately 3.5 ft away from the primary fence. However, a tall person
can lean over this barrier and put their fingers into the leopards primary enclosure. To ensure the safety of the
animal and the public this barrier will need to be moved back.

2. There is a wooden, stockade fence gate to the left of the leopard enclosure. This gate is used by the staff to gain
entrance to the back of the leopard enclosure. However, the left gate fell of its hinges as we entered the area. To
ensure the integrity of the fence line and to ensure that the public does not gain entrance into the back section of
the leopard or adjacent primate enclosure, this gate will need to be repaired.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure that housed one pig was in need of attention. The bamboo / reed fencing on the right side of the
enclosure was detaching from the chain link fence. To ensure that the pig does not get injured on this fencing, it will
need to be tacked back onto the chain link fence.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
This facility presently has 2 adult camels. One is a Dromedary and one is a Bactrian. They currently have an 8' X
12' shed. There is also a large number of deciduous trees within their enclosure / pasture. However, this shed /
shelter will not be large enough for these camels during the winter months. Due to their size and temperament an
additional shed will need to be provided before the winter weather approaches.

behind the leopard enclosure. However, to ensure that no unwanted animals or public gain access into the zoo, via
this vegetation, it will need to be addressed. The entire perimeter fence should be evaluated for any other areasthat also need to be trimmed back.

The barn that houses the goats and pigs had a few bird nests present. The nests were in the eves and light

EMPLOYEES.
During this inspection it was noted that several routine maintenance issues were not being addressed. In speaking
with the staff I was informed that there are only 3 full time employees (keepers) doing all of the animal care work.
When asking the staff about the numbers of employees on the premise at one time it was explained to me that 2
days a week there is only 1 zoo keeper on the premise. Five days a week there is only 2 zoo keepers on the
premise. They are also involved with the camps and volunteers that are at the zoo. This facility has approximately
100 mammals, 35 - 40 reptiles, and 15 - 20 birds. In light of the lack of keepers, and the number of non-compliant
items noted during this inspection, it is apparent that more employees are needed. This issue will need to be
addressed.
