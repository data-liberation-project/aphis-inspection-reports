ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During today's inspection the Licensee had an ultrasonic scalier located in his kennel office. When asked about the
scalier, the Licensee stated that he had used it one time on a dog. He was not able to identify the dog that he had
used the scalier on at the time of inspection. However; he did state that the dog was awake and not under any
anesthetics or tranquilizers while using the scalier. He also stated that he did not plan to use the scalier again
because the dental tool vibrates and the dogs didn't like it. He informed the inspector that he had gotten the scalier
from someone other than a Veterinarian and that his Attending Veterinarian was not aware that he had obtained or
used the scalier. The use of an ultrasonic scalier requires training and if it is used improperly it can case damage to
the dogs teeth, gums and mouth. In addition, it can be very painful for the dog. Using an ultrasonic scalier without
obtaining proper instructions and guidance by a licensed veterinarian is not an appropriate method to treat dental
issues. The Licensee must discontinue the use of the ultrasonic scalier and obtain appropriate guidance and
instructions, in writing, on the appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat all dental issues by the
Attending Veterinarian.
