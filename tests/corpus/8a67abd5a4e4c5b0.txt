2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is not maintaining complete records of animals on hand, acquisition and disposition information. The current
record of animals on hand is out of date and hasn’t been updated to reflect changes in the animal inventory, retiring of
some animals, or acquisition of new animals. Not having proper record keeping for the facilities does not allow for proper
trace back of animals during a disease outbreak and does not allow for accountability or identification of the animals
during inspection. Correct by 30 June 2022 by making, keeping, and maintaining records that fully and correctly disclose
all information concerning all animals currently in possession, all offspring born on the farm, and any animals which have
been transported, sold, euthanized or disposed of.
3.27(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
Two facility guinea pigs are currently housed in enclosures outside. Their enclosures are situated under the eve of a barn
roof and enclosed by wooden panels on three sides. There is no prior approval for housing the guinea pigs outside from
the Deputy Administrator. Housing guinea pigs outside can lead to extreme temperatures and unnecessary stress.
Correct by 3 June 2022 by ensuring all guinea pigs are housed in indoor facilities.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.


Several structures throughout the facility are in need of repair.
- The original pen has a large run-in shelter on the back side of a barn. The siding on the barn has one area where the
plastic siding has fractured and created a hole about 4” x 6” with sharp edges.
- The front pen has a hole about 4” x 4” in one of the back boards of the wooden run-in shelter. The front run-in shelter
has some fractured wooden floor boards and a hole in the back left corner where previous broken boards have been
trimmed back, leaving an open section about 8” x 16”.
- The JM pen has hog wire along the wooden fence line with several areas of sharp metal points. One hog panel, used to
divide this pen from the Llama pen, has all of the cross bars of metal protruding from the last vertical cross-beam, causing
multiple sharp edges. Some of these metal rods are slightly bent. One wire panel along the back fence is coming
detached in the upper right corner and leaning away from the wood, into the pasture.
- The goat pen has a two-sided run-in shed with wood side boards. Both wood boards are beginning to rot on the sides
and bottom edges, leading to holes and roughened wood edges.
Broken boards, sharp points, and gaps in flooring can injury animals and lead to unnecessary pain and distress. Correct
by 8 June 2022 by ensuring all structures are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
3.127(c) Direct

Facilities, outdoor.
Two outdoor pen enclosures have drainage issues, leading to large areas of standing water and mud.
- The original pen has a large pool of standing water in the corner of the pen by the shelter. The pool covers
approximately 1/5 of the pen. There are also large areas of mud throughout the pen that cover an additional 1/3 of the
pen. The animals are required to walk through mud to access their water and food.
- The JM pen has large areas of mud comprising ¾ of the pen. The only elevated areas to stand and rest is where hay
has been spread out near the front fence of the enclosure. The animals are required to walk through the mud to reach


food and water.
Poor drainage with areas of mud and standing water forces animals to stand or lie in wet conditions which can lead to
illness or disease. Livestock are particularly susceptible to foot problems when forced to stay in wet conditions for
extended periods of time.
Correct by 6 June 2022 by ensuring all outdoor enclosures have adequate drainage that can rapidly eliminate excess
water.

Watering.
Three watering troughs on the property have algae built up along the inner side walls. The water troughs in the front pen
and the goat pen have a ring of algae running around the inner side wall. The trough in the JM pen has some algal growth
along the inner side wall and on the bottom surface.
Algal growth in watering troughs can lead to non-potable water or toxin build-up which can adversely affect the animals.
Correct by 1 June 2022 by ensuring all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary.
