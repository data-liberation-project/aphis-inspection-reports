1) At the time of inspection some of the outdoor pens were constructed with a wood frame and sheet metal panels
for the walls. There were three shelters (CMKH, CMKC, and HCTM) that had areas of the sheet metal wall where
the edges of the sheet metal had become bent outward so that the edges were no longer flush with the wall. Theupturned edges of sheet metal were sharp and could cause an injury to the nose or face of the animals.
2)The coral fence by the automatic water dispenser for heifer unit 2 had nails which were bent down but still had
exposed sharp point which could injure an animal
Per this section of the regulations, outdoor facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury.
