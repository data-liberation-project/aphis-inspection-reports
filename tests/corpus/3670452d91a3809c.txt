3.131(a)
SANITATION.
An outdoor, primary enclosure containing goats had an excessive buildup of excreta on the ground of this
enclosure. Excreta should be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained
and to reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of this enclosure should be more frequent
and effective to prevent the buildup of excreta.
