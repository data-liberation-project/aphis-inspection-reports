2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** * The current written program of veterinary care (PVC) is not up to date. The PVC was last signed by Attending
Veterinarian (AV) in 2013. The most recent documented AV visit was in June of 2014. Failure for adequate written
guidance from the attending veterinarian does not ensure that the facility can adequately provide veterinary care to
the animals in the kennel. The licensee must ensure the PVC is up to date and the attending veterinarian visits the
facility on a regular basis (a minimum of once per year according to the PVC) to ensure compliance with this
Section of the regulation. Correct this by contacting your attending veterinarian to update a complete Program of
Veterinary Care.

***DIRECT: The following dogs were identified during this inspection in need of veterinary care:
1. Female Maltese #41 has excessive tartar build-up on the upper teeth on both sides. The gum line is also red
from the canine teeth to the molars on both sides. There is gum recession on the 4th pre-molar on the right side.
2. Female Maltese #18 has an excessive build-up of tartar on the remaining teeth it has. The upper pre-molars and
molars on both sides are completely covered with tartar. This dog also requires grooming as the face and body areheavily matted. This dog was also drooling from the mouth.
3. Maltese #26 has tartar build-up on both upper arcades of teeth and a retained baby canine on the right. The
gums are also mildly inflamed. This dog was also heavily matted over 90% of its body and requires grooming.
4. Female Havenese #33 has a heavy tartar build-up on both upper arcades of teeth, being worse on the right side.
The pre-molars and molars on both sides are completely covered with tartar and there is gum recession on the
right upper canine tooth and pre-molars.
5. Female Shih-Tzu #6 has signs of significant dental disease. There was excessive tartar build-up on the upper
arcades of teeth on both sides. This dog was very uncooperative and would not allow a thorough examination of its
mouth.
6. Female Havanese #31 was found with an egg sized firm mass associated with the 3rd mammary gland on the
left side. This dog requires examination by the attending veterinarian.
7. Male Yorkie #5 has excessive tartar on all of its teeth. The 4th upper pre-molar on both sides are completely
covered with tartar, the gum line is inflamed on both sides, and there is greyish fluid on the gum line.
8. Maltese #37 is excessively matted and requires grooming. This dog is matted over 80% of its body. This dog(cid:25)s
nails are also excessively long and require trimming. Lastly, there is a dime sized area of reddened moist skin
(resembling a (cid:28)hotspot(cid:29)) near the dog's right ear. This dog requires grooming and examination by the attending
veterinarian.
All of these dogs require examination by a licensed veterinarian. Failure of the licensee to identify medical
problems in the dogs and communicate these to the attending veterinarian can result in prolonged suffering in the
animals. The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian to have these dogs examined no later than 5 PM on
July 22, 2015. The licensee must also follow all recommendations for treatment by the attending veterinarian.
Documentation of the examinations and treatments must be maintained for future review by APHIS officials.
*** The following dogs were found in need of grooming during this inspection:
1. Black and white Female Havanese #43 is excessively matted and requires grooming. This dog has mats over at
least 80% of it body. This dog(cid:25)s nails are also excessively long and require trimming.
2. Male Shih-tzu found in the 2nd to last kennel on the left with no ID is heavily matted and requires grooming. This
dog has mats at least egg sized over half of its body.
3. Female Havanese #44 is excessively matted and requires grooming. This dog is matted over 50% of its body
and has egg sized mats on its hind legs.
Excessive matting can lead to skin problems and inability for the dogs to regulate their body temperature. Long
nails can be a hazard to the dogs should they get caught in the coated metal wire used in the construction of the
enclosures and can impair their ability to walk normally. The licensee must correct this by grooming these dogs and
trimming their nails. Regular grooming of all dogs must be incorporated.

*** 8 dogs were identified during this inspection in need of veterinary care. Another 3 dogs were found to be
excessively matted and requiring grooming. The licensee is not adequately observing the dogs in his facility on a
daily basis as required. Failure to observe, identify, and communicate medical problems in the dogs can result
unnecessary suffering in the animals. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are observed daily and that all
medical problems are conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. Additionally, excessively matted
dogs must be identified and groomed on a regular schedule.

2.50(a)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
*** Identification of animals was incomplete. At least 3 dogs over 16 weeks of age had no official identification. In
addition, one litter of 4 puppies had no official identification. Failure to properly identify animals impedes the
inspection process and makes animal tracking difficult to impossible. Correct this by ensuring proper identification
to all adult dogs and pups in the facility.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***A screen in a window over the left side primary enclosures is torn, which allows pests and predators access to
dog area. Pests are known to carry diseases that may affect the animals and predators can cause harm to the
animals. This area is also not in good repair. Correct this by replacing or repairing this screen.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The tack room area immediately preceding entry into kennel has a significant amount of bird droppings covering
the floor, necessitating walking through these feces to enter the kennel and potential tracking of fecal material into
kennel area. Bird feces can carry bacteria and diseases that can adversely affect the health of adult and especially
young dogs. Correct this by thoroughly cleaning and tack room and maintaining it in a sanitary condition. Correct by: 24 July 2015
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The walls and doggy doors of most primary enclosures are covered in brown film and dirt buildup. There is also
grime, dirt, and smears on many of the primary enclosure walls. Improper cleaning and sanitation can yield
disease reservoirs that can negatively affect the health of the dogs. Correct this by thoroughly cleaning and all
areas of primary enclosures to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
Correct by: 24 July 2015
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Dog food bags were found stored on the floor of the tack room area. Food stored on the floor is not protected
from spoilage, contamination, or vermin infestation. Correct this by storing food off the floor and away from the
walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the food.
Correct by: 24 July 2015
3.6(a)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***At least two areas of wallboard were excessively damaged and had exposed underlayment. This prevents
proper cleaning and sanitation in accordance with 3.11(b) and allows for unsanitary conditions to exist. Correct this
by repairing or replacing these areas if damaged walls.
Correct by: 15 August 2015
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The indoor washdowns are stained and coated with layer of brown film. Also, the main PVC drain exiting the
building was at least partially clogged with feces and grey material. Several pieces of dried feces with white materialon them were noted in one primary enclosure, indicating that daily removal of all feces as required is incomplete.
Improper cleaning and sanitation can yield disease reservoirs that can negatively affect the health of the dogs.
Correct this by thoroughly clean washdowns, primary enclosures and clear the main drain including continued
proper maintenance of washdowns and drain. Licensee must also ensure feces are removed from primary
enclosures on a daily basis.
Correct from this day forward for removal if feces and 24 July 2015 for cleaning of enclosures
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Rodent feces were found in multiple areas in the dog housing area. An empty bag of rodent poison was found in
a feeder in a kennel that was not in use. An abundance of flies were noted inside and outside the kennel area. An
effective pest control program is not in place. Excessive amounts of tall weeds surrounded the outdoor run area.
Pests and their feces can serve as a source for infection for the animals in the kennel. Correct this by
implementing a pest control program that effectively controls rodents and flies in the facility.
