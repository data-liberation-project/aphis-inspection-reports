FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength.
There is one enclosure where the openings in the fence for the goats to access the feed bunk are large enough that
the smaller male is able to squeeze through the openings. The goat was outside of its enclosure and loose in the
barn's alleyway during the inspection and was seen re-entering its enclosure through the same openings. The
openings are allowing the goat to escape its enclosure, which could result in injury to the animal. These openings
must be addressed to properly contain the animals. Correct by 12 November 2014.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the owners.
