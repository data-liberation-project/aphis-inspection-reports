3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility has constructed a portion of perimeter fence that covers approximately half of the facility. Several species
continue to be maintained in outdoor enclosures at the facility, this includes: Bobcat, Arctic fox, Red fox, Grey fox, Striped
skunk, Fallow deer, Sika deer, Mink, Ferret, Alpaca, and Wallaby. Failure to provide an appropriate perimeter fence may
result in animal escape or injury and does not protect the animals from unauthorized people or animals entering the
facility. Correct by ensuring that a perimeter fence of sufficient height and that fully encloses the outdoor housing facilities
is constructed. Additionally, the fence must restrict animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with animals in the facility, so that it can perform as a secondary containment system.
