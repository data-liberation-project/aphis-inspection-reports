2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was a female Shih Tzu (46495B6650) that was holding the right front leg up and only occasionally seen
bearing weight on the leg. On closer observation, there was an approximately 1/4 inch diameter raised, nodule-like
lesion noted between two of the toes on the right front paw. The nodule was mostly covered by hair and the hair
was an abnormal-looking brownish red color in this area of the paw. The lesion between the toes could be the
result of an injury, infection, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may cause discomfort. The licensee
must consult with a licensed veterinarain regarding this animal's condition by April 4, 2014 in order to obtain an
accurate diagnosis and to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
*Note: The female Shih Tzu (087*379*530), the female Shih Tzu (#4632364346) and the approximately 6 month old
white male Shih Tzu (#JD13096) which had been previously included on the report for the inspection conducted on
January 7, 2014 under 2.40 (b)(2) had been addressed by a veterinarian.
3.10 DIRECT
WATERING.
***In the outdoor portion of the facility, there were a total of eleven dogs housed within four enclosures which each
contained water receptacles that had no water in them. According to the facility representative, water had last been
given to the dogs yesterday evening. When the facility representative was asked to offer the dogs fresh water
during the inspection at approximately 12pm, most of the dogs were observed immediately going up to the water
receptacles when they were filled and starting to drink the water. Some of the dogs were seen drinking water for at
least one minute continuously. Lack of appropriate amounts of water can increase the risk of dehydration and other
medical issues for the animals. The licensee must ensure all animals have access to water as often as necessary to
ensure their health and well-being, but not less than twice daily for at least 1 hour each time, unless restricted by the
attending veterinarian. The licensee corrected this non-compliance during the inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.Additional Inspectors
