Several guinea pigs were observed during inspection with a variety of medical conditions. This included:
1. In Pen #7, an adult female with mostly black hair with some tan was noted to have 2 firm movable masses under
its chin. The masses were approximately 1 inch in diameter each. This animal also had a slightly bulging right eye
and the animal appeared to be blinking more frequently over that eye. No ocular discharge was noted. The bulging
eye had not been noted by the licensee.
2. In Pen #7, an adult black and white guinea pig was noted to have a large, fluid filled mass under its chin
approximately 3 inches in diameter.
3. In Pen #7, an adult grey and white guinea pig was noted to have a firm 2 inch diameter mass under its chin.
4. In Pen #7, an adult guinea pig, mostly white with some tan coloring and black ears, was noted to have a 1 inch
diameter mass under its chin.
5. In Pen #8, an adult tricolor guinea pig, mostly black with some tan and white, was noted to have a firm 2 inch
diameter mass under its chin.
6. In Pen #8, an adult roan and white guinea was noted to have a 2 inch diameter mass under its chin.
7. In Pen #11, an adult white guinea pig was noted to have diffuse hair loss over 90% of its body. A small circular
area, approximately 3/4" diameter, of reddened skin can be seen on the top of its shoulders.This animal also had a
mildly swollen left front foot with some reddening of the skin. The guinea pig was ambulating normally, but was
noted to hold the limb up when resting. The hair loss had been treated by the licensee according to the facility's
program of veterinary care, but the swollen foot had not been noted by the licensee.
8. In Pen #27, an adult guinea pig, with tan, white, and black coloring, had 2 firm masses under its chin. One was
approximately 1.5" in diameter, and the other was approximately 1" in diameter. A 1" diameter area of hair loss ispresent on its right flank.
9. In Pen #27, a brown and white adult guinea pig is noted to have approximately 2" diameter areas of hair loss
bilaterally on the top of its lower back. The skin in this area on the left side of the animal is pink and there are
regional areas of dried blood and dark crust. The skin in this area on the right side is mostly smooth with some
resolving dark crusted material.
10. In Pen #27, an adult brown, tan, and white guinea pig had a 1 inch diameter firm, freely movable mass under its
chin.
11. In Pen #28, an adult white and grey guinea pig had a 2 inch diameter firm mass under its chin.
The licensee had identified guinea pigs with masses in the last few days, but had not contacted the veterinarian or
started treatment as outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care. When animals are identified as needing care, the
facility must either initiate treatment as outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending
veterinarian. Guinea pigs described in the report as numbers 1, 7, and 9 with additional problems of animal health
had not been identified by the licensee or communicated to the attending veterinarian. Licensees must conduct daily
observations to assess health and well-being.
The licensee must initiate treatment as outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending
veterinarian regarding the masses. The attending veterinarian must be consulted about animals 1, 7, and 9 so that
adequate veterinary care can be provided. Correct by June 5, 2019.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Three guinea pigs were out of their enclosures and loose on the floor of the facility at the time of inspection. The
licensee recovered the animals during inspection. The current front walls leave an opening large enough for the
guinea pigs to escape.
The licensee must ensure that the facilities are constructed in a manner to contain the animals and prevent injury.
Correct by July 3, 2019.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Several primary enclosures containing guinea pigs had wet bedding and floors by the automatic water valves.
Several of the drainpipes were full of an accumulation of wet bedding and debris. Licensee must ensure thatenclosures, including the drainpipes, are cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of wet bedding and
debris. Correct by June 4, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
