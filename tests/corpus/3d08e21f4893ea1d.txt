2.131(c)(1) Critical Repeat

Handling of animals.
The facility is allowing public interaction with two coatimundis and two raccoons without ensuring minimal risk of harm to
the animals and to the public. On January 26, 2020 bite injury was reported to the county health department. A coatimundi
bit a member of the public causing a minor injury to one finger. In a room that houses two raccoons and two coatimundis
the general public can enter the room and interact freely with the animals. An attendant is present but does not have
control of the animals and they are free to roam about, jump and climb on people. The injury occurred during an exhibition
when a coatimundi bit a member of the public. All animals during public exhibition must be handled so there is minimal
risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with enough distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general
viewing public to assure the safety of the animals and the public. The current method of handling these animals is not
sufficient to prevent possible injury to the public. A more appropriate handling method that would minimize the risk of
injury during public interactions must be established.

The facility is allowing public interaction with lemurs without ensuring that the animals are under direct control of the
handler at all times. The animals were seen climbing and jumping onto the shoulders and around the head of the guests
with no means to provide direct control. Allowing public contact without maintaining direct control of non-human primates


can result in injuries to the animal and/or members of the public. Nonhuman primates used in uncaged public exhibits
must be under the direct control and supervision of an experienced handler or trainer at all times when the public is
present. Trained nonhuman primates may be allowed physical contact with the public, but only if they are under the direct
control and supervision of an experienced handler or trainer at all times during contact. To be corrected from this day
forward. This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
