Facilities, indoor.
A strong ammonia odor was observed within the giraffe barn and kangaroo house. Inadequate ventilation in winter
housing buildings can contribute to respiratory and other health issues. Indoor housing facilities shall be adequately
ventilated for the health and to prevent discomfort of the animals at all times. Fresh air shall be provided by means by

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
A significant amount of rodent droppings where observed in the lemur house, lodging 5 ring tailed lemurs. Droppings were
present on the floor, window sill, catch cage, and enrichment table. There were two traps present in the lemur house. One
trap contained a mouse. Rodents can carry parasites and various diseases that could compromise the health and well-
being of non-human primates. Additionally, droppings can contaminate the animal’s food. All licensees are responsible for
establishing and maintaining an effective program for controlling pests so as to promote the health and well-being of the


animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.

Housing facilities, general.
On November 11th, 2020, an olive baboon bit its keeper. The baboon grabbed the employee’s hand while the handler
was locking the transfer door. The enclosure door had gaps that were approximately 3 inches wide. These gaps were
large enough for the baboon to reach his arm through and grasp the employee’s hand. Improperly designed facilities can
lead to unnecessary animal and human injury. Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and
constructed so that they are structurally sound, kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury, contain the animals
securely, and restrict other animals from entering. The facility has since taken measures to address the issue and
corrected their facility design.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The neck of a female tayra was observed to have hair loss and reddened and thickened skin. The facility was applying
anti-fungal medication. After a discussion with the attending veterinarian, it was determined that the facility had not
communicated the issue and did not have the veterinarian’s approval to apply the anti-fungal medicine. Failure to contact
and follow the veterinarian’s recommendations can delay animal healing and exacerbate any identified issues leading to
unnecessary animal discomfort. Facilities are responsible for using appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose,
and treat disease and injuries. By the end of the inspection, the facility had contacted the attending veterinarian regarding
the issue.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
