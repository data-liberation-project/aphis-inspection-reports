PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Three enclosures each housed 15 weaned guinea pigs and measured 16 inches by 48 inches providing 768 square
inches of floor space. Fifteen weaned guinea pigs weighing less than 350 grams require 60 square inches of space
each, for a total required floor space equal to or greater than 900 square inches.
Overcrowding and the lack of space impact the growth, health, and well-being of the animals. The licensee must
provide at least 60 square inches of floor space for each weaned guinea pig weighing less than 350 grams, and 101
square inches for guinea pigs weighing more than 350 grams and nursing females with their litters.
