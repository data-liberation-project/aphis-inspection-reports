3.53(c)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Rabbits were in enclosures that did not meet minimum space requirements. A sample of rabbits was selected for
weighing, focusing on those that visually appeared the largest. Licensee stated all enclosures were acquired before
1990.
-Two pigmented male rabbits were housed together, in an enclosure providing 420 sq inches. Each weighed
between 6 and 8 pounds, requiring 288 sq inches per rabbit, for a total of 576 sq inches. Rabbits were separated
during inspection.
-Two pigmented male rabbits individually housed on the rear wall were weighed at 9 lbs 10 oz each, in enclosures
providing 420 sq inches. The required space is 540 square inches.
Eighteen (out of over five hundred total) enclosures housed multiple rabbits, ranging from 7 to 10 rabbits per cage.
These enclosures provided 1260 sq inches of floorspace.
-Several of these enclosures were labeled as (cid:28)meat(cid:29). Labeling enclosures as (cid:28)meat(cid:29) does not exempt them from
meeting space requirements, if they are housed in the same area as rabbits destined for research.
-In two enclosures housing 7 rabbits, 5 were between 5 and 6 pounds, requiring 144 sq inches per rabbit, and two
were over 6 pounds, requiring 288 sq inches per rabbit, for a total requirement of 1296 sq inches.
-Several enclosures housed 8 rabbits, with at least one rabbit over 6 pounds in each. In enclosures providing 1260
sq inches, all rabbits must be below 6 pounds to meet space requirements.
-Several enclosures housed 9 or 10 rabbits. Enclosures do not provide adequate space for 9 or more rabbits, when
all rabbits are at least 5 pounds.
