HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The back metal wall in the enclosure housing one adult Great Dane inside the Port-a-stall barn has
deteriorated/rusted along the bottom leaving the metal with sharp edges and a gap along the back wall. The ceiling
above the enclosure for the one adult Great Dane has exposed insulation that is falling apart, is not in good repair
and could fall into the enclosure with the animal. The sharp metal edges and exposed insulation could potentially
cause an injury or health hazard to the animal. Maintain all housing facilities so that they are structurally sound, in
good repair and protect the animals from injuries.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the Port-a-stall barn next to the enclosure housing an adult Great Dane is excess equipment being stored
(i.e. door panels, trailer, plastic barrel box and other items). Equipment and other items inside the area where
animals are housed can be a harboring ground for rodents and other pests which could potentially spread diseases
to the animals. Ensure that animal areas inside the facility are kept neat and free of clutter.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the north east side near the road enclosure #26 housing 2 adult Cocker Spaniels the wood surface on the side
of the dog shelter is chewed and ripped leaving holes and exposed wood. These areas can no longer be properly
cleaned and sanitized. These areas where there are exposed wood surfaces can harbor bacteria and other disease
pathogens that can be harmful to the animals. Maintain all surfaces on a regular basis so that they can be properly
cleaned, sanitized or replaced when worn or soiled.To be corrected by: September 11, 2015

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
An excess amount of weeds is growing next to enclosure #11 housing 4 Adult Dachshunds. The weeds are
extending through the fence into this enclosure. Weeds can harbor pests and other vermin which could affect the

animals.
