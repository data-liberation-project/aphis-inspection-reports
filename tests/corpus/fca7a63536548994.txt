Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
During the facility inspection a galago was noted having difficulty recovering from surgery/study procedures conducted the
previous day. In reviewing the approved protocol M1700204-01 it was determined that the study staff made a significant
change regarding analgesic medications given before and after the surgical/study procedures without the IACUC first
reviewing and approving the change. The analgesic medication Buprenex (buprenorphine) was given pre-op, post-op and
the morning after the procedure at a dosage of 0.02 mg/kg. The dosage in the approved protocol was 0.005 to 0.01
mg/kg.
The IACUC, as an agent of the facility, shall review all components of activities related to the care and use of animals to
determine that the activities are in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations. The IACUC shall review and
approve proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities before the changes are
implemented.

Sanitation.


The enclosures housing tree shrews include a solid platform. In a couple of the enclosures a smear of brown material was
noted on the back wall of the enclosures extending from where the platform met the wall and for approximately 4 inches
above the platform. A buildup of brown excreta both fresh and dried was noted on the platforms. The tree shrews were
seen running along the platform then jumping against the wall thereby transferring the material from the platform to the
wall.
Excreta buildup in enclosures can lead to soiling of the animals, spread of disease and odors. The facility shall remove
excreta from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to
minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.

OAWA and other DAC and OAWA personnel.
