***In the outdoor facility there were several of the adult dogs that were seen scooting across the ground on their
back ends. The licensee stated that they were behind on deworming the adults as per the veterinarian's
instructions. The instructions on the program of veterinary care give specific instructions for preventative care for all
of the animals. Animals that do not receive care as instructed by the veterinarian, can contract illness, disease or
can worsen a health situation. The licensee must give the preventative medications as directed by the attending
veterinarian and assure that all of the animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.

***Throughout the outdoor facility, tall grass and weeds were either growing within the primary enclosures or
growing through the fence into the majority of the enclosures. Tall weeds and grass create a harboring place for
pests and parasites and increases the risks for contact between pests, parasites and the dogs. The licensee must
cut or clear the grass and weeds so that it kept in a manner to minimize pest transfer and assure that grass and
weed growth is controlled as required.
