Two dogs had medical problems that had not been recognized and treated by the licensee. An adult, female
English Bulldog (Stacy; m/c# 006AB6350) was limping on her left front leg. When standing still, she repeatedly held
the left paw off of the ground. An adult, female English Bulldog (JD; m/c# 4B1F5A4316) had a small, red, raised
lesion on her head next to her right eye. The dog(cid:25)s head was swollen from above the right eye to the nose. The
licensee stated that this dog had escaped from its enclosure the night before, but she had not noticed the lesion and
swelling. Untreated lameness and skin problems can worsen, can become infected, and can be painful. The
licensee must consult a veterinarian about these two dogs and follow the recommended treatment plan.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
3.6(a)(2)(ii) Protect the dogs and cats from injury
An adult, male English Bulldog was housed in an enclosure that had a large gap between the horse panel entry
gate and the t-post used to secure the side panel of the enclosure. The space was large enough that the dog could
fit his head and a portion of his body through it, leaving the potential for injury, entrapment or escape. The licensee
must ensure that the enclosures safely and securely contain the dogs to protect them from injury.

A plastic bag full of insecticide containing carbaryl was laying a few inches away from an outdoor enclosure
containing two weaned Pug puppies. The bag was torn and a pile of the insecticide was lying next to the chain-link
enclosure. The puppies could have reach through the chain-link and ingested the insecticide. This product was
not labeled for ingestion by dogs. The licensee stated that this was an old bag that she had discarded. Exposure to
toxic substances can result in sickness or death. The licensee must ensure that the premises are free of
accumulations of trash, junk, waste products, and discarded matter.
