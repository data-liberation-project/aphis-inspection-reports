ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The wolf, Montana, is expressing irritation from the flies biting his ears. The facility stated that this is a seasonal
issue in which the attending veterinarian had instructed them how to treat the condition when it occurs. This
treatment has been administered but the flies are still biting the wolves' ears and the condition still persists. The tips
of the ears appears to have a scab in some areas and in other areas it is open with the flies actively biting. The
wolves are displaying irritation by running their ears across the fencing. When a condition persists after the
instructed treament given by the attending veterinarian is administered and is then inadequate, the veterinarian
should then be consulted on further actions that need to be taken to ensure good health and well-being of the
animals. Correct by May 11, 2015

SANITATION.
