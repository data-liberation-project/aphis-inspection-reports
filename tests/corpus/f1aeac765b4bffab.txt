FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The chain link perimeter fence behind the Zebra enclosure has a few damaged top rails bent from falling tree
branches. This area has heavy brush leaning over the perimeter fence that will cause further damage if not
removed and it doesn't restrict unauthorized animals from entering the facility.
Perimeter fences must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that
it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
