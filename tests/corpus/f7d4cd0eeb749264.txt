ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**Direct**The collar on tan and white female Shih Tzu with USDA tag #152 is very tight. With an attempt to remove
the collar, it was found that several of the chain links were imbedded into the dog's neck such that they could not be
removed. Skin has grown over and through the links of the chain collar on the underside of her neck. Scabs and
dried blood are present.
**Direct**Black and white female Boston Terrier with USDA tag #153 has thick green discharge in and around both
eyes. Some of the discharge has dried and is adhered to the skin and hair around her eyes. Her eyes appear
hazy. Blood vessels are visible in both corneas. An opacity is visible in each eye, with the one in the left eye larger
than the one in the right.
Black and tan male Yorkie with USDA tag #158 has dark material adhered to his teeth. The gums have receded
back from the teeth and a grey green fluid has accumulated in some of these pockets. The gums appear swollen
and red, especially on the left side.
The collar on the black and white female Boston Terrier with USDA tag #168 is very tight. There is an
approximately nickel sized area of hair loss on the throat that is red and scabbed. The chain was removed at the
time of inspection.
Adequate veterinary care has not been provided. Appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries must be utilized. These dogs must be examined by a licensed veterinarian for diagnosis and
treatment. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and plan shall be kept for examination by
APHIS officials.

3.1(f)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Seven dead puppies are on the ground on the northern side of the sheltered housing facility. These animals are
spread in an area approximately 10 feet in diameter and approximately 20 feet from the kennel. At the time of
death, one animal appears to have been several weeks old and the others appear to have been newly born. These
animals appear to be well preserved. Dead animals can attract insects, pests, and vermin, as well as cause odors
and increase disease hazards. There must be regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of dead
animals to minimize contamination and disease risks.
