2.126(b)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30pm on January
27, 2021.

Called contact phone number which was disconnected. Knocked on door, the neighbor came out and told me the
apartment was vacant. I spoke to leasing company who said Mr. Smith did live there a few months ago, but since has
abandoned the apartment without leaving any forwarding information.

A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
