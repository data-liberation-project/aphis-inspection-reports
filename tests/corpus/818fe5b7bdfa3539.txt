ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30 a.m. on
08/18/2015.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 10:30 a.m. and knocked on the door. The licensee answered the door and
informed me that they were just leaving for appointments and would not be able to complete the inspection today.
