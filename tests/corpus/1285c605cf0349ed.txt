PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
The crate used to transport and house for the day the raccoon is damaged. The plastic piece between two of the
ventilation openings on the left side of the crate was torn loose from its attachment to the upper portion of the crate
and still attached at the lower portion. The piece of plastic with its sharp end was projecting into the enclosure. The
raccoon was noted sticking its front leg and "hand" through the enlarged opening created by the damage to attempt
to grab an item outside its crate. The raccoon may be injured by the sharp point while moving around in the crate or
sticking its arm out through the enlarged opening. All transport crates shall have interiors free of any protrusions that
could be injurious to the live animals contained therein. Correct by June 1, 2019.
