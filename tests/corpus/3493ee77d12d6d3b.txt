2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care (PVC) is not complete. A bottle of foot rot/ringworm spray was present in the
guinea pig room. There is no information on the concentration, dosage, instructions for use, and route of
administration for the foot rot/ringworm spray in the PVC. Standardized treatment protocols by the attending
veterinarian may be used by the facility to treat animals with common conditions such as ringworm, but the
medication and treatment must be listed in the written program of veterinary care. The PVC needs to be updated to
include all medications used by the facility such as the foot rot/ringworm spray so that the licensee has adequate
guidance to maintain the health and well-being of the guinea pigs. Correct by November 16, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner's son.
