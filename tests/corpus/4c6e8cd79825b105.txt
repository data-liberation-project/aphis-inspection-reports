2.31(c)(3) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
During the review of the semiannual reports to the Institutional Official, it was noted that the IACUC prepared reports of its
semiannual facilities inspection and program review in March 2022. The next report was currently being processed, after
having conducted the facilities inspection and program review on about 12/09/2022, an interval of approximately 9 months
between reports instead of at least once every 6 months.

Without timely IACUC communication and review as required by this regulation, animal welfare may be negatively
impacted.

A function of the IACUC is to prepare reports of the Committee’s semiannual evaluations of the program for animal use
and its inspection of the facilities. The semiannual reports to the Institutional Official shall be updated at least once every
six months upon completion of the required semiannual evaluations.

Correct from this date 12/13/22 for all future semiannual reports to the Institutional Official.

Watering
Approximately 15 dogs had water bowls that were either turned over or otherwise empty. The facility representative
conveyed that at the time the empty bowls were viewed, the dogs had already been out for part of their regular morning
outdoor time. While many of the emptied water bowls appeared to have been spilled just prior to viewing them, the facility
representative conveyed that there had been no animal caretakers who were checking on the dogs to ensure continuous
access while they were outside. There were no water restrictions approved by the Attending Veterinarian.

Lack of continuous water can worsen health problems in dogs.

Potable water must be continuously available to the dogs, unless restricted by the attending veterinarian.

Corrected at time of inspection on 12/13/2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Institutional Officer.
