Watering.
The water receptacles for the 2 black bears had a buildup of organic material black and green in color. The water present
was also black in color. The facility representative states they have not cleaned the enclosures and its contents since the
beginning of November.
All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary. The facility must clean the water receptacles often enough for the
bears to be provided potable water in a clean and sanitary receptacle.

Sanitation.
There is an excessive amount of excreta built up in the two enclosures, each housing one adult black bear. There is
minimal floor space that does not have feces present so the bears are frequently walking in the excreta. The facility
representative states that the enclosure has not been cleaned since the beginning of November.
Excreta shall be removed from the primary enclosure as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained and to minimize disease hazards. The facility must clean the enclosures often enough that the bears can move
freely without contact with excreta.
