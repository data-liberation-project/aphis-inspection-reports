Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:20 pm on October
27, 2021.

A person at the facility said that the facility representative was not there and she didn't know when she would return. I left
messages on her home and cell phones but she did not return my call.
