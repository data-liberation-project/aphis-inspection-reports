3.125
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures housing, respectively, a single adult lion and a single adult tiger are open topped cages, with fence
heights approximately 10 feet. There are short kick-ins on both fences. Cage fences of this height may not be
sufficient to adequately contain adult lions or tigers. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures housing adult big
cats are constructed and maintained to ensure the cats are safely contained.
