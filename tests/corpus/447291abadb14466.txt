2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A lemur became ill and started to convulse at approx 6:00 PM 4 days after being vaccinated by the attending
veterinarian. The licensee immediately called the veterinarian by telephone. The veterinarian was not available to
come to the facility but referred her to another veterinarian who was on call at the practice. That veterinarian
informed the licensee that she was not sure what she would do if she came out (she may have not had experience
with primates).
The licensee was in frequent contact by telephone with the veterinarians trying to get someone to come out to
examine the lemur. The lemur eventually stopped convulsing and the licensee then told the veterinarian during one
of the calls not to come because she thought the lemur was recovering. The lemur died the next morning.
The licensee's program of veterinary care indicates that the emergency care will be handled by the attending
veterinarian's hospital. In this case, the hospital's veterinarian was not able to either immediately come out to treat
this primate, or would not know what to do, as soon as symptoms developed which may have provided life saving
treatment.
A program of emergency care shall be developed and formalized to ensure that emergency care can be quickly
given to any species of animal that you have at any hour by a veterinarian who has knowledge of the species in
question. This may be accomplished (but not limited to) having your veterinarian's assurances that he will provide
emergency services by himself or another veterinarian in the practice, or recommending another hospital (or
emergency clinic) who can provide the required emergency services.
