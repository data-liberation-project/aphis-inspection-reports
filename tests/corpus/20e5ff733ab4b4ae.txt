2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
No written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) could be located during this inspection. The indicated Attending
Veterinarian (AV) was contacted by phone by the inspector. The AV confirmed his role as AV for this facility. He stated
that frequent and timely communications regarding any animal concerns routinely occur. His last documented visit to the
facility was July 2020 and his last appointment for animals from Kaleideum occurred October 2020. The lack of a written
PVC can lengthen the time taken for animals to receive adequate veterinary care. Each exhibitor shall employ an AV
under formal arrangements. In the case of a consulting veterinarian, the formal arrangements shall include a written PVC.
