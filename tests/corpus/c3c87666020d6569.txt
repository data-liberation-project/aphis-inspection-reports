2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two guinea pigs in building 1 had eye problems that the licensee was observing but are not under any treatment
and haven't been reported to the attending veterinarian:
-A black and white guinea pig had a pale discharge around its left eye and the eyeball could not be visualized.
-A brown/yellow/fawn colored guinea pig's right eyeball could not be visualized and the area around it was slightly
crusted. The licensee reported that it was observed to have this problem for a few days.
In building 2 the facility has an enclosure with twelve guinea pigs separated for sickness or what the licensee
described as mostly for gaunt animals for observation; however the animals' conditions haven't been reported to the
attending veterinarian to seek if animals need veterinary treatment. A gray guinea pig in the enclosure had a firm
swelling under its jaw and another guinea pig had a left head tilt. Gaunt guinea pigs, guinea pigs with swellings,
and guinea pigs with head tilts are in need of further veterinary evaluation. If left untreated and without the
attending veterinarian's oversight these guinea pigs' conditions could worsen and if contagious could lead to more
animals getting sick. The facility must contact the attending veterinarian to evaluate sick/gaunt animals and follow
the prescribed treatment plan.
3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A young guinea pig was seen running loose in building 2 during inspection. It was caught with out incident by the
licensee. The licensee reports this is only the third time this has happened this summer; but that they sometimes
squeeze through the area by the water sipper. Escaped animals could get injured or lose access to food and water
and their well-being cannot be assured. Ensure that the enclosures are fixed so that guinea pigs cannot escape
from them.
Correct by 10/2/17.
3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL. Since the last inspection, a male hedgehog was reported to have escaped from its enclosure and possibly the
building and is unaccounted for. An escaped animals' well-being cannot be assured. Ensure that the hedgehogs'
enclosures safely contain the animals.
Maintain correct from this date forward.
