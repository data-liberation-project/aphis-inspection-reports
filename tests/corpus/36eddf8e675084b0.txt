ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30 pm on
14-Feb-18.
Went to facility and spoke to Mrs. Lapp. She expected Mr. Lapp home anytime. Waited one half hour but he did
not return. Mrs. Lapp was unable to confirm optimal hours of inspection, but said she would have Mr. Lapp give me
a call.
