ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***I arrived at the facility at 9:20 am and the gates were closed. I called the owner and he did not answer. I left a
message that I was at the facility to conduct an inspection. I waited for the customer for 30 minutes and called
again. There was no answer so I left a message that this would be an attemted inspection and that he would receive
the inspection report in the mail. I left the premises at 10:00 am. A responsible adult was not available and one
should have been available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:20 am on 02/19/2014.
