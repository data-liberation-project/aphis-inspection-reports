ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-An approximately 3 year old female Golden Retriever, “Sassy” (#97), with a litter of six 4 week old puppies
appeared emaciated. She had an obvious visible waist and accentuated abdominal tuck. The tops of her lumbar
vertebrae were easily visible and the pelvic bones were prominent. There was no discernible fat palpable with a
gloved hand, bones were easily felt and the dog appeared to have a loss of muscle mass. The dog consistently
maintained a hunched posture and would often go out of view of the inspector by going in or out of the sheltered
building. According to a facility representative, he had noticed that the dog had gradually been losing weight since
she had whelped. He continued that the dog had been offered full access to dry puppy kibble since prior to whelping
and the dog had been de-wormed about a week prior to the inspection. Although the dog continued to lose weight,
the facility had not communicated the dog’s thin body condition to the attending veterinarian. The program of
veterinary care did not instruct the licensee on how to address this problem. Poor body condition in dogs can be due
to inadequate nutrition, parasites, or other underlying medical problems. The licensee must communicate with a
veterinarian in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan for this dog’s condition. The
licensee must ensure that the treatment plan is followed and that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all
times. To be corrected by: November 29, 2018

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
-There were at least 9 enclosures throughout the facility housing dogs that contained greater than a day's worth of
feces. Some of the enclosures were in the outdoor facility and others were in the outdoor portion of a sheltered
building. It appeared difficult for some of the dogs to maneuver around the fecal material in the outdoor portion of
the sheltered building, however, there were some small areas of flooring available to the dogs that did not have
fecal material and the dogs could avoid it. When asked when the enclosures were last cleaned, the facility
representative stated it had been 3-4 days ago. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease
hazards and of the dogs becoming soiled. The licensee must ensure that excreta is removed from the primary
enclosures daily as well as from under primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive
accumulation of feces and food waste. According to the facility representative, he would remove the excreta from
the enclosures by the end of the day of inspection. To be corrected by: November 29, 2018The inspection and initial exit interview were conducted on 11/28/18 with a facility representative. A final exit
interview was concluded on 11/29/18 with the same individual.
