SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The 8 cats are in wire cages inside a converted barn building which has a concrete floor and has mostly been
walled in with plastic boards except for windows on two walls in each room. The two pair housed female cats are in
one room and the six males are individually housed in the adjacent room. The temperatures in these rooms have
consistently been over 85 degrees for the last two months ranging from 88 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit. The
temperature at 11:00 today was 88 degrees in the room, with 56% humidity and a heat index of 95 degrees.
Outdoor temperatures for the last two months have consistently been in the 90s and 100s. The caretakers tried air
conditioners in both rooms but due to the lack of insulation of the building the rooms were hotter than the multiple
fans now in use. They have a sprinkler system which cools the roof at 14:00 each day. The caretakers report the
cats showed signs of being hot when the air conditioners were trying to cool and the ventilation was low. They
report the cats have not shown signs of being hot with the fans turned on them. The cats are not showing any signs
of heat stress during this inspection.
Although the caretakers at this point have done several things to bring the air temperature down in these cat rooms,
it is still exceeding 85 degrees for more than 4 hours during these long hot summer days. Ambient temperatures in
indoor and sheltered housing facilities are not to exceed 85 degrees for more than 4 hours when cats are present.
Additional measures need to be taken to keep the temperatures lower. Plans are to make this an outdoor shelter
and this will increase the ventilation further. To be corrected by 8-12-16.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the larger dog run area, there are several chain link divider walls with various size holes. Some of these were
patched with sturdier panel type wire, but the old wire was left leaving broken wires with potential sharp points.
These areas include the wire between runs 9-10, 14-15, 15-16, 18-19. All holes need to be repaired and all loose
protruding wire ends need to be removed. To be corrected by 8-19-16.Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
