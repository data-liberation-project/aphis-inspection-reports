2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a lionhead rabbit with small scabs and moderate skin redness extending ¼ of up the way up the rabbit(cid:25)s
ear. It was explained that the attending veterinarian had been consulted over the phone and had recommended
treatment with anti-parasitic medication. This treatment was applied by the owner as directed by the vet. However,
this animal has not been physically examined by the veterinarian and diagnostics have not been performed.
Conversation with the licensee revealed that a rabbit with more severe ear disease and a head tilt had died about a
month ago. Cause of death was not determined. The attending veterinarian had been consulted over the phone
several times regarding this rabbit(cid:25)s issue, and advice had been followed, but the rabbit had not been physically
examined or diagnosed by veterinary staff. Lack of appropriate diagnostics for a problem which may be recurrent
may contribute to the spread of illness among other animals within the population.
The goat Mariah remains visibly very thin with spinal bones and ribs visible. Conversation with the licensee revealed
that the attending veterinarian had been consulted over the phone on several occasions (5/6/14 and 6/9/14) and
had given recommendations regarding treatment and progress of this animal'(cid:25)s illness. Treatment recommendations
have been followed and the licensee reports that the animal has gained a little weight. This animal had not been
physically examined by veterinary staff during this time frame. Lack of appropriate diagnostics for a problem that is
chronic may contribute to use of a suboptimal treatment plan for the animal and continuing illness.
Though veterinary phone consultations can provide valuable information regarding maintenance of animal health,
they are not appropriate for the diagnosis, control, and treatment of serious conditions such as those which are
recurring, chronic, or result in the death of an animal within the population. Animals with serious, chronic, or
recurrent conditions must be physically examined and diagnosed by veterinary staff.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Licensee and the Authorized Person.
