ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An approximately 2 month old male calf has evidence of loose stools stuck in the hair around his tail and back legs.
The licensee stated that the calf has had diarrhea for about 3 to 4 days and that he has been treating the calf and
that it looks better than it has for the past several days. However, the attending veterinarian has not been consulted
regarding the health condition of the calf nor the treatment the licensee has been giving. Consult the attending
veterinarian regarding the calf's diarrhea and whether or not the current treatment is appropriate and effective.
