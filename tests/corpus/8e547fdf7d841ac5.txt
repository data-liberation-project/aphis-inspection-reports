FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The wire fence material provided as a dig barrier in front of the fox den has large squares (approximately 4 x 4
inches). The dirt beneath the barrier has eroded leaving a hole that is approximately 1 and 1/2 ft wide by 2 ft long
and a foot or more in depth directly in front of the den door which forces the foxes to have to jump over it to enter
the den. This may allow them to become injured if they land on it. This area shall be repaired to protect the foxes
from possible injury. Correct by June 24, 2019.
***The temporary wire placed around the lower portions of the primary enclosures for the deer to restrict the young
deer from exiting the enclosure or coyote from entering is separating from the main fence in some areas and
damaged leaving sharp points and unraveled wire that could allow the deer to become injured. The fence shall be
repaired to protect the deer from injury. Correct by June 24, 2019.
