Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
**Since the last inspection the facility acquired several new animals one of which was a tamandua which had not been
added to the Program of Veterinary Care. Animals housed at the facility should be added to the program of veterinary
care once acquired by the facility. The program of veterinary care should be updated and reviewed by the attending
veterinarian when new animals are acquired to ensure the health of the animals. It is the responsibility of the licensee to
ensure the written program of veterinary accurately reflects the animals housed at the facility and is reviewed by the
attending veterinarian on a regular to ensure adequate veterinary care is provided to the animals.
