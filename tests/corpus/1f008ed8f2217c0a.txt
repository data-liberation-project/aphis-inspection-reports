FEEDING.
On today's inspection about 75% of the self feeders have rust around the lip where the guinea pigs access their
food. Areas with rust can not be properly cleaned or sanitized. All food receptacles shall be kept clean and shall be
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. All feeders with rust must be repairs, resurfaced or replaced to allow proper
cleaning and sanitation.
