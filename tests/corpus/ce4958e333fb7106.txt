2.31(c)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In April of 2018, the escape of several rabbits from their enclosures was reported to the IACUC. Additional training
on rabbit caging was provided to personnel. Three days after the training was conducted, two more rabbits
escaped. No additional corrective action was taken at that time. From August to September 2018, six additional
rabbits escaped from their enclosures. These incidents were all reported to the IACUC by facility personnel. No
further action has been taken.
The enclosures at this facility are elevated off the floor on a rack system, and there is a substantial risk of injury to
the rabbits upon escape from these enclosures. These incidents are recurrent despite the additional training
provided by the facility in April. Further investigation of the underlying cause of the escapes is warranted to protect
the animals from potential injury. It is the function of the IACUC to review and investigate reported concerns
involving the care of animals.

2.32(a) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
On August 24, 2018, an animal was anesthetized for a study procedure. Two research associates were present to
administer and monitor anesthesia. One was a senior employee who was training a junior employee in anesthetic
procedures. The junior employee was responsible for pressure checking the anesthesia machine prior to the
procedure.
The animal was intubated and its vitals were recorded. Eight minutes later, the animal's heart rate was noted to
decline rapidly. The machine was checked and it was discovered that the pop-off valve had remained closed after
the initial pressure check, leading to breathing complications. The veterinarian was immediately notified and
resuscitation was attempted but was unsuccessful.The anesthetic complications and subsequent death of the animal were the result of failure of personnel to correctly
configure the anesthetic machine after the initial pressure check. It is the responsibility of the research facility to
ensure that personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties.
In response to this incident, the facility immediately conducted additional training on anesthetic machine use and
there have been no additional related incidents. Corrected prior to inspection.
This inspection was conducted from 10/15 - 10/16/18. An initial exit interview was conducted on site on 10/16/18. A
supplemental exit interview was conducted on site on 10/23/18.
