2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(a)(1) Veterinary care: The two written Programs of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility lack specific
guidance for the care of animals. There is no specific guidance for the parasite control of various species, only a list
of drugs. Species specific dosing and route is not included for any species or drug in either PVC. There is no
specific clinic or veterinarian specified for emergency care. For capture and restraint method there is listed only
chemical restraint with no species specific drugs, dosing or route. Additionally there is no guidance for anesthesia
monitoring, recovery or other pre or post procedural care where specific guidance is required. The method of
euthanasia lists injectable euthanasia solution but does not provide any species specific drugs, dose or route for the
licensee to use. Specific guidance from the attending veterinarian is required for all drugs used by the licensee.
Treatment records provided by the facility document that animals have been treated without written attending
veterinarian guidance such as goats treated for lameness.

Additional specific guidance is required for the Programs of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate
guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does
not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by
developing and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for all species housed at the facility.
Correct by October 31, 2015.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The following animal enclosures were found in need of repair.
1) The chain link fencing wrapped around the trunk of the tree nearest the public viewing area is unraveling at the
base of the tree in the enclosure housing six Sika deer. Wire strands are pulled away from the tree trunk and are
projecting out into the enclosure. The deer may be injured by the wire ends protruding into the enclosure. Once
APHIS officials identified the condition of the fencing around the trunk of the tree, the licensee had facility personnelrepair the fencing. Corrected during the inspection.
2) The front left corner of the floor of the barn shelter for the one black alpaca has the concrete eroded away from
the rebar creating a hole. The alpaca may be injured by the protruding piece of rebar and/or the jagged edge of the
concrete if it steps into the hole. The floor must be repaired to prevent injury to the animal.
3) The ground has eroded away from the front of the pool creating a significant gap/space between the ground and
the side of the pool in the enclosure housing one wolf. The wolf may be injured by the exposed rough concrete and
wire from the underside of the pool. The gap/space between the ground and the side of the pool must be filled to
prevent injury to the animal.
Facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
This inspection was conducted on September 29, 2015. An exit briefing was conducted on September 30, 2015
with the facility vice president; Mary Geib, VMO; and David Oelberg, VMO.
