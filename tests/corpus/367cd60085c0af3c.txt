OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
This facility is using sawdust for bedding for the adult dogs. Today, there is a small amount of sawdust bedding in
each of the plastic barrels used as shelters. This amount does not allow the dogs to bed down and potentially
nestle in the bedding to maintain body heat in the cold temperatures. The outside temperature by kestral was 19
degrees F during this inspection. Temperatures are predicted to drop below 15 degrees F tonight and remain cold
for the next several days. YAHOO weather shows highs in the mid 30's and lows in the mid-teens for the next 2
days. These dogs will continue to be at risk for cold stress as the weather remains cold. Not providing sufficient
bedding exposes the dogs to these cold temperatures and can lead to discomfort and possibly predispose animals
to the development of disease. The licensee must ensure that each shelter structure is provided with an adequate
amount of clean, dry bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees.

3.4(b) DIRECT REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
12 adult dogs housed in the lower outdoor kennel and 2 adult dogs housed in an outdoor enclosure near the upper
kennel do not have shelters large enough to allow these Rottweiler or Boxer dogs to sit, stand, and lie in a normal
manner or to turn about freely while in these shelters. Although there are enough barrels for each dog, these
barrels do not provide enough space for the dogs while in them. All shelters in outdoor facilities must contain a roof,
four sides, and a floor. In addition, the shelter must be large enough to allow each dog to sit, stand, and lie in a
normal manner and to turn about freely. This is required to ensure the dogs have adequate space and can rest
comfortably in these shelters.
