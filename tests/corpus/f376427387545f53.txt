2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records requirements.
The facility has made slight progress on their record-keeping system; however, some records are still not being
maintained and others do not contain all the required information. This includes the following:
*There are no acquisition records that correspond to the disposition records for 3 rabbits on 3/26/16, 6 rabbits on
3/31/16, 5 rabbits on 5/5/16, 11 rabbits and 4 Syrian hamsters on 5/26/16 and 7 rabbits on 6/2/16. It cannot be
determined to whom these animals were acquired from and on what date.
*There are several animals listed on the acquisition record that were not present on the inspection that do not have
disposition records. It cannot be determined when these animals left and to where. This includes 7 Russian winter
white dwarf hamsters, 3 Chinese hamsters and 2 roborovski hamsters.
*The acquisition records reviewed on the inspection were incomplete and did not contain all required information
including complete address and USDA license number of the person the animals were acquired from.
*Complete disposition information were not recorded for 4 roborovski hamsters, 6 soft-furred rats, 6 Russian winter
white dwarf hamsters and 8 Syrian hamsters. These lacked either a complete address of the buyer and/or date of
disposition.
Incomplete records do not allow for tracking of the animals, ensuring that they came from licensed, or exempt from
licensing sources, and does not allow for monitoring of mortality. The licensee must develop and maintain complete
and up-to-date records that contain all required information.
The male chinchilla documented under 2.40(b)(2) on the previous inspection report dated March 22, 2016 has been
addressed and received adequate veterinary care.
