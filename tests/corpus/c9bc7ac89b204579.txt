2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**A bottle of Epi-Otic ear cleaner is labeled for use in dogs and cats. Its use in rabbits is off-label; it must only be
used on rabbits with a prescription or written instructions from the Attending Veterinarian.
**Previously cited: A rabbit, Joker, was discovered to have a head tilt on 8/15/2016. He wasn't seen by the
Attending Veterinarian (AV) until 9/2/2016. Otitis media was diagnosed and medications were prescribed.
Addendum: Joker died 11/21/2016. Cause of death was determined to be a brain abscess. Delay in treatment of
otitis could have been responsible for the infection extending into the brain.
The licensee must ensure that appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries
are provided in a timely manner, and must provide documentation of these veterinary evaluations and treatments (if
prescribed) to the inspectors upon request. Delay of treatment can cause unnecessary suffering. Only medications
labeled for or prescribed for the rabbits are to be used in the rabbits.
This is a repeat non-compliant item previously cited on 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015, 4/12/2016 and 9/6/2016.
3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**Many of the cages are still hanging at a slant, and the floors are un-reinforced wire. The floors bounce quite a bit
when the animals move around, especially the larger animals. The floor of a cage holding two larger black and white
rabbits is bent into a severely sagging shape. Excess movement and slant of the floors can be hard on the animals'
legs, and the movement can fatigue the metal, causing it to break.
This is a repeat non-compliant item previously cited on reports dated 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015, 4/12//2016,
and 9/6/2016.
3.53(c)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES. **One cage contains 6 rabbits, which appear to be a doe and her litter. The juvenile rabbits are well past weaning
age. The cage measures 30"(cid:29) x 30" x 18" high(cid:25). This is 6.25 square feet or 1.04 square feet per rabbit. This number
of rabbits should have 10.5 square feet at a minimum.
**One cage measuring 30"(cid:29) x 24" x 18" high contains 4 rabbits. This is 5 square feet or 1.25 square feet per rabbit.
These juveniles need a minimum of 1.5 square feet each, or 6 square feet for all.
**One cage measuring 30" x 30" x 18 high contains 5 young rabbits. This is 6.25 square feet, or 1.25 square feet
per rabbit. These juveniles need a minimum of 1.5 square feet each, or a minimum of 7.5 square feet for all.
**A grey rabbit, Maleficent, in the quarantine area is in a cage measuring 24" x 12.5" x 14" high. With >3" of
bedding, the height is inadequate. This size of rabbit requires a minimum of 3 square feet of floor space; this cage
provides just over 2 square feet. This was corrected at the time of inspection by moving her to a different primary
enclosure.
**A new caging unit in the quarantine area has nine enclosures measuring 22" x 26" of floor space, or ~4 square
feet per enclosure. There are three does with litters and one adult pair housed in these enclosures. Adult
standard-sized does (4.4 - 8.8 pounds) with litters require a minimum of 5 square feet; adult rabbits 4.4 - 8.8 pounds
require 3 square feet each, so pairing them in these cages is not in compliance with the regulations.
Each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be provided a minimum amount of floor space according to USDA
APHIS Animal Welfare Act regulations. Housing rabbits in inappropriately sized enclosures may stress the animals.
This can lead to increased susceptibility to disease, incompatibility, and fighting. Rabbits must be housed in
enclosures with the minimum required floor space for their health and well-being.
