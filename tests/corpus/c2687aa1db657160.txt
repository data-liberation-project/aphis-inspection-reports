2.77 (b) Records
For a shipment of 9 German Shepard puppies, the registrant was unable to provide a health certificate. The puppies were
shipped with a health certificate, however the registrant failed to maintain a copy. Also, the registrant stated she routinely
provides the original health certificate to the consignee and does not keep a copy for her records. A copy of the health
certificate should be maintained and made available for review by an APHIS official for at least one year to facilitate
regulatory requirements. Correct by August 31, 2022

Care in transit.
Eight 5-week-old puppies and the dam, were transported by the registrant from Texas. After 2-3 days at the registrant’s
site, while awaiting pick-up from the consignee, the registrant noticed the puppies were ill. The registrant informed the
consignee that the puppies needed veterinary care. The consignee would not authorize payment for veterinary care. The
registrant provided supportive care and deworming medication but did not seek consultation with a licensed veterinarian.
Within a 48hr period from the onset of symptoms, 7 of 8 puppies died.
The intermediate handler failed to seek immediate veterinary care for the puppies. Regulated persons must ensure that


any dog in transport that become ill or are observed in physical distress receive proper veterinary care. When an animal
is determined to be in physical distress, the registrant or other agent must ensure the animals receives a proper diagnosis
and treatment in a timely manner by contacting the closest veterinarian available. Correct and implement this regulatory
requirement for all transport by August 31, 2022.

Care in transit.
On May 27, 2022, the registrant transported dogs from Fulton County Animal Services in Atlanta, GA to the registrant
location in Lexington, SC. While at the registrant site, a 10yo dog “Old Gal” was found dead at 8pm on May 28, 2022.
According to the registrant, the dog was fine at the 6pm and 8pm checks the night before. The cause of death is
unknown, and a necropsy was not performed.
Upon review of the records that accompanied the dog, it was noted that “Old Gal” was very arthritic and prescribed
Carprofen caplets (100mg) SID forever. The registrant did not read the medical papers prior to transport and did not
obtain any medication to be administered. Prior to accepting a dog for transport, the registrant must review all medical
documents provided to ensure that the health status of the animal can be supported and maintained while in transit.
Correct and implement this regulatory requirement for all transport by August 31, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with registrant.
