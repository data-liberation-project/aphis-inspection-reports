2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1500 on
02-Aug-18. I went to the licensee's house. The licensee was home, but informed me that she would be exhibiting
her animals that afternoon and had to start getting them ready to leave in the next half hour. She asked if I could
get the inspection done in that time. I explained to her that would not be enough time and I would have to send out
another repeat attempted inspection report. I asked for her optimal hours to which she answered that any day of
the week would work for her. I suggested to her that she should start emailing me her schedule so I can conduct an
inspection the next time I come out. She said she would start doing that.
End of report.
