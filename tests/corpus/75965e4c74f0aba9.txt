3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Jagged wire was observed at the back side of two enclosures, one housing 3 pigs and the other housed the coatimundi.
This condition could cause harm since sharp jagged edges could potentially injure the animal. Enclosures shall be
structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
3.127(d) Critical

Facilities, outdoor.
The outdoor housing facilities are not enclosed by a perimeter fence. There was a recent occurrence where multiple
gates were left open leading to the wallabies and Patagonian cavies getting out of their primary enclosure. A perimeter
fence was not present to prevent two of the wallabies from escaping from the facility property. One wallaby was later
found deceased, and the second has not been located. The cavies did not leave the area adjacent to the enclosure and
all were returned unharmed. Facilities must have a perimeter fence to protect the animals in the facility and function as a
secondary containment. In addition, they must be of sufficient height for the animal species housed at the facility and are
required to keep animals and unauthorized persons out.
