PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The whelping pens are made of wood that has been treated to be impervious to moisture. Several wood strips and
areas adjacent to the openings on the inside of the whelping pens have been chewed by the dogs and puppies
exposing bare untreated wood in spots. This wood cannot be cleaned and sanitized adequately and may contribute
to spread of disease and odors.
All surfaces in contact with the dogs must be readily cleanable and sanitizable or be replaced or repaired when
worn or soiled. Correct by Aug. 14, 2015.
Previous veterinary care citation 2.40b2 has been corrected-dog was treated by attending veterinarian.
