2.31(c)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The June 24th 2021 semi-annual report and program review had not been submitted to the Institutional official (IO) and
the following required aspects were missing from the reports:
- The signatures of the majority of the IACUC members.
- A description of the nature and extent of the facility’s adherence to the Animal Welfare Act.
- The distinction of significant deficiencies from minor deficiencies in the program review.
- A specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency in the program review.
- Any minority views or a statement that there were no minority views.
The semi-annual evaluation report to the IO is an important document that updates the IO on the status of the facility's
animal care and use program and allows the IO to know when to intervene to ensure that the facility meets the federal
guidelines. The semi-annual evaluation report needs to be reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members and
needs to include any minority views. The reports must contain a description of the nature and extent of the facility's
adherence to the Animal Welfare Act. If there are any departures, they must be stated along with the reasons for the
departure, the significance of the deficiency (significant or minor), a reasonable and specific plan for correcting the
deficiency and a correct by date.


The inspector previously reviewed the June reports during a courtesy consultation and communicated these shortcomings
to an IACUC member. At the time of inspection, the reports were not corrected. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to
make sure the semi-annual facility and program review are accurate and contain all the required information. To be
corrected by February 17th 2022.
2.31(d)(1)(iii) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
None of the approved protocols provide assurance from the investigator that the activities do not unnecessarily duplicate
previous experiments. This information must be included in order for the IACUC to verify that the animals are being used
in a judicious manner and the use of animals is not unnecessarily duplicative. This assurance needs to be provided for
proper IACUC review and approval.
2.31(e) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocol VETY2873 and Protocol VETY2854 are both missing a complete description of the proposed use of the animals
and a rationale for the number of animals to be used. Protocols VETY2803, VETY3844 and VETY2824 does state the
number of animals to be used per laboratory session but does not describe how that number justifies the total number of
animals to be used for the year. Without this information, the IACUC cannot assess how the animals will be used and
cared for and therefore cannot make an informed decision in approving the protocols. The facility was cited during the last
inspection for protocols missing the same information. The protocols were amended but, per an IACUC member, the
IACUC did not review the amended protocols to ensure adequacy. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure protocols
are complete and contain all of the required information before approval. Protocols describing the conduct of activity
involving animals must contain all of the required information for proper IACUC review and approval.
2.36(a)



Annual report.
The research facility did not submit their fiscal year 2021 Annual Report. Per an IACUC member, the IACUC did not
submit an animal count to the Institutional Official (IO) who in turn did not send in a report before December 1st, 2021.
The annual report is essential to assure that professionally acceptable standards governing the care and use of animals
were followed during the previous fiscal year. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to make sure the report accurately
depicts the number of live animals used for teaching and the IO’s responsibility to make sure the report is submitted in
time. Each research facility must submit an annual report to the Deputy Administrator for the State where the facility is
located on or before December 1st of each calendar year. To be corrected by February 17th 2022.
2.38(k)(2) Critical

Miscellaneous.
The acquisition documents for 4 cats donated to the university misrepresented how they were obtained. 3 kittens,
Squash, Pumpkin, and Midnight were found at a student’s workplace and a cat, Shadow, was found as a stray kitten on
the property of an employee. The facility knew the true origins of the animals upon intake; however, a form was completed
and approved certifying that the cats were born and raised on the donors’ premises. It is critical for dog’s and cat’s
acquisition records to document the true origin of the animals in order to allow proper traceback of medical and legal
history. No person shall obtain live dogs or cats by use of false pretenses, misrepresentation, or deception. Documents
were corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
