Facilities, indoor.
The facility is renovating the basement of an animal building that houses two tenrecs. A strong paint thinner odor was
observed in the green room of this animal building despite an outside door being propped open. Noxious odors can lead
to animal discomfort and potential respiratory issues. Indoor housing facilities shall be adequately ventilated by natural or
mechanical means to provide for the health and to prevent discomfort of the animals. The licensee must develop a
method to adequately ventilate the green room during renovations.

Feeding.
Two produce bins contained spoiled food items. One bin contained a gourd with white mold at the top and along one side.
There were also circular areas of discoloration that appeared to be soft in texture. Where the gourd contacted a sweet
potato, white fuzz-like strands could be seen. Half of the sweet potato had a dark discoloration and moist appearance.
White and green mold were observed on the sweet potato. A second bin containing lemons and limes, had at least two
lemons covered in a greenish fuzz-like material. Feeding spoiled food items can affect the health and well-being of
animals by causing disease or not providing sufficient nutritive value. Animal food should be wholesome, palatable, and


free of contamination to maintain all animals in good health. The licensee must remove rotting food and provide all
animals an appropriate diet.

Sanitation.
One bat enclosure, housing approximately 13 bats, had excessive fecal material on the climbing racks and the wall
behind them. Excessive fecal material can lead to animal disease and discomfort. Fecal material shall be removed from
the primary enclosure as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards, and to
reduce odor. The licensee must develop a method which adequately cleans the bat racks and the walls behind the racks.

Sanitation.
Rodent droppings were observed on several windowsills and several produce bin in the kitchen area. There was one bin
where the rodent droppings were on top of numerous potatoes. Pests can carry disease and lead to animal health
concerns. A safe and effective program for the control of mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. The
licensee needs to enhance their current pest control program to address the presence of rodents within the facility.
