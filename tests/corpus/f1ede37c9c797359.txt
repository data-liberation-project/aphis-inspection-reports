ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the last inspection an adult male Chinchilla named Tobasco was identified to be evaluated by the attending
veterinarian for his eye which was closed shut. This is a focused inspection to verify the animal had been evaluated
and received treatment. The dealer(cid:25)s representative called the dealer then stated the animal had not been
evaluated nor had it received treatment and the eye is now cloudy. The animal is still squeezing the eye shut. The
animal needs to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian. The dealer must maintain written documentation of the
evaluation and all treatment to protect its health and welfare.
Affects one adult.
This focused inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the Dealers Representative.
