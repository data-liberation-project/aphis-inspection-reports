Separation.
According to facility representatives, on March 30, 2022, two adult male sugar gliders (#501213 and #501214) that had
been housed together for several years were heard fighting in the pouch. Later they acted normal in the pouch, according
to facility records. A facility representative conveyed that the two sugar gliders were checked that evening, and no injuries
were observed and the pair was left housed together. On March 31, 2022, sugar glider #501214 was found in the wheel
within the enclosure, which the facility representative indicated seemed out of the ordinary, and when he moved around,
his back legs seemed not to be moving correctly. He was then evaluated and treated by the veterinarian, and the sugar
gliders were separated. On April 1, 2022, sugar glider #501214 was found dead at the morning check.

Housing two animals together when they are incompatible with each other can create health risks, including the potential
for injuries or death to one or both animals.

Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. Animals shall not be housed near animals that
interfere with their health or cause them discomfort.



Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
