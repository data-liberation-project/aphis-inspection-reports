2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Two dogs in the whelping room had matted fur with feces trapped in the fur around the anal area. Having feces
trapped in the fur can cause skin irritation and is an unnecessary discomfort for the dog. Proper handling of animals
includes grooming and attending to matted areas when observed for the comfort and health of the dogs. These
dogs were observed with this condition in the morning but it was not addressed until noted by the inspector later in
the afternoon.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Several areas of the main kennel are rusted including support beams underneath the enclosures. Some of the
large breed enclosures are rusted around the frames and some of the water dish holders are rusted. In addition one
rusted food bowl was removed from an enclosure. Once these areas become rusted they can no longer be
effectively cleaned and sanitized. These areas need to be addressed to facilitate cleaning of the facility.

3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The facility has not been sanitized in 4 weeks according to the licensee. There is an accumulation of hair and
debris hanging down underneath the wire mesh enclosures. This excess hair traps urine and feces contributing to a
stronger odor in the facility. In addition a few of the center support beams have caked feces stuck between the
beam and wire mesh that need to be cleaned.
*** A few of the puppy enclosures in the whelping room that are low to the ground have an accumulation of feces
underneath the wire mesh that needs to be cleaned. These areas need to be cleaned more frequently at least once
a week, for the health of the animals. *** The puppy trays are having shavings changed out weekly, but the actual tray holding the shavings is dirty and
has not been sanitized in several weeks.
*** There are a few used dirty empty enclosures in the whelping room that need to be cleaned. The enclosures have
been empty for a week. Once the enclosures are empty they should be cleaned and sanitized in a timely manner
(24-48 hours) to reduce disease hazards and odors in the room. This needs to be addressed for the overall health
of the dogs in the whelping room.
Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks to reduce disease hazards, odors and for the health of the dogs.
