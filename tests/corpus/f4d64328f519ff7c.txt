Housing facilities, general.
Several enclosures containing nonhuman primates showed areas of excessive rust. In the Kansas area there are multiple
enclosures exhibiting excessive rust along the cage fencing and gate poles. In the "Peanut Gallery" enclosure containing
two capuchin monkeys, the ground level pole of the enclosure entry gate had severely rusted to the point where the metal
was degraded and falling away. Several of the metal “runways”, especially at the feeding stations, show excessive rust
along the cage wire, to the point of pitting and break down of the metal.

Several wire outdoor enclosures housing squirrel monkeys were secured with rusted bolts and washers. In one squirrel
monkey enclosure, D7, the bolts and washers along the resting platform supporting the heat cave had significantly rusted.

Excessive rust can compromise structural strength, present roughened and jagged surfaces where it is possible for the
animal to injure themselves, and prevent proper cleaning and sanitization of a surface. Any surface that comes in contact
with the nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that
affects the structural strength of the surface.



When speaking with facility representative they stated the facility has a plan to address any rusted caging and enclosure
materials. There was visible evidence of ongoing repair and replacement of rusted surfaces however some cages had
been missed or not yet addressed.

Correct by ensuring that these areas are repaired or replaced and that all surfaces that come in contact with the individual
animals including primary enclosures, perches, shelves, swings, etc. are constructed and maintained in a manner that
allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized and are removed or replaced as needed.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Several outdoor enclosures housing spider monkeys and capuchins had multiple soiled areas (excreta) that are over
several days old. Dried feces was found in the hanging nets under the heat dens and on top of plastic shelters near water
sources. Additionally, there were accumulations of discarded diets (monkey biscuits, vegetables and fruits) that had not
been removed. Dirt floors, floors with absorbent bedding, and planted areas in primary enclosures must be spot-cleaned
with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta, or as often as necessary to
reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
3.84(b)(3)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Several squirrel monkey enclosures showed an accumulation of dark, sticky oil mixed with dirt and debris at the location
of the food containers. An employee noted that the non-toxic oil had been applied as part of their pest control program.
However, the oil was thick and accumulating dirt to the point where a thick black layer of material was coating and falling
from the wire grate supporting the food bowls and corresponding enclosure walls.



Accumulated organic material and surfaces, that are not cleaned and sanitized at an adequate interval, can harbor
bacteria and mold that could cause illness and negatively impact the health and wellbeing of the animal contacting these
surfaces. As it is, the animals must encounter this material while resting and eating at the feeding station in the enclosure.
Hard surfaces of enclosures must be properly sanitized to adequately remove organic material.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
At the time of inspection, the vegetation adjacent to the perimeter fencing in certain areas of the property was overgrown
and obscured the lower portion of the fence. This made it difficult to walk the perimeter fence and confirm if the fence was
structurally intact. Housing facilities must be free of any accumulation of weeds. The vegetation along the perimeter fence
should be managed so that the fencing can be checked for structural deficiencies or evidence of pest activity. Additionally,
overgrowth of vegetation may harbor pests.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with various facility representatives and the attending veterinarian.
