Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
In the facility, there were 2 animals with a medical condition that were not being treated per the attending veterinarian’s
guidance. A female Yorkshire pig was observed to have a circular mass, approximately 1 and 1/2 inch in diameter,
located below her right eye. A second female Yorkshire pig had a ½ inch diameter open and reddened wound on her
upper left rear leg, right above the knee. This pig also had an ½ inch diameter dark red to black bruise at the same
location above the knee on her right rear leg. For both of these conditions, the attending veterinarian had not been
consulted. Medical care that is not being done per a veterinarian’s instructions can result in inappropriate methods to
diagnose and treat conditions such as these. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian to obtain a
treatment plan for both animals noted above and then, moving forward, in cooperation with his attending veterinarian, the
licensee must develop appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. To be corrected

Facilities, general.
During the inspection, two Yorkshire female pigs, identification numbers 7200 and 7201, were found walking in the
alleyway leaving behind a small trail of blood. Pig # 7200 had blood covering the exterior toe of her right hind leg while Pig


# 7201 had blood covering the exterior toe of her left hind leg. The blood on both spanned approximately ½ inch above
the hoof to the tip of the toe. In this facility, feed bins are affixed to the enclosure at the bottom with a metal rod secured
with a bolt/pin. In the enclosure for these 2 pigs, the metal bar came loose because it was not secured by a pin. The pigs
were able to escape their enclosure by displacing their feed bin and were injured as a result. The primary enclosure was
not maintained in a manner to contain and protect the pigs from injury. Both animals were secured by the licensee and
placed in a pen. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are maintained in good repair and are structurally sound to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
