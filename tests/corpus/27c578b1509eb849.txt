2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In the November 2016 IACUC semi-annual facility inspection, four deficiencies were documented. Two were
designated "minor", and two as "major" deficiencies. All findings were assigned correction dates of February 2017.
On inspection, there was no indication that the two "major" deficiencies had been corrected. Upon discussion with
the facility, the representative realized the IACUC had failed to submit work orders for the two "major" deficiencies.
Problems found on semi-annual inspections must be designated as "minor" or "significant" and must have clear
correction dates. If the facility fails to correct "significant" deficiencies by the assigned date, the Institutional Official
must report this to APHIS, in writing, within 15 business days. The facility must correct the two "major" deficiencies
as soon as possible.
Correct from this point forward
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
