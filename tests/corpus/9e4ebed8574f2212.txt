HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Food storage.
**There was an uncovered plastic bowl partially filled with a diluted milk product (used for positive reinforcement)
sitting on a table in the squirrel monkey housing room. The bowl was next to the scale that is used frequently during
the day to weigh the animals, and there were 4-6 pre-filled 3cc dosing syringes partially submerged in the liquid.
According to facility personnel, the diluted milk product is prepared daily, left on the table during the day, and
offered to the animals periodically throughout the day. The cover for the bowl was next to the bowl. In addition, the
label on the can of the milk product states “refrigerate after opening”.
Per this Section of the Regulations, all food must be stored in a manner that prevents contamination and
deterioration of its nutritive value, and also open food supplies must be kept in leak-proof containers with tightly
fitting lids to prevent spoilage and contamination.
Leaving the diluted milk product out on the table during the day in an uncovered bowl next to the scale does not
prevent possible contamination and/or spoilage of the milk, and may affect its nutritive value.
The facility needs to ensure that any opened food supplies are stored in a container with a tightly fitting lid and also
needs to determine the appropriateness of leaving the milk product out on the table during the day.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL. Housekeeping.
**Several housekeeping issues were identified during the inspection of NHP housing rooms and the premises.
There was a thin film of dirt noted on the surfaces of plastic storage containers used to store surplus food
receptacles and other supplies; surfaces of shelving units in the animal rooms had a thin film of dirt and some
particulate debris; spray bottles of disinfectant and window cleaner as well as cleaning implements were found next
to clean food bowls; many of the shelves and counters in the housing rooms were cluttered in appearance due to
the amount of equipment and husbandry supplies being stored on them; and in the 2nd floor cage wash room there
were 2 dirty acrylic food receptacles that contained food particulate residue on a shelf next to husbandry items.
Per this Section of the Regulations, premises must be kept clean to facilitate the husbandry practices required in
this subpart. The presence of dirt and particulate debris on equipment, the storage of cleaning supplies next to food
bowls, and putting dirty food receptacles next to husbandry items does not constitute good housekeeping and
husbandry practices. The presence of clutter in the housing rooms interferes with the ability to keep the premises
clean and neat.
The facility needs to review its housekeeping practices and then ensure that all staff are familiar with these practices
in order to maintain the cleanliness of the housing rooms and the premises.

NOTE – Inspection conducted 5/3/17 and 5/4/17. Exit briefing held 5/4/17 on-site with facility representatives.
