2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:00 AM on
14-Jun-18. On Thursday, June 14, 2018 at 10:00 am a responsible person was not available to conduct an
inspection. This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct from this day forward.
Spoke to the licensee's spouse. He was not at home and was not expected back until the next day. Later I spoke
with the licensee by phone and discussed his schedule for the next few weeks.
