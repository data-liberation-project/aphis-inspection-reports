3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An outdoor sheltered enclosure has big puddles of standing water in and around where dogs are. Housing facilities
must have a drainage system in place where water can be rapidly eliminated. Licensee stated there was a big rain
storm a couple of days ago. Standing water can promote diseases, pests and vermin infestation. The licensee
needs to remove this standing water and put in place a maintenance program where standing water can be rapidly
removed from outdoor sheltered enclosures. This will help minimize contamination and disease risks for dogs.
