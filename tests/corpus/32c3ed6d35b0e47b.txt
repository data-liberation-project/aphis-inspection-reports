2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Two long haired Pomeranians had a large amount of feces stuck in their fur in the anal region. This amount of
feces in the fur is an unnecessary discomfort for the dogs and these dogs need to be groomed in a timely manner to
reduce this from occurring.
*** In addition a few dogs had long nails that need to be trimmed and mats that need to be removed. Matted fur
pulls and separates from the skin causing discomfort to the dogs and can lead to other skin care issues. These
dogs need to be on a routine grooming schedule for their health and well being.

Correct by end of business day.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The outside enclosures for the large breed dogs have insulated boxes but there was no additional bedding down for
the dogs at the time of the inspection. The ambient temperature was 21 deg F so per the regulations the dogs need
clean dry bedding material for their comfort and well being.
Correct by end of business day.
3.6(c)(1)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** The facility currently has a standard poodle with her litter in a wire mesh enclosure that does not provide 6
inches of head room for the dog when she is in a normal standing position. This needs to be addressed for the
comfort of the dog and to prevent injury.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** There was a strong ammonia odor in the whelping room during the inspection. There was an accumulation of
feces underneath the enclosures that needs to be cleaned more frequently to prevent this odor build up.
*** There was an accumulation of feces in several shelter boxes that needs to be cleaned daily to prevent the dogs
from being soiled while in the box.
*** Several of the outside runs had feces that were not falling through the wire mesh. These enclosures need to be
spot cleaned daily to prevent this build up from occurring and for the health of the dogs.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** In the sheltered building with attached outside runs, there were mouse droppings along the ledges and tops of
the boxes. A more effective method for controlling pests needs to be maintained and this includes cleaning excess
droppings from the building in a timely manner to reduce disease hazards.
