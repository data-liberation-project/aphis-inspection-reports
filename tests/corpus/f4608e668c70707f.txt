FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the enclosure for one of the opossums, there was an electrical cord within reach of the animal, and it was not
protected by conduit, or other chew-proof material. The other opossum's enclosure had an electrical cord and power
outlet bar which were attached to a trellis on the wall. Staff stated that this opossum is not able to climb, and
therefore unable to reach the electrical equipment.
Enclosures should be free of hazards that could be harmful to the animals. Animal behavior cannot always be
predicted, with regard to climbing, or sudden interest in features in the enclosure that were previously ignored by the
animal. Chewing an electrical wire could cause electrocution, or severe injuries. Steps should be taken to prevent
the possibility of an animal chewing an electrical wire, such as removal, concealing inside a wall, or enclosing in
chew-proof conduit.
To be corrected by 2/23/16.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
