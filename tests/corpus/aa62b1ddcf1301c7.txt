Facilities, general.
A temporary electric fence is used to assist shifting beef cattle between pastures 18A and 18B. The area manager said
standard procedure is to have it removed from the pasture right after animals are shifted, however during inspection it was
seen to be on the pasture ground where cattle can walk over it and the re-bar posts were bent over probably from cattle
rubbing on them. The loose fabric fence wire and the bare re-bar posts within the pasture could cause injury to the cattle.
To protect the cattle, ensure that the fence-wire material and posts are removed promptly from the pasture once shifting is
completed.
