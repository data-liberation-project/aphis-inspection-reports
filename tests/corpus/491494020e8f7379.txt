FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The following outdoor, primary enclosures utilize the facility'(cid:25)s 6ft, concrete, block wall perimeter fence as a part of
its primary enclosure: Camel pen, Asian, Small-clawed Otter enclosure, and Kangaroo pen/yard. The perimeter
fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from having contact with the animals, and so it can function as a secondary containment system. It must
be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals
inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Fences less than 3 feet in distance from
the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
