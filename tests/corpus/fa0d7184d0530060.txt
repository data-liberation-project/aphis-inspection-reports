2.40(b)(2) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. There was an adult brown and white guinea pig in Pen G5 with a firm
movable mass approximately 1/2 inch in size under the chin. The licensee had not observed the health condition and was
not administering any treatments. The Program of Veterinary Care on file contained treatment options for the condition.
Swellings in the neck can be indications of disease or injury, can be painful, affect the overall health and well-being of the
animal, and may require treatment with antibiotics or other medications. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment
for disease may result in pain to the animals, worsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional animals if the
condition is contagious.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending veterinarian to
determine a plan for diagnosis and treatment.

Facilities, general.
The plastic sheeting along the ceiling of the guinea pig facility had some areas with holes with exposed insulation above
guinea pig enclosures.


Exposed insulation cannot be cleaned and sanitized and can potentially fall into guinea pig enclosures and if ingested
may result in health problems.
Housing facilities for guinea pigs must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

3.26(d)

Facilities, indoor.
In the guinea pig housing facility, there were support beams and areas around some of the building openings that were
wood that was not painted or sealed.
Unsealed wood is not impervious to moisture and cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized.
Interior building surfaces must be constructed and maintained so that they are impervious to moisture, can be readily
cleaned and sanitized, and won’t absorb moisture or odors.

3.31(c)

Sanitation.
There were numerous flies in the guinea pig housing facility. There were screens on the building openings but the screen
was large enough to allow flies to enter. There was fly tape along the ceiling but it was coated with flies and was not
effective in controlling the fly problem.
Excessive pests such as flies can cause discomfort to the animals and result in increased disease spread.
An effective program for the control of flies must be established and maintained.

Facilities, general.


In the rabbit housing facility, there was a window with a pane of glass missing and a feed bag utilized to fill the hole.
Feed bags are materials that are not easily cleaned and sanitized. Failure to maintain buildings in good repair can result
to disease or injury to the animals.
Housing facilities for rabbits must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

3.53(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The wire screening used on the rabbit enclosures was broken in several areas resulting in sharp points and gaps.
Specifically, Pen A8 contained a 2 inch gap, Pen B27 and Pen B29 both contained a 1/2 inch gap, and Pen C8 contained
a 1/4 inch gap.
Broken wires with sharp points and gaps can cause injury to the animals or result in escaped animals.
Primary enclosures for rabbits must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury
and to contain the rabbits.

3.53(a)(5)

Primary enclosures.
Pen C9 in the rabbit housing facility contained a doe with a litter and no nest box. There were 7 kits approximately 6 days
old in the pen in a nest of bedding and hair with no nest box for protection.
Failure to provide newly born rabbits with a nest box can negatively affect their health, safety, and survival.
A suitable nest box containing clean nesting material must be provided in each primary enclosure housing a female with a
litter less than one month of age.
