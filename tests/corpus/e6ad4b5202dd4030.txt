ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female, adult black Scottish terrier, ID# 61, has an area of hair loss on both sides along the ribs, approximately
four inches long by 1 ½ inches wide. At the ends of these areas closest to the rear, the skin appears to be dry and
flakey, with an area approximately one inch by one inch that has a brownish crust. The licensee states she has
observed the dog rubbing against the chain-link divider wall, but thought it was due to the dog'(cid:25)s loss of a mate.
She has not consulted a veterinarian about this issue. Skin problems can be caused from allergies, parasites or
infection, can be itchy or painful, and can affect the well-being of the dog. The licensee must consult with a
veterinarian for proper diagnosis and to develop and follow a treatment plan. The licensee must document the
veterinarian(cid:25)s findings; the treatment plan that is followed, and have the records available to the inspector upon
request. To be corrected by: April 15, 2014.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In an outdoor enclosure housing two dogs, there is a plastic shelter structure with corners that are chewed and
roughened. These rough surfaces make it difficult to be properly cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must
maintain all surfaces in direct contact with the dogs on a regular basis, and surfaces that are worn must be repaired
or replaced. To be corrected by May 6, 2014.
An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
