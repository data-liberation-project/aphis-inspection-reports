HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the middle bedroom of old Bonobos, there is chipped paint and concrete on the ledge at the back of the bedroom.
In the south bedroom of lemurs there was rust or flaking paint next to the metal doorway. There must be a system
to maintain the surfaces of nonhuman primate enclosures on a regular basis in order to be cleaned and sanitized
effectively.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In some the larger pens/exhibits, the enclosure fence line consists of a lower wall 4 to 8 feet in height, sometimes
covered by gunnite, topped with chain link attached to stanchions/uprights. There are several small areas (given
the amount of enclosure fence present) where the substrate (both gunnite and dirt) below the existing chain link
fence has been eroded away (by natural and animal causes). In some areas the chain link fence has been
damaged or rolled up in a way that creates a hazard for the animals and has the potential to cause injury.
*In Central Asia, there is damaged chainlink at the Gate to Dholes (Tiger gate). At the forage gate, the fence has
been eroded away on the Eastern side and the NE corner, exposing the concrete footing for the fenceline.
*In Asian Plains, there is a fence hole with a temporary patch of very rusty wire below Arabian Oryx and on the
north end by the boma (rhino/gower), the fence is not secured to the retaining wall and the gap is filled with rocks.
At the south-east end, the fence is damaged and needs to be reinforced - it is separated from the supports.
*In the White Lipped deer enclosure, lower corner near the Markhor pass through the chainlink fence was damaged
and curling up, creating gaps underneath and areas where the animals could injure themselves. In the Markhor
pens, the chainlink used as tree wrap was loose and damaged, resulting in sharp points.
Correction date: 1 December, 2017In S. Africa and the Bantang and Sambar permanent pens and Addax enclosure lower corner by the road, there
were areas where the height of the enclosure fence was not sufficient (less than 6 feet tall) for the animals due to
the build up of silt and dirt that was washed down by the rains. Correction date: 15 July, 2017
In the field exhibits, chicken wire has been attached on the exterior of the fence line as predator wire, and is mostly
buried. Erosion and animal activity has exposed chicken wire in some areas, covering the gap between the concrete
wall and the chain link. Chicken wire material, especially when rusty, is not appropriate and of sufficient strength to
prevent entry of small noncollection animals into the enclosure. The exposed chicken wire used as predator wire
was in the Asian plains exhibit on the north east side fence across from the Rhino boma and at Blackbuck hill.

In off-exhibit holding, shipping pens (19) there is a large hole that has been dug in a corner. In pen 30/31, the wild
Ass has damaged the plastic inserts in to the chainlink and resulted in superficial wounds on his face. In the
Klipspringer pen, the plywood has holes and splinters in the catch pen. The catch pen above White Lipped deer
has cribbed and splintered plywood. In permanent breeding pens, the Oryx have dug holes and under the fence,
creating sharp points and a hazardous area. In middle level Long Term Holding, there is a hole in the fence,
damage to the plastic fence inserts and damage to the shelter on the West end of the row. Correction date: 15 July,

In the VSE area, the research pen has an entire wall of rusty metal panels, and several pens have rusty latches and
flat bars that fill the door gaps. The chainlink gate to the alleyway has damaged chainlink and the plywood in Pen 2
is chewed and splintered. These pens were recently in use by covered species (Sitatunga and Common Eland)
during quarantine. Correction date: 1 December 17
In the Okapi barn and the Red River Hog yard, the hogs have rooted up the rhino lining on the floor and damaged
the dividing fence, creating sharp points where a variety of wire fencing materials have been utilized. The Okapi
yards have several areas of chain link damage, especially in the upper yard. Correction date: 15 July 2017
In Tiger bedroom #4, there is damaged insulation around a pipe near the ceiling. The bench below the pipe that the
animal used to reach the insulation has been removed, but the insulation is still damaged and no longer in good
repair. A work order was submitted in Sep, 2016 and it has been noted during an internal animal care inspection as
well, so a correction is pending.
In the Dhole bedrooms, there is paint chipping off the concrete in several areas, and it is no longer in good repair.
Correction date: 15 July, 2017
Facilities must be structurally sound, constructed with material that is an appropriate strength for the animals
involved and shall be maintained in good repair.3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The Big Horn sheep exhibit and the White tailed deer exhibit lack sufficient shade for the extremes of summer heat.
The single tree and shade structure in each enclosure are not sufficient for the number of animals currently housed
in each enclosure. In the White Tailed deer enclosure, several animals were clustered under the single shade tree,
and another animal appeared to be using the shade from the wall. Additionally the Markhor, Barbary sheep and
several pens in the Cheetah breeding compound did not have sufficient shade. A system of pen design must be in
place to ensure adequate shade is provided for all the animals in the enclosure.

3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the large field enclosures, there is a boma sufficiently tall and available to provide shelter to giraffes in inclement
weather. During this inspection, there was a pregnant female housed in the boma, and therefore it was not
available to the rest of the giraffes in the South Africa field enclosure, including 4-6 adult giraffe. The other shelters
available are not sufficiently tall enough for adult giraffe. Shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions and the
species shall be provided to afford them protection and prevent discomfort.
Correction date: 1 December, 2017
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The past winter, with significantly more rainfall than normal, has resulted in excess water runoff through many of the
larger exhibits. There are deep crevasses (3-6 feet) in several exhibits and especially narrow crevasses with
exposed pipes may pose a hazard to an animal and have the potential for injury. The previously identified areas of
standing water and poor drainage have been corrected and some of the winter storm damage has already been
addressed.
N. Africa NW corner with deep crevasses and dangerous gullies.
Asian Plains SE end with deep drainage ditches.
Central Asian Plains, along the road with a pipe perpendicular to the ditch.
Arid Antelope pen, central ditch with pvc pipe exposed.
White lipped deer pen, gullies with exposed pipes.
Przewalski's horses and Bactrian camels, deep ditches in the central hill.Correction date: 1 December, 2017
