Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Three enclosures with 2 golden lion tamarins, 1 ring-tailed and 2 mongoose lemurs, and 2 cotton-top tamarins are not
being sanitized on a regular basis. Currently the zoo removes the substrate and sanitizes the floor in sections on an as
needed basis, and that the entire floor will be stripped and sanitized yearly. There are multiple vines and natural/built
wooden structures that are similarly scrubbed manually but not sanitized except about once a year. The enclosures get
spot-cleaned daily so excreta and food waste are removed, and those affected areas get sanitized at the time. However,
lacking a schedule by which the entire enclosures including all surfaces are sanitized, this is not compliant with the
requirements, even for scent marking species. Incomplete sanitizing can allow infectious material to accumulate, even if
organic material is removed regularly. Correct by sanitizing all indoor primary enclosures at least once every two weeks
or, for scent marking species, at regular intervals in accordance with generally accepted professional and husbandry
practices.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
