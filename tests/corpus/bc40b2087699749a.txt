missing the door flap completely, and 2 others need the doors to be repaired at the hinges, as the screws are loose
and falling out.
It is important to repair and replace any chewed or broken surface in the kennel that the regulated animals come in
contact with. the door flaps should be intact to prevent wind and weather from entering the dog house.
Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound and must be kept in
good repair.
