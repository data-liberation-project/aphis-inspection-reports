HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a 6 inch section of the wire-front under the access gate on the outdoor portion of one enclosure that is in
need of repair. This has resulted in wire points sticking into the enclosure and a hole under this gate that is large
enough for a dog in this enclosure to fall through. Wire points in the enclosure could cause injury to the dogs and
holes in the fence does not securely contain the dogs. All housing facilities must be constructed and maintained in
good repair so they are structurally sound, protect the animals from injury and contain the animals securely. Correct
