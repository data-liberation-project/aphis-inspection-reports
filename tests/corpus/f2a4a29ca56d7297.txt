ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45 AM on
05-Sep-19.
The inspector arrived in Laramie, Wyoming at 10:45 AM. The inspector tried to locate the address that APHIS has
on file for the registrant, but it was determined after searching with the Google Maps app for iPhone and with a
Garmin nuvi 57 LMT device that the address on file is nonexistent. The inspector called the phone number that
APHIS has on file for the registrant, but the line has been disconnected and there is no forwarding number
available.
