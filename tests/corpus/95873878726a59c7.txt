HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
The pet store is acquiring puppies from an unlicensed breeder in Georgia, and is transporting them into the state,
for sale in Florida, without the required health certificate from the supplier. A health certificate for the puppies is
obtained once they are in Florida and before sale from the pet store. One puppy became ill shortly after coming into
the state, was taken to the local veterinarian for treatment but was euthanized approximately two-weeks after
arriving. Dogs transported in interstate commerce must be accompanied by a health certificate executed and
issued by a licensed veterinarian within ten days prior to the transport, .
Correct from this point forwad.

PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
The facility acquired dogs from an unlicensed breeder. In conversation the owner indicated that she was aware that
a breeder with more than four breeding females needed to have a USDA license. When asked why the breeder was
not licensed, she stated that they didn't want to get a license. No dealer or exhibitor shall knowingly obtain any dog,
cat, or other animals from any person who is required to be licensed but who does not hold a current valid and
unsuspended license.
Correct from this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
