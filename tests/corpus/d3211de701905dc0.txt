2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On 4 June 2020 an employee turned the air supply off to a tank of white bass to observe the female for spawning. The
employee inadvertently forgot to turn the air supply back on in the tank. The next morning a caretake came in and found
the fish in the tank deceased. Employees must handle the fish expeditiously and as carefully as possible to prevent
trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort. Failure to turn the air supply on created discomfort
and physical harm to the fish in the tank. This incident was corrected by the IACUC instituting a policy that requires
employees to visibly checked for air and water in all tanks after handling fish within the building. The IACUC also requires
a responsible employee to visually inspect all tanks with fish to ensure air and water supplys are functioning properly at
the end of each work day.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
