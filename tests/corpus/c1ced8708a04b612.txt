2.126(b) Repeat

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:45pm on
08/27/2021.

I called the licensee's cellphone, left a message, and waited at the gate of the facility. Approximately 30 minutes after my
initial attempt at contact, the licensee called back and informed me that he was out of town and unavailable for inspection
at that time.
