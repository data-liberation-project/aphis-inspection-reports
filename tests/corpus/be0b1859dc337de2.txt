2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** One adult male boxer named (cid:28)Seargant(cid:29) ( MC# 035 078 005) was observed limping and placing little weight on
the right front leg. There is a raised area that appears swollen about one inch in circumference on the outside of the
leg approximately three inches up the leg from the paw. On and below this swollen region there are what looks like
various sizes (pinpoint to an approximately 1 inch linear line) of scar tissue. The licensee stated that today was the
first time the problem with the right front leg had been noticed. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian
had not been consulted. Leg problems can be painful causing discomfort when the dog has to place weight on the
leg, it can affect the mobility and daily activity of the dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a
licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
The Great Pyrenees (no identification) and the adult female Boxer (MC# 010 815 067) from previous inspection
dated August 27, 2014 have had their veterinary care issues addressed.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee by Erika Leisner VMO and Bill Heine ACI.
