2.31(e)(2)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
In an IACUC approved protocol amendment for deer mice, there is no rationale for the appropriateness of the numbers of
animals to be used. It is important for protocols to include an explanation for the number of animals requested so that the
IACUC can review it and determine if the number requested is appropriate for the proposed work. Failure to provide and
review this detail can result in an excess of animals used and euthanized. The registrant must ensure that all protocols
contain not only a rationale for involving animals and the appropriateness of the species, but also the rationale for the
appropriateness of the numbers of animals to be used.
