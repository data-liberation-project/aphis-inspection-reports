ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One adult female male Lhasa Apso ( microchip number 105 124 576 ), one adult female Shih Tzu ( microchip
number 089 088 032 ) and one adult female Poodle ( microchip number F0A01336936 ) were observed to have
matted hair. The matted hair on the Lhasa Apso was on both rear legs covering 30 percent of the total body. The
matted hair on the Shih Tzu was on the hips, thighs and feet covering 30 percent of the total body. The matted hair
on the Poodle was on the ears, face and hips covering 70 percent of the total body. The matted hair was balled and
was tightly adhered to the skin. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris and moisture can trap
moisture and cause skin irritation. The matted hair must be removed and a program of coat maintenance must be
established at the facility. This NCI was corrected
during the facility inspection.
* Facility inspection and exit briefing done on 3/11/14 were conducted with the licensee.
