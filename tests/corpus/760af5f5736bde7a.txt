3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis, and those that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be
replaced when worn or soiled.
Peeling paint, covering approximately 1/2 to 3/4 of the individual runs of the sheltered dog facility, was present in all
runs. Uneven surfaces caused by peeling paint and/or exposure of porous concrete underneath can cause these
surfaces to be incompletely sanitized. This can cause buildup of material or organisms that can affect the health of
the animals.
To be corrected by 3/11/2014.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
