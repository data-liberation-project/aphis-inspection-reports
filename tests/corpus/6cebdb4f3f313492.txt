2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A female Shiba Inu, microchip # 0A02314605, was observed shaking her head and tilting it to the right. Upon
closer observation noticed a very wet, heavy, and yellowish discharge in the ear and adhered to the hair around the
ear, the skin in the ear canal also appeared reddened and inflamed. As the inspector tried to gently lift the ear flap
for a better view of the ear canal the dog winced and tried to pull back as though this condition was painful. The
licensee was not aware of this dog's condition until it was pointed out to her by the inspectors. This could be the
result of an injury, infection, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may cause discomfort. The licensee
must have this dog examined by a veterinarian by close of business on 19 Aug 15. The licensee must ensure all
animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structure.
***In the sheltered housing there is a woven wire divider panel in between two enclosures, affecting 5 dogs, which
has a section of approximately 2 feet long by 2 inches in height, and at the dogs' leg level, that has become
unattached from the O-rings creating a gap large enough that the dogs' legs could become trapped or the dogs
could become injured. The licensee must repair or replace this section and ensure that all enclosures are kept in
good repair and they must protect the dogs from injury at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage
***Immediately next to 4 enclosures affecting 11 dogs, the ground was puddled with standing waste water. This
puddled area had a mixture of feces, food, green and black slimy material, and crawling, wiggling and flying insects.
Having waste close to the enclosures can attract pest and vermin that can harm the dogs. The licensee must
dispose the waste far enough from the facility as to not attract pests or vermin near the animals and ensure properdrainage occurs.

3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Construction
***The facility has outdoor enclosures with wood floors and shelters, not impervious to moisture. The wood floors
and dog shelters had water and urine soaking into the wood. There were 11 outdoor enclosures with 27 dogs that
had wood plank floors and dog shelters that were constructed with wood on the inside in contact with the dogs.
Three of the shelters in the enclosures had wood slatted floors with gaps between the boards, preventing proper
cleaning and sanitization. These wood surfaces are not impervious to moisture, and cannot be properly cleaned and
sanitized. Licensee stated the wood was treated last spring. The licensee must ensure all surfaces in contact with
animals are impervious to moisture and readily cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure all surfaces must
be maintained on a regular basis.
3.9(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
The food inside 3 of the metal self-feeders, affecting 6 dogs, contains several bugs. When the inspectors lifted the
lid off of the self-feeder the bugs were seen crawling on and through the food. These bugs could contaminate the
food. When questioned by the inspector as to how often the self- feeders are cleaned and refilled, she replied that it
"was last cleaned about 4-5 weeks ago" and she refills the feeders "about once a week". The licensee must discard
the contaminated food in the affected self-feeders and ensure that all food given to the dogs is uncontaminated,
wholesome, palatable, and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value.
