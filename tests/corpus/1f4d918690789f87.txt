ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care (PVC) states that the three wolf-dogs are to receive treatment two times per
year with two different worming agents for intestinal parasites. There were no records available during the time of
inspection showing that this procedure had been done. Failure to follow the program of veterinary care or other
directions from the attending veterinarian can result in a variety of medical problems with the animals.
Licensee must use appropriate methods to control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries as directed by the
attending veterinarian.
