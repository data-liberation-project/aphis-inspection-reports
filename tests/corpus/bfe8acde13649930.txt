ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) could not be found during inspection. The attending veterinarian must
be contacted to set up an appointment for a site visit and complete the PVC. One guinea pig was noted to have
hair loss and scabs on her back in enclosure #12. Treatment for this guinea pig must be guided by the Attending
Veterinarian. A current PVC signed by a licensed veterinarian must be available for inspection by APHIS officials.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation.
There was a strong ammonia odor in the building during inspection. By the end of the inspection I noted my throat
felt irritated. The building must be provided with fresh air while maintaining a temperature between 60 and 85
degrees F. Cleaning enclosures more often can also help with the ammonia odor. To promote animal health, the
ammonia odor must be decreased greatly.
3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(1) Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair...
At least 10 feeders were observed to be excessively rusted and/or have sharp edges on them. Sharp edges could
injure guinea pigs. Feeders must be repaired or replaced and all surfaces in the enclosures must be free of sharp
edges to prevent injury to the guinea pigs.

SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
The ceiling and areas around gas heaters had an excessive amount of dust and cobwebs. This can create a fire
hazard. To protect animal health, routinely clean the building from ceiling to the floor to prevent buildup of cobwebs
and dust on the walls, heaters, and ceilings.
3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(1) Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury...
A feeder in a rabbit's enclosure was noted to have a hole rusted through the top, exposing sharp edges. This could
injure the rabbit. Replace or repair this feeder and any other rabbit feeders with sharp edges to protect rabbits from
injury.
Correct by February 5, 2014.
3.56(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
In the corners of at least four rabbit pens there was an excess build-up of droppings and waste. Rabbit enclosures
must be cleaned often enough to prevent a build-up of waste. Build-up of animal waste can cause animals to get
sick and increase ammonia odors. Enclosures must be cleaned more often to promote the health of animals in the
building.
