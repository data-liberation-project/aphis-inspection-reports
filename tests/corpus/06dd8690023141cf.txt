CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The guenon and lemur night shelters have a shared common area adjacent to the enclosures. An accumulation of
roach egg sacs and droppings were noted on the concrete floor in close proximity to an improperly fitted mesh drain
cover that had trapped organic debris. A locked cabinet located on the wall of the common area was opened during
this inspection and numerous adult roaches were seen scattering inside. The shelves of the cabinet contained
accumulations of roach droppings and egg sacs.
These insects can contaminate food and potentially transmit bacteria, fungus, viruses and parasites that could have
a negative impact on the health and well-being of the non-human primates. The current pest control program should
be reviewed and modified to effectively control insect pests. Correct by July 1, 2017.

SANITATION.
The primary enclosures for the raccoon and porcupines each have a small water moat adjacent to the public barrier
on one side and directly adjacent to the primary enclosure on the other. Animals were resting in close proximity to
the moats during this inspection. The moat water appeared to be primarily stationary and large numbers of mosquito
larvae were noted swimming in both waterways during this inspection.
Personnel stated that the water was drained on a weekly basis, however, the moats are facilitating mosquito growth
and life cycles changes. Insect pests can be a source of physical irritation and annoyance to the animals as well as
serve as vectors for disease transmission. The facility should review the current pest control program and
implement changes to ensure an effective program for insects is maintained. Correct by: July 1, 2017.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.
