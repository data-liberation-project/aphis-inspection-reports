Watering.
The water in the water receptacles in all three fox pens was dark green and opaque in color. A filmy layer was noted just
below the surface in the middle pen. The sides and bottom of the water receptacles were not visible through the water
itself. The foxes may choose not to drink this water which may lead to dehydration. In addition, non-potable water may
contain unhealthy contaminants. Potable water is necessary for adequate hydration and health. Potable water must be
provided for the health and comfort of the animals. Correct by 10/15/2020.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
