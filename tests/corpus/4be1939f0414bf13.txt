1. A black female pug 'Rachel' born 5/1/12 has an accumulation of cream-colored mucus covering both eyes. The
licensee stated that eye drop medication was currently being administered to treat the condition. The licensee has
no documentation from a veterinarian regarding the use of eye drops to treat this dog. Not having clear vision can
cause
discomfort and affect the health and well being of the dog. The presence of eye discharge can be a sign of injury,
infection or other potentially painful veterinary medical conditions. The potential for injury exists if the dog is not able
to see clearly.

material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures, be painful, impact the ability of the
dog to eat normally and harm the health of the animal.
