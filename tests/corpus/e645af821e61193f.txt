that exhibitor.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the outdoor hutch, the areas of solid floor (wood & particle board covering 3/4 of the floor) did not contain litter,
and moisture from the water bottle and excreta stained the floor. The requirement for litter on solid floors is to
protect the rabbit's feet and legs from moisture and excreta. The rabbit showed no signs of injury and had enough
space to get away from the fecal material. The housing system should ensure that litter is provided on solid floors
for rabbits, or appropriate wire floors are used to prevent injury to the feet & legs of the rabbit.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure for the sheep and goat has added chicken wire on the door. The chicken wire is damaged, with a
strand of wire separated and hanging down, but still attached on both sides. The goat was observed putting his
head above and below the wire strand to push on the door. There were no visible wounds on either animal, but the
strand of wire presents a risk of injury to the animals. A system of maintenance should be in place to maintain the
facilities in good repair and protect the animals from injury.
