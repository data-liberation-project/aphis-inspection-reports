RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
On inspection, the acquisition records were incomplete. The acquisition records for 2014 did not have the date the
dogs were sold or removed, but had disposition records stating these animals were sold. By not maintaining the
required information it prevents or interferes with the dog(cid:25)s movements to be tracked and verified. The licensee
shall keep and maintain all required sections of all records of acquisition and disposition for all dogs including date
of sale/removed. Correct this day forward.
3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the whelping room, the carpet used in one enclosure with five West Highland white terrier puppies was
determined to be in disrepair. The 2ft. by 1 ft. orange carpet was significantly frayed around the outer edge. The
numerous frayed strands were approximately 1 to 3 inches in length. Any linear string-like material such as strands
from a fraying carpet that an animal could ingest can cause an impaction or serious trauma to an animal(cid:25)s
intestines. Remove the fraying carpet and monitor all materials in the enclosure to ensure worn or soiled surfaces
are removed and replaced. Corrected at time of exit interview.
The inspection was conducted with the wife of the licensee and the exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
