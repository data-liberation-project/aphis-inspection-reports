ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care states that the method of euthanasia for the hamsters and gerbils housed at this
facility will be by CO2. At time of the inspection, one live hamster was observed in an enclosure with a snake. Live
feeding of covered species to snakes is not a humane method of euthanasia and must not be used . There is no
CO2 chamber present at this facility . If a different method of euthanasia is elected then the program of veterinary
care must reflect that change and be in accordance with an AVMA approved method to ensure humane euthanasia
. Employees must receive adequate guidance in the method of euthanasia which if CO2 is used must include a flow
meter. The approved euthanasia method must be followed for each euthanasia of covered species.
