2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was an approximately 7 week old female Havanese puppy (#14-35) that was observed with an abnormal
gait in the hind limbs. At times, the puppy's rear legs appeared to splay outwards and not bend normally when
walking. According to the licensee, he had noticed the condition in the hind limbs since the dog was approximately
three weeks old, however, a veterinarian had not been contacted about the dog's condition. This condition could be
caused by a variety of veterinary medical conditions which could be uncomfortable. The licensee must have this dog
examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary
care at all times. To be corrected by: September 4, 2014.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***Inside the sheltered building, there were at least two enclosures housing puppies that contained sharp points.
Inside each enclosure there were metal feeders being held onto the wall of the enclosure with wire holders that had
sharp ends protruding into the enclosure at the dogs' level. Sharp points in the enclosures increase the risk of injury
to the animals. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so that they have
no sharp points or edges that could injure the animals. To be corrected by: September 4, 2014.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***Many of the water receptacles throughout the facility had an accumulation of a dark, green, algae-like growth on
the inside surfaces of the receptacles. One of these water receptacles was located within an outdoor enclosure and
at least five additional water receptacles were located within the outside portion of enclosures in the sheltered
building. Water receptacles, which are not properly cleaned and sanitized, can harbor disease-causing organisms
and could decrease the dogs'(cid:25) acceptability of the water. The licensee must ensure that all water receptacles are
kept clean and are sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if necessary in order to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. To be corrected by September 4,
2014.The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
