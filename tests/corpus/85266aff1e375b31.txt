ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***The snow macaque named Mojo has been housed since Sunday in an enclosure that does not have adequate
enrichment for the nonhuman primate. Exhibitors must follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement
adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The physical environment in the primary
enclosure must be enriched by providing means of expressing noninjurious species-typical activities. Correct by
October 2, 2014.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***On the front side at the bottom of the fencing in the bobcat's primary enclosure the post has rusted completely
through leaving a gap between the fencing and the adjacent post. Also the bottom of the fencing running along the
ground has rusted through leaving a space for the younger cats to potentially escape through. The primary
enclosure is in disrepair and should be maintainted to contain the animals and prevent escape. Correct by October
