ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a Yorkie male #11 with moderate dental disease, including dark greenish-brown tartar on all canines and
cheek teeth as well as discolored gums with some degree of swelling. In April of 2015, the licensee had
self-identified this dog as having Grade 3 out of 4 dental disease, which requires cleaning by the veterinarian. This
dog has not had any dental care performed after this assessment was made by the licensee. Dental disease can
be painful, cause difficulty eating/drinking, and can lead to infection in other parts of the body if left untreated. The
licensee must ensure that all animals are receiving proper veterinary care, including the use of appropriate methods
to prevent, diagnose, treat, and control diseases and injuries. Correct by having this animal examined by the
attending veterinarian and treated accordingly.
