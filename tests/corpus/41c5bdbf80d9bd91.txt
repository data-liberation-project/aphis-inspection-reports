ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-There was one adult female blackbuck antelope which was lying down away from the rest of the herd along the
fence line. The animal had an abnormal condition of the right eye which appeared swollen compared to the left eye.
When attempting to get a closer view of the animal, it got up and ran away toward the rest of the herd. A white to
yellow colored cylindrical-like object or material appeared to be extending from or penetrating the eye. The eyeball
itself was not easily visualized. There was a large amount of dark discharge-like material in the fur extending from
the corner of the eye downward past the bottom jaw. According to the licensee, he noticed an eye condition and
treated the animal once which was documented in the licensee's written records on May 28, 2017, but the animal
was not examined by a veterinarian. It is possible that the treatment did not improve the condition and/or a new
condition has developed since the last documented treatment approximately two weeks earlier. The eye condition
could indicate an injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition which could be painful. The licensee must
have this blackbuck examined by a veterinarian. This veterinary examination is in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document
this information and provide it to the inspector upon request. To be corrected by: June 14, 2017
-There were at least five adult aoudad with excessively long hooves especially on the rear claws. At least one of
these animals with long rear hooves, had a gait that appeared unsteady on the rear limbs. One of the sheep had a
medial claw on the left rear hoof twisted over the top of the tip of the adjacent claw. Another animal had a lateral
claw on the right rear hoof that was curled outward. There were at least two animals with hooves that were long
and curling upward or veering outward. One of the sheep had a right rear medial claw that appeared split or
cracked. Long hooves can affect an animal’s gait and can increase the risk of injury and/or discomfort. The licensee
must ensure that all hooves are kept short enough to not affect the animal’s stance or gait and are kept at an
appropriate length which will avoid injury. To be corrected by: June 16, 2017
-There were some medications at the facility which were past their expiration date. The following is a list of
products, and their labeled expiration dates in parentheses, that were stored with other products and/or medications
currently in use at the facility and were therefore ready for use.
Penicillin G (12/2016), 2 bottles of Clostridium Perfringens Types C & D Tetanus Toxoid (22 Jul 16 & 21 Feb 17),
Xylazine (7/09), “Tolazine” (2/11), 2 bottles of “Telazol” (01/2016 & 01/2016), Thiamine HCl (1-17), Vitamin B
Complex (10/15), Amoxicillin (05/16), Xylazine/“AnaSed” (Jul 14), Ivermectin (01/17), Sterile Saline Solution
(2016-03) and “Probios” (04/17). Expired medications may not work as anticipated and/or may lose their effectiveness and their ability to prevent or
control disease and/or pain. The licensee must ensure all medications are within their expiration dates at all times.
To be corrected by: June 16, 2017
-The licensee was also using some medications in an off-label manner. For example, the licensee had used
xylazine in a blackbuck without instructions for its use in that animal from a veterinarian. Use of medications in a
manner other than what is stated on the label could increase the risk of injury, illness and/or death in the animal.
The licensee must ensure that all medications used in a manner other than what is on the product’s label have
written instructions for its use under the order and direction of a licensed veterinarian. To be corrected by: June 27,
2017
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
The inspection and a preliminary exit interview were conducted on June 13, 2017 with the licensee. An exit
interview was completed on June 14, 2017 with the licensee.
