ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following guinea pigs were observed during inspection with medical conditions:
1). In pen D, an adult female with white and brown hair was noted to have a 1 to 2 cm mass under its chin.
2). In pen D, an adult female mostly brown with white and tan hair was noted to have a 2 cm mass under its chin.
The licensee had not identified the guinea pigs with masses prior to inspection, but did state that she observed
guinea pigs with masses in the past. Licensee also stated that she had never discussed masses with the attending
veterinarian. The written program of veterinary care on file does not does not address animals with masses.
When animals are identified as needing care, the facility must either initiate treatment as outlined in the program of
veterinary care or contact the attending veterinarian. Licensee must conduct daily observations to assess the health
and well-being of guinea pigs. The attending veterinarian must be consulted about the two guinea pigs listed above
so that adequate care can be provided. Correct by January 11, 2020.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records for guinea pigs were not being maintained on births and deaths. Only the number of weaned guinea pigs
were being recorded each week. Records need to be kept and maintained on animal births and deaths to help keep
track of animals and to assess the facility animal care program. Correct by January 16, 2020.
3.26(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation. There was a strong ammonia odor throughout the indoor guinea pig room. There was a small opening in
one window, but this opening was not sufficient to provide adequate ventilation. The enclosures were last cleaned
on Saturday (1/4/20). Failure to provide fresh air can expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards. The
indoor facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and to ensure the health of the animals. Correct by January11, 2020.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Several primary enclosures containing guinea pigs had wet, dirty, and soiled bedding by the water bottles and self
feeders. Enclosure were last cleaned on Saturday (1/4/20). Wet and dirty bedding can cause unpleasant ammonia
odors, lead to contamination of feed and water, attract pests, and expose animals to disease risks which can affect
the health of the animals. The facility must ensure primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to
prevent an accumulation of wet, dirty, and soiled bedding. Correct by January 10, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
