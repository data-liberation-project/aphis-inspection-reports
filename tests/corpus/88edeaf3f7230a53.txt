ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:05 on
16-MAY-19.
Waited at the closed gate at the Prather, CA address provided by the licensee and attempted to contact the
licensee by cell phone at her home telephone and cell phone numbers. Additionally texted the licensee. Received
no response to phone calls or text. After waiting 30 minutes the property owner came to the gate but stated that he
did not want an inspection performed without the licensee present.
