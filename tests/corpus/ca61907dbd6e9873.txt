Facilities, general.
There was a ferret that was being kept on the floor in a small, plastic bin in one of the indoor housing areas that managed
to crawl up and out of it during the inspection. As it was trying to escape the bin, one of the fellow inspectors pointed it out
to the licensee, and she was able to grab it. There were also several rusted and jagged sharp steel points within the
binturong enclosure, along the back and back-right sides midway up from the ground. Primary enclosures that do not
maintain the animal therein allow the opportunity for injury and/or death. Primary enclosures that are not well-maintained
allow the opportunity for animals to be injured and can negatively impact their well-being. The indoor and outdoor housing
facilities must be structurally sound and must contain the animals.

Correct by: Both issues were addressed at the time of inspection.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
There was an open bag of rat poison pellets sitting atop a small plank above the sink in the hedgehog breeding shelter.
Just to the left of this plank, down on the floor, was a plastic bin housing a pair of breeding hedgehogs, where if the bag
were accidentally knocked over, it could have easily fallen into the enclosure with the animals. In the enclosure housing


two binturong’s, there was also a live electrical cord (for their heating source) draped along the top left side of the
enclosure that was easily accessible to the animals. If ingested, rat poison could kill the hedgehogs. The cord poses a
well-being hazard to the binturong’s as if chewed, could kill them. Premises (buildings and grounds) must be kept clean
and in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

Correct by: The bag of rat poison was correct at the time of inspection. Correction date for the cord is December 2, 2021.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
During the inspection there was an excessive (too numerous to count) number of flies in the following areas: the outdoor
food prep area; atop the fresh produce inside the binturong, pig, African crested porcupine, and kinkajou enclosures.
There were numerous (at least 8), feral cats roaming the outdoor premises of the facility as well, where some were freely
entering and exiting a couple of the breeding shelters housing sugar gliders and ground squirrels. Finally, there was a
German roach crawling within the bedding inside an indoor enclosure housing spiny mice. Pests – in this case the cats,
flies, and roach - can harbor and introduce diseases to other animals, which could negatively affect the health and overall
well-being of those animals. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasite, and avian and
mammalian pests must be established and maintained.

This was the 1st, out of 3, attempts to pass the re-license inspection. There are now 2 remaining attempts.
