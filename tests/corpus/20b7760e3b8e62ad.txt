Housing facilities, general.
When walking back toward the kennel from the driveway a male dog named Chief, with id 34-A-0226-1, was loose. The
licensee stated that the dog had climbed out of the exercise yard.

Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept in
good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from
entering.

Ensure that the exercise pen is constructed to prevent dogs from jumping or climbing out
to prevent injury or death to the dogs.
