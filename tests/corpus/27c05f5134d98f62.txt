ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 3 year old female mini-golden doodle, microchip #991001000928238, has severe dental disease. There are
multiple missing teeth. The remaining incisors (3) have severe gum recession and a mild amount of brown tartar.
The canines on the left side have a moderate build-up of brown/yellow tartar. All teeth located behind the canines
on the upper and lower jaws, have a significant amount of brown, yellow, green tartar and thick plaque. The gums
are reddened. One tooth, near the back of the mouth on the left mandible, has a cream/brown, spongy, pus-like
material at the gum line. A lack of dental care can be painful and jeopardize the animals health. Dental disease lead
to an increased risk of kidney disease, liver disease, and heart disease.
