There was a electric cord on the outside of the lemur enclosure which was hanging within the animals reach. This
cord was plugged into an electric outlet above the lemur enclosure, however the cord was accessible to the animal,
and there was debris and prints on the cord indicating the animals has contact with the hord. This is a hazard and
can cause the lemur to become injured. Animal enclosures need to protect the animal from injury. The licensee
attempted to secure the cord above the lemur enclosure and out of the animals reach however the cord fell back
down into the animals reach. A more secure method must be established so to properly secure the cord.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. The run in shed in the camel pasture had areas in the roof that had gaps, and the insulation underneath was
exposed. There was insulation also found on the ground. In addition, roofing material and supplies were being
stored against the wall inside this shelter. This can pose a hazard to the animals as well as can cause injury if the
insulation is ingested by the animals.
2. There were areas of the fencing for the goat enclosure which were jagged and broken, and had come apart from
the horizontal support beam. This created a large gap underneath where the animals could possibly become
injured. Fences need to be kept in good repair.
3. The fencing for the top alpaca enclosure was sagging downward. It had come apart from the top horizontal
support beam and was sagging. All fences need to be kept in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and properly contain the animals.
4. One alpaca was being kept in an enclosure which allowed him access to the back end of a storage trailer. The
sides of the back door of this trailer were crumbling and falling apart, and jagged edges of the material were
present. This could cause the animal injury. Enclosures need to be kept in good repair and must not allow animalsaccess to materials which they could ingest or cause injury.
5. The serval enclosure had a leak in the roof. The water was dripping into the enclosure and was being collected
by a container on the floor in the middle of the enclosure. Animal enclosures need to be kept structurally sound and
in good repair. This situation needs to be corrected.
