OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The perimeter fence is not six feet in height. Some erosian may have occured and the fence measures four to five
feet in height in several areas. The fence must be made six feet in height all around the animals. The fence must
be constructed so that it protects nonhuman primates by restricting unauthorized humans, and animals the size of
dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going through it or under it and having contact with the nonhuman primates.
Fences less than 6 feet high must be approved by the Administrator.
