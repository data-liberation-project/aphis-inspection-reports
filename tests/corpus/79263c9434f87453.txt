2.40(a) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the March 2017 inspection a couple of the pigs appeared thin. This was pointed out to the licensee at that
time. During this inspection quite a few pigs and a couple of the sheep/goats appeared extremely thin.
Extremely thin animals indicate some type of health or husbandry problem. The licensee is responsible for
providing the animals with adequate veterinary care. These animals need to be evaluated by the attending
veterinarian and a written plan on treatment/husbandry changes needs to be provided by the veterinarian. This plan
needs to be available to USDA inspectors at the next inspection.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Hay being fed to the animals was being stored in a stall on top of approximately six inches of old hay on top of dirt.
Although this was not directly on the ground this type of storage does not prevent the hay from becoming wet and
possibly moldy if the dirt beneath becomes wet.
Straw used for bedding was being stored in an open sided shed. This storage did not protect most of the straw from
exposure to rain.
Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in facilities which adequately protect them from deterioration, molding
or contamination by vermin. The hay and straw need to be stored somewhere with better protection from possible
water exposure

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Excessive crowding in both the sheep/goat enclosure and the pig enclosure was observed during this inspection.
Several of the pigs were in poor body condition and had excessive hair loss. A couple of the goats and sheep were
in poor body condition. There was excessive crowding around feeding areas and competition for food was
observed.
Inadequate space can cause poor body condition, stress, hair loss and abnormal behavior patterns. The number of
animals in these enclosures needs to be reduced so that each animal has sufficient space to eat and move without
competition and stress.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The licensee continues to feed old produce to the animals. The licensee is responsible for providing food that is of
sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. Since several of the animals are
extremely thin the licensee needs to acquire written directions from the attending veterinarian for feeding this old
produce. Directions should include which produce can and cannot be fed, how often it can be fed, and which
animals it can be fed to.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
Hay being fed to the cattle had been thrown onto a muddy area just inside of the gate to the enclosure. Food shall
be accessible to all animals and shall be placed as to minimize contamination. Hay fed on top of mud does not
minimize contamination. Some method for feeding the cattle must be implemented that minimizes contamination by
mud and feces.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The llama enclosure had 8 trash cans full of old hay and dried mud/feces. According to the licensee these had
been filled the day before but had not been removed from the enclosure. These 8 trash can were from
approximately ½ of the enclosure. The other half of the enclosure still needed to be cleaned. The goat/sheep enclosure and pig enclosures had old soiled straw on the ground that did not appear to have been
cleaned in several days. The pig enclosure smelled like rotting produce and had an excessive amount of flies.
Old straw/bedding, excessive feces, and excessive numbers of flies can contaminate new feed and possibly cause
illness in the animals.

These enclosures need to be cleaned more frequently to decrease odors, contamination, and the excessive fly
problem.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There is an excessive amount of junk deposited around the animal area, especially around the storage shed for the
hay and straw.
This type of situation is excellent for attracting and housing all types of vermin which could cause harm to the
resident animals.
Premises must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and illness.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The pig enclosure had an excessive amount of flies. Flies can carry disease and cause physical discomfort to the
animals. A safe and effective pest control program needs to be established to reduce the fly problem. This should
begin by regular cleaning of the animal enclosures.
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
The licensee currently has 2 full time employees that care for the animals. Due to the extensive number of
husbandry issues at this facility this does not appear to be enough employees. The licensee needs to hire more
employees or reduce the number of animals these 2 employees are responsible for.
