ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is no formal arrangement with an Attending Veterinarian at this time. There is no current written Plan of
Veterinary Care (PVC).
Although there is a relationship with a local practice, the veterinarian at that practice indicated that she has no
formal agreement with the museum to serve as their Attending Veterinarian. She did indicate that she has
previously provided care for the facility(cid:25)s AWA-covered species and is aware of no known active veterinary
concerns.
A formal arrangement with an Attending Veterinarian and a written PVC are required for licensed facilities and must
comprehensively describe the relationship to ensure proper care for the animals. Correct by May 27, 2016.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
An accurate record of animals on hand, including acquisition and disposition records, is not available. A
short-tailed opossum on a previous record has no disposition record. The ability to verify animals on hand and their
sources of acquisition and disposition is required and is important for trace-forward and trace-backward activities.
Records must include the name, address, phone number and identification for the source and disposition of
animals. Correct by May 27, 2016.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Significant amounts of feces are present in the chinchilla and the sugar glider enclosures. Feces are noted on
resting areas, in the nesting materials and sleeping areas, and on the floor of the enclosures. Excessively soiled
bedding is present on the floors of the chinchilla and hedgehog enclosures. Excessive feces and soiled bedding
provide opportunity for harmful bacteria to proliferate and can negatively impact the health of the animals. Correct
from this day forward. Exit interview conducted on 5/14/16 with facility representatives (Exec Director, Director Education).
