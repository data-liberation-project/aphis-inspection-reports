ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The Program of Veterinary Care for this facility is not current. The APHIS Form 7002 presented by the licensee
was blank except for the administrative information (name and address of the licensee) on page 1 completed and
signed by the Director on 12/26/14. Failure to have specific accurate guidance and a complete written Program of
Veterinary Care does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also
does not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this
by developing and implementing a complete, accurate, written Program of Veterinary Care.

Correct from this day forward.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** During the inspection, the facility Director stated there were three big cats that had been euthanized since the
last inspection. When reviewing facility records, these 3 animals (a lion named Simba, a tiger named Mirage, and a
lion named Nayla) were still listed on the current on hand forms with no written documentation of disposition or
euthanasia. Additionally, the on hand records provided had numerous animals that had been lined through to show
they were no longer on the premises. There was no written documentation of disposition for these animals. Accurate animal records regarding births, deaths, acquisition and disposition are used to help evaluate the facility(cid:25)s
animal care program and for animal tracking for ownership and health care concerns. Every exhibitor must make,
keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning animals
purchased, acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her control, or were transported, sold, euthanized
or otherwise disposed of by that exhibitor, including any offspring born of any animals while in his or her possession
or under his control.
From this day forward correct by maintaining accurate records regarding the correct number of animals on hand at
the facility, and all new births, acquisitions, deaths and sales.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The enclosure housing a macaque named Eddie is rusted on the lower right area of the door. The door frame is
made of metal tubing and is rusted about 18 inches from the ground down to the floor. Excessive rust can affect the
structural strength of surfaces and prevents the required cleaning and sanitization of enclosures. Any surface that
comes in contact with the nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning
and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface. Correct by ensuring that these areas are
repaired or replaced and that all surfaces that come in contact with the individual animals including primary
enclosures, perches, shelves, swings, etc. are constructed and maintained in a manner that allows them to be
readily cleaned and sanitized and are removed or replaced as needed.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
*** The current enrichment plan is incomplete. The facility Director produced a document showing a plan of
enrichment for one primate on the property. There was no written plan addressing the other primates (including 2
capuchins, 2 lemurs, and a vervet monkey). The development and implementation of environmental enhancement
plans to promote psychological well-being in nonhuman primates has promoted social housing and enriched the
environment of the nonhuman primates resulting in a decrease in stereotypic behavior. The facility must develop,
document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement to promote the psychological well-being of
all their nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as
cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian. This
plan must be available to APHIS upon request.Correct by: June 1, 2015

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The primary enclosure for a macaque named Eddie requires cleaning. This enclosure has surfaces in contact
with the primate that are covered with grime and require cleaning especially the wire fencing used as cage walls.
Failure to clean on a regular basis exposes the animals to disease hazards and does not satisfy accepted
cleanliness standards. The facility must ensure that all primary enclosures housing non-human primates are
cleaned on a regular basis. Additionally, all indoor primate enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized at least every
2 weeks or as often as necessary to prevent excessive accumulation of dirt and debris in accordance with section
3.84(b)(2).

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The following areas were found in need of repair or replacement:
1. The resting perch for a tiger named Malina is broken and requires repair or replacement.
2. The hotwires for 4 enclosures housing 6 black bears (Gabby and Gunther, Cody, Bart and Heather, and
Smokey) are not functional. The facility Director stated during the inspection that they are aware of the problem and
it is on their list to correct this item.
3. Structural support poles for 3 cougar enclosures (housing Freddie, Lincoln, and Callie) have come loose from
the roof of the enclosures. The poles are lying in the enclosures currently.
4. The resting perch for two lions named LuLu and Lexus are broken and require repair or replacement.
All of these areas are in need of repair or replacement. They are all areas of potential injury or escape. The facility
must ensure that all animal enclosures are maintained to adequately contain the animals and protect them from
injury.
Correct by: May 11, 2015 for hotwire, July 1, 2015 for all other items.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** There are piles of spent bedding and animal waste in the pathways between rows of enclosures and near theprimary enclosure den boxes for many of the big cats and bears. The facility Director stated that during the winter
shelter boxes were cleaned and these piles accumulated. There is also a rodent problem at this facility with rodent
holes and live rodents observed during this inspection near the tiger, lion, and bear enclosures. This spent bedding
and animal waste must be removed and a process designed to remove and dispose of waste as cleaning is being
performed. There is also a very large pile of spent bedding and waste in a collection area that the facility Director
stated they are waiting to have picked up. This waste disposal system must be improved to decrease potential
disease hazards and to combat the current rodent problem at the facility.
***A large burn pile is present near the bear enclosures and back area housing cattle. This burn pile was
smoldering during the inspection. The facility Director stated that the employees have been instructed to no longer
use this area for burning. Smoke from this burning has the potential to harm the animals in the area in addition to
potential spreading of fire if this area is not monitored closely while burning. Another location away from the
animals must be selected if the facility chooses to continue burning trash as a means of waste disposal. Local and
state requirements must also be followed. Correct this by halting any future burning in this area and removing the
current large pile of waste from this area.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The enclosure for 2 lions named Brutus and Otis is excessively muddy. An approximately 4 foot area of ground
on the both the left and right sides of the enclosure has standing water and is filled with mud. The center area of
the enclosure does allow the animals access to a dry area. This enclosure requires additional drainage or
substrate to ensure the animals can remain dry in all seasons and also to satisfy accepted drainage requirements.
Standing water can also be a breeding ground for insects. Correct this by providing proper drainage to this and all
animal enclosures.

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The perimeter fence is currently inadequate and does not function as a secondary containment system. Although
an 8 ft. high perimeter fence is present surrounding the facility, there were several large mature trees within 3 feet of
the perimeter fence that had no preventives to stop an animal from climbing the trees and leaping over the
perimeter fence. Several areas behind big cat and bear enclosures have excessive overgrowth of weeds and smalltrees/vines making it difficult to inspect these areas for structural soundness. Additionally, there are areas where
excess items including building materials and other miscellaneous items are being stored near the perimeter fence
creating a potential (cid:28)step(cid:29) for animals to get over the fence. The presence of these materials near the fencing
effectively reduces the height of the perimeter fence. A perimeter fence that is maintained in good repair and not
less than 8 feet in height is required for all outdoor housing facilities that maintain dangerous animals. Perimeter
fencing protects the animals in the facility by ensuring in the event of an escape there is a secondary containment
mechanism to prevent the animal from leaving the property and endangering the public. Correct by removing all
building materials and other debris that are in close proximity to the perimeter fence and altering trees in a manner
to ensuring the perimeter fence can adequately function as a secondary containment system. A thorough
inspection of the entire perimeter fence by the facility to document and create a plan to correct them is also
required.
Correct by: June1, 2015 for items stored by fence, removing excess brush, and creating a plan. November 1, 2015

3.129(a)
FEEDING.
*** This facility does not have a process to properly thaw frozen meat being fed to the animals. During this
inspection, two small non-functioning freezers were found with meat being thawed inside them. One freezer
contained a space heater that was not on at the time which the facility Director stated was used in the winter to
warm the unplugged freezer to thaw meat. A functional system to properly thaw the frozen meat must be devised.
The use of small functional freezers is one option if a control device is utilized to maintain proper thawing
temperatures. Incorrect thawing procedures can negatively affect quality and nutritive value of the meat. Correct
this by developing and incorporating a system to properly thaw meat.

SANITATION.
*** Two primary enclosures housing tigers named Jax and Spike have excessive piles of feces in them. Bacteria
and fungus may grow in the excessive feces in addition to the potential for fly infestation should these piles remain.
These and all animal enclosures must be cleaned often enough to reduce potential disease hazards and to satisfy
accepted husbandry standards. These enclosures must be cleaned and maintained on a more frequent basis.
Correct: May 13, 20153.131(d)
SANITATION.
A large number of rodent holes were found throughout the facility, especially near the lion, tiger, and bear
enclosures. There is a waste disposal concern currently where spent bedding is being maintained immediately
next to or in close proximity to the den boxes for the animals, which is contributing to this problem. Rodent bait
boxes are present throughout the facility but significant rodent activity is still present. The presence of these
mammalian pests is a potential disease hazard to the animals as these rodents can be carriers of disease and
parasites. An effective pest control program must be established to ensure control of these mammalian pests.
