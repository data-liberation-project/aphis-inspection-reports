PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
This licensee primarily maintains free ranging breeding colonies of ring tailed lemurs on an island. Reviewing
medical records showed this past June and July, the Windmill group had 4 infants go missing over a period of
several weeks. Then on 7-26-15, the mother of two of the missing infants was missing and then found dead, with
only bones left. At this same time, juvenile great horned owls were heard and seen in the Windmill group area. The
lemurs exhibited fearful behaviors, staring often at the sky and not coming down from the trees when the food truck
arrived. Because the caretakers believed the owls were snatching the infants, they started locking the lemurs into
the backup enclosures at night to decrease predation chances. The caretakers also stopped feeding the lemurs on
the five foot tall platform perches, as these are easily available to aerial predators. On August 25, 2015, the
caretakers received orders to not lock the Windmill group in at night and to continue feeding on the platforms.
Although the caretakers did this (and there were not additional missing lemurs), they are under the order to not lock
the lemurs in to the backups at night should an aerial predator become a hazard again.
Although these free ranging lemurs cannot be fully protected from injuries and predators all of the time in a
situation where the enclosure is an island, there are measures that can be taken when necessary which can
decrease the chances of predators killing the lemurs. Locking the lemurs in the backups whenever aerial predators
are detected is one such measure. The attending veterinarian told the caretakers to do this. Other predator
deterrents are being attempted, but unless the veterinarian dictates otherwise, the caretakers should lock up the
lemurs when necessary and be allowed to feed in safer areas in order to prevent unwanted animals from having
physical contact with the lemurs. To be corrected from this time forward.
During this inspection, at least one male lemur was under treatment for being bitten by a free ranging lemur who
tried to reach the lemur in the cage. The caged lemur suffered an injury to its finger because the lemurs could have
contact through the coated one inch mesh wire. This animal is with a group in an enclosure which is not double
wired (or otherwise built) to prevent unwanted animal contact. There have been other instances of this happening
in the past, but due to new social groupings, there are more lemurs in enclosures than have been in the past.
Enclosures need to be constructed or modified in order to keep unwanted animals, including other lemurs, from
having contact with the enclosed lemurs, in order to prevent injuries. To be corrected by 1-31-16.
