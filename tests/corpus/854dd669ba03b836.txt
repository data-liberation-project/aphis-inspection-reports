SANITATION.
There was one raised enclosure with solid flooring housing one adult and two young rabbits. The enclosure had an
excessive amount of excreta so there were very few areas of the floor not covererd with feces. A build up of feces
poses a health risk for the animals. The licensee must ensure that the rabbit enclosures are kept reasonably free of
excreta by periodic cleaning. This non-compliant item was corrected at the time of inspection.
The inspection and an exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
