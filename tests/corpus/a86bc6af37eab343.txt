SANITATION.
The cage housing the coati was in need of cleaning. There was old food materials, dried fecal matter, and bedding
on the floor of the enclosure. There was enough vertical space, structures (platforms, benches, and branches), that
the coati was not in contact with the floor of the cage.
The cage housing the bushbaby in the boarding area of the store was in need of cleaning. The trays beneath the
wire flooring were full of old bedding, food materials, and moisture. The bushbaby was not in direct contact with the
trays.
Cages need to be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize disease, and to
reduce odors. There needs to be a regular cleaning schedule in place to maintain clean cages for all the animals in
the store.

3.131(c)SANITATION.
The floor of the boarding area in the store was covered with old wood shavings around, beneath, and in front of the
animal cages. It appears that the cages had been cleaned but the floor had not been swept and old bedding
removed form the area. The area was also cluttered with open bags containing bedding and dry food, and cleaning
equipment. The floor in this area needs to be swept and clutter removed to facilitate a clean area for the animals,
reduce odor, and eliminate areas for pest to hide. A regular program of cleaning and sweeping the floor and
elimination of materials that are not needed in the area to reduce clutter needs to be in place and maintained.

SEPARATION.
There was an enclosure in be boarding area of the store that housed several degu. One animal appeared to have
small areas of hair missing around the ears and top of head. These areas looked like potential bites indicating
fighting.
There were no open wounds or cuts. Store personnel had seen some aggressive behavior but was not aware of
the bite areas. It was asked that the animal with the bite areas on the head be placed in a separate enclosure and
this was done at the time of this inspection.
Animals housed together must be compatible to reduce the risk of fighting which may result in injury and undo
stress on the animals housed together.
Animals housed in groups need to be observed daily for any signs of over aggression and if such behavior is
noticed animals must be separated to protect them form each other.
