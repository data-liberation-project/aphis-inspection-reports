3.1(c) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
There was rust, sharp points, and unsealed wood in some of the enclosures. Four metal wire crates in the puppy building
had pitted, flaking rust on at least 50% of the doors and front panels of the crates. Multiple chain link outdoor enclosures
had pitted flaking rust on the doors and along the bottom of the walls of the enclosures. A few of the horizontal bars along
the bottom of the walls of the enclosures were severely rusted and broken, exposing sharp edges that could injure the
dogs. The chain link on the front one kennel door was broken, and there were some sharp wire points. Unpainted wood
had been installed in a few kennels along the bottom of the walls to cover up rusted areas of chain link and tin. The
unpainted wood was approximately 8 inches tall and 1-2 inches thick, and some areas were discolored with green moss.
Surfaces in enclosures that are in poor repair, of poor strength, or that have sharp points or edges may injure dogs.
Unpainted wood and severely rusted metal may harbor germs that can make dogs sick.
Correct by September 1, 2021 by maintaining surfaces in good repair to protect animals from injury and so that surfaces
can be cleaned and sanitized.

Watering
An adult female white and tan dachshund named Chloe (#983000320260225) was in an enclosure with her nursing
puppies. The enclosure contained a water bowl that was empty. When Chloe was placed outside in an exercise pen and
provided with water, she drank eagerly for 30 seconds, returning to the bowl later to drink more later on. No signs of
dehydration were observed in the animal.
Dogs who do not have continuous access to drinking water may experience thirst, dehydration, or discomfort. Lactating
(nursing) dogs require more drinking water in order to produce milk for their puppies.
Correct by 7/1/21 providing potable drinking water at all times to dogs, this dog was provided with water at the time of
inspection.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
One bag of unopened dog food in the dog food storage area had an approximately 2 inch circular hole in the side of the
bag. The edges of the hole were irregular and tattered. There were a small number of rodent droppings on the floor in the
storage area. One live rodent was observed in an animal housing area.
Rodents can carry diseases that are harmful to dogs. Rodents can contaminate or ruin animal feed and bedding.
Correct by August 1, 2021 by maintaining an effective program for control of pests.
