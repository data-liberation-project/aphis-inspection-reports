FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that the Jacob sheep enclosure was in need of attention. The front, right
corner, across from the newly constructed rabbit exhibit had a section of wire mesh that was detaching from the
bottom wood rail. This now exposed jagged edges. To ensure that the sheep will be contained and cannot be
injured on this mesh it will need to be addressed.

SANITATION.
While conducting this inspection it was noted that the bison and cattle shelter was in need of attention. There
appears to be an accumulation of manure, hay, and mud present. There was also a board lying across the bottom
of the doorway. To ensure that the animals have access to a clean and dry shelter, this area will need to be
thoroughly cleaned.
