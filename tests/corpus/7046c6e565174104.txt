PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
** The hamadryas baboons entrance into their primary enclosure was constructed with a sheet of wood. There is a
cut out in the wood to only allow one baboon to shift at a time which makes it safer to shift the animals. The
baboons are chewing the wood and, the surface of the wood is worn and jagged. The entrance materials shall be
designed of suitable materials for these animals and need to be repaired and/or replaced.
**The hinges on several nonhuman primates primary enclosures (hamadryas baboon and white-throated capuchin)
on the back of their night houses are rusted. These hinges need to be replaced and or repaired to maintain its
structural integrity and contain the animals.
The primary enclosure must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound
for the species of nonhuman primates contained in them. Correct by June 11, 2015
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the curator and Director.
