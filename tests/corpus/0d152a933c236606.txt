2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* The total adult dog count in the kennel was 219. The Dogs on Hand (APHIS form 7009) only had 79 adult dogs
listed. There was missing information for the adult dogs for numerous blocks throughout the form.
Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with
certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two dog door inserts are excessively chewed along the sides and exposing bare wood under the plastic in areas.
There are gaps in some of the inserts corners. The inserts were located to the right of the entry door of the
Breeding House Kennel. These surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Therefore, increasing the
disease potential for the four adult dogs housed in these enclosures. All surfaces must have maintenance on a
regular basis. This will allow for properly cleaning and sanitization of the surfaces reducing the disease potential.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* To the right of the entry door for the Breeding House Kennel, six enclosures have an accumulation of brown grime
on the walls, floors, dog doors and door inserts. This indicates that daily-spot cleaning is not taking place. Without
daily-spot cleaning and sanitization, waste can accumulate and increase the disease hazards for the 12 adult dogs. All surfaces must be spot-cleaned and sanitized when necessary to reduce the disease hazards for the dogs.

3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Three enclosures on the west side of the Breeding House Kennel, housing six adult dogs, have vinyl wire gates.
The vinyl wire is broken in areas along the bottom of the gates where it fastens to the PVC pipe framing. The
broken areas have sharp points protruding into the enclosure. These sharp points were located at a low level where
the dogs could possibly get injured from them. All enclosures must be maintained, so there are no sharp points that
could injure the dogs.

3.6(a)(2)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Six enclosures on the west side of the Breeding House Kennel, housing 20 adult dogs, have gates with vinyl wire
attached to PVC pipe framing. The vinyl wire is not secured to the PVC pipe framing along the bottom of the gates.
The vinyl wire is broken and rusted apart in areas, along the bottom. The vinyl wire is bowing inward approximately
½ to 1 inch along the bottom. This indicates the enclosures do not have regular maintenance. The dogs could be
injured by trying to escape or getting tangled in the wire. All enclosures must be constructed or maintained to
provide protection from injury for the dogs.

3.6(c)(1)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* The following is the measurement of two adult dogs:
1. A Yorkshire Terrier (I.D# 092548112) measured 16 inches. (16 inches + 6 X 16 inches + 6= 484 inches/ 144 =
3.36 square feet).
2. A Yorkshire Terrier housed with the other dog (not identified) measured 16 inches. (16 inches +6 X 16 inches + 6= 484 inches/ 144 = 3.36 square feet.).
100 percent required total space for these dogs is 968 inches/ 144 = 6.72 square feet.
The enclosure is (24 inches X 30 inches) allowing for 720 square inches/ 144 = 5 square feet of total space.
Therefore, 248 inches or 1.72 square feet of additional space is required. All dogs must be provided with the
required amount of floor space to comply with the regulations, allow for proper exercise and socialization.
