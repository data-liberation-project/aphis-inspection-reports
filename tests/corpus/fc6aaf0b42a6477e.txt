2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There was not an identifiable attendant present at all times where the public is allowed to feed the giraffes. Upon
arrival to the exhibit at 2:10pm, the inspector observed there were no employees present at all. During this time, the
VMO witnessed several instances where members of the public (at least five personally owned vehicles) were able
to drive up to the feeding exhibit without an attendant or employee available. One vehicle was seen where a child
was leaning its body out of the rear window for a closer view of the animals. When asked how the park staff
oversees the giraffe feeding exhibit, the facility representative confirmed there are no staff members assigned to this
feeding exhibit.
The absence of a readily identifiable employee or attendant endangers the safety, health, and well-being of both the
animals and general public when public contact is not overseen at all times.
The licensee must have a responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable attendant present in this area at all
times.
To be corrected by close of business today, August 13, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
