Item IACUC 2.31 e 3
At the time of inspection bat protocol 15-10450 was reviewed. The protocol involves breeding of bats, the protocol
does not mention how the investigator intends to monitor the breeding of the animals as well as reporting any other
issues involving the care and use of animals to the IACUC.
In addition a request by the USDA VMO to review the records of the 5 bats reported on the annual report could not
be accomplished, as there were no records available for the USDA to review.
The IACUC needs have the investigator supply the updated information for the protocol and maintain records for the
animals.
