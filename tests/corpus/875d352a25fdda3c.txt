FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the isolation area, in the pen housing four adult goats and their six kids, there was a wire fence panel at the back
of the enclosure that had a gap between it and the wall behind it. The height of the wire panel and the spacing
between it and the wall was such that it could pose a risk of a goat getting stuck or getting its head or a leg stuck.
The gap poses a potential risk of injury to the goats. The wire panel placement should be fixed or the panel should
be removed to prevent possible injury of the animals.
In the enclosure housing eight bison there is a shed with two metal bumper-type railings attached to the posts on
either side. On one side it was observed that the lower railing attached to only three posts and the end of the railing
stopped halfway between the third and fourth posts creating a gap. The end of the railing looked sharp and had
pointed edges. The upper railing on the same side ended between the first and second posts leaving a gap in a
similar manner. It was also near eye level of the bison. The exposed ends of the railings could potentially pose a
risk of injury to the bison if they run into the sharp ends or trip on the lower rung. The railings attached to the shed
posts should be modified, repaired or replaced so that there are no sharp or pointed ends that might injure the
bison.
3.129 REPEAT
FEEDING.
There is a public feeding tube provided at the bear enclosure housing the four bears. The tube is a white PVC pipe
in which the public is allowed to drop food to feed the bears. The inside surface of the pipe has a buildup of food
residue or grime that will contaminate food delivered through the tube. Contamination poses a health risk. All food
receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary to prevent contamination and protect the health of the bears.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Parts of the bobcat enclosure have not been adequately cleaned. A shelter structure (blue plastic barrel) in the
enclosure housing three bobcats appeared dirty and had brown smears and streaks on large areas of the shelter.Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and minimize disease
hazards.
