****Cleaning.
The floor under the puppy enclosures there was a build up of feces, urine, and food. Some of the food under these
enclosures was moldy. There was also dirt and grime hanging from the underside of the flooring. The washdowns
under the dogs in the whelping portion of the facility had a brown liquid paste built up along the entire washdown.

sanitized properly or often enough increase the risk of disease transmission to the dogs. The licensee must ensure
all surfaces in contact with the dogs are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks. The
licensee must ensure all other surfaces of housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy
generally accepted husbandry standards.The veterinary care NCI from the July 6, 2016 report for dog 330 has been addressed.
