ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1200 on
31-Aug-16.
Inspector rang the doorbell and knocked at the door, honked vehicle horn twice and waited. Called number on
file and reached the licensee who stated she was out of town and the animal caretaker had already been there. She
let me know when she would be back and I left the facility.
