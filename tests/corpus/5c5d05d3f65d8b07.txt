ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male Shih Tzu with microchip number 106800831 had wet fur around its mouth. The front teeth, canine teeth and
cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth had a dark brown material on the surface of the teeth. There was a grayish
colored creamy material extended along the line where the teeth meet the gums.
These signs are consistent with the presence of dental disease. Dental disease can be painful and lead to a
decreased appetite and systemic health problems. The licensee must, in consultation with the facility veterinarian,
appropriately address the dental health of this dog and develop and maintain a preventative dental program to be
included in the facility's program of veterinary care. Correct by March 6, 2014.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the owner.
