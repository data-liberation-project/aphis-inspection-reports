2.31(b)(3)(ii)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Between March 2016 and February 2017 the IACUC held six meetings. The unaffiliated member was not present
for four of those meetings. In addition, the unaffiliated member was not involved in either of the two semi-annual
facility inspections and program reviews conducted by IACUC members during those 12 months. The lack of
participation of an unaffiliated IACUC member in IACUC meetings and semi-annuals means that there is a lack of
general community interest being represented on the committee regarding proper care and treatment of animals at
the facility. The IACUC, when conducting business required under the Animal Welfare Act, shall include at least one
member unaffiliated with the facility. Correct by April 2017.
2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC meeting minutes state that a semi-annual facility inspection and program review were conducted in
September 2016. However, there is no written evaluation report of the findings submitted to the Institutional Official
as required. The evaluation report must contain all required information about the inspection and review findings,
include any minority views and be signed by a majority of the IACUC members. The semi-annual evaluation report
functions as method for the IACUC to notify the Institutional Official of the status of the animal care and use
program at the facility. The facility shall ensure that the IACUC completes an evaluation report to the Institutional
Official upon completion of the required semiannual evaluations. Correct from this day forward.
Facility inspection conducted with vet techs.
Records inspection and exit interview conducted with undersigned facility representative.
