3.3(e)(i)
The floor of the kennel building, where 14 dogs and 5 puppies were housed, consisted of unsealed concrete which was
not impervious to moisture. In three kennels, there were wet areas on the floor under the automatic water drinkers (wet
areas were approximately 1-foot diameter in size). The licensee stated that the concrete floor was not sealed, but that the
floor contained a hot water heating system and that as a result the floor dried quickly when wet.

The walls of two enclosures, located near the front entrance to the building, were made up partly of uncovered and
unsealed plywood. The kennel containing 5 cocker spaniel puppies and their dam had an uncovered plywood wall on one
side. The adjacent kennel, housing an adult light brown miniature poodle, had plywood walls on two sides; the plywood
wall containing the dog door was dark colored and mildly warped along its base consistent with previous water damage.
The licensee stated that these plywood walls were not impervious to moisture and she avoided spraying them during
cleaning because they would get wet.

Surfaces that absorb moisture cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, and may harbor odors, organic debris, or bacteria
which may negatively impact the health and well-being of dogs in the enclosure.



Correct by housing dogs and puppies in enclosures in which the floors, walls, boxes, houses, dens, and other hard
surfaces in contact with the animals are impervious to moisture. Correct by December 1st, 2020.

Health certification and identification.
The licensee did not have copies of health certificates for any dogs sold in the last year. The licensee stated that she only
obtains health certificates for dogs that she ships via air, not for those she delivers herself via ground. The licensee stated
that she drives dogs directly to buyers and routinely meets buyers at locations outside of Alabama. The licensee stated
that she does not obtain health certificates for these dogs.

Examination of dogs and puppies by a licensed veterinarian within 10 days prior to transportation in commerce is
important for identifying any infectious diseases or physical abnormalities in the animal that may endanger the animal,
other animals, or the public.

Correct on October 21st, 2020, by obtaining veterinary examination and health certificate for dogs transported in
commerce.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
