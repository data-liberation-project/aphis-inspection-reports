ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1210 on
10-Jul-18. We went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one answered the door. I honked the car
horn and then called the licensee. I left her a message. We then waited for a half hour. No one called back. We
then left the property.
Note: An Animal Care Intern was with a for a ride-along on this inspection.
End of report.
