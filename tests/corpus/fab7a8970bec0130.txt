2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
In April 2021, a rabbit on study was found entrapped in an e-collar. Review of the incident revealed that the animal had
been observed by research staff that morning. The animal was recorded as “healthy” at the time of that observation, but it
was discovered 1 hour and 22 minutes later entrapped in the collar and in distress. The attending veterinarian was
notified.
The entrapment had resulted in a laceration and swelling of the muzzle of the animal, causing narrowing of the animal's
airway leading to respiratory distress. On exam, the animal was cyanotic and had lost 27% of its body weight. Facility
representatives note that the extent of the injury and the weight loss was such that it was unlikely to have occurred in the
82 minutes between clinical observation by designated research staff and observation of the animal in distress by the
veterinary staff. Accurate information about the condition of the animal at the time of the initial observation was not
recorded or conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
Daily observation of animals to assess their health and well-being may be conducted by someone other than the
attending veterinarian provided that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health is conveyed to the
attending veterinarian.


This incident was identified by the facility and corrective measures had been implemented prior to this inspection. To
remain corrected from this date forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
