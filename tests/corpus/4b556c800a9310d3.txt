ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:38am on
06-Jan-20.
Drove up to the brick residence on the licensee's property and beeped my car horn twice. Called the licensee and
left message on voicemail. Additionally, walked up to residence and knocked loudly on front door. Called the
licensee again after waiting 45 minutes and no answer.
