3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
In the outside portion of the sheltered facility at least two enclosures had excessive fecal build up on the flooring. The
licensee stated they were last cleaned 2 days ago. A build up of feces is a disease hazard and can attract pest. The
licensee must ensure all surfaces which come in contact with the dogs are spot cleaned daily.
To be corrected by: April 13, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
