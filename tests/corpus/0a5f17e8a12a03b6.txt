Facilities, general.
-There is a platform for the primary enclosure for approximately 12 goats housed next to the single male production pig
with 3 nail heads sticking up approximately an inch.
-The primary enclosure for the Boer goats has a platform that has one leg chewed, and has a large crack through the leg.
-The shelter in the primary enclosure for approximately 6 goats in the back pasture is in disrepair. The back of the shelter
is bowed out leaving at gap at the corner, and there is a board missing at the top of the back wall. In this same enclosure
there are 4 nail heads sticking out of a board approximately 2-3". One of the goats was standing on the fence with its
front legs, and the goats head was right next to the nail heads.
-The shelter in the primary enclosure for the single male sheep is in disrepair. There is a hole in the front of the shelter,
and several boards missing from the side of the shelter.
All housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury

3.127(b) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.

-The 3 cows housed together on the right side of the back pasture had one shelter, with a roof and one wall, that had
thick, wet, muck 3-4" thick. The other shelter in the enclosure had no boards until approximately 16" from the ground, and
a gap at the top of 1' to 3' on three sides. This shelter also contained several inches of wet muck and no bedding. Mud
was noted up the legs and on the belly of these three cows.
-The primary enclosure for the two cows housed together in the back pasture had gaps of 1-3' at the top of the enclosure,
and several inches of mud with no bedding.
The temperature with the wind-chill ranged from 22 degrees F to 30 degrees F.
Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all
animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.
Sufficient shelter must be provided to the animals to prevent cold wind, and precipitation from entering the shelter, and
sufficient bedding to provide comfort from the cold ground.
3.127(c) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The primary enclosure for the 3 cows housed together on the right side of the back pasture, the primary enclosure for the
2 cows housed together in the back pasture,
the primary enclosure for the single housed male sheep, and the two male goats housed together have excessive
amounts of mud/muck in their enclosures. These animals do not have free access to food, water, and/or shelter without
having to walk through several inches of mud. Mud was noted on these animals legs, and up to the abdomen on the 3
cows housed together.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water.
An effective method must be provided to eliminate excess water so that animals have access to food, water and shelter

without traversing mud, and to ensure the animals are not soiled by the mud. This cold mud/muck can be a disease
vector, and cause the animals discomfort from the cold.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
There is an excessive amount of excreta on the platforms for the Boer goats.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
Clean primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent disease hazard and odor.
