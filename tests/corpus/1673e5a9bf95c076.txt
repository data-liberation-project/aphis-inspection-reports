2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Upon review of the facility's program of veterinary care it was noted that the veterinarian who had signed the
program of veterinary care was different from the veterinarian currently perfoming site visits and providing hands-on
treatment of animals. These veterinarians do not practice at the same business. A third exotics veterinarian at a
separate business is often consulted by phone when regulated animals become ill. It is important for the
veterinarian performing site visits and providing direct care to the animals to sign and approve the program of
veterinary care. This ensures that the attending veterinarian and licensee have a mutual understanding of what care
is to be routinely provided for regulated animals and when a veterinarian should be consulted in case of illness. Site
visits are to be performed and program of veteirnary care approved by the site veterinarian at least once per year to
ensure that it is up to date and reflective of current veterinary practice standards for regulated species. Correct by

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
A conversation with the licensee revealed two missing records. Three Nilgai ( Boselaphus tragocamelus) were sold
at an exotic animal auction in 2013. There was no record of this transaction available for review at inspection. One
male Dik Dik was also given away in 2013 to an individual. There was no record of this transaction available for
review at inspection. Keeping complete records of acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of exotic animals facilitates
tracking of these animals in case of disease outbreak. Records of acquisition and disposition of animals also enable
detection of unlicensed activity by buyers and sellers. Records containing the name, address, and USDA license
number (where applicable) of the buyer and seller shall be kept for any animals acquired, sold or given away.
