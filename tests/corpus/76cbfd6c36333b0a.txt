2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two female Zebu, Jeannie (DOB 1993) and Cassie (DOB 1994, #19), have excessively overgrown hooves. The
hooves have become so long that they are curling upwards at the ends. The licensee stated that the hooves of the
Zebu are trimmed once a year. Hooves that have become extremely long can cause pain and discomfort to the
animal as well as affect the animal's natural gait. These Zebu cows must have their hooves trimmed to an
acceptable length. The licensee must establish a hoof trimming schedule that ensures the hooves of all hoof stock
are kept at an appropriate length in order to promote their health and well-being.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The pasture housing five camels has a separate fenced area that contains the shelter and water source. The
camels must walk through an open gate to access the shelter/water source area. The ground in the gate area is
extremely muddy and has multiple standing puddles of water on it. Improper drainage can cause the animals to
become wet and soiled which could negatively impact their health and well-being.
A suitable method must be established to rapidly eliminate any excess water. The licensee must establish a
method for quickly eliminating the standing puddles of water in the gate area of the camel enclosure. The licensee
must ensure that standing water is rapidly eliminated from all animal enclosures.
