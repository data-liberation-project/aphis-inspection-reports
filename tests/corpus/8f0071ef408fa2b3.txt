2.31(b)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The sole appointed unaffiliated member of the IACUC has not attended or participated in an IACUC meeting since
January 12, 2017. Engagement with the IACUC by the unaffiliated member during this time has been minimal and
primarily limited to email feedback on a protocol amendment.
The mandatory appointment of an unaffiliated member to the IACUC is intended to provide representation for
general community interests in the care and use of animals under the Animal Welfare Act. Participation and
engagement with the committee by the community member is paramount to fulfilling the intended function of the
appointment.
The lack of community representation was identified by the IACUC at the December 2018 meeting and
subsequently reported to the IO. The appointment of a new unaffiliated member is anticipated.
Correct by: Next scheduled IACUC meeting.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the director.
