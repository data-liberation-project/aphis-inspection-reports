Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. The licensee must follow all preventive care
recommendations of the attending veterinarian in order to ensure the best health of the dogs at the facility. Review the
program of veterinary care with the veterinarian and follow all directions contained in the PVC.
