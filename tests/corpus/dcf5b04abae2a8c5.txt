INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semi-annual reports submitted to the Institutional Officer for the past year have not been signed by a majority of
the IACUC members. Without this documentation, it cannot be verified the IACUC has reviewed and approved of
the contents of these evaluations. A system should be in place to ensure this is completed semi-annually as
required.
With respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall prepare reports of
its evaluations of their program and facilities and submit the reports to the Institutional Official. The reports shall be
reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members and must include any minority views.

There are 2 Principal Investigators (PI)/ Instructors teaching courses that engage in covered activities. Their names
have not been included to the approved protocols that correspond to the courses.

are conducting the covered activities, and that they have been reviewed and approved by the IACUC before these
activities have started.
In order to approve proposed activities or proposed significant changes in ongoing activities, the IACUC shall
conduct a review of those components of the activities related to the care and use of animals and determine that the
proposed activities are in accordance with this subchapter unless acceptable justification for a departure is
presented in writing.
