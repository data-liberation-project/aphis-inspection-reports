Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Yorkshire terrier (tag #189, microchip #3725) has poor dental health and an abnormal condition of the skin. A
thick buildup of dark brown tartar is encasing nearly the entire surface of the upper right canine tooth. The tooth is loose
and moved easily when gentle pressure was applied by the inspector. The gums are slightly reddened and have receded
away from this tooth.. The lower left canine tooth is encased in a thick buildup of dark brown tartar, hair and light colored
creamy substance. The upper molars on both sides of the mouth are also encased in a buildup of brown tartar. The
licensee last cleaned the teeth in January and has not identified the current condition of the dog’s teeth and no treatment
has been provided or is scheduled to be provided.

This dog also has numerous areas of scab-like material on the surface of the skin. Several areas of the scabby material
are located along the right shoulder and the licensee pulled the material off exposing some small open wounds that began
to bleed. Along the dog’s left flank are several areas of scabby brown material. The material is concentrated into
perpendicular lines and the licensee began pulling the material off exposing raw skin beneath. The licensee was
unaware of the dog’s skin condition and the animal has received no treatment.

Female Yorkshire terrier (tag #024) has poor dental health. An upper left cheek tooth is loose and moved easily when

gentle pressure was applied by the inspector. The upper right canine tooth and the adjacent upper front tooth are both
encased in a buildup of dark brown tartar and the gums surrounding the canine tooth are moderately reddened. A line of
grey substance is located along the top of the upper molars on both side of the mouth. The licensee last cleaned the
teeth in January and has not identified the current condition of the dog’s teeth and no treatment has been provided or is
scheduled to be provided.

Female Yorkshire terrier (tag #176) has poor dental health. The majority of the teeth on both sides of the mouth are
missing and the remaining lower left cheek tooth is loose and moved easily when gentle pressure was applied by the
inspector. Blood is located along the base of this tooth. The licensee last cleaned the teeth in January and has not
identified the current condition of the dog’s teeth and no treatment has been provided or is scheduled to be provided.

Poor dental health and abnormal conditions of the skin could cause pain and discomfort as well as lead to further health
issues.

The above mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an
effective treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that each dog receives adequate veterinary care at all times.

Housing facilities, general.
The enclosures are constructed of wire panels. A broken wire is located on the gate of the outdoor portion of an
enclosure containing two adult Yorkshire terriers. The broken wire is protruding inward and the inspectors observed the
dogs touching the sharp point with their faces, chests and front feet. The licensee removed the sharp point at the time of
the inspection.


Two additional enclosures have sharp points created by the wire panel along the top of the outdoor portion of the
enclosures. The sharp points are protruding inward and are located at the level of the dogs. A total of two dogs are
housed in these affected enclosures.

In the sheltered portion of the housing facility, one plastic divider has become disconnected from the enclosure front
resulting in a gap between the enclosures. The gap is large enough that a dog could place its leg through the opening
and into the adjacent enclosure. A total of two dogs are housed in the affected enclosures.

Sharp points and gaps could cause injury to the animals.

Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury. The licensee must alter the
sharp points and gap in a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the animals. The licensee must ensure that the
enclosures are maintained in good repair and are safe for the dogs at all times.
3.1(b)

Housing facilities, general.
The housing facility has a storage cabinet which contains items used for the husbandry of the dogs including several
medical products. Two drawers containing these husbandry items also have an excessive amount of clutter. The clutter
includes a buildup of rodent feces, rusty pieces of metal and nails, screws, tools, parts for automatic waterers, used
syringes, hair, wood shavings, and debris. The buildup of clutter could result in the contamination of products used to
provide care to the dogs as well as attract pests such as rodents and insects.


Housing facilities must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste material, junk, and other discarded items. The
licensee must remove the cluttered items from the drawers and ensure that all husbandry items are stored in areas free of
clutter at all times.

Housing facilities, general.
The plastic divider of one enclosure is severely scratched and worn. One dog is housed in this affected enclosure.
Severely damaged surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which could increase the risk of disease hazards
towards the animals.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be
replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace this plastic divider or alter it in a manner that allows the surface
to be readily cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are appropriately maintained in order to
support the health and well-being of the dogs.

Watering
At least sixteen adult dogs, including one female nursing a litter of three puppies, has no potable water. The inspection
occurred after 5:30 pm, and the inspectors observed the water bowls were dry and the licensee stated that he waters the
dogs in the morning and again later in the day. The inspectors requested that the licensee provide the dogs with water,
and the majority of the dogs drank immediately upon receiving water. One adult Yorkshire terrier drank continuously for 1
minute and 30 seconds whereupon the animal ran out of water and the licensee provided more. The dog then drank

continuously for another 30 seconds. Failure to provide continuous potable water may result in severe dehydration which
could have a detrimental impact on the health of the animal.

Potable water must be continuously available for dogs. The licensee must ensure that each dog is provided with potable
water at all times in order to support their health and well-being.

To be corrected by: The licensee provided each dog with water at the time of the inspection.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee's Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete and is missing the schedule of administration for several
vaccinations that are being given to the puppies and adult dogs.

The licensee is vaccinating puppies for Distemper, Leptospirosis and Hepatitis at 6 weeks of age, but this is not noted on
the Program of Veterinary Care.

The second vaccination for Distemper, Leptospirosis, Hepatitis and Bordetella is not documented on the Program of
Veterinary Care although the licensee stated that he may occasionally retain a puppy as breeding stock.

The licensee is vaccinating adult dogs for Leptospirosis and Hepatitis yearly, but this is not noted on the Program of
Veterinary Care.

The Program of Veterinary Care must contain the schedule of administration of all vaccinations given in order for APHIS

officials to determine that adequate veterinary care is being provided.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes the vaccinations for contagious and/or deadly diseases. The licensee
must add the schedule of administration of each vaccine that is being provided to the puppies and adult dogs to the
Program of Veterinary Care. The licensee must ensure that all information contained on the Program of Veterinary Care
is complete and accurate at all times.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee had the Attending Veterinarian physically examine each dog on 06/07/21, but there is no medical record
documenting the exams and the results of the exams. Failure to document the exams interferes with APHIS officials
ability to determine if the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. The licensee
must document all required information for the physical examination of each dog. The licensee must ensure medical
records are kept for each animal.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
