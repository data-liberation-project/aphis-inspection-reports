MISCELLANEOUS.
In June of this year, it was reported that one rabbit experienced an injury during an oral gavage dosing session.
The animal was noted by the dosing biologist to have impaired use of rear limbs following the oral gavage dosing.
The veterinary staff was immediately alerted and the animal examined, where it was observed and documented that
the rabbit was weak in the rear limbs. The animal was euthanized due to its condition and a necropsy was
performed. The incident triggered an alert to the management of the institution, whereupon it was decided to
conduct re-training for all technicians on rabbit handling.
Every interaction between humans and animals poses some degree of risk of physical injury, distress, and other
harm to all parties involved. Therefore, handling of animals must be conducted as carefully as possible in a manner
that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
This incident was thoroughly investigated by the IACUC and corrective actions were taken starting within one week
of the occurrence.
Correct from this time forward.
The physical inspection and records review was conducted on 28-30 June with the IACUC Administrator, Attending
Veterinarian, and Animal Husbandry staff by Mike Neafsey, VMO, and Kathy Campitelli, VMO. The exit interview
was conducted on 30 June with the aforementioned personnel and the Global Director for Preclinical Lab Animal
Medicine and other management staff.
