2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female, black pig, Penelope, had noticeably overgrown hooves on her back feet. Both outer hooves were elongated,
abnormally curved and each had a visible crack on the tops of these hooves. This animal did not appear to have any
lameness or gait abnormalities at time of this inspection. The overgrowth of hooves may cause pain, discomfort and lead
to injuries or lameness if not appropriately addressed. The facility must establish and maintain an adequate program of
veterinary care that includes a timely schedule of hoof trimming and care.
