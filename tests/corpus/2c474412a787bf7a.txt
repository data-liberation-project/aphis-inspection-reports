Sanitation.
The coati mundi's have dug holes under the concrete barrier in front of the shelter box and next to the wall in the front
section of the exhibit. These holes may trap excreta, food and debris making cleaning difficult. They also serve as a
habitat for rodents. These areas must be corrected and the floor maintained to facilitate cleaning and husbandry .
