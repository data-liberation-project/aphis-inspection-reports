SANITATION.
The current pest control program is not safe and effective to control of insects and mammalian pests.
The food storage room has an excessive amount of rodent droppings. There was one hole in the ceiling from rats
and a hole located on top of the wood panel outside leading into this storage area. There were also roach
droppings in the kitchen area. The entrance door is not sealed and there is a small opening that has a wire grate
attached near the floor in the food storage room. The areas where roaches and rodents are entering the food
storage room and kitchen need to be sealed. There are an excessive number of rodents living on the grounds at this
facility as in the past years. Roach and rodent excreta transmission to animals and humans.can cause serious
illness and disease, so there must be an effective program that is followed and documented to minimize and control
the rodent population.
