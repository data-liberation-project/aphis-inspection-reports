Housing facilities, general.
Currently closed bags of food are stacked in the main kennel area next to miscellaneous items and cleaning supplies.
One bag was broken at the corner and food was on the floor from a dog getting a hold of the bag. Only food that is in
current use may be stored in the main kennel and once the bags are opened, the food must be stored in leakproof
containers to protect the food supplies from potential contamination. This food needs to be moved to another area for
proper storage.
