ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 130pm on
02/03/2014.
Both doors were knocked on and I waited in the drive for 30 minutes. I attempted to leave a message but the
voicemail box was full. I left a card in the door asking the licensee to call in order to determine days and times that
are better for future inspections to find the licensee and a phone number to make contact.
