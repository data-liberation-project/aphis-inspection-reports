RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The records of acquisition and disposition continue to be incomplete. Specifically, there are no records for the
disposition of kulan, arctic fox, and a Patagonian cavy. There no acquisition records for the llama, aoudads and
coati. Records of acquisitions, dispositions, and animals on hand must be kept and maintained. The records of
animals on hand are not available for review. These records must also be available for review at the time of
inspection by a USDA inspector to assist with the enforcement of the regulations and standards of the Animal
Welfare Act and to ensure the well-being of all animals at the facility.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is only a single rope barrier in front of the Nilgai and blackbuck. There is no barrier in front of the cavy
enclosure. The single rope barriers are 2-3 feet in height leaving enough space underneath for a child to pass under
or an adult to step over and come in contact with the animals. Sufficient public barriers must be in place to protect
the animals and for the safety of public. Barriers must be installed of a sufficient height and designed in a manner
that protects the animals by preventing the public from coming in direct contact.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Lion Enclosure:
Structural strength: Lion Enclosure: The enclosure is 80 feet x 70 feet and 12 feet in height with no overhang or
electric wire. The enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel
poles, 4 inches in diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest
upon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep
roots - no lower branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is
approximately 4 feet from the enclosure fence. There is now an 8 foot high tensile wire barrier fence approximately
20 feet from the front of the enclosure.
The enclosure currently houses a five (5) year old male lion and a four (4) year old female lion with limited mobility.The enclosure is 12 feet in height which is inadequate to contain a lion. Primary enclosures must be constructed in
a manner that will ensure containment of healthy big cats. Based upon known physical and behavioral
characteristics of exotic cats, the height of the enclosure must be extended at least 4 feet in height or the top of the
enclosure modified with an appropriate overhang to minimize the potential of an animal escape.
NOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014.
3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Asiatic Bear Enclosure:
***The two (2)Asiatic black bears are housed in a 20’ x 20’ x 12’ chain link enclosure with a concrete floor. Within
the enclosure there is a single tire swing and a water trough for the bears to use. At the time of inspection, the
bears were noted sitting together in a pile of substrate that was place in the left front corner of the enclosure. The
current space and structures within the enclosure provide little stimulation for bears who typically enjoy climbing and
being active in water. The enclosure needs to be of an adequate size to allow the bears to make all normal
postural adjustments and adequate water features for the bear to engage in species typical exercise and
thermoregulation. Additional space and elevated structures for climbing and resting and an appropriate water
feature should be added to the enclosure to allow the animals to demonstrate species typical behavior and to
improve their psychological well-being.
NOTE: Progress has been made on the construction of the new bear enclosure. Upon completion the bear
enclosure will provide additional space and structures to encourage species typical behavior.
Tiger Enclosure:
***The three (3) tigers are housed in a 30’ x 40’ x 10’ closed top enclosure with a dirt and gravel and a single
elevated structure. No water feature is available for swim-like activity. No changes have been to the enclosure
since the last inspection that would increase the size of the enclosure or that would allow the tigers to demonstrate
more species typical behavior. Tigers often engage in running, climbing, jumping, and water play. Tigers should be
housed in an enclosure with adequate space and structures that allows them to engage in natural behaviors. The
current enclosure must be modified or husbandry practices adjusted in a manner that will allow the tigers to jump,
climb, run and engage in water activities to improve their level of activity and to prevent abnormal behavior patterns.
NOTE: Work on the construction of the new enclosure has not progressed since the last inspection due to other
projects and weather conditions.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses approximately 175 regulated and non-regulated animals. There was one keeper present
performing husbandry duties during the inspection. An additional person was performing maintenance tasks. There
are now at least two staff members caring for the animals and maintaining the property six days a week. Theincrease in the number of daily employees has allowed more husbandry and housekeeping tasks to be completed.
However, there are still a number of maintenance and building projects that need to be completed. There must be a
sufficient number of employees to carry out the facility husbandry duties, repairs, and projects to maintain routine
upkeep of the facility in a timely manner for the safety and well-being the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
