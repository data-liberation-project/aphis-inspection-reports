3.2(d)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
A portion of the interior flooring of building #3 has missing floor tile. Two to Four feet of this flooring in the
sheltered/indoor housing shelter (building #3) is not impervious to moisture. These areas need to be impervious, in
order for good cleaning and sanitizing to take place. Impervious surfaces with good cleaning and sanitizing will help
this facility to be a healthier environment for dogs. The facility owner must repair/correct this un-impervious section
or sections of this floor.
