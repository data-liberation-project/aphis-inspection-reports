Structural strength: Lion Enclosure: The enclosure is 80 feet x 70 feet and 12 feet in height with no overhang or
electric wire. The enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel
poles, 4 inches in diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest
upon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep
roots - no lower branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is
approximately 4 feet from the enclosure fence. The enclosure currently houses a ~4 year old male lion and a ~ 3
year old female lion with limited mobility. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that will ensure
containment of the animal. Based upon known physical and behavioral characteristics of exotic cats, additional
containment measures must be made to the lion enclosure to prevent escape.
NOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014 and recommendations were
made.The exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
