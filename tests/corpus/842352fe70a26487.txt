2.31(d)(8)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
In April 2021, the Attending Veterinarian was reviewing surgical records of voles with telemetry devices implanted for
behavior studies. Upon reviewing the records, the Attending Veterinarian identified 11 voles that had gone through the
telemetry implant surgery from March 30th to April 2nd. According to the IACUC approved protocol, only 8 voles were
supposed to be used. The Principal Investigator had not submitted an amendment to the IACUC for this change in
animals.

Proposed activities and proposed significant changes in ongoing activities that have been approved by the IACUC may be
subject to further review and approval. Any changes in activity that involves the care and use of animals must be
approved by the IACUC.

This was corrected at the time of inspection by the Attending Veterinarian retraining the Principal Investigator and the
IACUC approving an amendment to increase animal numbers.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Attending Veterinarian.
