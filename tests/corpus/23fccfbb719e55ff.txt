FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The bottom of the entry door on the first corn crib needs repair due to the metal wire being broken where it should
connect to the bottom of the door frame. There is a patch, however the metal wire has pulled away from the patch,
causing the door frame to be weak and a possible area where the bear could work on and cause more damage.
Weak areas in the fencing and doors of the bear enclosure could be possible sources of injury due to the loose
metal and wires, or a possible location the bear could tear open enough to escape or injure itself trying to escape.
All loose and broken wires and framing should be repaired and/or replaced when it becomes rusted, weakened or
broken from the framing material or against itself. The licensee must repair/replace and weak areas in the corn cribs
that house the bears, including the bottom of the first entry door.

SANITATION.
All three corn cribs containing 3 bears are in need of waste removal and wet straw in the den of 'Pappa bear'. There
are several piles of feces in each crib that should be removed. It has been one week since the cribs have been
cleaned. Normally the cribs are cleaned 2 times per week, however this week it has been only once. The male bear
was soaked on his right side with water, due to the straw being too wet in his den from water being dumped in it, by
him the previous night.
A build up of feces, dirt, debris and web bedding in the enclosures can be a source of illness and discomfort for the
regulated animals if not removed before the buildup in a timely manner.
The licensee must increase the cleaning of the bear pens more often to prevent the buildup of feces, old food, wet
straw and debris that can cause the regulated animals discomfort or inability to move freely without coming in
contact with the debris. All wet bedding must be removed and replaced with dry.To be corrected by: February 23, 2017
