ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:45 pm on
01-Aug-18.
No one home at facility so called contact number and left a message. A cell number was provided in the greeting of
the contact number, so I called it and spoke to Mrs. Yoder. She said they were out of town and would not return
until the next evening.
