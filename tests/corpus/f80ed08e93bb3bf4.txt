3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
The Sika deer enclosure continues to have large loose sections of the fence on the back side. The licensee has
recaptured the escaped deer noted on the last inspection. Additionally, he has removed and replaced one section
previously identified on inspection reports as needing repair, however, there are still large areas which have not been
appropriately maintained. There are at least 2 remaining support posts that in poor repair and can easily be moved
easily. There are large sections of the fence that are still poorly secured and approximately 10 support posts where the
fence is no longer attached on the upper side of the post. This allows the fence to move and sway easily when touched.
There are several areas where the bottom of the fence continues to be poorly secured the ground which allows animals to
push under. The majority of the fence is still loose and composed of multiple layers of overlapping wire and sharp points
remain at the bottom where wire ends remain. With this combination of problems, animals can easily become entrapped
allowing the fence. Additionally, there is a significant risk of animal escape or ability for predators such as dogs to enter
the enclosure. Correct by ensuring that all enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to safely contain the animals.
3.127(d) Critical Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.


The facility continues to not have a perimeter fence. Several species continue to be maintained in outdoor enclosures at
the facility, this includes: Bobcat, Arctic fox, Red fox, Grey fox, Striped skunk, Fallow deer, Sika deer, Mink, Ferret,
Alpaca, and Wallaby. Given their current maintenance, the primary enclosure for the Sika deer is not effective or
customary. In the past, this enclosure has failed to contain the animals allowing two to escape. On at least two prior
occasions animals (sika deer and arctic fox) have escaped and because there is no perimeter fence, no secondary
containment was present to facilitate recapture. There are no alternative security measures in place to contain the
animals and an Administer approved variance has not been secured. Animals and unauthorized persons continue to
have easy access to the animals. Failure to have an appropriate perimeter fence may result in animal escape or other
harm to the animals such as undue stress, disease exposure, theft, injury, release, and/or death. Correct by ensuring
that outdoor housing facilities are enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. This fence must protect the animals in the facility by restricting animals from going under or
through it and prevents outside animals and persons from having contact with the animals in the facility. Additionally, it
shall act as secondary containment in the event of an escape.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
