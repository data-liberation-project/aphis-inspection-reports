2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Male Poodle with chip number 033 288 599 ("Ode" DOB 12/2008) is squinting his left eye. There is clear drainage
collecting around the left eye and eyelids. The "white of the eye" is more red on the left side when compared to the
right. There is a white color visible within the left eyeball. The licensee had not identified this problem before the
inspection and had not communicated the problem to the attending veterinarian. The program of veterinary care
does not instruct the licensee on how to address this problem. Eye problems can be caused by infection, trauma,
eyelid conformation, and other medical problems. The squinting suggests that this eye is painful.
Female Pomeranian with chip number 017 582 367 ("Princess" DOB 4/2012) has a heavy buildup of dental calculus
on all of the visible molar and premolar teeth ("cheek teeth"). On the left side there is one loose lower premolar and
one loose upper premolar. Both teeth are easily moved. The licensee had not identified this problem before the
inspection and had not communicated the problem to the attending veterinarian. The program of veterinary care
does not instruct the licensee on how to address this problem. The loose teeth indicate that there is dental disease
present in this dog. Dental disease can be painful as it can cause damage to the gum tissue, teeth, and the bone of
the jaw supporting the teeth. Dental disease can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and affect the
overall health of the animal.
The conditions of these two dogs are clearly seen and should have been observed by the licensee. The conditions
also appear to have started to be a problem well before the last daily observation. The licensee must observe all
animals at least daily to asses their health. There must also be a mechanism of direct communication that is
frequent enough so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health are conveyed to the attending
veterinarian. To be corrected by 19 Sept 2018.
2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Of the 31 adult dogs at the facility, 14 do not have identification. Proper identification is essential for tracking the
movement of animals and to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee uses microchips in the rest of the dogs
that are identified. This is one of the appropriate means of identification. The licensee must ensure that all live dogson the premises are correctly identified. To be corrected by 15 Oct 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
