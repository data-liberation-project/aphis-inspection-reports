ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Rabbit B404 underwent a surgical procedure as per IACUC approved protocol on 8/4/16. Rabbit B404 was
observed by the inspector on 15 AUG 16 to have an approximately 1.5 in L x ¾ in W elliptical dermal wound on the
left shoulder. The wound had a dry scaly yellow central surface with pink to red thickened edges. A piece of black
suture like material was noted along the top edge of the wound. There was no evidence that any observation of this
wound had been made. The post-operative record for rabbit B404 located in the room did not have any
observations documented on the form as of 8/5/16 through 8/15/16 at the time of inspection. There had been no
communication of the rabbit’s clinical condition to the veterinarian.
Rabbits B407, B111, B112 and B422 also underwent a surgical procedure the week of 8/4/2016 as per IACUC
approved protocol and no observations had been performed and documented on the post-operative record for these
animals.
Daily observations of all animals needs to be performed to assess their health and well-being. Communication of
these observations need to be made in a timely manner to the veterinarian to ensure proper care is provided.
As of 8/16/16 the wound had been diagnosed by research personnel as a surgical incision dehiscence and had
been surgically corrected before the end of the inspection.
Recommend the facility evaluate the current procedures on post-surgical monitoring and communication with the
attending veterinarian as of the end of the USDA inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
The inspectors completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared theoriginal inspection report, which occurred on 17 August 2016.
