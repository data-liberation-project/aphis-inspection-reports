3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
In 1 breeding pen containing 4 chinchillas, a broken section of wire protrudes into the enclosure and leaves a gap in the
cage wall of approximately 4" x 1". A resting shelf was supported by this section of wire and is still attached to the broken
wire. Sharp points can injure the chinchillas in the cage and even small gaps in the enclosure walls can allow escape or
cause additional injury. Housing structures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and prevent escape. Correct by 9/19/22
3.125(d)

Facilities, general.
Two chinchilla cages, containing 3 chinchillas are constructed in manner that allows waste and other debris to fall into the
4 inhabited cages below. The enclosures are doubled up single-house enclosures with an open area in the middle where
the dust bath normally goes. The under-cage trays do not extend under the dust bath area so the wire floor opens directly
on to the hay feeder of the 2 cages below, allowing waste and other debris to fall on to the animals below. The licensee
stated that he normally puts a wooden block on the floor of the dust bath area to prevent this but had forgotten to do so for
these 2 enclosures. No hay was present in the feeders below but there was a buildup of dirty bedding. Improper waste


disposal can contaminate feed and bedding, which can spread disease and create stress for territorial species. Removal
and disposal of animal waste, bedding, and debris must be done in a sanitary manner. Correct by 9/19/22
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
Overall cleaning of the building is not currently facilitating the prescribed husbandry practices. There is a thick buildup of
dust, hair, and debris on the top of and surrounding at least 50% of all used and unused enclosures. In addition over 60%
of the enclosures not currently in use but mixed throughout the inhabited enclosures, have dirty shavings, fur, and
spiderwebs in such quantities that one cannot see through the wire enclosures. In the second room, the breeding cages
are stacked on top of a wooden bench and dirty shavings are piled 6" high on top of the bench between each of the 9
stacks of cages. Failure to maintain acceptable cleaning can contribute to disease hazards. The licensee must ensure
that all premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals from disease hazards and to
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Correct by 9/27/22
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
There was a large number of small, black, flying insects throughout the facility. The insects congregated in wet bedding
and food. In the first room, there were no fly traps. In the second room, there were 2 hanging sticky traps but they were
covered in dead insects and no longer effective. Insects can carry disease and cause injury and irritation. A safe and
effective program for the control of insects and other pests must be established and maintained. Correct by 9/27/22

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
