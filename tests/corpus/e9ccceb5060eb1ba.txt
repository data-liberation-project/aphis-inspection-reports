2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1230 on
02/04/2014.
I knocked on the front door, honked my horn several times and waited in the driveway for 30 minutes. I also called
both phone numbers available to me and left a message for the licensee to return my call.
End of report.
