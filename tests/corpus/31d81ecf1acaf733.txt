Sanitation.
There was a large number of small black flies present in the small mammal housing room. Insects were observed on the
walls, inside some of the animal enclosures, and flying inside the room. The 3 fly strips hanging in the room were
completely full.

Per this Section, a safe and effective method to control insects and other pests should be established and maintained to
minimize and control unwanted pests. Flies can transmit disease-causing agents and can be distressful to the animals
when inside their primary enclosure. A more effective pest control program should be put in place to reduce and control
insects in the small mammal housing room for the health of the animals.

Correct by 4/22/22.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted 4/14/22 with Licensee. *END OF REPORT*
