2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
An opened expired vial of Tauroline-citrate solution (Exp 08/2016, Lot #30812) was found in a medicine cabinet and
it was confirmed that it had been used in at least one macaque on 10/3/2016. In another medicine cabinet there
was an expired bottle of Beuthanasia solution (Exp OCT 2016, lot 4JRR12, bottle #15-4) that was confirmed to have
been used for one animal on 11/3/2016. The use of expired medications can cause adverse effects to animals. The
facility must ensure that expired medications are not used in animals.
2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
Since the 1/5/2016 inspection, there have been four incidents of nonhuman primates escaping primary enclosures
that caused serious injuries to nine nonhuman primates. Three of these incidents were due to human error and one
incident was due to an enclosure lock failure. In these four incidents, the nonhuman primates were injured due to
uncontrolled interactions with other nonhuman primates in secure animal rooms where the escapes occurred. Some
lost portions of their tongues while others needed sutures and/or partial digit amputations. In order to prevent further
escapes that lead to injury of animals, the research facility must ensure that personnel always handle animals as
carefully as possible and ensure that the enclosures' hardware is appropriate to enable personnel to handle animals
without injury.
Note: The facility previously identified these incidents and reported them to the ACUC. Corrective actions have been
implemented to minimize further incidents. Affected animals promptly received appropriate veterinary care.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The bottom shelf in one of the refrigerators in a food storage area was covered with a dirty brown, gelatinous liquid.
Food distributed to the non-human primates is stored in this refrigerator. Supplies of food for non-human primates
should be stored in a manner to protect the food supplies from contamination and spoilage. The facility needs to
address this area of food storage to ensure supplies are stored in a manner that prevents contamination.Correct by 11/9/2016
3.81(a)(3) CRITICAL
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
On 12-28-15 a rhesus macaque was found dead in its enclosure. Necropsy indicated it had severe trauma wounds
and suggested that it died acutely with traumatic thoracic injuries. Three days (12-24-15) prior to its death , it had
been treated for wounds caused by an older cagemate. Wounds affected multiple muscle layers on its back and
involved a partially exposed vertebrae (bone). The medical record indicates that the affected macaque was treated
and returned to the same enclosure with the aggressive cagemate and noted that Behavior [department] would be
notified of the aggression. Following closure and treatment of wounds, the macaque was given pain medication and
recovery was monitored for three days with no further agression noted but there are no records of a behavior
evaluation of the grouping or from the veterinarians indicating if the cagemates should continue to be considered
compatible in light of the serious aggression injuries on 12-24-2015. Injuries on 12-24-15 suggest that there was a
compatibility problem with the cagemate which led to its death on 12-28-15. While working to maintain beneficial
social groups or pairings, the facility must ensure that the compatibility of non-human primates is determined in
accordance with generally accepted professional practices and actual observations, as directed by the attending
veterinarian, to ensure that the pairings are in fact compatible.
Correct from this day forward.
3.129(a) CRITICAL
FEEDING.
While reviewing records it was noted that an incident in January 2016 affected several Peromyscus mice: On
January 25, 2016, three cages of Peromyscus mice were found to have no food in the cage feeder or hopper. The
water levels in the water bottles throughout the room were low. In one of the three cages, one mouse was found
dead and the other mouse was hunched and had an unthrifty appearance. The dead mouse had been cannibalized
by the second mouse which had to be humanely euthanized. Necropsy reports indicated the stomach contents of
the mouse found dead contained hair, paper and bedding. The room sheets documenting feeding schedules had
not been marked on January 22, 23, or 24th to indicate the animals had been fed on those dates. To ensure animal
well-being; animals must be fed daily except when considering veterinary treatment, hibernation or other accepted
professional practices.
This incident was reported to the ACUC and appropriate corrective actions have been taken to ensure lapses in
feeding animals in the affected lab does not occur in the future.This inspection was conducted from 11/1-11/3/2016 and was a routine inspection of nonhuman primates and a
routine record review of the Graduate School and College of Letters and Sciences. The exit briefing was conducted
with facility representatives on 11/4/2016.
