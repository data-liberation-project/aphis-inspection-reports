FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A bottle of hand sanitizer was in the storage container for the food used for the goats , llamas and zebu. Two sacks
of feed for the elephants was on the floor in a storage area in a trailer . The floor was damp from recent rain. Hand
sanitizer may contaminate the feed for the animals. Storing bags on a damp surface may result in the feed molding
which may harm the animals if ingested. All feed must be stored in such a manner that prevents contamination and
protects it from deterioration. The hand sanitizer was removed immediately and the feed was placed on a pallet
during the inspection.
