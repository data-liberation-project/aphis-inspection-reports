FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are boards that have become loose or broken in The boar goat pen, fainting goat pen, regular goat pen, and
the front of the camel enclosure have boards in the fence that have been dislodged from the fence or been broken
and are falling. The broken or loose boards could fall and have exposed nails that may cause injury. The wire fence
in these areas has been bent or torn leaving gaps in the enclosure fence. The loose or missing boards and gaps
created in the wire may allow an animal to leave it's pen or an unwanted animals to access the pen. The fence shall
be repaired to protect the animals from harm and keep them safely contained within their enclosure.
The goat climbing structure in the regular goat pen is in disrepair. The boards attached to the metal overhang of the
roof are broken and are loose and falling. The climbing ramp to the upper level was constructed with cross slats to
give the goats support and prevent the goats from slipping while climbing. Some of the slats have broken and
others are missing leaving exposed nails. The sheets of plywood forming the platform have become warped and the
corners are raising up off of the support leaving gaps large enough for a goat to get a leg into and potentially
become injured. The structure shall be repaired to protect the goats from injury.
There is a ramp in the boar goat enclosure near the barn that is leaning. It is not structurally sound and should be
removed, repaired, or replaced to prevent injury.

3.130 CRITICAL
WATERING.
The pond in the main hoof stock yard has dried up. There are two water troughs provided at the front of the
enclosure. The larger water trough was added when the pond dried. When we approached the enclosure the
smaller metal trough was empty and there was little water in the larger trough. When the caretaker rinsed out the
larger trough and began filling it the cattle (4 domestic cows, 1 water buffalo) eagerly approached the trough and
began to drink while it was being filled. Other cattle also began to approach the trough while we continued theinspection. The animals actions indicate they were very thirsty. The troughs are checked in the morning and filled
at the end of the day. This inspection was conducted in the afternoon when the temperature was in the low 80's, the
troughs were already empty or nearly empty. While the pond is being repaired and the troughs are the main source
of water, two troughs being filled once a day is not sufficient to provide enough water for all of the large hoof stock
(30). Access to water, especially when the temperatures are high is essential for the animals health. Water must be
provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal.
Corrected immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Caretaker.
