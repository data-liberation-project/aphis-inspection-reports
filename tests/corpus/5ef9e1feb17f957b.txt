2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- There is no current, signed Program of Veterinary Care on hand. In order to ensure proper medical guidance and
veterinary care, the licensee must have a formal arrangement with a licensed veterinarian. This consists of a
signed, fully completed document which accounts for each species of animal kept by the licensee. It must cover
routine and emergency care, euthanasia methods, and any other advice or recommendations from the veterinarian.
This document must be kept current, and made available as needed for review by inspectors.
