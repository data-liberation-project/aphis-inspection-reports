ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two topical medications (vetropolycin (gerbil), mupiricin (canine)), one oral medication (carprofen (canine)) and one
injectable medication (lidocaine (equine)) were found to be expired. Two sets of surgical scrub and alcohol in two
treatment areas (feline treatment and CPL surgical prep areas) were either not labeled and/or had no expiration
dates. Using expired and/or unlabeled medications can cause detrimental effects to the health and well-being of the
animals. The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnoses and treat diseases and injuries shall be
included in a program of veterinary care.
