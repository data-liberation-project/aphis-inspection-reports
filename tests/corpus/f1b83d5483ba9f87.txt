FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The food receptacle for hay in the barn area of the enclosure housing one Oryx and one Llama is constructed out
of wood support and coated wire. The coated wire has been bent and pulled resulting in two metal ends being
exposed. These exposed metal ends are at face/eye level in the hay. Exposed metal points can cause injury to the
animals, especially when in with the hay in a food receptacle.
* There is a hole in the wall of the barn area of the enclosure housing one Oryx and one Llama. The hole exposes
some fiberglass insulation and insulation backing that has been torn. The wood edge around the hole appears to
have been chewed. There is some fiberglass insulation and wood chips on the ground of the enclosure near the
hole. Animals can be harmed from chewing or consuming inappropriate materials such as fiberglass and wood.
The licensee must ensure that the facility be constructed of such materials and of such strength as appropriate for
the animals involved. The housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in food repair to protect the
animals form injury.
For the correction date, these mentioned item(s) were corrected during the inspection process.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
* The gate in the perimeter fence labeled as G8 has gaps both between the gates and at the base. The two gates
swing together, but leave a gap that measures about 5.5 inches at the widest point between them. There is also a
gap between the base of the gate and the ground that measures about 8.5 inches at the widest point. The licensee
must ensure that all parts of the perimeter fence, including gates, be constructed so that it protects the animals in
the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. To be corrected by, 9-August-2016.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative, Dr. Margaret Shaver (VMO) and
