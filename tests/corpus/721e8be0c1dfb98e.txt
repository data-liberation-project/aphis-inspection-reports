3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The previous perimeter fence variance for housing non-carnivorous/non-dangerous animals in an enclosure that utilizes
the perimeter fence as the enclosure fence is no longer valid. The mule deer enclosure uses the perimeter fence as the
primary enclosure fence. This fence is vertical split rail to approximately 6 feet, with welded wire and barbed wire above
that to approximately 8 feet with three strand barbed wire above, angled out at approximately 45 degrees. On the
opposite side of the facility, the three strand barbed wire is no longer in good repair. In another area of the perimeter
fence, there is a tree directly adjacent to the perimeter fence that decreases the effective height of the perimeter fence.
The perimeter fence must be constructed and maintained so that it restricts animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it and so that it can function as secondary containment for the animals in the facility. Perimeter fences
less than 3 feet from primary enclosure fences must be approved in writing by the Administrator (variance) and a new
variance must be submitted to Animal Care and approved by Animal Care. Perimeter fences must also be maintained in
good repair and meet or exceed the effective height required based on the species in the facility.
