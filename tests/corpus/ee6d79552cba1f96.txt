WATERING.
***During the inspection, the APHIS inspector observed that the water in the water receptacles provided for the two
rabbits was frozen into blocks of ice. A facility employee stated that the rabbits’ water receptacles were supposed to
be filled daily in the morning. At the time of inspection at approximately 12:00 PM, these receptacles had not been
changed/refilled from the previous day.
The licensee must ensure that the rabbits are provided with clean, potable water in order to ensure that they
maintain adequate hydration. Sufficient potable water shall be provided daily except as might otherwise be required
to provide adequate veterinary care.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***There was not adequate drainage in an enclosure containing two young cows. The ground beneath the only
shelter in the enclosure was muddy, wet, and filled with puddles of standing water. The animals must stand in the
mud and puddles in order to be sheltered from the elements.
Animals standing in water for excess periods of time are at risk for hoof rot and other foot problems. The facility
must have a suitable method to rapidly eliminate excess water from the enclosures.
