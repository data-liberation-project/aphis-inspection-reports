3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The primary caretaker was out of town for 3 weeks, and the outdoor exotic cat enclosures were not adequately
cleaned during this time. The primary caretaker started cleaning the cages last night as evidenced by a litter box
full of waste in the middle cage containing two Geoffroys cats. The first enclosure, containing four Geoffroys cats
has an accumulation of old white feces in a pile next to the fencing behind a support board and a smaller pile on the
metal roofed of the shelter. Cleaning of primary enclosures was cited on 7-21-15. All enclosures are to be
cleaned on a more regular basis to prevent disease hazards and to prevent contamination of the animals.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
