Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 100 adult guinea pigs and 30 newborns
were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records of the number of adults, weanlings, and newborns
present for the last few months. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary
by identifying guinea pig additions and losses by deaths or decreasing numbers of animals born or animals kept for
replacements. The facility must maintain records on the number of guinea pigs held, owned, births, deaths, and sale of
animals. Correct by February 28, 2022.

two walls and floor of the guinea pig room. Indoor surfaces must be impervious to moisture so that surfaces can be
repeatedly cleaned and sanitized, won't retain odors, and do not allow the absorption of moisture or liquids. Licensee
must ensure that room wall surfaces and floor are impervious to moisture so that the surfaces can be repeatedly cleaned
and sanitized, won't retain odors or moisture. Correct by May 1, 2022.
