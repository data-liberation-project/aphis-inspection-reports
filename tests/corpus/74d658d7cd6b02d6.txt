Outdoor housing facilities.
A capuchin monkey was housed in an outdoor enclosure that did not have the required barrier to keep the public from
accessing the animal. An appropriate chain link fence is planned but had not been constructed prior to placing the animal
in the enclosure. Having no barrier between the public and the monkey puts both the monkey and the public at risk of
injury. Per the regulations, fixed public exhibits housing nonhuman primates must have a barrier between the primary
enclosure and the public at any time the public is present, in order to restrict physical contact between the public and the
nonhuman primates. Correct by May 24, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
