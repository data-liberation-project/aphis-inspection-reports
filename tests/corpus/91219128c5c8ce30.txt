2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
On February 25, 2014, this facility exhibited an opossum to the public off site without a USDA license. The
Executive Director was unaware of acquiring a USDA license. An application packet was issued and the facility will
be applying for a license for compliance. Any person who exhibits USDA regulated animals must obtain a valid
USDA license.
Until a license is issued, no animals covered by USDA can be exhibited to the public.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the Director and Educational Coordinator.
