ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***** The facility does not employ a full-time veterinarian and there was no written program of veterinary care
available at the time of inspection. That program of veterinary care must be made available for review during
inspections to ensure adequate veterinary care is being provided. The licensee, in coordination with the attending
veterinarian, must provide specific information on the type of products used at the facility and the frequency of use.
This is not considered to be adequate veterinary care when information on how the licensee provides veterinary
care for all animals have not been recorded. The licensee must ensure that the program of veterinary care is
updated with current preventive practices to ensure that all animals are provided adequate veterinary care. The
licensee must follow a written program of veterinary care as directed by the attending veterinarian and make it
available during inspections.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***** In the outdoor enclosure containing 18 dogs, there were 7 Ori Peis with open wounds on the tops of their ears
from flies biting them. The sores on all seven dogs were moist, reddened and inflamed in appearance. The sores
were estimated to be the size of a dime. The licensee stated that the sores have been noticed off and on during the
start of the summer. The licensee has been treating the open sores with antibiotic ointment and Vaseline. The
licensee treated the animals again during the inspection with a fly repellent. An open sore can be painful causing
discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection which affects the health of the animals. These dogs must be
examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administrated. The licensee must ensure that all
animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***** The licensee is currently using a computerized form of record keeping listing 163 dogs on the premise. The
licensee had 33 additional dogs listed that are no longer at the facility. Complete and accurate records are
necessary to ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace those
animals. The licensee must maintain records which fully disclose all information concerning each dog in their
possession.
