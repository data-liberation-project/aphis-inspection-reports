Facilities, general.
Multiple old bottle fly traps with accumulations of 25-50% capacity of dead and rotting flies were present around the
outdoor enclosures, including on a gate next to the Watusi, where a sticky trap was also lying on the ground. Disposal of
traps at the end of fly season, such as after the first frost, and as often as necessary during the season, must be done to
ensure that dead flies do not become a disease hazard or attract other vermin. The facility must make provisions for the
disposal of wastes from pest control methods.

Sanitation.
Both sinks in the kitchen had black mold on the wall behind the faucets, with peeling paint and damaged, pitted and
flaking soft wall board along the back of the sink. The hot water heater had rust and pitting over approximately 30% of the
top, and around the piping leading to the sinks. In Barn 4, the refrigerator had mold on the door and around the seals.
Damaged and dirty surfaces in food preparation areas may lead to contamination of feed and failure to adequately
maintain sanitation, which can adversely impact animal welfare. The facility must ensure that the kitchen is maintained in


good order to facilitate good husbandry practices.
