FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure to the far north has a side that is adjacent to the dog enclosure and has a metal grate along one
edge of the fence at ground level and the dirt under the grate has eroded. The grate is present to prevent the dogs
in the adjacent enclosure from digging out. However, this grate is exposed and appears elevated by 4 to 6 inches.
The grate is 2X3 inch squares that are 6 inches wide and 3 feet in length. This metal grate creates a possible limb
injury threat to the enclosed animals consisting of 4 sheep, 2 goats and 1 zebu. Licensee needs to remove the
grating or replace the dirt under the grate and on top of the metal grate to ensure the animals are safely contained
and protected from potential injury.
