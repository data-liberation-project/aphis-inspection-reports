3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The anteroom of the smaller bat enclosure has a 3-tier cage that is dirty. The top two tiers are covered in fecal
matter. The cage was reported to not have been used for a long time. The temporary caging was not cleaned since
it was last used.
Dirty surfaces pose a risk of soiling of the animals, and of contamination and disease spread via the feed, some of
which is stored in the ante room.
This repeat NCI was discussed with the PI on 6/27/2018.
This inspection was conducted with facility personnel. Exit briefing was conducted with the PI per telephone on
