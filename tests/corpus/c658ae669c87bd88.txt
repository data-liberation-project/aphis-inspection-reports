2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two Yorkshire Terrier dogs were identified as having severe periodontal disease. A 9 year old male, microchip
0A01420770, and a 4 year female, microchip 7E10170405, both had a heavy accumulation of hard brown material,
consistent with tartar, covering all of their teeth. The gums were red and swollen and had receded from the teeth. A
creamy grey material was present along the gumline. The male yorkie was also missing some teeth. Dental and
periodontal disease is painful and can lead to discomfort, poor body condition from refusal to eat, and severe infections in
the mouth and other organs. Correct by consulting with the attending veterinarian to treat the affected dogs and establish
a program that addresses the appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat dental and periodontal
disease. Correct by Feb 17th, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
