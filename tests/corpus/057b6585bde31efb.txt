2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was an animal at the facility with a health condition requiring treatment in consultation with the attending
veterinarian. There was a male bighorn sheep observed with lameness in the rear limbs. The sheep appeared stiff with
reduced range of motion in the rear limbs particularly the right rear leg. The facility thought the sheep had been treated
but the attending veterinarian was present at the facility and stated she had not been informed about the sheep's
condition and had not administered any treatments.
Lameness in the rear limbs can cause discomfort if not treated.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate this animal and determine an appropriate plan
for diagnosis and treatment.
