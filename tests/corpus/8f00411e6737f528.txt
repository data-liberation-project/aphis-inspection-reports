2.31(c)(3) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The report that the IACUC submitted to the Institutional Official (IO) on August 25, 2019, did not include minority views or
distinguish significant deficiencies from minor deficiencies. Reports to the IO must include minority views to ensure that
members of the committee that express differing viewpoints than what is reported, can have their findings documented
and submitted to the IO for consideration. On the report to the IO, it is also important to distinguish between significant
and minor deficiencies so that significant deficiencies, that may be a threat to the health or safety of the animals, are
recognized and corrected in a timely manner or reported to APHIS if not corrected by the proffered date. Including this
information ensures that the IO continues to be aware of the current status of the animal program, facilities, and
procedures. After completing the review of the facility’s program for humane care and use of animals and the inspection
of the animal facilities, the IACUC must prepare reports of their evaluations, including minority views and deficiencies, and
submit the reports to the Institutional Official.

An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
