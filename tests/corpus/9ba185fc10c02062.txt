2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available to review at the time of inspection. The Attending
Veterinarian's signature page was present, and the AV had signed within the last month.
The PVC needs to be complete, kept current, and made available for review. A current, complete PVC will ensure
that all aspects of veterinary care and husbandry have been considered before a need arises.
Correct within 30 days, by 8/24/2017.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The acquisition record for the tiger cub was not available for review at the time of inspection. From the information
available on the record of animals on hand and the Certificate of Veterinary Inspection, it appears that the cub was
transported at two weeks of age.
Records must be current, complete, and available for inspection in order to follow-up on animals' movement and
track them through ownership changes.
Correct by having complete records available for inspection from this point on.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Welded wire mesh fencing in the petting zoo area enclosures is broken down on top so that bare, sharp ends of
wires are exposed. These sharp points pose a risk of injury to the animals in the enclosure.
Enclosures must be kept in good repair to ensure safe confinement of the animals.
Correct by 8/4/2017.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Two of the panels of the perimeter fence on the back side of the big cat enclosures are not 8 feet tall. The entire
perimeter fence must be at least 8 feet tall to be in compliance. The perimeter fence is required to keep unauthorized persons and animals away from the primary enclosure, and to
be a secondary enclosure in case of escape from the primary enclosure.
Correct by 8/4/2017
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There were excessive flies in the coatimundi and wallaby areas, on the animals and on their food. The facility
representative said that they had pest strips available, but they hadn't yet put them out where needed.
Flies and other vermin (rodents and birds) can carry disease and contaminate the facilities and the feed. A good
control program can limit such disease spread, and can reduce the risk of the vermin stressing the animals.
Correct by implementing pest control measures by 8/4/2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.
Additional follow-up was made with licensee via email.
