2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Most of the licensee's Dogs on Hand records (APHIS form 7005) were missing information, including
birthdates/ages of dogs, dates acquired, identification numbers, and the full address of the sellers. Properly
completed acquisition records are necessary for identification of dogs to facilitate record-keeping requirements for
inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare. The licensee must update the Record of Acquisition and maintain
the record on a regular basis so that it always has accurate information regarding acquisition, identification, and
disposition for all dogs.

3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures, housing a total of 6 dogs, had shelters that had large cobwebs attached to multiple sides inside the
shelters. The cobwebs were very large and were covered in dust and dirt. As the dogs jumped around inside the
enclosures, their faces were contacting the cobwebs. The dirt and dust can harbor diseases that can affect the
health of the dogs. The licensee must clean and sanitize all surfaces as often as necessary to satisfy generally
accepted husbandry standards and practices.
3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The shelter in an outdoor enclosure, housing two Boston terriers, had a hole in its side where the dogs had chewed
through the plywood. The hole was almost big enough for the dogs to stick their heads through. Shelters that are
not structurally sound can result in dogs being injured by jagged edges, can result in entrapment of heads or legs,
and can allow dogs to escape from the enclosure. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are kept in
good repair.

3.11(d)CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were a large number of flies inside the whelping building and throughout the outdoor facility. Flies can carry
organisms that can cause diseases in dogs. The licensee must establish an effective program for the control of
insects and other pests so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and to reduce contamination by
pests.
