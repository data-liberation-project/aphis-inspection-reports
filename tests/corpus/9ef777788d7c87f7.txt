SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures.
The enclosure for four cows has no dry ground in it. The cows have mud on their upper legs and they sink in the
mud past their hooves. Lack of access to dry ground can increase risk of disease and cause animals discomfort.
Ensure that the cattle enclosure is maintained so that each cow has access to dry ground.
