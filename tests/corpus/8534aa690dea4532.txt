2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
**A current written program of veterinary care was not available during the inspection. The program of veterinary
care was last reviewed by the attending veterinarian in August 2008 and it did not list a current inventory of animals.
Guinea pigs were listed on the program of veterinary care, however, there are currently no regulated animals at the
facility. Failure to have an accurate written program of veterinary care that has been reviewed by the attending
veterinarian does not provide for adequate veterinary care of the animals. It is the responsibility of the licensee to
ensure the written program of veterinary care accurately reflects the species of animals utilized at the facility so that
the appropriate veterinary care will be provided.
