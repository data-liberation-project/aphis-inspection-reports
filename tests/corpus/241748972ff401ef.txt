OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***Shelter from Elements***
Six enclosures in the concrete block kennel building on the east side of the kennel area had interior shelter boxes
that had an inadequate amount of bedding. Bedding was provided but a larger portion of the rubber matting
beneath was visible. The outside air temperature at the time of inspection was approximately 32 degrees F with the
temperature inside these shelter boxes approximately 38 degrees F. Additional bedding must be provided to allow
for enough bedding material for the dogs to nest in and conserve body heat. To be corrected by: 11/13/14
This inspection was conducted with the owner with an exit briefing conducted at the conclusion of the inspection.
Noncompliant items and correction dates were discussed with the owner with the report to be sent via certified mail.
