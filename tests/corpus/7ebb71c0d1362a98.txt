3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1) Exposed and chewed wood surfaces were observed on the interior side of the dog access door located on the
west wall of the southwest enclosure in the whelping building. The enclosure currently houses two young black
chow- chows.
2) A plywood panel attached to a dividing wire panel between occupied dog pens in the west kennel building was
observed to have a large hole chewed in it.
Exposed, worn or chewed wood surfaces are difficult to sanitize and may pose a splinter risk to dogs. Large holes in
wooden divider panels may also pose a potential entrapment risk to animals. All damaged wood surfaces need to
be repaired or replaced and maintained so as to remain impervious to moisture and easily sanitized.
