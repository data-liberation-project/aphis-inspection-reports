Facilities, general.
There is a section of mesh over the wire door leading to the porcupine enclosure that is chewed and frayed. There is a
potential for the mesh that is chewed to cause an impaction problem in the animal. This section of mesh needs to be
addressed to keep the enclosure in good repair for the safety of the animals.
