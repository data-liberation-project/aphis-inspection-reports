PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The rhesus macaque and the capuchin enclosures had wood branches in them in order to provide perching areas.
These branches were held in place with zip ties, however the ends of the zip ties were long and showed evidence
that the animals had been chewing on them. This could lead to injury if the animals ingested the plastic material.
Enclosures need to be maintained in order to protect the animals from injury. This was corrected before the
conclusion of the inspection.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The capuchin, rhesus, snow macaque and lemurs did not have toys provided in their enclosures. According to the
facilities' Nonhuman Primate enrichment plan which had been approved by the Attending Veterinarian, toys will be
provided for these animals at all times. Various material was in the enclosures providing areas to perch, such as
branches and a swing in the snow macaque enclosure. The caretaker stated that the toys had not been offered yet
since they had just set up and it was opening day of the fair. Various types of enrichment must be provided at all
times for these animals in order to enhance the environment and allow for species specific behavior. This was
corrected before the conclusion of the inspection.
