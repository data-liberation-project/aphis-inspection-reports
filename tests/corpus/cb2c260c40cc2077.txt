3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All primary enclosures that housed the adult and un-weaned puppies had rust and corrosion. Several of the
enclosures had corrosion that created jagged edges and sharp points, because of breakage causing holes in the
flooring. The dogs legs could fit through the holes and become injured due to the jagged edges and sharp points.
The rust and corrosion cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized which can then harbor disease.
In the primary enclosures wooden boards were provided to the dogs and puppies for a solid resting surface. The
boards have green residue and the edges are splitting and splintering off. The surfaces cannot be properly cleaned
or sanitized which can harbor disease.
The licensee shall ensure all housing facilities are constructed so that they are structurally sound, kept in good
repair, and protect the animals from injuries.
The corrections should be made by July 7, 2015.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Inside and outside the sheltered housing there was an abundance of flies. The licensee used fly bags and once full
did not dispose of the bags creating a strong odor and allowed the life cycle of the flies to continue adding to the
number of flies. Flies contaminate surfaces and spread disease affecting the well-being of the dogs. The licensee
must have an effective pest control program to reduce the number of pests and promote health and well-being of
the animals.
The corrections should be made by July 1, 2015.
3.11
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The self-feeders had green film on the interior surfaces that were in contact with the food. The food is at risk for
contamination which could cause illness in the dogs. The licensee shall sanitize the feeders at least once every two
weeks and more often if necessary. The corrections should be made by June 19, 2015.
The inspection and exit interview were done with the Licensee and ACI Liz Bartels.
