EMPLOYEES.
4 deer mice were housed in a compatible group in an area of the facility designated for animals used for educational
programs. These animals were handled by employees of the facility as well as volunteers that assist in the care and
handling of program animals. Their enclosure was a plastic enclosure with a wire lid, which requires that the lid be
placed correctly in order to securely contain the animals. On August 12, 2019, it was noted by a staff member that
there were only 3 mice in the enclosure. It is not known how or when a mouse escaped from the enclosure. This
animal was not able to be recovered.
Employees and volunteers that are involved in the care of animals must be adequately trained in order to maintain
professionally accepted husbandry standards. Acceptable husbandry standards include handling and enclosure
maintenance that results in the safe containment of the animals. In this instance, handling or enclosure
maintenance by inadequately trained personnel led to the escape of the deer mouse, and the facility was unable to
safely recover the animal.
After the escape of the deer mouse from this enclosure, this species was removed from the education program, the
remaining animals were moved to a separate location in a different type of secure enclosure, and handling of this
species is now limited to trained and experienced employees of the facility.
This item has been corrected by the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted on site with a facility representative.
