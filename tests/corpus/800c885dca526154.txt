RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The disposition records are also still incomplete. The is no written record of the disposition of the potbelly pig,
prairie dogs (2), one alpaca, and two Jacob's sheep. There is also no record of the birth of 4 rabbit kits. Records of
sales, donations, transfers, euthanasia, births and deaths must be kept to facilitate the regulatory requirements of
the Animal Welfare Act. The dispositions of the potbelly pig, alpaca, prairie dogs, and Jacob's sheep and the birth of
the rabbits must be recorded to maintain an accurate animal inventory and to ensure the animals on hand receive
proper care. Corrected during the inspection.
2.126(a)(2) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***The licensee still refuses to disclose the disposition of one Patagonian cavy and 2 brown nosed coatimundi which
were removed from the property prior to 06-March-2017. Licensees are required to provide access to all records
required to be kept by the Animal Welfare Act and the regulations. Licensees are required to provide information
regarding the disposition of animals to an APHIS official. Failure to provide the information to an APHIS official is in
violation of the regulations of the Animal Welfare Act. The disposition information of animals is necessary for APHIS
officials to track/trace animals for health issues. The disposition of the animals must be disclosed to an APHIS
official upon request at the time of an inspection.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The two white rabbit enclosures, one housing a Flemish and the other a chocolate satin rabbit with four babies,
still has an accumulation of fecal matter and a dark yellow material underneath and along the back legs of the
raised cages as first noted on the 12-October-2016 inspection. The dark yellow material is mixed with hair and dirt
and appears to be a hard pasty texture. Accumulations of waste materials can lead to strong odors, attract pests,
and may pose a disease hazard for the animals. Fecal material, urine, and other debris must not be allowed to
accumulate. Wastes under cages must be disposed of at a frequency that prevents accumulation for the health and
well-being of the animals and to maintain an effective pest control program.3.53(a)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***The floor of one of the white rabbit enclosure has 1 inch by 1 1/2 inch openings. The feet of the chocolate satin
rabbit housed in this cage can pass through the openings easily. Particle boards have been placed in the enclosure,
however these boards do not cover the entire cage floor and may cause additional problems because of rough and
chewed edges. This was previously identified on the inspection report of 12-October-2016 and no change has been
made at the time of this inspection. Primary enclosures must be constructed in a manner that protects the feet and
legs from injury. The floor of the rabbit enclosure must be modified to to decrease the size of the openings for the
comfort of the rabbit and to prevent injury.
3.53(a)(5)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***The chocolate satin rabbit has a litter of four one week old kits. The mother rabbit made a nest of straw in one
corner of the cage. No nest box is present in the cage. Rabbits prepare for giving birth by making a nest in a hidden
area for privacy and to protect their litter. A nest box must be provided in the cage for the comfort of the mother
rabbit and for the protection of the kits. Correct by August 4, 2017.
3.56(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***The black and white lop-eared rabbit is in a new cage with a solid floor shelter. An excessive amount of feces is
present on the floor of the shelter. Animals in direct contact with an excessive amount of feces can become soiled
and be exposed to disease hazards, which can lead to illness.
Primary enclosures must be kept free of excreta, hair, and debris to provide the animals with a clean living
environment and prevent exposure to disease hazards. Excreta and debris must be removed from the primary
enclosures at a frequency that will prevent the build-up of material to ensure animals are maintained in in a
reasonably clean cage for the comfort of the rabbit and ensure the animal remains free of disease due to unsanitary
conditions.
3.56(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***Based upon the appearance of this buildup of fecal matter, these cages are not being sanitized at least every 30
days as specified in the regulations. Rabbit cages should be sanitized every 30 days with one of the methods
appropriate to the caging system specified in the regulations, such as washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent
solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant. Sanitizing the cages will help prevent the buildup of old fecesand debris and eliminate bacteria and viruses that can cause harmful diseases and discomfort. Sanitize all rabbit
cages at least on a 30 day interval.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Along the left of the enclosure housing four mouflon sheep, the chain link fencing is curled upward into the
enclosure. A piece of wood has been placed over the section of fence, However, it is not secured to the fence and
therefore will not effectively prevent potential injury. Unsecured fencing that curls into an enclosure could cause
injury to a hoof or leg of an animal walking the fence line. The curled fencing must be repaired or secured in a
manner that will prevent injury to the animals.
***The portion of fence along the right side of the goat enclosure housing two adult goats, is bowed curling upward,
into the enclosure.This has a been a point of escape. The damaged fence may also cause an injury. The curled
fencing must be repaired or secured in a manner that will prevent injury to the animals and escapes.
***The bottom fence line along the right side of the enclosure housing 6 six deer, has a gap of about 3 inches as a
result of ground erosion. The gap is large enough to allow the entry of unwanted animals or objects. It also could be
a point of escape or cause injury. Enclosures should be constructed in a manner that protects and contains the
animals. Modifications along the fence line must be made to eliminate the gap and prevent further ground erosion
for the safety of the animals and the public.
***Goat enclosure: The bottom of one section of fencing near the gate, is bent upward into the enclosure and bowed
outward. This has created a gap that would allow an animal to enter or exit the enclosure. The owner indicated one
goat was seen pushing the section of fence up and going under it to escape from the enclosure. The section of
fence no longer prevents the escape of animals or the entry of unwanted animals. The fence must be reconstructed
in a manner that will ensure the fence is structurally sound and made of such material and strength to contain the
goats within and to prevent further damage to the fence.
***Goat enclosure: The gate for the goat enclosure is a wire panel loosely secured with carabiners and a chain. The
panel gate fence is attached so the pointed edge extends into the enclosure. The goats in the enclosure could be
injured by the points along the edge of the gate fencing. The gate must be better secured, such as a hinge or metal
fence clamps, to ensure the gate is kept closed to prevent escape and the unwanted entry of patrons. Additionally,
the gate must be constructed in a manner that will allow the gate to be properly closed and the points eliminated to
prevent injury to the animals.
***Highland Cow / Zebu: The gate is not squarely placed. The gate leans forward as there is no latch and just a
single chain attached to the mid- section of the pole. A single chain does not securely fasten a gate to an enclosure
housing cattle. Poorly secured gates do not prevent animals from being able to dislodge the gate and escape. Thegate must be secure in a fashion that would prevent an animal or person from dislodging the gate to ensure the
containment of the animals.
***Highland cow / Zebu: A set of 4 rungs of board fencing are attached to a wood support post and extends beyond
the post but does not extend all the way to the metal support pole that secures the gate. The unattached boards
leave a gap between the fence and the gate, approximately 2-4 inches wide. The current design does not serve to
secure the enclosure and could be easily broken by an animal or human. The fencing must be constructed in a
manner that will provide adequate strength to contain domestic cattle.
NOTE: The black squirrel was securely contained in another enclosure at the time of this inspection. The wild grey
squirrel was released.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***According to the owner, the zoo has been closed since the last inspection. However, the admission sign at the
gate remains visible to the public. There is a “No Trespassing” sign on the tree near the main entrance to the zoo
and the private entrance to the owner’s property. The gate at the main entrance has been repaired since the last
inspection but is not locked. The back gate for entrance into to the zoo remains missing and the adjacent fencing
for which it would be attached is still bent down to the ground due to a bent support pole. The entrance from the
private home is also often left open. These gates are a part of the perimeter fence and if left open or broken will
allow members of the public free access to the property even when the zoo is closed. Members of the public have
presumably gained access to the property through an open or broken gate. All gate entrances must be repaired and
properly secured to prevent the entry of unwanted persons for the protection of the animals.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***The deer feed trough has jagged edges from chewing, that resulted in two deep U-shaped crevices along the top
edge of the trough. A leg of a deer could get caught in the crevices or some other injury may occur due to the
jagged edges and the W-shape of the trough damage. The feeding trough needs to be replaced or repaired to
prevent injury to the deer in the enclosure.
***There is a significant amount of overgrown weeds and brush present in the Highland cow / Zebu enclosure. The
plants have reached a height that makes it difficult to view the animals from a distance and for the animals to reach
their shelter, food, and water. Naturally grown plants within enclosures should be maintained by cutting or trimming
on a regular basis to prevent overgrowth. The weeds and brush must be cut or trimmed to ensure the animals can
move freely and to provide for better visually of the animals for daily observations. Correct by August 7, 2017.***Mouflon sheep: The back of the shelter still has the 18 inch diameter hole.The shelter has been patched in
several areas. The hole is located in an area in which a horn may get caught. Shelters must be kept in good repair
to maintain the integrity of the structure, prevent injury, and provide adequate protection from various weather
conditions.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Rat holes were still noted behind the white nosed coati enclosure. The rat problem has continues but their is less
evidence of their prescience was since the last inspection. Rats are known to carry various diseases that may
affect the health of the exhibit animals. A safe and effective pest control program is required to ensure good animal
health. Implemented pest control measures based upon expert recommendations must be continued at an
appropriate frequency to prevent harborage and recolonization of the rodent population.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses 64 regulated animals, numerous birds, and one (1) turtle. There are only two (2) employees
and occasional help to feed, clean enclosures, and to conduct the maintenance of the enclosures and upkeep of the
property. The two main employees also keep records and provide the daily observations of the animals have
regular responsibilities for jobs unrelated to those of the zoo.
Based upon the number of animals and non-complaint items related to cleaning, sanitation, waste disposal and
maintenance there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the husbandry
responsibilities of the facility on a daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of trained employees to carry out
the day to day husbandry duties and maintenance on the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is needed
to ensure that cleaning, animal observations, maintenance tasks, and pest control duties are performed at
professionally acceptable level for the number of animals housed at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owners.
