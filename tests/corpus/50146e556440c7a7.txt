SANITATION.
Many flies were noted inside the enclosure, resting on top of the shavings and sitting on top of the feed in the feed
receptacle in the rabbit enclosure currently housing one rabbit. Flies can irritate animals and can spread disease.
The facility needs to establish and maintain an effective program for the control of flies and other insect pests.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The goat enclosure (two goats) needs repair in the following areas:
*The interior floor of the shelter structure contains large cement chunks/rocks. They make it uncomfortable for the
goats to use the shelter and possibly may lead to foot/leg injury.
*Two sides of the three sided shelter do not reach the ground as the shelter is on a hillside. The sides are up to a
foot above the ground. One short side of the shelter is missing a board comprising almost half of the side. The goats
may injure themselves if they get caught and the openings may not protect the goats from the elements.
*Erosion along the upper side fence has led to the fence being loose at ground level. The goats may become
entrapped in loose fencing and other unwanted animals may enter the enclosure simply by pushing on the fencing.
*One large metal stake/spike is protruding from the ground outside the fencing into the enclosure along the upper
side of the fence and may lead to injury.
The goat housing enclosure must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the goats from
injury. Correct by Oct. 11, 2016.
3.131(c)
SANITATION. The cavy enclosure has an overgrowth of weeds and plants in areas both inside and immediately adjacent to the
enclosure on the outside. Only the roof of the wooden shelter structure is easily visible due to the tall growth. The
weeds/plants make it difficult to walk around the enclosure, evaluate the enclosure fencing and evaluate the cavy
regularly. In addition, weeds make it difficult to clean the enclosure and may harbor pests. The enclosure grounds
and premises shall be kept clean and free of extra plants/weeds that make it difficult to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices. Correct by Oct. 4, 2016.
The written program of veterinary care has been updated.
