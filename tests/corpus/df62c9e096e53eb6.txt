PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The enclosure housing the two mongoose lemurs has several areas on the walls where the white paint has been
scraped off and the blue coat underneath is exposed. These areas of missing paint are within two feet of the
ground and therefore accessible to the animals. Similarly, there is a door within the enclosure in which the white
paint has also been scraped off to reveal a brown surface beneath it.
Primary enclosures for nonhuman primates must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. Flaking or
peeling paint can present a health hazard to the animals if ingested as well as make sanitation of the enclosure
difficult to achieve. Correct by repairing these areas of peeled/flaked paint. Correct by March 12, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Interim Curator.
