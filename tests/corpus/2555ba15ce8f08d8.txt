Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
***In the M3 outdoor run number six housing, there are two plastic storage (milk) crates suspended on the wall of the
enclosure as platforms or climbing structures for the macaques. The crates do not have solid walls but have many holes
and crevices (similar to lattice work or mesh) making them more difficult to clean. These crates have a buildup of waste
material ground into or smeared on the openings. The runs had already been washed down for the day but the crates in
this run did not get cleaned. All surfaces shall be cleaned as necessary to prevent excessive accumulation, prevent the
nonhuman primates from becoming soiled and to reduce disease hazard. Correct by September 12, 2017.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Housekeeping,

***The air vents in the ceiling over the primary enclosures in T-2 have dirt building up on them and on the ceiling directly
in the path of the air flow. The vents have filters but there is a solid buildup of dust and/or particulate matter around the
vents. The vents shall be cleaned and the filters checked to aid in providing clean air into the housing area thereby
potentially protecting the nonhuman primates from contamination. Correct by September 21, 2017.



***There are several roaches on the floor in the treatment room in M-7 and the procedure/storage area in G-12 There are
numerous flies swarming in the inside housing area of building in M-3. There are old fly strips still suspended near the
enclosures on one end of the building but none on the other side. The presence of flies shall be minimized to prevent
exposure to the NHP's and protect them from contamination. Correct by September 21, 2017.

This inspection and exit briefing conducted with the Assistant Directors of Animal Resource for the field station and the
