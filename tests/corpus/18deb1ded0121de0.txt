ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***Two female bighorn sheep, M315 and A715, have overgrown hooves due to lack of routine hoof trimming. The
“toes” on the hind limb of the sheep are starting to cross over one another.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries.
As part of the facility’s program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive
appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
These two animals must have their hooves trimmed by May 9, 2017.
This inspection was conducted with facility representatives from May 1, 2017- May 2, 2017. The exit briefing was
conducted over the telephone with ACUC chair on May 2.
