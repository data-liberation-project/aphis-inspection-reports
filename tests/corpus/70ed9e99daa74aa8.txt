FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an open bag of bed shavings for the pigs being stored directly on the ground. Storing supplies in such a
manner may not adequately protect them against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. A system
should be in place to ensure bedding is being stored as required.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The Racing Pig Building has semi solid/liquid waste material accumulating under and at the back of the building.
This material is being generated from the slatted floor inside the building and is overflowing to outside of the
building. There is a heavy foul odor emanating from the liquid waste to the animal areas. At the rear end of the
starting gate chute, there are heavy accumulations of pig excreta present. Accumulations of animal and food waste
can adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals .A system should be in place to ensure the removal
and disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding and debris on a regular schedule so as to minimize vermin
infestation, odors, and disease hazards. The disposal facilities and any disposal of animal and food wastes,
bedding, dead animals, trash, and debris shall comply with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations
relating to pollution control or the protection of the environment.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
There are 8 pigs, two per enclosure, being housed in enclosures that do not meet our minimum space
requirements. The pigs are crowded and cannot move around easily. Failure to provide sufficient floor space to the
animals may adversely affect their health and well-being. Enclosures should be constructed and maintained so asto provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate
freedom of movement.

SANITATION.
There are two enclosures, with two cattle in each, which have a heavy accumulation of fecal material collecting
within. The enclosures have not been cleaned for several days and the cattle cannot lie down without coming in
contact with the waste material. Enclosures maintained in this manner may adversely affect the health and
well-being of the animals. A system should be in place to ensure excreta is removed from primary enclosures as
often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and
to reduce odors.

SANITATION.
The outside walls of the Pig Racing Building are covered with flies. There are hundreds of flies present and there is
no pest control program in place. The back wall of the building is directly above a puddle of pig excreta that has
overflowed from the building. The presence of flies can transmit disease and can cause discomfort to the animals. A
safe and effective program for the control of insects should be established and maintained.
