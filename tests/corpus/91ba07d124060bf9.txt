2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Several IACUC approved protocols (IACUC #'s 1342, 1402, 1408, & 1412) involving animal use activities did not
have an appropriate rationale for the number of animals to be used.
All of these protocols did not include a rationale as to why the numbers of animals per group were chosen with a
statement that "the number of animals assigned to this study represents the minimum required to meet the
objectives of the study...".
**In protocol #1342, several groups of dogs were listed in a chart with 2 groups having 1 male and 1 female dog, 2
groups having 2 males and 2 females, and 2 sets of 3 groups that had 3 males and 3 females. No explanation for
why 1 dog of each gender was needed in the 2 study groups versus 2 of each or 3 of each was provided.
**In protocol #1402, 2 groups of 6 guinea pigs was requested but no statistical analysis nor any other scientific
justification for why 6 animals were needed in each group was provided. When the study director was questioned, it
was leared that, within each group of 6 guinea pigs, there were actually 3 groups of 2 guinea pigs but the study
director could not explain why 2 guinea pigs would be adequate except that there was concern that the fewest
number of animals were to be used.
**In protocol #1408, 4 groups of 5 guinea pigs was requested but no statistical analysis nor any other scientific
justification for why 6 animals were needed in each group was provided.
A proposal to conduct an activity involving animals, or to make a significant change in an ongoing activity involving
animals, must contain a rationale for the appropriateness of the species and numbers of animals to be used.
To be corrected on all currently active protocols and subsequent protocols involving covered animals reviewed and
approved by the IACUC.
3.1(a)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures housing dogs were not being maintained in good repair and to protect the animals from injury.
**One chain link enclosure in the Ponderosa Building housing 2 beagles (#2001 & #2002) had numerous broken
and stretched wires on the south side of the enclosure, posing a risk of injury to the dogs.
**An enclosure housing 3 colony beagles in the Ponderosa Building had numerous exposed staples from the worn
and chewed plywood walls, posing a risk of injury to the dogs.
Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury.
Sharp ends and exposed staples to be corrected by 4/15/2014 with more maintainable materials added to repair or
replace the current damaged surfaces by 4/21/2014.
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An open bag of shavings used for bedding for dogs and a box of dog biscuits were not kept in leakproof containers
with tightly fitting lids. Open supplies of food and bedding may become contaminated by debris or by pests or may
deteriorate or spoil so should be stored so as to protect the health of the dogs.
All open supplies of food and bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent
contamination and spoilage.
To be corrected by 4/17/2014.
Accompanied on the inspection by the CFO, Study Director, Institutional Official, IACUC Chair, and several animal
care staff.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representatives.
