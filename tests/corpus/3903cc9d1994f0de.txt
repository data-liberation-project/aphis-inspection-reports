***On September 10, 2021 three 6-month old juvenile sheep (1 female and 2 males) died after the Animal Care Manager
administered an incorrect levamisole dose causing an acute levamisole toxicity. These three juvenile sheep, assigned to a
USDA-regulated IACUC protocol, were diagnosed via fecal floatation with gastrointestinal parasites. Under veterinary
direction, the herd Animal Care Manager administered levamisole and other medications. The Animal Care Manager
contacted a veterinarian immediately after observing muscle tremors, a clinical sign of possible toxicity, however all three
juvenile sheep died approximately 30-60 minutes after the levamisole was administered.
The facility promptly reviewed all treatments and doses and determined the Animal Care Manager was supposed to
administer the recommended volume of 15mls of diluted “Standard Drench Solution” (½ fluid oz/50lbs) but had instead
prepared and gave 15mls of the “Concentrated Drench Solution” (2mls per 50lbs). This error resulted in the Animal Care
Manager administering 15mls of concentrated drench instead of 2mls causing an acute levamisole toxicity and death.

***On October 27, 2021 a female Mexican free-tailed bat escaped from a research staff member’s hand while it was being
hand fed. While trying to locate the bat on the floor, the staff member moved a large shelving unit on wheels and injured
the bat. The bat was euthanized immediately due to the injuries it sustained.



Inadequate training in the proper handling and care of animals can lead to injuries or death. The research facility must
ensure that all personnel with direct animal contact are qualified and properly trained in the handling and care for the
various species of animals used by the facility. It is the responsibility of the research facility to provide continued training
and instruction to all personnel with sufficient frequency to fulfill the research facility’s responsibility and maintain the
health and well-being of the animals.

Corrections had been instituted prior to the inspection by retraining all protocol personnel with animal care responsibilities
on handling and protocol techniques.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
