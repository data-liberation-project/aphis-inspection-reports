3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Two primary enclosures housing 11 and 12 guinea pigs respectively had accumulations of soiled bedding. Majority
of the plastic enclosures have fly dirt stains on the surfaces. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals
to disease hazards and health problems. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, excreta, and soiled bedding and enclosures must be sanitized at least once every two
weeks. Corrrect by ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, excreta, and soiled bedding.
