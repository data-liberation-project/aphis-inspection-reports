2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a pregnant female bulldog (brown/white) that has a cloudy left eye with a moderate amount of green discharge
and brown crusty material around the rim of the eye lid. The eye was squinting and blinking more often than usual and
appeared uncomfortable to the dog. While the facility representative was wiping out the eye, a veterinarian was not
contacted for proper diagnosis and treatment.

There is a 2.5 month old female Australian shepherd puppy and three male 10 week old bulldog puppies housed together
that had some green and/or white discharge coming from the noses and eyes. During the inspection coughing and a
hacking type noise could be heard from several of them. A raspy breathing sound or the sound similar to mucus in the
lungs could be heard when listening to their breathing standing next to the enclosure. A veterinarian has not been
contacted about the puppies before the inspection.

The Australian shepherd puppy appeared to be under weight with the abdomen area being indented more than what is
normal, and the hip bones being more pronounced. This puppy had been taken to the vet a week before and the
veterinarian did not prescribe any treatments advising the puppy seemed fine. However, the day after the vet visit the
puppy started coughing and the facility decided to medicate and treat themselves instead of contacting the veterinarian for

proper diagnosis and treatment after other symptoms appeared.

The lack of timely veterinary care can cause a treatable condition if caught early, to become more serious or fatal if there
is no treatment and cause unnecessary pain or discomfort to the regulated animals. Self treatment with antibiotics/drugs
without the proper diagnosis and consultation of the veterinarian can pose a serious risk for the regulated animals if the
medicine is incorrect for the problem and/or the animal is over or under dosed for the health issue.

A veterinarian must be consulted for proper diagnosis and treatment of the regulated animals.

3.11(b)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There are 8 doggy doors that have a moderate amount of brown/black dirt and grime on both sides of the doors. The
outside metal walls of the run area around the doggy doors have a moderate buildup of brown dirt/grime on the surfaces
that have not been scrubbed clean to allow for proper sanitization. The wooden ramps have several chewed wooden
cross bars that are used to provide traction for the dogs.

The chewed exposed wood does not allow for proper sanitization of the surfaces that come in contact with the regulated
animals. The buildup of dirt/grime on surfaces that is not scrubbed off does not allow for proper sanitization. The lack of
properly sanitized surfaces can be a source of possible disease or other health issues.

All surfaces including food and water receptacles that come in contact with the regulated animals must be sanitized

according to AWA standards and regulations at least once every 2 weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup
of dirt and grime. The methods used should be either live steam under pressure, Washing with hot soapy water or
detergent, or using appropriate detergent solutions and disinfectants or combination that accomplishes the same purpose.
