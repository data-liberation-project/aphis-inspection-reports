ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1540 on
02-Aug-18. I went to the licensee's house. No one answered. I called the licensee up and left a message. I waited
30 minutes and then left the property. A few minutes after I left I received a voicemail. The licensee informed me
she would not be available to do the inspection that day.
End of report.
