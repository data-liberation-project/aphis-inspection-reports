2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Upon review of an inventory of animals on hand and in reconciling it with acquisitions and dispositions, there were two
records of disposition that were missing regarding the sale of a rabbit and the sale of four chinchillas.

Accurate, complete records are necessary, as every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully
and correctly disclose the needed information concerning animals, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased,
or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. Information is needed regarding the name and address of person from whom the
animals were purchased or otherwise acquired; the USDA license or registration number of the person if he or she is
licensed or registered under the Act; vehicle license number and State, and the driver's license number (or photographic
identification card for non-drivers issued by a State) and State of the person, if he or she is not licensed or registered
under the Act; the name and address of the person to whom an animal was sold or given; the date of purchase,
acquisition, sale or disposal of the animal(s); the species of the animal(s); and the number of animals in the shipment.
