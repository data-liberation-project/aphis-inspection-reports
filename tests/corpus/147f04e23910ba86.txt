ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Eight adult guinea pigs were noted to have swelling under their chins. The licensee had identified these animals
prior to inspection, but the attending veterinarian had not been notified. There is no guidance in the Program of
Veterinary Care for the treatment of this condition.
In the 2nd pen from the door, an adult tan and white guinea pig had a round, firm swelling under the chin
approximately 1" in diameter.
In the 5th pen from the door, 3 guinea pigs were identified with the swellings. A tan, brown, and white adult
guinea pig had a swelling approximately 1.5" in diameter under its chin. An adult guinea pig, mostly black with some
tan and white markings, had a swelling approximately 1.5" in diameter under its chin. An adult guinea pig, mostly
white with small black and tan markings, had a swelling approximately 1" in diameter under its chin.
In the 8th pen from the door, 2 guinea pigs were identified with the swellings. An adult guinea pig, mostly grey
with some white, had an asymmetrical swelling that was overall approximately 1.5" in diameter under its chin. The
swelling was composed of several firm, round structures, with the largest one on the right side of the animal's neck,
and measuring approximately 1" in diameter. Another adult guinea pig, black with white markings, had a firm
swelling under its chin approximately 1/2" in diameter. The surface of this swelling had a small tan crust and the
skin was pale pink, consistent with a healing wound or draining tract.
In the 9th pen from the door, 2 animals were identified with the swellings. An adult black and tan guinea pig had a
swelling approximately 1" in diameter under its chin. An adult tricolor guinea pig had a swelling approximately 1.5"
under its chin.
These swellings may represent an underlying disease process or an active infection. When problems of animal
health are identified, direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required to ensure the
provision of adequate veterinary care. The veterinarian must be contacted to provide guidance for the care of these
animals.

3.26(d)FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The barn in which the guinea pigs are housed have poured concrete pads that are separated by exposed dirt. The
primary enclosures for the guinea pigs are located just behind one area of exposed dirt floor. This dirt flooring is not
substantially impervious to moisture and cannot be sanitized. All interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities
must be constructed and maintained such that they are substantially waterproof and readily sanitized. The flooring
in this area must be modified or replaced to ensure it is impervious to moisture and easily cleaned.

3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Approximately 30% of the enclosures in the facility are noted to have excessive buildup of wet bedding and organic
debris, and the walls of the enclosures have a dull brown layer of material coating the sides where the guinea pigs
contact the walls. All of the enclosures with the breeding animals have a buildup of wet bedding material and a wet,
brown slurry around the waterers and the drainpipes. This buildup is preventing the water from draining out of the
enclosure, resulting in very wet bedding around the waterers. Primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized
often enough to prevent the accumulation of excreta or other debris, and they must be cleaned and effectively
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. These enclosures must be cleaned.
