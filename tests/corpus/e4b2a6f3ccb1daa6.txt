3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the morning of July 9, 2018 a keeper found a young male ringtail, Stevie, with his tail caught in the space
between the metal wall and the wall of the building of his enclosure. The grey fox in the adjacent enclosure chewed
off approximately 12 cm of the distal tail of the ringtail. He was also missing the 3rd and 4th digit claws of his left
front paw, along with a partial thickness laceration on the medial aspect of the 3rd digit. The damaged portion of the
tail was amputated and he is currently recovering in the medical building.
Enclosures for all animals must be constructed in a manner so that they contain the animals securely, in order to
protect the animals from injury.
The staff has now sealed the gap between the metal wall and the wall of the building of the enclosure, ensuring the
animals housed in either enclosure cannot have access to each other. The facility should continue to monitor all
enclosures to ensure that they adequately contain the animals housed within. A system of timely identification,
maintenance, and repair of facilities must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of all animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
