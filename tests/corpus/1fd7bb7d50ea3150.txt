Several of the goats have overgrown hooves that require trimming. These include goats #3, #33, #25, and #26.
Overgrown hooves can lead to lameness and make movement difficult. It can also stress ligaments and joints from
the abnormal movement. These animals were previously identified during the inspection conducted on March 1,
2018.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

The facility has repaired and repainted the north side of the barn. Most of the fencing for the animals has also been
upgraded; however, one of the metal gates in the back pasture was found off of the top hinge and leaning over.
The compromised position of the gate could result in an animal injury.
A system of routine monitoring and preventative maintenance of buildings, fences and equipment must be
maintained by the facility.
The gate was repaired at the time of inspection.
