2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1330 on
11-APR-18.
I have attempted to make contact several time in the past 3 mths to conduct an inspection. You stated you are no
longer in business so I provided a cancellation form but there has been no official notification received in the office.
I am providing another cancellation form with the report. Until the license is cancelled you are still subject to
required unannounced inspections Please send official notification of cancellation or an update of your business
contact hours to the address below. Thanks.
