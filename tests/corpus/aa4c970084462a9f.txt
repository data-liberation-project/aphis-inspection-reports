FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Although some new cages have been added, approximately half of the sugar gliders are still housed in cages with
rust on the cage bars. The corner of one cage tray housing a short tail opossum is broken due to rust. Rust
weakens the strength of the wire and may result in broken wires causing animal injury or escape. Rusted surfaces
cannot be properly sanitized .Cages must be maintained in good conditon to prevent injury or escape.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There are now empty cages, clean food dishes and other materials stacked on the shelves housing
the hedgehogs and scattered around the room. Materials not used in the daily care of the animals must be stored in
a dedicated area and not intermingled with animal enclosures to ensure proper husbandry practices.
There is a large amount of spilled feed on the floor under the sugar glider cages. This is serving as an attractant for
flies and other pests. All spilled food and bedding must be removed from floors on a more frequent schedule to
facilitate husbandry practices.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There were a large number of flies and small moths in the sugar glider room . The large amount of spilled feed
under the sugar glider cages is a fly attractant. Keeping rooms free of spilled feed will aid in reducing the pest
problem .An effective and safe pest control program must be established and maintained.
