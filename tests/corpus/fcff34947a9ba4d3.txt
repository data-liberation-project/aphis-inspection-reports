3.84(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The top of the four wooden beams which comprise the resting platform within the indoor section of the primary
enclosure housing a single male capuchin are coated with a firm, thick, dark brown material resembling that of
excreta. These wooden surfaces are in direct contact with the animal. Primary enclosures must be sanitized at
least once every two weeks to prevent an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, waste and excreta to minimize
disease hazards and for the health and well being of the animal. Sanitizing enclosures on a regular basis is part of
a good disease control program.
