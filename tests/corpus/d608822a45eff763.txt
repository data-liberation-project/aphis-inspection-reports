FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.125 (a) Structural Strength. The hanging pouch inside the enclosure housing 2 adult sugar gliders has several
holes with fraying edges. The holes are large enough that the animals could potentially get caught/tangle in and
cause injuries. Maintain housing facilities so that they are structurally sound, in good repair and protect the animals
from injuries.
