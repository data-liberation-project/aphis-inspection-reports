3.127(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
On July 30, 2018, a Yorkshire boar (#10) weighing 563 lbs.was removed from its primary enclosure at
approximately 8 a.m. and placed in a connecting alleyway. No shade or water was provided for the animal and the
caretaker forgot to return the pig to the enclosure after the cleaning procedure. At approximately 1:20 p.m. the pig
was discovered dead in the alleyway. Historical reports of ambient temperatures that day ranged from 75-101
degrees. Large pigs are particularly sensitive to heat stress and hyperthermia. The presumed cause of death,
undisputed by necropsy results, was heat stroke. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight and lack of water likely
contributed to the death of this animal.
When sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort of an animal sufficient shade shall be provided to allow
an animal kept out doors to protect themselves from direct sunlight.
The information regarding this adverse event was not previously reported to the USDA and was provided to this
inspector during the inspection process. Review of IACUC documentation from the August 2018 minutes and a
related adverse event document indicate that the responsible employee was terminated and the location director
would review facility policies and procedures. It could not be determined during this inspection if sufficient
corrections and preventative measures had been implemented to prevent re-occurrences of this non-compliance.
The IACUC should review and evaluate all corrections and preventative measures associated with this
non-compliance. Correct by: October 10, 2018.
This inspection was conducted with multiple CMP and compliance staff September 4-6, 2018.
The exit interview was conducted on September 10, 2018 with the IO, IACUC chair, interim CMP executive director,
compliance director and other compliance staff.
