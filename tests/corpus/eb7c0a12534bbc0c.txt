FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A female hedgehog was discovered loose on the floor during the inspection. The hedgehog was observed behind
the bedding container outside of the hedgehog room. The license holder returned the hedgehog to its clear plastic
tote enclosure (labeled HH16) and indicated that it has repeatedly escaped. The hedgehog could injure itself
escaping from the enclosure.
Assure the hedgehog is housed in an enclosure that will securely contain it.
