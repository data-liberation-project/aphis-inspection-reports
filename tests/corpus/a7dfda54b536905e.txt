2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A polypay ewe, # E171, is observed with a severe eye condition. The left eye is protruding outward and is covered by a
matt of brown bedding and feed material. The normal structures of the eye are not visible. The eye is actively draining a
foul-smelling fluid which has resulted in matting of the wool on the left side of the face. The licensees stated that they
discussed the condition of the ewe with their veterinarian a month prior to the inspection, and provided antibiotics and
anti-inflammatories at that time. However, the licensees have not recently treated or communicated the worsening
condition of the eye with the attending veterinarian.

Diseases or injuries to the eyes can be painful to sheep, and can potentially affect other systems of the body and the
overall health of the animal if left untreated.

The licensee must implement and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that includes methods to prevent,
control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The sheep must be evaluated by a Licensed Veterinarian for further
diagnosis and treatment of its health issues.

3.129(b) Critical

Feeding.
During the inspection, three adult, polypay ewes (#123, 073, E184) were found dead as they were wedged between the
enclosure fence and the self-feeder in pen 1 of the large sheep shed. The pen has approximately 50 adult ewes with their
lambs and only one self-feeder for grain, which has approximately 4 feet of space for eating on two sides. It appears that
the three sheep were pushed down by the other sheep while trying to eat from the feeder, and were unable to rise as the
other sheep continued to trample them which resulted in their death. The licensee stated that they feed the sheep grain
twice a day, and the ewes had not been entrapped when they fed grain earlier that morning. During the inspection, the
licensee moved the self-feeder to allow for additional space for the ewes to access the feed without risk of entrapment.

Failure to provide a sufficient quantity of easily accessible food receptacles can cause competition between the sheep
which can result in injury or decreased feed intake in less dominant or smaller animals.

The licensee must provide a sufficient quantity of food receptacles which are accessible to all animals in the enclosure.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and his son.
