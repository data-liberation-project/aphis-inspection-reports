Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
During the IACUC semi-annual inspection conducted in Oct. 2021, there were deficiencies noted that were identified as
being significant. The correction date of the significant finding was to be completed by the end of Nov. 2021 but was not
confirmed as being corrected until Dec. 9, 2021. The facility did not report this lapse in correction until early Jan. 2022,
which was more than 15 business days past the original correction date.
If program or facility deficiencies are noted, the reports must contain a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with
dates for correcting each deficiency. Any failure to adhere to the plan and schedule that results in a significant deficiency
remaining uncorrected shall be reported in writing within 15 business days to APHIS and any Federal agency funding that
activity.

Corrective actions taken include highlighting any significant findings in a bold red font and adding a more thorough
method to track progress of completion, such as calendar reminders.

Correct by adhering to correction dates set for deficiencies noted during semi-annual inspections.
Corrected actions in place prior to inspection date.


2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
*On Nov. 30, 2021, a male Cynomolgus macaque (~1.5-2 kg), a stock animal, was found dead in a slide style restraint
chair while out for a routine cage change/sanitization. It was the second time these primates had been placed in restraint
chairs. Also, during this restraint period, there was a female that had to be removed from the chair due to not acclimating
well to the restraint and was placed into a slide and clip style chair with no further issues. Prior to this date, it was noted
that a male had to be removed due to not acclimating well to the restraint and was placed into a slide and clip style chair
with no further issues. He was persistently trying to escape from the chair and appeared to be compromising his
respirations in the attempt. There were two (2) technicians present during the routine cage change/sanitization, one
primarily observing the primates in the chairs and the other cleaning/sanitizing the animal room.

*On March 10, 2022, a male Cynomolgus macaque (~1.5 kg), a stock animal, was found unresponsive in a restraint chair
during an animal room sanitization. He was removed from the chair and the veterinary staff was immediately notified.
Upon veterinary exam, no respiratory effort or pulse was noted, and he was pronounced dead. It was the second time he
had been placed in a restraint chair which was equipped with a slide style top. Shortly after this incident on the same day,
a second primate began to show signs of distress in a slide style restraint chair, and he was immediately removed from
the chair and given oxygen before recovering. There were at least three (3) technicians in very close proximity. Mitigation
efforts were planned to modify the chairs in this building to restrain the collar only but were delayed due to a shortage of
hardware. Approximately 50% of the chairs had already been modified and the remaining were modified by the end of the
day.

The previous style of the primate restraint chairs (slide style), in combination with the primate collars and size of the


primates available, did not adequately protect the animals from injury during handling.

*On Dec. 7, 2021, a male pig (5M024, repeat dose toxicity study) was evaluated due to lameness that had persisted since
Dec. 6, following a toxicokinetic blood collection, during which manual restraint was used. Upon palpation of the right
distal hind limb, the Attending Veterinarian noted swelling and crepitus, as well as a likely fracture of the mid-tibia. Deep
palpation, further diagnostics and treatment were not performed due to the scheduled necropsy of this animal on that day.
Euthanasia and necropsy occurred after the examination (on Dec. 7). Necropsy revealed fractures in both the tibia and
fibula.

Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

Corrective actions already taken for the primates: the restraint chairs have been modified, additional monitoring has been
instigated and there is a plan to review and implement an acclimation process.

Correct by further evaluating handling techniques and devices, conduct appropriate training or re-training as needed, and
evaluate methods of monitoring, to include the importance of proper care and monitoring of all animals.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
A female pig (#3088782, 4F053) was witnessed on Aug 19, 2021, as being loose from her primary enclosure with a male
pig (4M023). This was recorded as a potential mis-mating between the animals, as this facility does not breed animals.
On Sept. 16, 2021, the female was administered inhalation anesthesia by mask for Lutalyse injections to terminate any


potential pregnancy.

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor
and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.

Correct by evaluating all enclosures (primary and secondary) and repairing as needed to protect and contain the animals.
Correction date: June 17, 2022
