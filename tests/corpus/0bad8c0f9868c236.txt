ANNUAL REPORT.
In April 2015, a study on hamsters involving mucositis and topical compound administration, resulted in 3 of the
animals being found dead. These hamsters were reported as having had an adverse reaction to the study
compound. The facility's annual report submitted to USDA for fiscal year 2015 does not categorize those 3
hamsters as a pain/ distress category "E".
Correct from this point forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
