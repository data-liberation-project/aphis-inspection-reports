Facilities, general.
During this inspection it was noted that the unopened bags of food and bedding were being stored directly on the floor.
Due to the number of aquatic tanks and equipment in this area the floor does get wet. These supplies need to be stored in
a manner that keeps them free from deterioration, molding or contamination.

This was corrected by the end of the day.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
While reviewing the records it was noted that there was no documentation for the disposition of 2 goats and 2 hedgehogs.
The paperwork on the newly acquired Bengal cats did not include the Driver’s license # and vehicle plate #’s of the seller.
All records need to include name, address and the USDA number of the person the animal was bought from. If they do
not have a USDA number their Driver’s license # and their vehicle plate # needs to be obtained. The date of the
transaction, the species of animal(s), and the number of animals in the shipment also need to be documented. All records
need to be kept current and accurate.

2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
1. The capybera enclosure has an approximately 4ft tall wooden wall along the public walkway. This wall also has a door
built into it for entrance/exit purposes. However, up until August 2020, this door was kept unlocked. In August a member
of the public was able to enter the capybara enclosure, by opening and walking through this door, in the absence of staff
presence. This incident was confirmed by employees who reported that the animal was not injured because of this
incident. The facility corrected this item by placing a lock on the door to prevent further entry by the public. The facility
must ensure that during exhibition, there is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the viewing public.

This item has been corrected with the addition and implementation of the functioning locks that were present at the time of
this inspection

2. An incident occurred in July 2020 when a small child was bitten by one of the otters during public feeding. The injury to
the child was minor as his/her skin was not broken. At the time, the otter was able to reach the child’s fingers via the PVC
pipe that runs through the plexiglass wall. The facility has in place PVC pipe “elbows” that run through the plexiglass
barrier between the otters and public. Those elbows have a 1’ long PVC straight pipe that runs down the wall on the otter
side. This straight pipe restricts the otters from gaining access to the elbow piece where they could fit through enough to
contact the visitor’s fingers as they place food. At the time this incident occurred, one of those straight pipe pieces was
missing and the otter encounter was still conducted. The child placed their hand into the elbow piece and the otter was
able to reach in and nip his fingers. The facility must ensure that during public exhibition, there is minimal risk of harm to
the animals and public with sufficient distance and /or barriers between the animals and public.


The facility has addressed this item by instructing all employees to ensure that the enclosure is secure before an
encounter is conducted with the public.
2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
In June 2020, an employee entered the otter enclosure with otters present to perform assigned husbandry duties. When
the otters started to jump on and around him/her, the employee reacted by hitting the animals with a metal food bowl.
The facility reported that the animals were not injured as a result of this incident and the employee was removed from
duty as part of the corrective actions. The facility must ensure that the animals are handled in a manner that does not
cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

This item has been corrected by the removal of the employee and training on proper otter handling for remaining staff.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a representative of the licensee.
