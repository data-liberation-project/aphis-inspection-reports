3.78(d) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
** The rhesus and bonnet macaque and the lemur outdoor enclosures did not have a 6 foot perimeter fence around
the enclosures. The north side of the bonnet and rhesus macaque enclosure needs a perimeter fence of no less
than 6 ft. The south and east side of the lemurs enclosure requires no less than a 6 ft perimeter fence. All outdoor
non-human primate enclosures must be enclosed by a 6 foot high perimeter fence. The fence must be constructed
in a manner so that it restricts unauthorized humans, and animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from
going through it or under it and having contact with the non-human primates. The facility must enclose the outdoor
non-human primates housing by a 6 foot perimeter fence to protect the non-human primates.
3.84(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
** In Joe the chimpanzee's indoor primary enclosure there was an excessive accumulation of debris on the old
insulation above him. In and around his enclosure there is also an excessive amount of dust. The indoor primary
enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and as often as necessary to prevent an excessive
accumulation of dust, debris and/or disease hazard.
3.84(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the stall next to Joe the chimpanzee's primary indoor enclosure there was an abundance of dusty linen piled up
from corner to corner. Areas around the animals quarters must be kept clean to reduce or eliminate breeding and
living areas for rodents, pests, and vermin. Correct by July 9, 2015
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The shelter for the cavies in their primary enclosure had nails pointing into the inside of it. The animals could
potentially harm themselves while being inside of the shelter. Please remove the pointy ends of the nails to ensure
good health and well-being of the animals.** The fencing of the primary enclosure for "Rainbow" the lion is being encroached by the surrounding bamboo that
has overgrown along the rear of the enclosure. The branches pushing down on the fencing could shorten the height
allowing animals to escape or cause it to be in disrepair. Please clear the bamboo from the fencing to ensure the
containment of the animals.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
** PVC piping used to transfer food items into the bear's enclosures had a noticeable brown and green organic film
extending the length of the inside of the pipe so that it comes into direct contact with the food items. Inadequate
sanitation practices can contaminate food items or attract insects or vermin. PVC piping used to transfer food items
must be clean and sanitized on a regular basis.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
** The chinchilla has feces and debris on the bottom of its cage that needs to be cleaned more frequently. The
licensee stated that it had been about 2 weeks since it was last cleaned. Excreta shall be removed from primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize
disease hazards.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
** In the preparation room the ceiling is covered in old degraded insulation that is slowly deteriorating allowing
particles to fall sporadically all over the room. This doesn't make for a suitable environment to prepare food that is
being fed to the animals. The facility needs to dust and clean the preparation area to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices set forth. Also repairing or replacing the ceiling could alleviate the accumulation of particles,
dust and debris.
