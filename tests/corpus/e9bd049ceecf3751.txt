SANITATION.
***The ferrets on protocol 14-01-006B that were housed three to a cage had an excessive amount of feces within
their primary enclosures. Generally the feces was located in the far back corner of the cage. With the ferrets
indiscretions while playing, themselves and their ball came in contact with the feces. In order to minimize the
animals contact with their feces the frequency of cleaning the enclosures should be increased. Excreta shall be
removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein
and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. Correct by April 19, 2014.
The exit briefing was conducted with the Attending Veterinarian.
