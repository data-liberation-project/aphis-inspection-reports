ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facilities current Program of Veterinarian Care is missing specific guidance on dosage, method of
administration and frequency/routine of administration on the medications and vaccinations that are currently listed.
Without specific guidance from the attending veterinarian, there is no way to ensure the animals are receiving the
appropriate veterinarian care and treatment. The written Program of Veterinary Care must provide specific guidance
from the Attending Veterinarian on the proper dosage, method of administration and frequency/routine of
administration for all medications and vaccinations listed.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
This facility allows the public to hand feed their goats. The public is able to walk directly up to the animals enclosure
and pet or feed them. During today's inspection, there is an area next to the enclosure where activities are set up
for the public. There is an attendant in this area overseeing the activities. However; they are not dedicated to the
animals' area. In addition, there are several areas of the fence line that cannot be properly observed from the area
with the attendant. All handling or contact with the animals must be done in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary discomfort to the animals. Without a barrier between the animals
and the public or without an attending present at all times of public contact, this facility is not able to monitor the
public's interactions with the animals. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant
must be present at all times during periods of public contact or a barrier must be provided with a sufficient distance
between the animals and the public as to minimize the risk of harm to the animals and to the public..

SANITATION. The facility is currently using a three sided structure as shelter for their goats. Inside the structure there are several
bird nests and bird droppings on most of the solid surfaces. In addition, there are several areas with piles of old
molding bird droppings. Birds can be carries of several communicable diseases. There is an increased chance of
these animals being exposed to the hazards without the facility having an affective pest control program or affective
program for cleaning and/or eliminating the droppings, This facility must ensure that establish and maintain an
affective pest control program.
