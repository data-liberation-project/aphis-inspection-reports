3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Large amounts of clutter including several empty animal cages and crates was present in the pen housing the
pregnant sow. A fence panel separating the sow from this area had been knocked down by the sow. This can
provide a habitat for vermin to breed and hide and present safety hazards. Animal housing areas should be kept
clear of trash and debris at all times. Corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
