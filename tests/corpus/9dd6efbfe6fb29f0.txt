SANITATION.
Excessive amounts of dead insects are present in the freezer that contains sacks of animal feed. The freezer is not
plugged in and is used to store dry animal feed only. No live insects were observed in the animal feed. The dead
insects could potentially contaminate the feed, clean and sanitize the food storage freezer and repeat as often as
necessary to promote animal health.
