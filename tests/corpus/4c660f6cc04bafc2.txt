2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Section 2.31(e)(4) IACUC: Section 14.5 in the new proposal format no longer specifies the facility SOP describing
how pain will be addressed, if pain does occur as a result of the nature of the test article being used. Section 6.3.1
in proposal 2200-06 for anesthetic and/or analgesic treatment is not clearly written for the continued administration
of buprenorphine. The terms "at the discretion of the Study Director" and "may be administered" are not adequate.
Pain must be relieved unless withholding relief is justified for scientific reasons in writing in the proposal. A proposal
to conduct an activity involving animals must include a description of procedures designed to assure that discomfort
and pain to animals will be limited to that which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research,
including provisions for the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquillizing drugs where indicated and appropriate to
minimize discomfort and pain to animals. Proposal 2200-06 must clearly describe the administration of
buprenorphine to the rabbits. All proposals must include or specifically reference how pain to animals will be
addressed. Correct by March 26, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility institutional official.
