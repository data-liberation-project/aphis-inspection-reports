(b)(2)
There was an adult, female Shih Tzu housed in the last adult sheltered housing area. The animal appeared thin,
was lethargic and would not stand when prompted. The kennel staff removed her from her enclosure and positioned
the dog in a standing position. The dog would not support her weight and sunk to a laying position. Upon palpation
the dogs, ribs, vertebrae and hips were protruding and her gums were pale. The licensee stated that they had
noticed the dog was underweight and had recently treated the dog for parasites. Abnormal behavior, extreme
weight loss and lethargy may be the indication of a serious medical condition. The licensee shall obtain a written
diagnosis and treatment plan from a licensed veterinarian. The prescribed treatment should be provided as directed
and the treatment should be documented. All documents should be available at the time of the nest inspection.
