ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult (age unknown), male grey kangaroo has been in declining health since March 2018 and was last examined
by a veterinarian about 3 weeks ago. The primary symptom exhibited by the kangaroo is weight loss and little
improvement has been seen after treatment according to the licensee. There is no available diagnosis or current
treatment plan in place for this animal.
During this inspection the kangaroo was noted to be thin with hip bones protruding and little visible muscle mass
and body fat especially in the hindquarters and tail. General body condition appeared poor.The animal was initially
sternally recumbent and when invited to rise by the licensee did so slowly and reluctantly and appeared unsteady in
a standing position.
Because the kangaroo has shown little improvement to prior treatment and continues to exhibit symptoms that can
indicate compromised health status and/or continued illness the animal should be re-examined by a veterinarian
and a new treatment plan formulated for ongoing care. Correct by: May 14, 2018.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Guinea pigs are currently housed at this facility in an exhibit that contains an indoor enclosure with climate control
potential attached to an outdoor open air exhibit. The guinea pigs are free to access either area at will and are not
restricted from outdoor access. During this inspection most of the guinea pigs were in the outdoor exhibit portion.
Guinea pigs do not tolerate temperature extremes well and are susceptible to heat stroke in high temperatures.
Temperatures in this region routinely exceed 85 degrees in the summer months. Housing of guinea pigs outdoors is
restricted under the Animal Welfare Act unless facilities are located in an appropriate climate for outdoor housing
and prior approval has been obtained from the Deputy Administrator. The licensee has indicated he plans to apply
for a variance for outdoor housing. Correct by: June 10, 2018.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
