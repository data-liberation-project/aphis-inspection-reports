TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The wolf hybrid dogs are identified by microchip and name, with a photo of each animal in the office. The tags for
each animal does not include the individual number, just the name and are all hanging on the fence. The licensee

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The APHIS form 7005, Dogs and Cats on Hand, is incomplete at the time of inspection. The acquisition and
disposition records were not documented and there were no records of the animals that were born on the premises.
Accurate records must be maintained to know the animal's identity and to facilitate tracking of the animals. A system
of records must be kept and maintained for all animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or
otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The exterior gates to the primary enclosures had been recently reinforced with wire around the gates. The wire was
ragged and loose with sharp points on the exterior gate to the SW and NW enclosure, and the exterior gate to the
courtyard, which was regularly used by the wolf-dogs. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so
that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the wolf-dogs, in order to protect the wolf-dogs from injury.
There must be a system of maintenance in place to ensure that primary enclosures are kept in good repair.
