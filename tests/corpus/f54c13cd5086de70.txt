Watering.
Several of the pools in various animal enclosures needed to be cleaned. The water was a very dark greenish color.
Neither the sides nor the bottom of the pools could be seen.
Although the animals had clean potable water in their enclosures to drink, allowing the animals access to pools this dirty is
a health hazard due to the mosquito larvae, algae overgrowth, and bacteria in the water.
All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary. The facility must ensure the pools are cleaned regularly or empty
for the health of the animals.

Sanitation.
One of the bobcat cages had an excessive accumulation of old feces, hair, and other debris. According to the facility
representative, this bobcat will not go into its shift enclosure so only two people are able to go into the enclosure with the
bobcat to clean. One of these people was on vacation for the past 10 days.
Enclosures with dirt floors must be spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid
contact with excreta, or as often as necessary to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors. This enclosure is


approximately 8’x8’. It is not large enough for the bobcat to avoid a 10-day accumulation of waste and debris.
The bobcat enclosure needs to be cleaned more frequently. Options the facility might consider are: (1) train additional
people to work with this bobcat (2) desensitize and train the bobcat to go into his lockdown (3) move the bobcat to an
enclosure that is safer and easier to work in if the bobcat will not go into his lockdown.
