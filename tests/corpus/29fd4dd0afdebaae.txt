ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Some of the woodchucks had areas of missing or patchy fur. Two of the woodchucks were observed to have small
dime sized red areas on their heads. These conditions had not yet been addressed. Veterinary attention is required
in order to rule out medical causes for the red areas and hair loss, and to determine the most appropriate treatment.
The facility needs to correct this issue.

The primate enrichment plan had not been updated by the attending veterinarian to include the recently acquired
baboons or squirrel monkey. Currently there is only one squirrel monkey at the facility and it is singly housed. An
enrichment plan which has been approved and signed by the attending veterinarian must be available in order to
verify that the primates at the facility are being provided appropriate enrichment. The facility needs to address this
issue.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The watering troughs for the hyenas were unlevel allowing water to continuously run over the side of the trough and
into the shelter. This caused an area of stagnant water. Stagnant water can collect bacteria and create unhealthy
conditions for the animals. Appropriate methods for drainage must be in place in order to prevent water from
accumulating in areas in the facility. The facility needs to correct this issue.

FEEDING.
The facility was not able to produce a written plan describing the diet being fed to the big cats. A documented
description of big cat diets which has been approved by the attending veterinarian must be available for inspection.
This is to verify that an age and species appropriate diet is being fed. The facility needs to correct this issue.

SANITATION.
In the area inside and around the red fox enclosure there were many dried up and crusted leftover chicken bones.
Some of these bones had been removed from the enclosure but were not removed from the area, and were left on
the ground immediately outside the enclosure. This unsanitary condition can cause a health hazard to the animals.
Leftover food debris needs to be removed from the area in a timely manner so as not to attract flies and other pests.
The facility needs to correct this issue.
