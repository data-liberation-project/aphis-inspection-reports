3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The enclosure housing 2 llamas and 47 goats behind the house has an interior
woven wire fence that has detached from the bottom of the third wood fence post. This has created a gap under the
wire fencing where the fencing has pulled up away from the ground. Goats were observed going under the wire
fencing at the time of the inspection instead of going through the fence opening. There are broken wires in the
lower portion of the fence by the third wood fence post that may injure the goats. Animal enclosures must be
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by repairing, replacing
or removing this damaged section of wire fencing and by ensuring the wire fencing is securely attached to the fence
posts. Correct by April 27, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
