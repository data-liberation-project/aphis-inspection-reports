ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are new animals at the facility including, 2 hedgehogs, 1 sugar glider, 4 Degus' and 1 Serval cat. The current
program of veterinary care has not been updated to include the veterinarian requirements and expectations of care
for each of these species. There is not a written program of an acceptable diet plan that should be provided for the
Serval that is approved by the attending veterinarian.
A complete program of vet care is required to provide any information by the attending veterinarian on specific care
and monitoring needs requested by the veterinarian for proper care and management of the regulated animals.
The licensee must have the attending veterinarian provide information in their requirements for care of each species
of regulated animals. This would include and not limited to vaccinations, de-worming if needed, monitoring, ecto
parasite control, diet plans, supplements etc. The licensee should provide a diet plan that is approved by the
attending veterinarian for the Serval including any supplements, if required.
