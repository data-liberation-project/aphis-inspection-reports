FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility currently houses two camels, one nilgai and two African Crested porcupines, water buffalo, zebu and
watusi. None of these animals are currently in enclosures that have a secondary or perimeter fence. The facility has
a perimeter fence variance for the watusi only at this time. A perimeter fence is necessary to contain animals that
may escape their primary enclosure and to prevent unwanted animals or people from having contact with the
animals. The facility shall construct a secondary perimeter fence for the above listed animals or shall obtain a
variance from the Regional Office. Correct by Dec. 15, 2014.
