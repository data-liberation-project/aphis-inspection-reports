TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* There was no record of inventory present on seven recently weaned puppies born at the facility. No inventory
information was attached to one shelter enclosure containing the seven recently weaned puppies. If any puppy
born on the premise has been recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the enclosure must have the following
information attached to it: dealer's USDA license number, the letters (cid:28) USDA (cid:28) and the number identifying each
puppy in that litter. If no offspring have been recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the following information
must be recorded and attached to the enclosure. The dealer's USDA number, the number identifying each puppy,
the date of birth of the litter, the dam's ID number, a description of each puppy ( breed, sex, color and any distinctive
markings ). The inventory information records must be maintained with all corresponding 7006's for one year. If
the licensee chooses to identify the "unweaned" puppies with official USDA identification ( collar, tattoo or microchip
), then no inventory information is required on the enclosure. Complete and accurate records are needed to
ensure that every puppy's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace all puppies. The
licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all puppies at all times at their facility. To be corrected
from this day forward.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Gaps, broken pieces of cement and holes in the cement flooring were observed in at least five outdoor
enclosures housing seven dogs. Gaps and holes in the cement flooring can allow accumulations of dirt, debris,
food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards to collect creating unsanitary conditions for the dogs. In addition,
the affected surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must fill all gaps with a material that
will allow the cement surfaces to be readily cleaned and sanitized on a routine basis. Correct by 3/9/15.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* There is no bedding in the shelter structures in five outdoor enclosures housing 11 dogs. The ambient
temperature at the conclusion of the inspection was recorded by the inspector's kestrel as 44.2 degrees F. In
addition, according to the (cid:28)NOAA(cid:29) website (weather.gov) for the licensee's zip code, the lowest temperaturerecorded in the last 24 hours in the area was 32 degrees F. Dogs that are not provided dry bedding when the
ambient temperatures are low can have a difficult time maintaining a safe body temperature. The licensee must
provide dry bedding when the ambient temperatures are below 50 degrees F, and additional bedding when the
temperature is below 35 degrees F. To be corrected by end of the day today.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* High grass, used tires, electric cords, plastic containers and various other miscellaneous items were observed
accumulating on the west side of the north outside runs housing five dogs. Accumulations of trash, junk, high
grasses and discarded matter around the premise can provide a living area for rodents, other pests & vermin.
Keeping premises free of trash, junk, high grasses and discarded matter is necessary for the welfare of the dogs.
The licensee must ensure that the premise and surrounding grounds must be kept free of accumulations of trash,
junk, waste products and discarded matter at all times. Correct by 3/9/15.
* The facility inspection done on 2/9/15 and exit briefing done on 2/10/15 were conducted with the licensee.
