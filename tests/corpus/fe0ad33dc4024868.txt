ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:15 PM on
06-Sep-16.
Spoke on the phone with the director upon arrival. She indicated that because they were in the middle of a medical
procedure they were not able to bring me inside the facility for an inspection that day.
