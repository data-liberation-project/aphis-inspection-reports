ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility does not have an enrichment program for its individually housed tamarin. NHP are very social animals
and require enrichment to maintain their psychological well-being. Therefore, it is the facilities responsibility in
conjunction with their AV to provide enhancement of the environment. When there are individually housed NHP that
are unable to see and hear NHP of their own or a compatible species a program of enhancement must be
established and maintained.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The lynx and fox perimeter fence door had an approximately 6 inch gap at the bottom and was not 6 feet tall.
Animals without a proper perimeter fence are potentially exposed to unauthorized persons and/or animals having
contact with them. The perimeter fence also acts as a secondary containment to prevent escape from the facility
which may lead to injury or death. All outdoor facilities housing non-dangerous animals must be enclosed by a
perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet tall to be used as a secondary containment for the animals and prevent
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it.

their primary diet. The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity
and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The lynx must be fed an appropriate diet to prevent
disease and injury.
