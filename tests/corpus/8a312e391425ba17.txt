2.31(c)(1)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Semi-annual program reviews and facility inspections were conducted by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) on January 19, 2019 and then not again until January 22, 2020. The IACUC is required to review, at
least every six months, the facility's program for the humane care and use of animals. Failure to conduct these reviews
semi-annually could result in lapses in the care and treatment of the animals, or failure to adhere to requirements under
the Animal Welfare Act.

The facility should resume an appropriate schedule for semi-annual program review and inspections from this time
forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
