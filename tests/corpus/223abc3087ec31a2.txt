ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***At the time of inspection, medical records supplied to APHIS VMO's indicate a female bobcat (DOB 5/8/14) was
under treatment beginning 17-Sept-14 for injury to her right arm and collar bone. The facility's veterinarian
prescribed a treatment plan which included: administration of polyflex every 24 hrs. for 5 days and Baytril every 24
hrs. for 10 days. The animal should have received polyflex on September 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st. Records
show that the animal did not receive polyflex on 19-Sep-14 and 21-Sep-14. The records also show the last
administration of any medication to this animal was on 21-Sep-14. According to the prescribed treatment plan from
the veterinarian, the animal should have received Baytril from September 17th through September 26th. The facility
treated with Baytril for only 5 days (should have been 10 days). At the time of inspection, the facility could not
supply any additional documentation of medication administration or a new treatment plan from their veterinarian.
Failure to follow the prescribed treatment plan from the veterinarian can lead to inadequate treatment, prolonged
injury with any associated pain and distress for the animal. From this time forward, the facility should maintain
documentation of medication administration or any changes to treatment plans as directed by their veterinarian.
***One rabbit was noted by the APHIS VMO(cid:25)s to be squinting and had a clear discharge and reddened tissue in the
corners of both eyes. The facility representatives stated that this problem had been noted before and it had been
treated by wiping the eyes with Vetricyn. Reddened tissue and discharge from the eyes may indicate an underlying
inflammatory or infectious problem and, if not properly diagnosed and treated, may lead to a painful condition or
loss of vision.
The licensee contacted their veterinarian by email following the inspection. The licensee still must have this animal
examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on November 19, 2014, to obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate
treatment plans for the issue cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided to the inspector upon
request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those
tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and
entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the
animals.There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of the animal
at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and the
need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The enclosure housing 3 collared peccaries had several areas in which the lathe (metal framework) under the
gunite was exposed and twisted with sharp points. The building materials were not maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury or to contain the animals. Failure to maintain housing and exhibit facilities in a
structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. The affected structures must be repaired or replaced and
all facilities should be maintained and kept structurally sound to protect and contain the animals moving forward.
To be corrected by 11/28/14.
***The enclosure housing 3 collared peccaries had an area in which the concrete had chipped off exposing a black
tarp which appeared to have been chewed on. The building materials were not maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury (ingestion of a foreign body) or to contain the animals. Failure to maintain housing and
exhibit facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. The affected structures must be
repaired or replaced and all facilities should be maintained and kept structurally sound to protect and contain the
animals moving forward.
Corrected during the inspection.
***Indoor/outdoor carpet in the enclosure for 1 juvenile bobcat, Kiara, had frayed edges with long strands of the
carpet fibers accessible. The frayed strands pose a risk to this animal for ingestion and intestinal obstruction.
Corrected during the inspection.
***The metal roof on a hay bunk in the enclosure housing 7 white bison had bent edges with sharp points
protruding. These edges are at head-height and pose a risk of injury to the animals.
To be corrected 11/24/2014.
***The inspection was conducted with the chief operating officer and two APHIS VMO's.
***The exit briefing was conducted on 11/18/14 with the chief operating officer and two APHIS VMO's.Additional Inspectors
