ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1745 on
05-Jun-17. I went to the licensee's house. His parents answered and said the licensee was out of town. They said
there was no one available to do an inspection with me. I told them I would try again another time.
End of report.
