2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Male Pomeranian (“Gunner”, microchip #956000000387658) has excessively matted hair coat across the back of
both hindquarters, across the top of the rump, and on the tail. A dark colored material is attached to and trapped
within the heavily matted hair across the hindquarters. The licensee stated that she had acquired the dog in March
and has been unable to fully groom the dog as he is likely to bite. The licensee stated that she has spoken to the
veterinarian about having the dog groomed but no appointment has been set at the time of the inspection. Due to
the dog’s tendency to bite, the licensee was unable to handle the dog to allow the inspector a closer view of the
excessively matted hair coat.
Female Cocker Spaniel (“Lacey”, 900085000209401) has large clumps of matted hair hanging from both of the
ears. The clumps of matted hair are firm to the touch and have a thick, dark colored material coating parts of the
surface of the clump.
Matted hair coats can cause pain and discomfort to the dogs, as well as lead to further health issues.
The licensee must provide the above mentioned dogs with hair coat maintenance and the licensee must ensure that
the hair coats of all animals are adequately maintained at all times.
