2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During inspection I observed a female brown goat (ear tag #IAAF7123) shaking. In addition the goat had flaky skin going
down the middle of its back. The goat wasn't moving much and just laid down with its legs tucked underneath its body
while being observed. The goat appeared to be uncomfortable. The licensee or facility representative had not observed
this prior to inspection. Not conducting proper observations doesn't ensure that health issues like what is noted above will
be identified and brought to the Attending Veterinarian's attention. The goat must be treated by the Attending Veterinarian.
Observations must be conducted daily to identify health issues in a timely manner. Correct by 7/29/22.
2.126(c)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The licensee has not submitted a written itinerary to the Deputy Administrator notifying us of their overnight travels. Not
submitting an itinerary makes it difficult for USDA inspectors to know when and where the licensee's animals will be. It
doesn't allow for APHIS officials to ensure animal welfare is being addressed by the licensee. The licensee must submit
an itinerary to the Deputy Administrator no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel or they must contact the Deputy
Administrator immediately if the licensee accepts an engagement for which travel will begin with less than 48 hours'
notice. Correct by 7/30/22.

2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
While watching the public interact with the camel, kids were observed to be climbing up the panel. Face to face contact
was made between the camel and multiple people. There was no facility representative, employee, or attendant
overseeing the interactions between the camel (or any other animals for that matter) and public or to act as a barrier
between the animals and the public. There were also no physical barriers in place to prevent the public from going right
up to most of the enclosures. Not having proper barriers in place doesn't ensure the safety of the animals or the public. A
barrier must be established to assure the safety of the animals and the public. Correct by 7/29/22.
2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
While watching the public interact with the camel, kids were observed to be climbing up the panel. Face to face contact
was made between the camel and multiple people. There was no facility representative, employee, or attendant
overseeing the interactions between the camel (or any other animals for that matter) and public. There was only 2 staff
members on site during inspection. One of staff members was focused primarily on pony rides while the other was
selling feed for the animals. I did not observe any identifiable employees to be present during public contact with the
animals. Not having enough personnel for the number of and types of animals doesn't ensure the safety of the animals or
the public. The travelling exhibit must be staffed by an adequate number of personnel to ensure the safety of the animals
and people. Correct by 7/29/22.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The corral panel used for the camel enclosure was not secured down tightly. During inspection, I observed a child feeding
the camel. The camel stuck its head up over the panel and pushed its weight against the panel. The panel moved forward
towards the child and the ends of the panel lifted up off the ground. Not having a panel secured tightly so it can’t move

doesn’t ensure the safety of the people near the enclosure or the animal within the enclosure. In addition, if the panel fell
over, the camel could potentially escape its enclosure. Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Facility Representative.

End of report.
