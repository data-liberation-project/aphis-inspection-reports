Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
*** A young llama was observed away from the other llamas in the park and appeared thin with a rough, dull colored hair
coat. This animal does not appear to be thriving compared to other young llamas in the park and could be indicative of
illness. This animals condition was not observed until the inspectors identified it to the park owner. This animal should
have its condition monitored and communicated to the attending vet for guidance in treatment and care.
*** A large female pig in the animal adventure area has overgrown front hooves. Overgrown hooves do not properly
protect the pig’s foot and added pressure on the front hooves can be painful and can cause lameness. In addition, this
animal also has dry flaky skin and some hair loss on the sides. This animal was recently purchased at an auction and
while it’s observed through daily feedings and watering, the condition of the front feet and skin were not identified as a
concern by the attendant and therefore information on the condition of this animal has not been communicated to the
attending veterinarian.
*** The facility recently acquired a litter of piglets from the same location as the adult female. Several of the piglets also
had dry flaky skin and were itching themselves or rubbing against items in the enclosure. One piglet appeared to have red
irritated skin and was continuously rubbing against a bar for an extended period. Again, the condition of the animals was
not noted or communicated to the vet for assessment and potential treatment.


Daily observation at the facility for animal welfare must be conducted by employees and attendants who can recognize
when animal health or condition is compromised and then communicate that information to the attending veterinarian so
timely and accurate information on problems of animal well being are being properly diagnosed and treated.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee did not have accurate records or acquisition forms on the pigs that had just come to the facility. In addition,
multiple animals (rabbits, water buffalo, goats etc) have been sold and there are no records indicating where the animals
went to. Records of animals born at the facility are only added to the records at intermittent times and the count provided
at the time of the inspection is 4 months old and does not account for multiple animals born in recent weeks (llamas,
buffalo, elk, deer, etc). As this is a large facility with frequent animal movements and births, the licensee must ensure that
records are maintained to disclose the information required in this section for accurate record keeping practices.

Handling of animals.
*** This is a large drive through animal park, divided into three different park areas containing large hoof stock freely
roaming. Guests can drive their own vehicles through or ride in a facility driven vehicle. The USDA inspectors drove
through the park and stopped frequently to wait for other vehicles or observe animals. During one stop, the USDA
inspector’s vehicle had six llamas around the vehicle including two babies that were too small to be seen when they were
in front of the car. The USDA inspector’s vehicle could not move for 15 minutes due to safety concerns of the babies and

the potential hazard of driving into a small, young llama. The USDA inspectors noted that the following car behind was
also unable to move for an extended period due to llamas around their vehicle. After an additional 7 minutes a park
employee came over in a 4-wheeler to help move the llamas so the cars could pass. During the self-guided park tour, only
one employee was observed moving around the area between the three park areas, while 7-8 vehicles of guests stopped
to feed and interact with various animal species without a readily identifiable employee present.

*** The facility has a small animal adventure where guests can go into a large fenced area with domestic species of goats,
pigs, alpaca, deer, etc. and feed the animals. The area is staffed with one attendant outside the animal area who is also
selling tickets and food items. At one point during the inspection, there were 16 guests in the area with the animals. This
area is too large with several blind spots where the one attendant cannot see all the animals and guests during periods of
public contact. In addition, this one employee is expected to watch animals and guests down a pathway approximately 50-
60 feet in length with animals on both sides of the path behind fences. The facility needs to address this and add
additional staff to the area to ensure the safety of the animals.
The facility must ensure that a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee is always present during
periods of public contact to be able to ensure the safety of the animals.

Facilities, general.
*** The food storage area has items such as paint, brushes and buckets stored next to animal feed bags. There are also
miscellaneous tools, and cleaning items in between food items. Food stored in close proximity to these items may
potentially get contaminated or deteriorate. The licensee must ensure that supplies of food and bedding are stored in

facilities which adequately protect against deterioration and contamination.
