Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Several dogs had untreated veterinary care issues.
- A 5 year old, black, female pug named "Black Diamond" with ID # 5639 had severe accumulation of dental tartar and
exposed tooth roots on her right upper cheek teeth.
- A 1 year old male poodle named " Rowdy" with ID # 5642 had accumulation of dental tartar and multiple retained
deciduous teeth. He had matted fur on his face, legs, back, backend, hips, and belly area.
- A 15 year old, male, gray and black poodle named " Rowdy" with ID # 069069033 had severe hair matting over the
majority of his body. The mats were very tight to his body on his back, legs, hips, backend, and on his face to the point
where it was difficult to find his ears.

Dental disease can be extremely painful and potentially lead to tooth loss, reluctance to eat, and systemic illness. Hair
matting can lead to severe problems with the underlying skin, including infection and skin sloughing. The animals on the
report must be treated appropriately. The licensee must develop and implement an effective program to control dental
disease and hair coat care.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee doesn't have the record of acquisition form 7005 for any dogs in care. Keeping complete and accurate
records helps maintain accurate veterinary records and to know the certainty of identity and number of dogs.
3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
There are numerous structural problems throughout the facility. Multiple runs have broken wires with exposed sharp
points. At least one indoor/outdoor access door has an exposed metal edge at the same height as the head's of the
enclosed dogs. One enclosure has a large hole in the back wall above the access door. A suspended kennel housing
two miniature pinschers has a large hole in the wire outer wall, with an exposed sharp point. This hole is easily large
enough to allow a dog's head to pass through. Multiple enclosures have sagging and/or leaning walls which need to be
tightened, repaired, or replaced.

Sharp points and edges are a potential source of injury to the enclosed animals. Holes in the walls of the enclosures are
a potential source of injury and/or escape. All sharp points/edges need to be repaired or removed. All holes need to be
patched or repaired. Sagging/leaning walls need to be replaced or repaired. The licensee must maintain the facility in
appropriate condition for the animals housed here.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The outdoor sections of the enclosures at the facility had an excessive accumulation of feces present. In most of these
enclosures the dogs were not able to avoid contact with the fecal matter when using the outdoor runs. The washdowns
under the enclosures had excessive accumulation of fecal material. At least one washdown appeared to have a clogged
drain, resulting in several inches of standing fecal contaminated water.


Accumulation of waste is a source of contamination to the enclosed animals. The presence of excessive waste in the
washdowns underneath the dogs is an attractant to pests and a source of noxious odors for the animals above. Primary
enclosures must be spot cleaned on a daily basis, and the washdowns must be cleaned as often an necessary to prevent
accumulation of waste.

3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There were numerous roaches and other insects present in the interior portion of all three kennel buildings. Roaches
were seen on the walls and within the cages of the dogs and newborn puppies. This is a potential source of
contamination to the enclosed animals. The licensee must implement an effective pest control program to maintain
appropriate sanitation in the facility.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee didn't have a current program of vet care. A current program of vet care that addresses treatment and
prevention of parasites and pests as well as preventative care and treatment of eyes, ears, skin, coats, teeth, and nails is
necessary to ensure proper health and welfare for the dogs.

The licensee must have her program of vet care to include treatment and prevention of parasites and pests as well as
preventative care and treatment of eyes, ears, skin, coats, teeth, and nails. Correction by February 16, 2022.
