inform him that USDA inspectors had arrived to conduct an inspection of the facility. Licensee told the inspector that
he was going to have construction performed on his driveway that afternoon and an inspection would not be able to
be conducted. VMO Engel told the licensee that if they were unable to conduct an inspection, then this would be
considered an attempted inspection. Licensee confirmed that he understood. The inspectors left the premises
without conducting an inspection.
