2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This store had several medications that were either expired or had no expiration date. Two bottles of Wet-Tail
drops had no expiration date and one bottle of Ferret Rx had an unreadable expiration date. A bottle of Opticlear
eyewash expired 02/11, a tube of Triple Antibiotic ointment expired 07/10, a tube of Tinactin ointment expired 01/14,
and a tube of Preparation H expired 07/2010. All these medications were in the same drawer as the unexpired
medications and available for use on the animals. Expired medications can lose their effectiveness and their ability
to prevent or control disease and/or pain. The licensee must ensure that all medications and vaccines are within
their expiration dates at all times and that each medication has a readable expiration date.
TO BE CORRECTED BY AUGUST 15, 2014.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative.
