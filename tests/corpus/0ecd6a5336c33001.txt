Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The Principal Investigator (PI) listed on the three IACUC-approved, active teaching protocols left the institution in May,
2018. Since that time, the IACUC has not updated the PI listed on these ongoing, IACUC-approved active protocols.
Significant changes in personnel, especially the PI, on a protocol can lead to varying levels of care and use of the animals
covered by that protocol. The IACUC has not required modifications of significant changes regarding the care and use of
animals in ongoing activities, as required by this section of the regulations. Correct by November 15, 2020.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
