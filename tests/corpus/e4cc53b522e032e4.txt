RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Acquisition records for at least 6 sugar gliders were not available for review during this inspection. Additionally, a
disposition record was not available for one sugar glider which was sold on 10-2-13.
These acquisition and disposition records must be provided. All acquisition and disposition records must be
correctly completed and maintained to ensure that accurate information is documented as required.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
During this inspection, the pet/display sugar glider was housed in an enclosure that only measures 18 inches
long by 18 inches wide by 22 inches high. Additionally, another enclosure which is provided for a store employee's
pet sugar glider, only measures 14 inches long by 14 inches wide by 14 inches high.
Both of these enclosures are too small, barren, and do not provide adequate space to allow the sugar gliders to
make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.
Both of the sugar gliders, that are maintained at this store, must be provided with larger enclosures that will
allow them to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement for their health
and well-being.
BOTH OF THE ABOVE ITEMS ARE TO BE CORRECTED BY: FEBRUARY 13, 2014
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
