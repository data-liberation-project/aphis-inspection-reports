ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:20PM on
20-Aug-20.
Contacted licensee via cell. Licensee was not available for inspection and informed me the old business address
was not correct. Animals are being held at two separate locations until the new business location is completed. We
discussed attempted inspection report and exchanged contact information.
