FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the front section of the park a tiger enclosures had pieces of raw meat sitting on top of the shade structure and
fence, evidently from employees attempting to feed the animals by throwing meat over the fencing. Park policy is
to feed through the metal feed chutes located in the fence walls. Meat left on top of the fencing or shade structures
will quickly turn rancid and become an attractant for insects, pests, and wild animals. Food not consumed must be
removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein
and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

EMPLOYEES.
- In the arena area containing 15 tigers there was a tiger with a small red lesion on the right carpal area. The
licensee was asked about the red area on the tiger and he stated that the park employees did not follow the feeding
protocol for this enclosure. He stated the employees were throwing meat over the fence instead of following the
current policy. The employees are supposed to lock all tigers out of the arena, then enter and place the meat in 16
separate piles at least 15 feet apart. The licensee believes the injury was likely a scratch or bite which occurred
during feeding. The animals had been fed that day just prior to the inspectors arrival. The licensee must have
adequately trained employees to maintain an acceptable level of husbandry practices. Employees must follow park
policies to help ensure the safety of the regulated animals.
Correct from this point forward.
