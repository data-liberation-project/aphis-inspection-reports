RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Acquisition and disposition records were not complete and accurate. Acquisition records were not consistently
available for all of the animals. The animals that had been acquired prior to 2012 had very few records available,
and the animals that had been acquired since then did not have all the required information under b(1) available.
Disposition records were also not complete and accurate. A paper copy of the APHIS Forms 7019 or 7020 may be
used to track the required acquisition and disposition information in one place for all animals, or the information
must be available in the individual animal records. A system of recordkeeping that contains all the required
acquisition and disposition information must be maintained.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Guinea pigs are housed in outdoor pens under a roof structure, that are protected from predators through fencing
and covered with a tarp to protect them at night. The climate in San Juan Capistrano is very mild, but there is no
variance present in the file approving outdoor housing of guinea pigs. A variance must be requested through the
regional office for approval to keep guinea pigs outside.
