CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The floor behind the non-human primate cages was dirty with grey-brown-black debris loose and adhered to the
floor and the floorboards. A couple of centimeter long bugs were noted crawling on the floor. The facility
representative stated that they have been dealing with a pest issue and have a multi-prong pet control program in
place. An employee was noted sweeping together several piles of debris from the floor in front of the cages at the
time of inspection. The areas behind the cages and on the lower walls should be kept clean to help reduce/eliminate
breeding and living areas for pests. Correct by 5/27/18.
This inspection was conducted with facility representative. Exit interview were conducted with undersigned owner.
Animals cited for veterinary issues on last inspection have been evaluated by a veterinarian. Sissy is no longer at
the facility. The tamarin appears improved.
