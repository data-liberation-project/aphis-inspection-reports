ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Wilsonville store had liquid wormer (Strongid) that was labeled for equine use, not for any of the species in the
facility. A vitamin C supplement bottle was labeled for use in humans. These items did not have prescription labels
or written instructions for their use in the intended species. Any off-label use (use in species that are not on the
original label) must be under written prescription or instructions from the attending veterinarian. These instructions
may be located on a prescription label directly on the product or documented in writing from a veterinarian, as long
as the information is readily accessible, understandable, and available for use at the facility.
There is risk of harm to the animals from accidental misuse of medications when there is not proper labeling or
instructions.
