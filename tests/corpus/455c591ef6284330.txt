2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee made changes to the diet that were not approved by the attending veterinarian. The Program of Veterinary
Care states that the diet will consist of a commercial diet supplemented with fruits, vegetables and yogurt. The licensee is
mixing different types of leftover cereals into the commercial sugar glider diet. During the inspection, we observed Apple
Jacks cereal mixed in with the diet that was fed to the sugar gliders. A conversation with the attending veterinarian
revealed that multigrain cereal, specifically cheerios, was approved to be used as a treat with a guideline of one piece per
sugar glider per day. The attending veterinarian further stated that Apple Jacks is too high in sugar and not approved as
part of the sugar gliders' diet.

Feeding a diet with modifications that were not approved by the attending veterinarian may lead to health issues. The
attending veterinarian must be given appropriate authority to oversee all aspects of animal care including the diet.

The attending veterinarian must be consulted about the sugar gliders’ diet and the licensee must feed the diet as it is
approved by the attending veterinarian.
