Outdoor housing facilities.
The outdoor enclosure for the lemur does not have the required 6’ perimeter fence. This fence serves to protect the lemur
by restricting unauthorized access of humans and animals. It prevents physical contact of the lemur by these
unauthorized animals or humans. Construct a perimeter fence 6’ in height at least 3’ from the lemur’s primary enclosure. It
should be constructed to keep animals from going through or under it.

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence for the enclosure housing one coyote is now 6’ high. There are, however two sections of the
perimeter fence that are not 3’ from the primary enclosure fence. This fence must be at least 3’ from the primary
enclosure fence. Another coyote has been acquired by the facility and it does not have a perimeter fence for its primary
enclosure fence. This primary enclosure needs a 6’ perimeter fence at least 3’ from the primary enclosure fence. It should
serve to keep unauthorized persons and animals from going through it or under it and having contact with the coyote. It
should serve as a secondary containment system for the coyote. Construct a 6’ perimeter fence for this new coyote
enclosure at least 3’ from the primary enclosure.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
