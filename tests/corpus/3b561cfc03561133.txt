3.6(a)(2)(ix)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The floors, walls and doors on the primary enclosures in the front room (whelping area) of the building were
moderately worn. The primary enclosures in this area are constructed of primarily of coated wire. The wire coating
has been worn or chewed off over portions of the floors, walls and doors. These areas of the kennel are no longer in
good repair. The areas where the coating is damaged provide crevices that organic material can become entrapped
preventing adequate cleaning and sanitization. Additionally, the rust which has formed over the exposed wires also
prevents them from being readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by repairing or replacing these damaged areas. All
surfaces in contact with the dogs must be readily cleaned and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11 (b) of this
subpart, or be replaceable when worn or soiled.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
During the inspection it was noted that the wash-down areas had a heavy buildup of tan matter. There was a
moderate amount of feces and urine present within the wash down area. This buildup is an indicator of dried urine
and feces that has built up over time. Improper cleaning and sanitization of the wash down contributes to the odor
and disease hazards within the facility. This facility must establish and maintain a routine for proper cleaning and
sanitization for the facility to include all wash downs.
