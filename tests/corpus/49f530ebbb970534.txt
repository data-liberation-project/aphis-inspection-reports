2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown and white female Shih-Tzu approximately nine years old and identified by tattoo number 07 has an
excessive buildup of brownish colored material covering most of its teeth. The thick buildup of material on the
surface and encasing the affected teeth make it difficult to visualize the normal shape of the teeth. An upper right
cheek tooth is loose and .has a crack extending down from the gum line. The dog is also missing some lower and
upper teeth.
Tarter buildup, loose and missing teeth can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to health problems for the
dog. The abnormal buildup of material on the teeth can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally. The
licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. The
outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
