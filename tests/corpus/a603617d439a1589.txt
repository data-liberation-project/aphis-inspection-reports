2.126(b)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:10 am on 07-
FEB-22. Upon arrival, I rang the door bell, but there was no response. I spoke to the licensee on the phone and they
were unable to return for an inspection.
