ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The two reindeer cows, Bossy and Jingles, had excessively overgrown hooves due to a lack of routine hoof
trimming. The front dewclaws on Jingles were curling and making contact with the ground and her front toes were
starting to cross.
Excessive hoof growth can lead to gait abnormalities which can cause a change in the toe joints and may contribute
to osteoarthritis, especially in older animals such as these. The facility must adhere to the plan it created which
states that the reindeer’s hooves will be trimmed twice a year. As part of the facility’s program of preventative
veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
Bossy is currently being treated by CSU for a bite from a brown recluse spider and her veterinarian visits every four
days for treatments. Her veterinarian should be consulted before hoof trimming is performed as it is important to not
interfere with her recovery.
Jingles must have her hooves trimmed by November 24, 2016.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative and VMO Dominique Engel.
