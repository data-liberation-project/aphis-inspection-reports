PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On today's inspection, there was female golden doodle housed in an enclosure that measured 36"X30" or 7.5 sq ft.
The dog was measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail while standing and lying down. On both
occasions, this dog measured 28" and would require 8.03 sq ft of minimum space. This enclosure does not provide
this dog with an adequate amount of space. The Licensee must ensure that dogs have at least the minimum about
of floor space that is required. To determine the appropriate amount of space the licensee must ensure that each
Each dog housed in a primary enclosure is provided a minimum amount of floor space, calculated as follows: Find
the mathematical square of the sum of the length of the dog in inches (measured from the tip of its nose to the base
of its tail) plus 6 inches; then divide the product by 144. The calculation is: (length of dog in inches + 6) x (length of
dog in inches + 6) = required floor space in square inches. Required floor space in inches/144 = required floor
space in square feet.
This citation was corrected by placing the dog identified in a larger enclosure prior to the exit.
This was a facility inspection only. Records were collected for further review.
