2.40(b)(2) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility has been using Kaolin-Pectin Solution to treat dogs for diarrhea. The dogs were given the treatment within the
last month, but the Kaolin-Pectin Solution expired in November 2016.

The facility is using Canine Distemper-Adenovirus Type 2-Parainfluenz-Parvovirus Vaccine to vaccinate the puppies
against the diseases, but the vaccine expired on September 17, 2021.

Expired medical products and vaccines may lose their effectiveness and may not assist the animals in recovery from
illness and injury or could leave the animals without proper protection against serious and deadly diseases.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and prevent diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure that all medical products, including vaccines, are current and have not expired in order to support the health
and well-being of the dogs.

The Canine Distemper-Adenovirus Type 2-Parainfluenz-Parvovirus Vaccine is stored in the refrigerator. The temperature
in the refrigerator is 50 degrees F according to the inspector’s Kestrel. The vaccine label states it should be stored at 35-

45 degrees F. Vaccines stored at the wrong temperature may lose their effectiveness and could leave animals without
the proper protection against serious and deadly diseases.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and prevent diseases and injuries. The licensee
must ensure that all vaccines are stored at required temperatures and that all medical products are properly stored in
order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
2.50(a)(1) Repeat

Time and method of identification.
The facility uses a metal tag attached to a collar and placed around the dog’s neck as the official form of identification.
Eleven dogs over 16 weeks of age (Johnna, Seamus, Oakley, Romi Belle, Theo, Rustin, Ashley Wilkes, Tobi Mac, Birdie,
Finn, and Josie) are not wearing a collar with an attached metal tag. Official identification is necessary for APHIS officials
to identify animals and trace their movements.

All live dogs shall be identified by an official tag affixed to a collar around the animal’s neck, by a legible tattoo marking
approved by the Administrator, or by a microchip placed under the dog’s skin. The licensee must place a collar with an
attached metal tag around the neck of the eleven dogs listed above or apply one of the other forms of identification. The
licensee must ensure that all dogs have an official form of identification at all times.
2.75(a)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Fourteen puppies and nine adult dogs have no documented acquisition information. The facility uses cage cards to
document the acquisition information for the puppies, but at the time of the inspection no cage cards have been created
for any of the puppies. The nine adult dogs (Finn, Baxter, Shelby, Poppy, Tucker, Theo, Rustin, Josie, and Seamus) are

not listed on APHIS form 7005. Acquisition information is necessary for APHIS officials to identify animals and to trace
their movements.

The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose all information concerning
each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control,
or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include
any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. The licensee must record the
acquisition information for all fourteen puppies and nine adult dogs. The licensee must ensure all required information is
properly and accurately documented at all times.
2.75(a)(1)(ix) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005) is missing the disposition date for two male
dogs, Adonis and Roscoe.

Incomplete acquisition and disposition records may interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to accurately inventory the
animals, identify individual dogs and to track their movements.

Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain records or forms that fully and correctly disclose the date each dog was
disposed. The licensee must add the disposition dates to APHIS Form 7005 and always maintain all required information.
3.1(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.

The facility houses dogs in wire crates and one enclosure, containing one adult dog and three puppies, has clutter on top
of the enclosure. The clutter consists of a large bible, clipboards, and two plastic bags containing stacks of paperwork.
Clutter stored on top of the enclosures could impact the movement of air, as well as become too heavy and cause the top
of the enclosure to collapse potentially injuring an animal.

The enclosed porch and food storage area are heavily cluttered. The dogs use the porch to access their outdoor area
and the clutter on the porch has left just a small walkway for the dogs and people to pass through. The clutter consists of
numerous large cardboard boxes including boxes which are stacked on top of each other, golf clubs, vacuums and
attachments, plastic bins, and household items. The food storage area also consists of a large amount of household
clutter and unused items including old medical materials that are no longer used for the dogs. Clutter stored in animal
areas could accumulate dust and dirt and could attract pests such as rodents. The clutter could also pose a risk of injury
should it topple over and land on top of a dog.

Animal and food storage areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter. The licensee must remove
the clutter from the top of the enclosure and from the porch and food storage area. The licensee must ensure that all
housing areas remain free from clutter at all times.
3.1(c)(3) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The floor in the enclosed porch and food storage area has a thick buildup of dark colored excreta and other organic waste
material. The floor space in the porch and food area is very limited due to cluttered items, so the dogs must walk on the
compacted excreta in order to pass through these areas. A buildup of excreta and other waste materials could cause the
dogs to become soiled as well as increase the risk of disease hazards.


Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b)
of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. The licensee must clean and sanitize the
floors in the porch and food storage area in order to eliminate the buildup of excreta and reduce the risk of disease. The
licensee must ensure that all surfaces with which the dogs come into contact with are maintained in a clean and sanitized
state.
3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
The plastic bin containing open dog food has no lid. The facility representative stated the lid had broken, but a new one
has not been acquired and nothing has been done to cover and protect the food. Open food could become contaminated
by pests such as flies or mice which may have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.

All open supplies of food must be kept in leak proof containers with tightly fitted lids. The licensee must acquire a tightly
fitted lid for the plastic food bin and ensure that all food is properly stored at all times.

3.4(c)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The door leading to the outside exercise yard has a doggy door in it, below the doggy door, the paint has been worn and
scratched away leaving a rough, wooden surface. This surface is no longer impervious to moisture.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis so that they may be readily cleaned and sanitized to prevent odors,

diseases, insects, pests and vermin.

The facility must maintain all surfaces and ensure they are kept impervious to moisture.

To be corrected by: 20-October-2021.
3.8 Repeat

Exercise for dogs.
The licensee's exercise plan has not been reviewed or approved by the attending veterinarian.

A complete exercise plan that has been approved by the attending veterinarian is important to ensure the dogs are
receiving adequate space and exercise to support their health and well-being.

The licensee must have an appropriate plan, approved by the attending veterinarian, that provides all dogs with the
opportunity to exercise.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
On the Program of Veterinary Care, it states the puppies will be vaccinated for distemper and parvovirus at 6-7 weeks and
10 weeks of age. The facility stated that they vaccinate at 8 weeks of age. The facility is not following the deworming
schedule for puppies, the Program of Veterinary Care states puppies will be dewormed at 6-7 weeks and 10 weeks of
age. The facility stated that they deworm at 2, 4, 6, and 10 weeks of age.

Failure to follow the preventative care schedule for vaccinations and intestinal parasite treatment in the Program of

Veterinary Care does not ensure the puppies are receiving appropriate protection against contagious and deadly diseases
including distemper, parvovirus and intestinal parasites.

The facility must follow the vaccination schedule and intestinal parasite treatment schedule documented in the Program of
Veterinary Care.

To be corrected by: From this day forward.
3.13(b)(2)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee stated that Male Yorkshire terrier (Tobi Mac) has been examined by a licensed veterinarian for an abnormal
condition of the eye. There are no medical records documenting the examination and the veterinarian’s findings
concerning the dog’s eye condition.

The facility has been using an anti-diarrheal solution within the last month to treat the adult dogs for diarrhea. There are
no medical records showing which dogs were treated and on what date the treatments were given. There is no
documented medical plan for the use of the solution to treat diarrhea in adult dogs.

There are no medical records documenting when the deworming treatments were given to the puppies currently at the
facility. The adult dogs were just dewormed during the summer months according to the facility representative, but no
documentation of this treatment could be presented.

Failure to create medical records interferes with APHIS official’s ability to determine if the dogs are receiving adequate

veterinary care.

Dealers must keep medical records for dogs documenting all required information including the date and identification of
animals treated, fully detailed treatment plans, and results of examinations conducted by licensed veterinarians. The
licensee must ensure medical records are created and maintained and fully document all procedures, treatments, and
examinations for each adult dog and puppy.

To be corrected by: The licensee must have documentation for Tobi Mac’s eye condition by 20-October-2021. All other
medical procedures, treatments, and examinations must be documented from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
