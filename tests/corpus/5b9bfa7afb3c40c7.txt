INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The research protocol justified acquisition of 200 rabbits per year. However, the IACUC approved acquisition of 400
rabbits per year in years 2 and 3. The approved number is double the amount justified in those years.
Proposals to conduct activity involving animals must contain a rationale for the appropriateness and approximate
number of animals to be used. Identification of the appropriate number of animals is required so that the IACUC
can insure that resources are available for the appropriate animal care and use.
Correct from this date forward.

EMPLOYEES.
Approximately 18% of rabbits have moderate to marked accumulation of dried, crusty dark-colored material on the
outer surface of ear, consistent with dried blood.
Supplies for blood collection (including a rabbit restraint device and several solution bottles) have moderate
coverage of red spots/splatters, consistent with dried blood.
Drug/supply cabinet is unkempt, including unlabeled/mislabeled solution bottles. Although the shelves are lined, the
liner shows a moderate accumulation of dust/dirt and some trash (e.g. used needle wrappers).
Several animals had long toenails, and one animal was observed to have multiple skin lesions in the tailhead region
that were not recognized by husbandry staff. These finding would typically be noted during daily observations of
animals.
Without a sufficient number of employees, the facility may not be able to provide the necessary level of husbandry
and sanitation.Correct by: May 8, 2019
