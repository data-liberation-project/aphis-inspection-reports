**The shift door in the lion tailed macaque enclosure is rusted on the surface facing the outside. Wood around the
door is chipped. Excessive rust and exposed chipped, unpainted wood can prevent effective sanitization of the
surface or affect its structural strength which may affect the health of the animals.
**Peeling paint was observed on the perch support brackets within the chimpanzee enclosure as well as rust on
doors of the enclosure. Peeling paint and rust cannot be effectively sanitized which may affect the health of the
animals.
