ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care provided at the time of inspection did not address several issues: there was a lack
of emergency contact information, a method of euthanasia was not provided, no vaccination schedule, and no
information on TB testing for the facility(cid:25)s chimpanzee. These additions must be provided with the Program of
Veterinary Care to ensure that the exhibitor is providing adequate veterinary care to its animals.

2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The enclosure for 'Candy' the chimpanzee has a public barrier that consists of a chain link fence, at least 6 feet high
that is also affixed with hot wire. However, when APHIS personnel asked the primary caretaker at the time of
inspection if the public has access while she is being exhibited, the employee admitted that the public has been able
to toss various items into her exhibit, one item in particular being lit cigarettes. During public exhibition, any animal
must be handled so that there is minimal risk of harm and well being to the animal. The public barrier that is
surrounding Candy(cid:25)s enclosure is not adequate. The facility must provide a sufficient distance and barrier between
Candy and the general viewing public to assure the safety of animals and public.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The monkey biscuits for Candy the chimpanzee are kept in a metal container in a storage room. At the time of
inspection, there was a large accumulation of food waste, debris, and garbage kept in the same area as the feed. In
the area where Candy(cid:25)s refrigerator food was kept, a live rat was noticed in a pest trap by APHIS personnel. The
facility must provide frequent collection and removal of debris, garbage, pests and other wastes. Dead animals,animal parts, and animal waste must not be kept in food storage, refrigerators and animal areas.

FEEDING.
At the time of inspection, Candy the chimpanzee is being fed fruits and vegetables that are given to her in a plastic
bag. While the diet itself is appropriate and of industry standard, the food receptacle is not. Using a plastic bag as a
food receptacle causes a potential risk of medical injury to Candy. The facility must implement measures to ensure
that the food receptacle used cause no risk of harm or injury to the animal.
