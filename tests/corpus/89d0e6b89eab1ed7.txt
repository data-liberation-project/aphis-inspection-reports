2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Proposals to conduct an activity on animals.
1. Review of Protocol # 100598-0116: There was a discrepancy noted between the monitoring procedures outlined
in the IACUC approved protocol and the situation observed by the APHIS inspector at the time of the inspection.
The protocol states that "Rabbits are monitored following anesthesia until alert....." but during the inspection the
APHIS inspector observed a Rabbit in its primary enclosure that was unconscious and in lateral recumbency. No
one was in the room with the Rabbit and its medical record indicated that the animal had received an injection of an
anesthetic a little over 2 hours ago and an injection of an analgesic less than ½ hour ago; both of the medications
had been administered by research personnel.
Per this Section of the Regulations, a proposal for animal use must contain a description of the procedures
designed to assure that any discomfort and pain to animals will be limited to that which is unavoidable for the
conduct of scientifically valuable research, including provisions for the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing
drugs where indicated and appropriate. Research personnel are expected to follow animal use procedures as they
are described in the IACUC approved protocol.
The IACUC needs to address the discrepancy identified for this ongoing IACUC approved research proposal.
Correct by 8/21/14.
2.33(b)(5)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Adequate Pre and Post Procedural Care.
1. At the time of the inspection just before 10 AM on 7/17/14, the APHIS inspector observed a Rabbit in an
enclosure that was unconscious and in lateral recumbency. Review of the medical record at the same timerevealed that the Rabbit had received an injection of anesthetic at 7:38 AM and an injection of analgesic at 9:30 AM
under Protocol #100598-0116; both injections had been given by someone from the investigator's lab. The written
medical record had been initialed by the same lab person and the medical record already had entries written for 2
more doses of analgesic, one for 7/17/14 at 5PM and the other for 7 AM the next day.
Per this Section of the Regulations, every research facility shall establish and maintain a program of adequate
veterinary care that includes adequate pre and post procedural care in accordance with current established
veterinary medical and nursing procedures. Making entries for treatments or medications in an animal's medical
record before the treatments or medications have been administered to the animal is not in accordance with current
professionally accepted veterinary medical practices.
The research facility needs to: (1) address this issue with research personnel on Protocol #100598-0116, and (2)
ensure that all research facility personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are familiar with and follow
this Section of the Regulations.

Correct (1) by 7/28/14 and (2) by 8/22/14.
NOTE - Inspection conducted 7/17/14 and 7/21/14. Exit interview held 7/21/14 on-site with facility representatives.
