ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:50 am on
11-May-17.
I arrived at the facility at 11:50 am. I pressed the buzzer at the gate and waited for a response, after no response I
called the three contact phone numbers listed on the board but was transferred to voicemail in each case. I left the
message that I was at the gate for inspection and asked to be called on my cell phone, I provided my number. I
waited at the gate for about 20 minutes and then went to a nearby gas station where I waited until 12:45 for a return
call. I then left for my next inspection.
