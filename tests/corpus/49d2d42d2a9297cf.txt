INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol CB-I-9263, a training protocol involving multiple species, is listed as USDA Pain Category C/D. The
principal investigator did not provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine
that alternatives were not available.
In order for the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) to approve a proposed activity for
procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals including Category D
studies, the principal investigator must provide such a written narrative description. Without the required description
of the availability of alternatives, activities may unnecessarily cause pain or distress to the animals.
The protocol should be amended to include this required information.
Correct by: 05 August 2018 or prior to additional animal use under this protocol, whichever comes first.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In protocol # CB18-7010 involving rabbits, the “Objective” section of the study states that the study concludes with
treatment with the study sponsor’s photodynamic system. The study also listed in a chart application of "PS" and
"PDT," without further description. the study fails to describe what these treatments entail, and hence, what the
animal will experience.
In order for the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) to approve a protocol, it must contain a
complete description of the proposed use of the animals. A complete description of proposed activities is necessary
for an adequate understanding by the IACUC members of what the animal will experience. Such understanding is
necessary in order for them to assure the humane care and use of the animals on study.
The protocol should be amended to include this required information.Correct by: 05 August 2018 or prior to additional animal use under this protocol, whichever comes first.
