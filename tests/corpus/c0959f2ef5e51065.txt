2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The facility's official form of identification is via microchip. Two adult male Pomeranians (Trevor Aaron and Toby
Boy) are not identified with a microchip or other form of official identification. Lack of official identification does not
allow for the proper identification or tracking of the animal. Identify the adult dogs with official USDA identification.
