Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two adult Aoudad sheep were observed on inspection with forelimb lameness’s. Upon approaching the primary
enclosure, one female Aoudad remained sitting while the remainder of the herd swiftly moved to the back of the
enclosure. After standing, a profound right-forelimb, minimally-weightbearing lameness was noted. A second adult
Aoudad was then seen limping on its left forelimb. Though the facility representative stated they were already planning to
treat the female Aoudad, neither had received veterinary care prior to this inspection. Furthermore, the second lame
Aoudad identified had not been noticed by the facility representative until it was brought to their attention.

Lameness is suggestive of pain and/or an underlying condition. Failure to appropriately identify and treat diseases can
lead to prolonged suffering, infection, pain, and other veterinary care problems. In addition, failure to observe all animals
daily can result in deterioration of the animal's health, especially when limping has began and the initial onset is unknown.

The facility must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

Employees.


During the inspection, a Brown-Tufted adult capuchin escaped from its enclosure during daily husbandry cleaning. Per the
facility representative, the employee cleaning the enclosure was a new hire, employed at the facility for approximately four
to six weeks. Though the employee was being supervised by a tenured staff member, the capuchin had not been locked
out of the indoor exhibit. The cleaning protocol had not been followed, resulting in the capuchin fleeing from its enclosure.

Adhering to a facility’s protocol can help prevent animal escapes, as well as further injury to the animal and members of
the public. Employees who provide care, husbandry practices, and handle nonhuman primates must be trained and
supervised by an individual who has the background and experience to oversee others.

Corrective actions were taken at the time of inspection.

Watering.
One enclosure housing Aoudad sheep and Fallow deer did not have clean drinking water. Upon inspection, the water
receptacle contained cloudy, brown water that could not be clearly seen through to the bottom of the receptacle. Floating
on top of the water were clumps of brown and green plantlike material. Once drained, the receptacle had copious
amounts of brown sludge sitting on the bottom. The consumption of unclean drinking water can compromise an animal’s
health or cause severe illness. Accessibility to potable water is necessary for health, sustenance, and well-being of the
animal. All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and facility representative.
