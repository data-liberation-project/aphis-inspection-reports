Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
2.40 b 3 Attending veterinarian
Several of the rabbits had varying degrees of hair loss. The facility felt the hair loss was due to barbering, however all
rabbits are housed individually. Hair loss can be the result of multiple things. Barbering, lice, mites, and boredom are
some causes of hair loss. The facility had not consulted with the attending veterinarian.
A method of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animals’ health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
The attending veterinarian needs to be consulted about the hair loss in the rabbits.

Facilities, general.
A majority of the rabbit cages had some degree of rust on the wire. Rust cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected
which can lead to illness and foot infections in the rabbits.
The facility needs to remove the rust from the cages or acquire new cages.

3.56(a)(1)

Sanitation.
The rabbit cages do not appear to be adequately cleaned on a routine basis. Several of the rabbit cages had an
accumulation of obvious feces and hair. Other cages had a coating on the bottom wire that appeared to be a congealed
mix of feces and hair.
Inadequate cleaning of cages can contribute to illness and foot infections in the rabbits, and flies and other pests in the
barn.
The facility needs to ensure the rabbit cages are thoroughly cleaned on a regular basis.
