3.137(a)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
On February 25, 2016 the licensee presented and left for air transportation four young sugar gliders housed in four
individual primary enclosures. The four enclosures had tape applied to the exterior that sealed all ventilation
openings on the enclosures. Removal of the externally applied tape on one enclosure revealed the openings had
also been sealed with a layer of tape applied to the inside of the enclosure.
No dealer shall offer for transportation any live animal in a primary enclosure that does not conform to the following
ventilation requirement: when there are ventilation openings located on all four walls of the primary enclosure the
ventilation openings on each wall shall be at least 8 percent of the total surface area of each wall.
By sealing the openings on all four sides of the enclosures the animals were essentially provided with no openings
for ventilation. Insufficient ventilation during transportation will compromise animal well being by restricting oxygen
and could result in death of the animal. Animals must not be accepted for transportation when housed in primary
enclosures that do not meet requirements for adequate ventilation under the Animal Welfare Act.
