Watering.
The wallaroo and sitatunga enclosures have automatic waterers. The bowls of these waterers are coated with green
algae.
Dirty water containers can reduce the animals’ water intake. Keeping receptacles clean and sanitary is necessary for the
health and well-being of the animals.
Correction: The licensee said the waterers would be cleaned within a day.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
