3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor hutch style enclosures housing ten adult dogs had a build-up of organic material on the interior
surfaces of the shelters. The majority of the floors, and walls had a brown greasy residue.
The build-up of organic material can harbor disease. The licensee must sanitize in accordance to 3.11(b), which
states that used primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every two weeks or as often as necessary to
prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris, foot waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The wooden parts of the shelters in the outdoor hutch style enclosures housing ten adult dogs had scratched and
chewed surfaces that were no longer impervious to moisture.
Scratched and chewed surfaces can harbor disease and cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. The licensee
must construct the enclosures and shelters so they are impervious to moisture. All surfaces must be maintained on
a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled.
