INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***Three New Zealand white rabbits were not administered post-operative pain medication that the protocol
described would be provided. The rabbits underwent an arthrotomy procedure approximately 3 months prior to the
inspection and were no longer at the facility. According to the protocol, the rabbits would receive buphenomorphine
at 2 hours and 1 day post-operatively. According to animal care staff, the buphenomorphine had not been ordered
and the rabbits did not receive post-operative pain medication as described in the protocol. In accordance with the
protocol, the signs of post-operative pain and distress in the rabbits were noted to be numerous and indicated they
would be monitored with the use of a checklist. The checklist for pain or distress in rabbits included monitoring for
decreased food and water consumption, weight loss, rapid breathing, unkempt appearance, dilated pupils,
self-imposed isolation/hiding as well as many other signs. There were general comments recorded by the animal
care staff on a daily activity sheet for the room housing the rabbits; the sheet included occasional brief comments on
the (cid:28)inputs(cid:29) (eating and drinking) and (cid:28)outputs(cid:29) (urine and fecal output) of the animals. However, there was no
documentation or completed checklist that indicated the additional numerous signs of pain had been monitored in
the rabbits. Still, according to the animal care staff daily activity sheet, the first written comment was noted 3 days
post-operatively in the rabbits and stated "(cid:28)little input or output"(cid:29). Similar comments of little eating, drinking and
output appeared sporadically for the rabbits following the surgery and were documented for at least one rabbit up to
approximately 21 days post-procedure. The principal investigator failed to submit an amendment or proposed
modification to the approved protocol regarding the change in analgesic administration and post-operative
monitoring for pain and distress. As a result, this significant change in not administering post-operative pain
medication was not reviewed by the IACUC. The IACUC must review and approve all proposed protocols and
amendments to ensure that animal pain and distress is minimized and that proposed activities comply with the
Animal Welfare regulations. The registrant must ensure that all future activities are done in accordance with the
IACUC protocol and ensure that all significant changes to the ongoing use of animals are reviewed by the IACUC.
