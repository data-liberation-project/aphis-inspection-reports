SANITATION.
The walls and bottoms of the plastic tubs and aquariums serving as hedgehog enclosures have significant build-up
of a brown film and fly specks. Excessively soiled cardboard housing boxes are noted in most enclosures.
Excessive amounts of feces are present in about half of the enclosures. Buildup of feces and unclean enclosures
can lead to pest problems and pose risks to the health of the animals. Excreta shall be removed from primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize
disease hazards and to reduce odors. All enclosures need to be cleaned appropriately and/or replaced if adequate
cleanliness and sanitation cannot be maintained. Correct by December 15, 2016.
3.131(b)
SANITATION.
Brown film and fly specks are noted coating all surfaces of the enclosures housing the hedgehogs. Excess grime
can lead to pest control problems and disease concerns for the hedgehogs. Enclosures shall be sanitized in
accordance with this section. Correct by December 15, 2016.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The room housing the hedgehogs is overcrowded and cluttered with excess equipment, pest control products, and
bedding materials. The walls, ceiling and floor of the room are not clean and have excessive amounts of brown film
and dirt. Overcrowding of housing areas with nonessential items can lead to increased pest problems and an
inability to clean and sanitize the facility adequately. Correct by December 15, 2016.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
An excessive number of houseflies are present in the room housing the hedgehogs. Although fly strips are in place,
there are too many flies in the enclosures and the room in general. Four to five flies were noted in most enclosures.
Pests can transmit diseases that can impact the health of the hedgehogs. A safe and effective program for thecontrol of insects, ectoparasites and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Correct by
December 15, 2016.
