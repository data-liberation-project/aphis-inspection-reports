PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

and a few nails at the top of the enclosures are exposed. These enclosures need to be maintained in good repair for
the safety of the animals and to facilitate cleaning and husbandry.

3.80(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** There are sections of wire mesh in the lemur enclosure that are secured with zip ties. This is a very thin wire that
is starting to break apart from the normal wear of the animal jumping on the mesh. Several strands of the wire were
broken which can be a potential hazard to the lemur. In addition there is a gap in the wire mesh from the door frame
where the animal could put his hand or arm through causing potential injury. This enclosure needs to be addressed
to keep the enclosure in good repair for the safety of the animal.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The facility has acquired a porcupine and a singing dog which are currently housed behind a fence that is only 4
feet high and does not surround the new singing dog enclosure. Additionally there are no locks on the fences and
the fencing on the back side of the enclosures is right up against the chain link. This fence does not act as a
perimeter fence because it does not restrict unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having
contact with the animals in the facility. The perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the
primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside
the perimeter fence and must be at least 6 feet high. This needs to be addressed for the safety of the animals at the
facility. Correct by: Aug 30, 2016
