FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is some paint chipping & flaking along the top of the pool walls, as well as at the junction of the top of the
wall, and the wall itself, on the main & med pools. This condition allows for these paint chips/flakes to potentially fall
into the water and be consumed by the manatees as they dislodge.
All pools shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals for injury.

VETERINARY CARE.
An orphaned baby manatee is in a pool that has a water depth of only 4 feet. The minimum depth requirement for
this species is 5 feet. This manatee is under veterinary care, however, there is nothing noted in this animal's
medical record that provides a justification for the lack of the required depth.
Holding of a marine mammal in a medical treatment or medical training enclosure that does not meet minimum
space requirements for periods longer than 2 weeks must be noted in the animal's medical record and the attending
veterinarian must provide a justification in the animal's medical record. If holding in such enclosures for medical
treatment and/or medical training is to last longer than 2 weeks, such extension must be justified in writing by the
attending veterinarian on a weekly basis.
