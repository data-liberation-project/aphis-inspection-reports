CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is a buildup of dirt/grime material on the white bars of the fencing in the indoor wall of the lockdown area in
the Macaque 'Bella's primary enclosure. There is a buildup of dust or dirt on the platform and wood support beams
around the platform with some spider webs along the base of the fencing. While the primary enclosure is spot
cleaned 1-2 time per day, the buildup of dirt or grime on the wooden surfaces and fencing suggest that the
sanitization program should be increased.
A buildup of dirt and grime on the surfaces the regulated animals come in contact with can be a possible source of
health hazards or parasite control issues.
The licensee must sanitize all surfaces that come in contact with the primates at least once every 2 weeks or more
often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime on the surfaces. This includes the out surfaces of the
fencing and wooden supports inside the lockdown area.

SANITATION.
There is a female tiger, 12yrs old that has a lockdown area inside her primary enclosure. Inside the lockdown area
the floor and wooden platform the tiger lays on has a buildup of dirt, debris and hair on all surfaces, including hair
and spider web debris throughout the fenced gate that makes up the fourth wall inside. While the area is being
picked up daily, there does not appear to be a deeper cleaning of this area that would keep it in compliance
preventing this accumulation of debris.
The buildup of dirt, grime and spider webs in an enclosure can be a possible source of health issues or parasite
control.
The licensee must thoroughly clean the surfaces the regulated animal is in contact with to prevent the ground inbuildup of dirt and debris on the wooden platform and walls.
