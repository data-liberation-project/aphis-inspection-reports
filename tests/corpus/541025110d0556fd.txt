Primary enclosures.
The facility acquired two rabbit hutches that do not meet the minimum interior height for the rabbits individually housed in
them. An area in the enclosure approximately 18 inches by 22 inches has an interior height of 13.5 inches for the
approximate 9 lbs rabbits housed within. The interior height of this section of the enclosure does not allow the rabbits to
make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement without their ears touching the ceiling to the
second level of the enclosure.
Each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be provided a minimum interior height of 14 inches to allow normal
postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.
The facility must ensure the rabbits' enclosure meet the minimum interior height of an enclosure.

Facilities, general.
Several sharp points were identified on the fencing of the following enclosures.
**In the goat enclosure housing 6 domestic goats, there was one sharp point created by baling wire on the fence line. The
sharp point was at eye level of the goats.
**In the cattle enclosure housing 2 domestic jersey cattle, there were at least 10 sharp points created by baling wire and
broken fencing. The sharp points were at eye and leg levels of the cattle.

**On the door between the cattle and sheep enclosures, there was a sharp point created by a broken chain link fence at
foot level of the sheep and cattle.
**In the sheep pen housing 2 domestic sheep, there was a broken piece of chain link fence creating a sharp point at foot
level of the sheep.

The shelter for the 3 domestic pigs has a worn wall with holes through the plywood and paint stripped off around the
holes. It looks as though the pigs have been chewing on the wall.

Sharp points and walls not kept in good repair may cause injury to the animals. Housing facilities shall be structurally
sounds and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

The facility must maintain the housing facilities in good repair and protect the animals from injury.
