FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Temperature in chinchilla room was measured at 78-79 degrees F; humidity measured 83-85% (all measurements
taken with Kestrel 3000). Many chinchillas had ruffled fur which can be an indicator of high humidity/heat. Air
conditioning was running but was not effective at lowering heat/humidity to comfortable levels for chinchillas. Dirt
floor was damp and may be the source of excess humidity. (Outdoor humidity was measured at 73%). Chinchillas
require cool temperatures and low humidity for their health and comfort. High heat/humidity levels may lead to
heatstroke and/or death. Need to maintain adequate temperature and humidity levels.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
