ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The female kinkajou housed under the barn is noted to have a red open wound under the right ear. A scab was
noted behind the left ear. A facility employee stated that the wound had been present for at least 2 weeks. There is
no record that the animal has received veterinary care. A second female kinkajou in pen 2 area has a fresh scrape
area under her chin. The 4 coatimundi housed together are all scratching. Licensee stated that she sprays them as
needed for fleas. A wound behind the ears may be the sign of an ear infection which can be expected to cause the
animal pain and distress. Small wounds such as the skin scrape on the other female kinkajou may become infected
if left untreated. Left untreated fleas may cause severe health issues for the coatimundi. The 2 female kinkajous
must be examined by a veterinarian to determine proper treatment and an effective method of flea control must be
discussed with the veterinarian to prevent pain and discomfort to the animals. CORRECT BY : 10/19/17
