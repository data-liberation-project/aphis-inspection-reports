INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On Sept. 30, 2015 the IACUC approved a significant modification to protocol 060619JGT10201 adding a survival
surgery performed under general plus local anesthesia to the procedures the animals may undergo. The
modification submitted did not contain a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine
that alternatives were not available to the surgical procedure. Alternatives to procedures that may cause more than
momentary pain or distress need to be considered by the investigator and reviewed by the IACUC to ensure that the
changes in ongoing activities avoid or minimize discomfort, distress and pain to the animals. The IACUC shall
ensure that the principal investigator has considered alternatives to the surgical procedure and that a written
narrative description of the methods and sources used has been provided. Correct by April 1, 2016.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On Sept. 30, 2015 the IACUC approved a significant modification to protocol 060619JGT10201 adding a survival
surgery to the procedures the animals may undergo. The modification as submitted by the investigator and
approved by the IACUC did not contain assurances of the use of aseptic techniques for the survival surgery. The
originally approved protocol included only terminal surgery and stated specifically that aseptic technique was not
required. The modification also did not adequately describe post-operative care such that the IACUC could assure
that the post-operative care provided is in accordance with established veterinary medical practices . The
modification stated that the animals would be monitored until fully recovered and then daily but did include what the
monitoring would include or what provision would be made for any necessary post-operative pain control. In order to
approve any proposed significant changes in ongoing activities the IACUC must ensure that all activities involving
surgery include appropriate provision for post-operative care and that procedures are performed using aseptic
techniques to ensure the well-being of the animals. The IACUC shall ensure that the principal investigator has
included appropriate provision for post-operative care and aseptic technique in the protocol modification. Correct by
April 1, 2016. Exit conducted with the undersigned Attending Veterinarian, IACUC Chair and IACUC Regulatory Review
