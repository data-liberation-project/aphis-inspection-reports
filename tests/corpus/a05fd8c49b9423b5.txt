3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a hole in the siding material approximately 3"X3" on the outdoor portion of the east side of the whelping
building. This hole has exposed the underlying wall material resulting in a surface that cannot be easily cleaned
and sanitized. The surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed in a manner that allows them to be readily
cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 1 Feb. 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
