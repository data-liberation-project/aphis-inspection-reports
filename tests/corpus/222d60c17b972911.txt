FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There was a strong ammonia odor throughout the guinea pig housing room. There were no vents, doors, or
windows observed to be open to allow proper ventilation of the room.
Failure to provide fresh air can cause respiratory distress and expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards.
The indoor housing facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.
