facility inspection. The four young dogs are being housed in outdoor housing. The licensee is using microchips as
the official identification. Official identification is needed to ensure that each animals identity can be known with

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* A two to three inch gap along the bottom was observed between one enclosure gate and the cinder block wall
used to secure the gate to. Two dogs are in contact with the affected area located in outdoor housing. The

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Deterioration of the exterior wall wood surface has created a hole along the bottom of one shelter housing.
Four young dogs are in contact with the affected surface located in outdoor housing. This indicates that unsanitary
conditions and a potential disease risk exist when the affected surface cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis and if any surface cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized it must be replaced when worn or soiled. Correct by 9/15/15.3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta on one metal entryway door, metal flashing and the exterior
fiberglass wall in one enclosure. Four young dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in outdoor
housing. The affected area covers approximately 50 percent of the fiberglass wall area, 75 percent of the metal
entryway door and 25 percent of the metal flashing. The licensee stated that the affected surfaces were last
cleaned and sanitized approximately seven weeks ago. Cleaning and sanitization of surfaces are necessary to
prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists
that could lead to potential disease risks. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are spot cleaned on a daily
basis and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b). Correct by 9/15/15.
