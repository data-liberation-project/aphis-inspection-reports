2.4 CRITICAL
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
At the exit interview, as we finished going through the inspection report, Mr. Woody became increasingly upset,
combative and verbally abusive towards us. His face reddened and he was yelling. He began verbally attacking us
by accusing us of having personal agendas, and purposefully not lifting his suspension immediately. I tried to tell the
licensee that we did not have the authority to lift the suspension, at which time he accused us of lying. He continued
to rant about HSUS, PETA, the USDAs’, and our personal agendas’ with those groups to get him out of the animal
business. It was impossible to say anything because he was yelling and would not stop to listen to anything we tried
to say or let us get a word in.
We were unable to finish the exit interview because of his behavior and his nonstop yelling and interruptions. We
could not discuss items we felt he should monitor or improve, nor were we able to ask him if he had any questions
since we were concerned that anything we said might inflame him more and cause his bad behavior to become
even worse. At this point, knowing that nothing more could be accomplished and that we needed to leave the
situation, I managed to ask Mr. Woody to sign the reports. As he was signing his name in an exaggerated and
furious manner, his pen stopped working, and he whipped it across the kitchen where it hit the wall and fell to the
floor. I took the reports and we immediately left the facility.
Both Dr. Kingston and I felt our anxiety peak during the exit interview and was very concerned that Mr. Woodys'
behavior had become unpredictable. He had never gotten this upset in past inspections. For safety’s sake, we both
knew we needed to leave as quickly as possible, and not discuss a harassment/interference NCI with him. Mr.
Woodys' actions during the inspection made it at times difficult and frustrating, and interfered with us performing our
duties smoothly, and his behavior at the exit interview was intolerable because we truly did not know what actions
he would take in his fit of anger.
