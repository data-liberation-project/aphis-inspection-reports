ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The licensee does not currently have an AV who can provide adequate veterinary care to his domestic animals
such as the goats, rabbits, and zebu. The licensee has given vaccines based on suggestions from other individuals
for the goats and zebu. The licensee shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements, which shall
include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits. This is to assure the AV has appropriate
authority to ensure the provisions of vet care for guidance and usage in regards to vaccines, parasite control, diet
and other areas of animal health.
