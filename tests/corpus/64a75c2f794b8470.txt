ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10am-1030am
on 23-Feb-17.
The inspector tried to make contact at the Licensee's door, but no one was home. The inspector honked her horn
to ensure no one was on the property outside the house. In addition, the inspector called the number on file and left
a message. The Licensee called back several hours later and left a message for the inspector to confirm that no
one was available for inspection at the time the inspector was at the facility.
