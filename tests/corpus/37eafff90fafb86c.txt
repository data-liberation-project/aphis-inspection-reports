Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocols ACH-100, ASH-200 and ARB-400 contained surgical procedures for chinchillas, sheep and rabbits. The
Principal Investigators for protocols ACH-100, ASH-200, and ARB-400 did not write narratives that clearly considered
alternatives to potentially painful surgical procedures. The narratives provided by the Principal Investigators instead
described the objectives and the rationale for the research.

The IACUC shall determine that the principal investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more
than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals and has provided a written narrative description of the methods
and sources used.

Primary enclosures.
On inspection on 04/26/2022 a rabbit kit born 04/05/2022 (aged less than one month old) was housed with the dam in a
cage without a nest box. A next box provides juveniles with the opportunity for thermoregulation, maternal care, and rest


to ensure proper growth and animal welfare. A suitable nest box containing clean nesting material shall be provided in
each primary enclosure housing a female with a litter less than one month of age.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Paint was peeling on walls of 2 nonhuman primate rooms in the S444 suite. Paint has been scraped off an approximately
6ft long section of the wall in room S415. There was excessive dust and rust colored material evident on the exterior of
PVC water lines located in multiple rooms including S410, as well as excessively dusty ventilation filters.

Accumulation of dust and debris on surfaces in animal rooms can lead to unsanitary conditions that affect the health of
the animals. Unsealed surfaces in primate rooms does not allow for proper cleaning to reduce disease hazards. Premises
must be kept clean and in good repair to facilitate the husbandry standards set by the facility.

Feeding.
Sheep in two enclosures had hanging green half tube feeders. The entire interior surface of the feeders were covered by
a film of brown material. Feeders that are not kept clean and sanitary may contaminate food, leading to animal welfare
concerns. The facility must ensure that feeders are maintained in sanitary condition to prevent deterioration and
contamination of feed.

Sanitation.
Two enclosures of bats had thick guano deposits on water lines located below roosting spots. Guano was also present on
the wire of the walls of the enclosures. Excreta must be removed from enclosures to minimize disease hazards for the
animals. The facility must ensure that the enclosures are cleaned as often as necessary to remove excreta from surfaces.
