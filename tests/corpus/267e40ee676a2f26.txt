Contingency planning.
A contingency was not available at the time of inspection.
Without such a plan for an emergency or disaster which could reasonably be anticipated, animals might be exposed to
conditions which might be detrimental to the good health and well-being of the animals in their possession for a prolonged
period of time after such an unplanned event.
A contingency plan must be developed and facility trained on it.
