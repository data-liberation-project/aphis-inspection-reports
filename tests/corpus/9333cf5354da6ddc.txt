2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*The attending veterinarian has visited the facility and completed a new written program of veterinary care since the
last inspection. However, the new plan is still lacking some details important in ensuring delivery of adequate
veterinary care to the animals. The following information needs to be addressed in the program: the frequency of
visits by the vet to the facility, route of administration for euthanasia drugs, information regarding TB testing of
non-human primates, dosages for ivermectin administration for the multiple species at the facility and whether
"twice yearly" under the internal parasite section refers to fecal testing or treatment, and the contact information for
a veterinarian for emergency care. Lack of detail in the written program of veterinary care can lead to lack of
adequate veterinary care for the animals. The facility shall, with their attending veterinarian, complete a written
program of veterinary care that includes all aspects of veterinary care needed for the animals at the facility.
3.50(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Three of four large permanent floor level rabbit enclosures consist of a solid floor and solid walls. A combination of
materials have been layed over the top of three of the enclosures. The top of the fourth is open. Rabbit
excreta/pellets are present on top of the wire top sections over the three enclosures. The facility representative
explains that they were cleaned within the last 24 hours. Apparently the rabbit in the open topped enclosure is
jumping out of its enclosure and spending time on top of the materials layered over the other three enclosures. The
rabbit could injure itself by falling while jumping, by chewing on electrical cords/plants nearby or can escape since
the door to the greenhouse building was propped open today for ventilation. All enclosures for rabbits must be
structurally sound, in good repair, protect animals from injury and contain the animals. Correct by 5/1/16.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Since the last inspection, the facility has developed an environment enhancement plan for the marmoset. The
attending veterinarian has not approved/signed off on the current plan. This plan must be in accordance withcurrently accepted professional standards, must specifically at a minimum address social grouping, environmental
enrichment and all special considerations and must be directed by the attending veterinarian.
The four prairie dogs have been evaluated by the attending veterinarian and treated.
Exit with undersigned facility representative.
