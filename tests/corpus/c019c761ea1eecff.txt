Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information
concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or
her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records
shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.

Animals on Hand records must be completed and maintained to include all animals acquired and all animal disposition
dates. Records must be kept so that animals can be traced and tracked in the event of disease outbreak, and to ensure
all parties are licensed, if a license is required.

that would require use of the plan, be reviewed annually, and be made available for APHIS upon request.
