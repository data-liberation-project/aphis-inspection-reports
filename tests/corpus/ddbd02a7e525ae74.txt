ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The 6 Shetland sheep were observed sitting in the shade and breathing heavily. Sheep with a thick coat of wool
are prone to heat stress, which can negatively affect the health of the animals. During days when temperatures are
above 85 degrees and animals are showing sign of heat stress, immediate measures must be taken to prevent the
animals from overheating. Measures to provide immediate relief from heat stress must be developed and
implemented in consultation with the attending veterinarian. Correct by May 19, 2017.
NOTE: A water sprinkler was added to the pen for the Shetland sheep at the time of the exit briefing and report
signing on May 19, 2017.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The 6 Shetland sheep were observed sitting or standing in various areas within the pen in the shade and
breathing heavily. The temperature outside was over 90 degrees and the sheep still have a thick coat of wool.
Animals demonstrating excessive panting indicate they are overheating. A thick coat of wool contributes to heat
stress in animals. The animals must have the wool sheared to prevent illness, relieve their stress, and for their
comfort and well-being. Correct by May 22, 2017.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***Fourteen guinea pigs are housed in an outdoor enclosure with a shelter box. There is no auxiliary ventilation in
the shelter. However, the enclosure is partially located under a tree which provides some shade. The ideal
temperature range for guinea pigs is 65 – 75 degrees. On the day of inspection the temperature was over 90
degrees. Guinea pigs do not tolerate heat or temperature extremes well. The average climatic conditions for the
area in the spring and summer is outside of the ideal temperature range for guinea pigs. In accordance with the
regulations, approval to house these guinea pigs outside in the current enclosure must be obtained from the Deputy
Administrator. A variance request must be submitted to the Eastern Region office for official approval. Correct by
May 31, 2017. NOTE: Guidance on submitting a variance was provided.3.78(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shelter from the elements
*** There is insufficient shade on Lemur Island for the nine (9) ring-tailed lemurs. Although there are trees on the
island, the lemurs ate the leaves leaving the trees bare. The bare trees provide no protection from sunlight. The
open front shelter box does cast shade in a small area, mostly directly under the shelter, at certain times of the day.
The area of shade is insufficient for the lemurs to be comfortably protected from the sunlight, which can cause
discomfort and overheating of the animals. Adequate protection from the sunlight is not provided throughout the
day. For the comfort of the animals, structures must be added to the enclosure to ensure that all animals can seek
shelter from the sunlight throughout the day. Correct by May 19, 2017.
NOTE: A shade cloth had been placed on one side of the island at the time of the exit briefing and report signing on
May 19, 2017.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***There are nine (9) ring-tailed lemurs and three (3) red ruffed lemurs on their respective islands. The single
shelters on each island does not provide sufficient space for all 12 lemurs to comfortably seek shelter from the
elements at one time. The shelters are too small to protect animals that rest near the opening of the box. Additional
shelter or modifications to the current shelter structures must be provided to ensure all of the lemurs will be
protected from any weather conditions that may occur. Correct by May 31, 2017.
NOTE: Corrected at the time of the exit briefing and report signing on May 19, 2017 by adding a wind block to the
front of the shelter boxes.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The shelter roof of the warthog pen is constructed of wood panels. Some of the wood panels are warped and
detached, leaving opening in portions of the roof structure that will allow wind and rain to pass through. Shelter
structures must be constructed in a manner that protects the animals from inclement weather. The shelter roof must
be repaired and constructed in a manner that will prevent the animals from being exposed to rain and wind when
seeking cover in the shelter. Correct by May 20, 2017
NOTE: Corrected at the time of the final exit briefing and report signing on May 19, 2017 by adding a tin roof.3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The giraffe is locked out of the barn on a sunny day with temperatures in the high 90s. One spot of shade is
available to the giraffe in varying locations in the enclosure throughout the day. There is no shade structure within
the enclosure. Animals mus have adequate protection from sunlight to prevent discomfort and over heating. An
adequate shade structure must be provided within the outdoor enclosure or changes implemented in the husbandry
practices that will allow more access to indoor housing. Correct by May 20, 2017.
Corrected: The giraffe was given access to the indoor housing the time of the exit briefing and report signing on May
19, 2017. Access will be allowed until a shade structure is constructed in the outdoor enclosure.
This inspection included the evaluation of the animal care program for birds in the aviary in response to a complaint.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with lead keeper and the CEO by phone.
