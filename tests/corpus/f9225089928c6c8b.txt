**** The APHIS form 7005 shows 25 dogs and the physical count during the inspection was 30. Inaccurate list of
breeding dogs inhibits the ability to track dogs from where they came from and where they go from your facility. All
intact dogs purchased, acquired, owned, controlled,or held in your possession must be listed on the 7005 and
accurately reflect the number of dogs in your facility.

**** Along the edge of the pens, the grass has grown to approximately 12 inches into the fence. Three pens have
grass in the middle of the pens that is approximately 6 inches in some areas. The overgrown grass inhibits the
ability to clean the pens and harbor pests which can impact the health and well being of the dogs. All grass in and
around the pens must be maintained to ensure the dogs are protected from pests and ensure proper cleaning of the
pens.
