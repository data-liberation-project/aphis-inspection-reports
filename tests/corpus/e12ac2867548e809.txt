Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
Two puppies (AWBs 001-62570815 and 001-63178301) originated from St. Louis, MO and travelled through Chicago, IL
on American Airlines flight 2317 and flight 2131. The puppies were inspected upon arrival at SAN by the APHIS official at
1:38 PM and 1:45 PM, respectively. Neither crate had an attached consignor's certification statement.

Carriers must not accept a dog for transport in commerce unless the consignor certifies in writing that the dog was offered
food and water during the 4 hours before delivery. The certification must be securely attached to the outside of the
primary enclosure in a manner that makes it easily noticed and read, and must include the consignor's name and address,
the time and date the animal was last fed and watered, specific instructions for the next feeding(s) and watering(s) for a
24-hour period, and the consignor's signature including date and time the certification was signed.

Failure to provide a consignor's certification, including details regarding the last feeding/watering and instructions for
feeding and watering during transport, may result in handling that could be detrimental to the well-being of the animal. It
is the carrier's responsibility to ensure that the consignor's certification is complete and securely attached to the outside of


the primary enclosure when animals are accepted for transport, so that accurate information is available to those handling
the animals during transit.

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
One puppy (AWB 001-43245823) originated from Dayton, OH and travelled through Chicago, IL on American Airlines
flight 4067 and flight 2131. The puppy was inspected upon arrival at SAN by the APHIS official at 1:23 PM. A food and
water certification was attached to the top of the crate, which stated that the animal was last offered food and water at
4:00 AM on 4/5/22.

The attached food and water instructions stated that the animal should be offered water and food at 4:00 AM on 4/5/22;
This is the same day/time that the animal was last offered food and water. The consignor's certification must include the
time and date the animal was last fed and watered and the specific instructions for the next feeding(s) and watering(s) for
a 24-hour period.

Failure to provide clear instructions may result in handling that could be detrimental to the well-being of the animal. It is
the carrier's responsibility to ensure that the consignor's instructions for feeding and watering are clear and complete
when accepting dogs for transport, so that accurate information is available to those handling the animals during transit.
3.15(a)(9)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
One puppy (AWB 001-43245823) originated from Dayton, OH and travelled through Chicago, IL on American Airlines
flight 4067 and flight 2131. The puppy was inspected upon arrival at SAN by the APHIS official at 1:23 PM. The solid-
bottomed crate contained no litter or absorbent material.



Unless the dog is on a raised slatted or mesh floor, the primary enclosure must contain enough previously unused litter to
absorb and cover excreta. Failure to provide suitable absorbent material could potentially allow the animal to become
soiled in excreta. The carrier must insure that all dog transport enclosures contain a suitable absorbent material that is
safe and nontoxic.
3.17(c)

Food and water requirements.
One puppy (AWB 001-43245823) originated from Dayton, OH and travelled through Chicago, IL on American Airlines
flight 4067 and flight 2131. The puppy was inspected upon arrival at SAN by the APHIS official at 1:23 PM. The crate
contained only 1 bowl, which was unattached to the primary enclosure and was overturned.

Food and water receptacles must be securely attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that the receptacles
can be filled from outside the enclosure without opening the door. Failure to do so could be detrimental to the well-being
of the animal, because it is difficult to safely offer food and water as required. When accepting dogs for transport, the
carrier should ensure that there are both food and water receptacles in the enclosure, and they are securely attached and
placed so that the receptacles can be filled without opening the door.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the cargo representative.
