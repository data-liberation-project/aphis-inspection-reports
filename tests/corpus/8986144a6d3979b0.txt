3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the main kennel, 18 plastic feeders, used to feed 18 adult dogs, are excessively chewed along the top. There is
brown debris within the chewed areas. The brown debris within the chewed areas indicates the plastic feeders
cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. Improper cleaning and sanitization can increase the disease potential for
the dogs. All chewed and worn surfaces must be repaired or replaced so they can be readily cleaned and sanitized.
Surfaces that can be readily cleaned and sanitized will reduce the disease hazards for the dogs.
To be corrected by: 20-September-2014.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the owners.
This inspection will be sent by e-mail.
