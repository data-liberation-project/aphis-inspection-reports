3.130 Watering
There are two beavers housed in an enclosure without a fresh water source. These animals do have access to a
pool that is duped, cleaned and re-filled with fresh water once a week. Having fresh and potable water on a daily
basis decreases the risk of illness or disease. Fresh water needs to be provided to all animals on a daily basis as a
minimum. Water may need to be provided more often if necessary for the health and comfort of the animals.
