Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
***One adult female Nubian ibex is observed to be non-weight bearing on her left front leg. The animal is reluctant to
move; when standing she touches her left forefoot on the ground or raises it outward in front of her. When walking, she
carries that leg out in front and the gait is affected as she heaves her left forequarter forward. When asked, the licensee
stated this animal was evaluated by the attending veterinarian (AV) a few years ago and said nothing could be done.
Upon speaking with the AV, the AV confirmed that she had seen the animal and believed the condition was chronic but
had performed no diagnostic workup or prescribed specific treatment. She recalled that the plan was to re-evaluate but
that had not been done recently; the AV last visited the facility two or three months ago, she states. Lameness can be
caused by a variety of problems including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing
and affect the health and well-being of the animal.

***One adult female and one adult male white-tailed deer were observed to be emaciated, with protruding hip bones,
spine, and ribs. The bones of their spine, hips, and long bones were visible, and each rib was easily seen by both APHIS
inspectors upon inspection. They have a rough, unthrifty hair coat and overgrown hooves. These animals were discussed
with the veterinarian, who advised the licensee to modify the nutrition, but that was not done. However, further diagnostic


workup has not been done to document their declining condition. In addition, there are two adult addax that appear thin to
emaciated with prominent ribs and vertebrae. In an enclosure that houses one of these thin addax, there is no hay or
other typical feed present, but there is a plant in the pen growing from the ground and all of its leaves and smaller
peripheral stems are gone. This similar or same type of plant grows in other enclosures containing the other addax, but it
is not being eaten. Poor body condition can be an indication of health issues, including parasitism, poor dentition,
malnutrition, and systemic disease.

***One adult male hog deer is observed to have right rear lameness and has some wounds present on his right hip. The
animal is reluctant to move at first and tried to remain laying down behind a bale of hay. When coaxed to move, it toe
touches the affected limb to the ground when standing, carries it completely off the ground when walking, and does a
“bunny hop” with the rear legs together when running. There are two, circular areas of hair loss ranging from 1.5-2.5” in
diameter on the right hip, revealing pink skin. The owner noted the lameness previously a week or two ago, but did not
communicate it to the veterinarian, and no veterinary evaluation was performed on this animal. Lameness can be caused
by a variety of problems including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and
affect the health and well-being of the animal.

***One adult female fennec fox has multiple hair mats present on her back. There are six distinct hair mats among
tangled fur which extends along the top of the back from the shoulder blade area to the base of the tail and along both
sides of the animal. The licensee stated that he had noticed the mats but doesn’t know how long they’ve been there.
He mentioned this animal does shed a lot. Matted hair can lead to medical problems, it can cause skin irritation, pain and
progress to infected lesions. A system of monitoring and brushing to prevent the fur from becoming matted should be in


place to maintain the health and well-being of the animal.

*** Five, adult Nubian ibex and three, adult white-tailed deer have overgrown hooves, affecting the angles of the feet, due
to a lack of hoof trimming. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or
cause injuries. As part of the facility’s program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals
receive appropriate hoof care in a timely manner.

*** One adult male muntjac has a one-inch, linear, superficial wound with fresh blood , surrounded by wet, dehaired skin.
on his back. The licensee states he had not observed it previously. The APHIS inspector observed the animal licking at
the wound site during the inspection.

The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The licensee
must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending
veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use
of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee was verbally
instructed during the exit interview that all animals listed in this citation must be evaluated by a veterinarian, with
diagnostic/treatment plans and written guidance provided which must be followed by close of business on August 27,
2021.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.


At the time of inspection, there are no records available for inspection to reflect acquisition and disposition of animals in
the inventory or for veterinary care provided to sick or injured animals.
Records containing the required information for animals removed from the inventory for any reason or acquired for use in
regulated activities, including those offspring born on premise, are necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their
humane care and use. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition and disposition of all animals
that fully and correctly disclose the required information.

Housing facilities, general.
The food preparation areas in the barn housing 11 ring-tailed lemurs and two fennec foxes are dirty and cluttered, with
numerous chemical agents (Comet cleanser, WD-40, Flex Seal, moth crystals) stored on or above the surfaces where
food is prepared.
Unsanitary conditions and keeping chemicals on food preparation surfaces can result in contamination of food and animal
illness. Substances that are toxic to non-human primates must not be stored in food storage and preparation areas.
Chemicals must not be kept or used in close proximity to food preparation and storage areas, and food preparation areas
should be kept clean and sanitary.
TO BE CORRECTED BY AUGUST 31, 2021.
3.80(a)(2)(iii) Critical

Primary enclosures.
In the lemur barn, there are two, juvenile, ring-tailed lemurs that were seen leaving and entering the other lemur
enclosures by squeezing through the metal squares of the enclosure fencing which are 2X4” openings. This allows the
animals access to the barn, other lemur enclosures, and potentially the outside areas of the facility through windows and


doors opened in the barn to facilitate ventilation.
Primary enclosures that do not contain the animals can facilitate escape and/or injury. Primary enclosures must be
constructed and maintained so that they contain the non-human primates securely and protect the animals from harm.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
At the time of inspection, there is an inadequate written plan in place for environmental enhancement for most of the
nonhuman primates, including two spider monkeys, three lar gibbons, 11 ring-tailed lemurs and three brown capuchins.
There is limited environmental enrichment within the lar gibbon, spider monkey and capuchin enclosures, which consists
of items for climbing and swinging, but none that facilitate cognitive/sensory enrichment.
Environmental enhancement is important to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. A plan for
environmental enhancement that addresses social grouping, environmental enrichment, and other special considerations
such as juveniles and individually housed animals, must be developed and followed for each nonhuman primate at the
facility. This plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards and approved by the
attending veterinarian.
3.83 Direct

Watering.
***In the lemur barn, there is an enclosure containing two adult and two juvenile ring-tailed lemurs with two empty water
bottles and no other source of potable water available. When the bottles were filled and replaced, the adults drank
vigorously and continuously for three minutes. At that point the juveniles that exited the cage returned and took turns
drinking continuously with the adults in the enclosure for an additional two minutes. This level of thirst suggests the
animals were without water for some time.


CORRECT IMMEDIATELY AND FROM THIS TIME FORWARD.

***In one enclosure containing a single, male lar gibbon, there is a water receptacle containing water that contains feces,
feathers, dirt and other debris. There is no source of potable water in the enclosure.
CORRECT IMMEDIATELY AND FROM THIS TIME FORWARD.

***In the capuchin enclosure housing three adult brown capuchins, the single water receptacle contains cloudy, brown
water with leaves, feathers and green material floating on the top. There is no source of potable water accessible to the
animals.
CORRECT IMMEDIATELY AND FROM THIS TIME FORWARD.

The provision of potable water is a basic need, and insufficient water intake can lead to dehydration and illness. Potable
water must be provided in sufficient quantity to every non-human primate in the facility. If potable water is not continually
available, it must be offered to them as often as necessary to ensure their health and well-being.
3.84(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In the enclosure housing three brown capuchin monkeys, there is an accumulation of decaying vegetable matter, food
debris and feces on the bench inside the shelter, completely covering one third of the bench and scattered less densely
across the remaining two-thirds.

Routine cleaning and sanitation must be done daily to protect the health and well-being of nonhuman primates. Dirt, fecal


material, food waste, and other debris must be removed daily to prevent contamination of food, prevent nonhuman
primates from becoming soiled and to reduce disease hazards.
3.84(b)(3)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
***There are five dirty water bottles on three lemur enclosures, containing a total of six adult and juvenile ring-tailed
lemurs. The bottles have brown and green material on the inside of the bottles.

***There are three gibbon enclosures, housing a total of three adult gibbons, with water receptacles that have a brown
and green slime covering the interior of the receptacles.

***In the enclosure containing three capuchins, there is a dirty water receptacle with brown and green slime covering the
interior of the receptacle. Unsanitary water receptacles can lead to the contamination of the water inside, making the
water unpalatable and/or causing illness. Food and water receptacles must be sanitized using live steam under pressure
or washing with soap/detergent in water that is at least 180F (such as in a cage washer), or by washing them with
appropriate detergent solutions or disinfectants or a combination with a thorough cleaning to remove organic material, so
as to remove all organic material and mineral buildup, and to provide sanitation followed by a clean water rinse.

Employees.
The facility owner states that he has insufficient staff to provide adequate cleaning, feeding, general husbandry and facility
maintenance for all of the non-human primates and other animals. This is evident throughout the facility as noted in the
non-compliances cited throughout this report.


Without an adequate labor force, animals and facilities cannot be properly managed and cared for, leading to
circumstances that compromise the health and well-being of the animals. Every person subject to the Animal Welfare
regulations maintaining non-human primates must have enough employees to carry out the required level of husbandry
practices and care. The licensee must acquire sufficient help to manage the animals and facilities according to the Animal
Welfare regulations.

3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
***On the morning of Feb 11, 2021, when the licensee was about to feed the hog deer, she noticed 11 dead hog deer in
the enclosure. The licensee contacted the local animal control. Paw prints were found inside the enclosure and animal
control assumed dogs entered the property through holes they found under the perimeter fence. The hog deer were
temporarily removed from the enclosure, the holes under the fence filled, and the gates locked.
The perimeter fence line must be maintained to protect the deer from predation by animals intruding from the outside.
Perimeter fences must be constructed so that they protect the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals inside the facility. The licensee
implemented daily perimeter fence checks to ensure predators are not digging under the fence.
CORRECTED BEFORE TIME OF INSPECTION.

***In multiple separate enclosures which house nine Nubian ibex, 13 axis deer, and 25 hog deer, the wire fence material
has sharp edges exposed in several areas. The sharp points at the bottom of the fence face into the enclosure where the
animals could come into contact with them.



***In the enclosure housing nine Nubian ibex, one wooden shade structure is in disrepair and the roof is falling down. The
back wood panels of the structure are leaning and not structurally sound. The wood panels are worn and have sharp,
jagged edges that the animals could come into contact with. In the same enclosure there is another shelter structure with
two broken metal panels. At the lower edge, the metal panel isn’t secured to the wood backing and is sticking out,
creating sharp, jagged edges that are facing into the enclosure where the animals could come into contact with them.

***In the enclosure housing three white-tailed deer, the shade structure metal panel is worn in one corner, and the
exposed metal has jagged edges that the deer could come into contact with.

***The shade material covering the fence enclosure of the five muntjacs is in disrepair and coming loose from the fence to
which it is attached. The shade material is creating gaps along one side of the enclosure that can come into contact with
the animals. The loose shade material could lead to entrapment or injury of these animals.

***The enclosure housing seven domesticated goats and one white-tailed deer contains a smaller chain link fencing
enclosure within, which is falling apart. The fencing structure is in disrepair and has many sharp points where the animals
could come into contact with them and cause injury. All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points,
protruding edges, holes, and gaps/openings in order to protect the animals from injury.

Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. A system of
monitoring and maintenance should be in place so that all housing facilities remain structurally sound and in good repair


to protect the animals from injury and/or escape.

Feeding.
***In a sheltered food storage area, there is a wheeled bin containing a mixture of ‘sweet feed’ and dried corn that is
uncovered, with bird feathers and flies seen in the food. The facility owner states that this feed is used for some of the
USDA-regulated species at the facility. Uncovered feed can become contaminated and/or lose nutrient value, leading to
animal illness.

***In the muntjac enclosure containing three adult and two juvenile muntjacs, there is a self-feeder that has caked and
slightly moist food crumbs in the bottom with fresh feed on top, with dirt, spider webs and egg sacs on the interior of the
hopper. These conditions can lead to contamination of fresh feed that is added to the feeder, leading to animal illness.
Food must be wholesome, palatable and free from contamination and of sufficient nutritive value to maintain all animals in
good health; adequate measures must be taken to prevent molding, contamination and deterioration or caking of food.

Watering.
Multiple enclosures throughout the facility (collectively containing one bobcat, five muntjacs, seven white-tailed deer, 20
addax, one barbary sheep, 10 oryx, 19 Nubian ibex, four camels, 13 axis deer, and seven domestic goats) have water
bowls or troughs that are covered in thick, slimy green-brown material and/or have cloudy water with debris floating on the
surface.
Unsanitary water receptacles and unpotable water can be unpalatable to animals and lead to illness. It is the responsibility


of the licensee to make sure all water receptacles be kept clean and sanitary for the overall health and well-being of the
animal.

Sanitation.
***In the muntjac enclosure containing three adult and two juvenile muntjacs, there is a decomposing bird carcass. The
presence of dead and decaying animals can attract pests and vermin and be a source of disease-causing agents and
odors.
TO BE CORRECTED BY AUGUST 26, 2021.

***In five enclosures, collectively containing 10 oryx, 19 addax, 13 axis deer, one barbary sheep and one bobcat, there
are multiple lengths of plastic twine in piles or strewn across the ground. This material poses a risk of illness due to
ingestion or injury due to entrapment.

Employees.
At the time of inspection, the facility owner states that he does not have sufficient help to facilitate adequate animal care
and husbandry, cleaning and maintenance of facilities. This is evident in numerous areas of the facility, as noted


throughout this report.
Without an adequate labor force, animals and facilities cannot be properly managed, leading to circumstances that
compromise the health and well-being of the animals. A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be
utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices as set forth in the regulations.
