2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The one rabbit remaining on protocol 1506 amendment 2 was observed to be wearing an e collar. There were pasty
feces noted on the cage floor. Facility employees stated that the e collar may result in the rabbit not eating its full
amount of the regular diet and was being supplemented with vegetables resulting in the abnormal fecal pellets. The
protocol states that the animal will wear an e collar for 7 days post op. This rabbit has worn an e collar for greater
than 7 days. There is concern that the e collar is restricting access to a full amount of the normal diet and also
restricts the rabbits ability to consume night feces which is a necessary part of the digestive process for rabbits. The
extended use of the e collar - longer than stated in the protocol is a significant change in the care and use of
animals and requires IACUC review and approval prior to the change. The IACUC must review and approve ,require
modifications to or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in
ongoing activities.
