2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
I attempted to contact the licensee by his cell phone at 1502. The call went to a message stating a voicemail had
not been set up. I called the licensee's house phone and spoke to his wife. I informed her that I was there to do an
inspection. She stated that her husband would not be home for another hour and there was no one to take me
through for an inspection. I informed her that this would be a repeat for an attempted and she indicated that was
fine.
End of report.
