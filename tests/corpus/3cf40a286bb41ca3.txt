2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care instructs the licensee to administer Ivermectin as a heartworm preventative to all
adult dogs once a month from April through December. When asked if the licensee is doing this, he informed me
that he has not been. In addition, the licensee uses a product called Organic GI Renew which is labeled for horses.
The Program of Veterinary Care does not give instructions to use this product on the dogs. Not following the
Program of Veterinary Care doesn't ensure that the dogs are receiving proper treatement or care. The Program of
Veterinary Care must be followed from here on out. Correct immediately.

MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
One puppy born on 10/15/16 was sold by the licensee on 12/9/16. The puppy would have been 55 days old on the
day of sale which is one day shy of the required 8 weeks of age. Dogs younger than 8 weeks of age are more
susceptible to stresses that occur from travelling and being placed into a new facility. Their immune systems are
more susceptible to becoming comprised which could cause them to become sick and even die. The licensee must
not sell any more puppies under 8 weeks of age unless it is directly to the end consumer. Correct immediately.
3.3(e)(1)(i)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Three dogs were housed in a barn separate from the rest of the dogs. The concrete floor in this barn was not
sealed and was not impervious to moisture. Not having the floor sealed and impervious to moisture doesn't ensure
that it can be readily and easily cleaned and sanitized which could contribute to the spread of disease. All indoor
floor areas in contact with the animals must be made impervious to moisture. Correct by 1/19/17.
3.6(a)(2)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Three dogs housed in a barn separate from the rest of the dogs did not have proper enclosures that contained
them. The dogs were able to roam throughout the barn and could enter an enclosure that contained a horse. Notproviding the dogs proper enclosures that effectively contains them doesn't ensure that they can't easily get injured.
If the dogs were to enter the enclosure containing the horse, they could get stepped on which could injure or even
kill them. The dogs must be provided enclosures that properly contain them. Correct immediately.
3.6(c)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During inspection (at approximately 2:30 p.m.), an adult female Golden Retriever (#96) was observed to be chained
up to the front of the enclosure. The chain had very little slack for the dog to move around. When I questioned the
licensee about this, he informed me that the dog was chained up so the male in the enclosure could breed with her.
Tethering a dog for an extended period of time can be uncomfortable and stressful for that dog. In addition, it can
result in injury to the dog. Tethering of dogs for breeding purposes or any other purposes must be immediately
stopped. Correct immediately.
Note: The licensee unchained this dog during inspection.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
During inspection, the licensee was asked how often he is sanitizing the primary enclosures. He informed me that
he sanitizes about every 2-3 months. Not sanitizing the primary enclosures doesn't ensure that the various types of
germs (such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, etc.) have been killed and that the cage is safe to use for new incoming
dogs. All primary enclosures must be sanitized once every two weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. Correct by 1/2/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
