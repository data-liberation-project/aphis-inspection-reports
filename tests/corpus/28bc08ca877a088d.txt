3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
***This was a focus inspection specifically addressing the direct non-compliant item from May 13, 2014, 3.9 (b)
Feeding.
In one dog shelter there was one self-feeder that had ants crawling among the food that was accessible for two
dogs. In the cattery there was an enclosure with three cats that had one food dish with cat litter (wood pellets) mixed
in the food from the litter pan directly next to it. Contaminated food can decrease the animals acceptance of the food
and can increase the risk of disease and health hazards. Pest can transmit diseases or harm the animals.
Contaminated cat food was replaced during inspection. Licensee needs to replace the dog food containing ants.
The licensee needs to establish and maintain a program to ensure that food is protected from contamination and
pests.
Veterinary care from the May 13, 2014 for animals (073-609-108), (084-102-559), (041-597-005) have been
addressed.
Inspection and verbal exit interview were done with licensee on 5/27/2014.
