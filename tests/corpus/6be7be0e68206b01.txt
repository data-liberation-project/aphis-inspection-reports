Primary enclosures.
An enclosure was noted to have a missing clip attaching the left side of the cage floor to the rest of the enclosure. There
was a gap approximately 20 inches long and up to approximately 2 inches wide between the side and the floor of the
enclosure which would potentially allow entrapment or injury of an animal’s extremity.
The floors of the primary enclosures shall be constructed so as to protect the rabbits’ feet and legs from injury.
Correct from this day forward.

Black mold and green algae was noted coating an approximately 2 by 5 foot area on the window coverings and wall siding
beneath each of the misters along the north wall causing warping of the siding and discoloration and degradation of the


siding and window covering.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribe
husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
