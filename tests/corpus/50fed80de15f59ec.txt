2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was found not to include all regulated species on exhibit at the
premises. The PVC is missing plans of adequate veterinary care for chinchillas, flying squirrels and domestic cats.
Adequate veterinary care for all animals on the premises of the licensee must be included in the facility's PVC. The
PVC must be revised/approved by the attending veterinarian to ensure adequate veterinary care for all animals on
the premises is provided, and to ensure adequate veterinary guidance is provided to personnel involved in the care
of all animals.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records for animals at hand containing required information on acquisition/disposition information of these were
found to be incomplete and/or inadequate. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which
fully and correctly disclose information on purchased or otherwise acquired animals, and that are in his or her
possession/control. The Record of Animals on Hand (APHIS Form 7019) and Record of Acquisition, Disposition, or
Transport of Animals (APHIS Form 7020) are forms which may be used by the licensee to keep and maintain the
information required by federal regulations. The licensee needs to obtain/document the required information on all
recently acquired animals as soon as possible.
