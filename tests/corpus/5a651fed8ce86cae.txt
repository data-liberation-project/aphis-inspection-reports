3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
There were 8 enclosures housing a total of 106 guinea pigs on the left side of the building with accumulations of excreta,
soiled bedding, and dried debris covering the floors. The belting material used on the floors had chewed edges along the
sides with dirt and debris accumulations. The cleaning process (method & frequency) utilized is not effective in removing
this accumulation. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation can expose the guinea pigs to disease hazards and health risks.
Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding and debris. In
addition, enclosures must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. Remains uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
