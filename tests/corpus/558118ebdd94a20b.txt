ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Multiple adult dogs had a variety of skin and haircoat conditions.
**A male Cocker Spaniel named Crosby had patchy hair loss over much of his body. He also had thickened skin on
the underside of his neck, chest, on his rump either side of his tail.
**A female Cocker Spaniel named Mooney had greasy hair over her back and sides, patchy hair loss, scaly skin,
and reddened scabby areas on her chest.
**A female Cocker Spaniel named Gloria had nearly complete hair loss on her tail, the adjacent areas on her rump,
and behind her ears. She also had areas of missing hair on her neck and back.
**A male Springer Spaniel named Spiffy had areas of missing hair about the size of a silver dollar to the right of his
tail and on the tip of his tail.
**A male Cocker Spaniel named Archie had matted hair on his ears and both back feet.
**A female Bernese Mtn. Dog named Sheba had matted hair behind both ears, on her back, and above her tail.
Skin conditions can be the result of underlying medical conditions, parasites, or inadequate nutrition. Matted hair
can be painful and result in skin lesions. The licensee had tried to treat the skin conditions on her own but they
either returned or never completely resolved. The licensee must remove the matted hair and consult a veterinarian
about the skin conditions. She must follow the veterinarian's treatment schedule and seek further consultation if the
problems do not completely resolve.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is not performing adequate daily observations to detect ticks on her dogs. The licensee does not have
direct and frequent communication with her veterinarian regarding the skin problems of her dogs. Daily observation
of all the dogs and direct, frequent communication with the veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The Golden Retrievers had dug a hole under the fence of their enclosure and during the inspection were crawling
under the fence and entering the adjacent Weimaraner enclosure. The two male dogs began fighting, resulting in
the Golden Retriever receiving a bite on one ear. Primary enclosures must be structurally sound and kept in good
repair to prevent dogs from escaping. The licensee must ensure that enclosures contain the dogs securely.

establish an effective pest control program for the dogs and the premises.
