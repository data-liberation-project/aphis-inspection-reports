2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult, female English Bulldog named "Sally" microchip identification # 0A02536230 was infested with fleas. The
licensee stated that she had treated all of the English Bulldogs at the kennel by dividing a fipronil-based topical flea
and tick product labeled for dogs weighing between 89 and 133lbs between the dogs. The licensee's Program of
Veterinary Care states that topical fipronil-based flea and tick product should only be used for the licensee's "non
English bulldog" breeds and that "Capstar" oral treatment should be used to treat and prevent fleas and ticks for the
English Bulldogs. The licensee is altering medication dosages without the instruction of a licensed veterinarian and
is not using medications as directed by the Attending Veterinarian in the Program of Vet Care. The licensee shall
provide adequate veterinary care to animals at the facility by providing treatments as prescribed by the Attending
Veterinarian and administering medications according to the manufacturer's instruction label.
There was a bottle of Pyrantel Palmate that expired in August of 2008, with a dosage syringe setting on top of the
enclosure containing an adult, female English Bulldog and her 5 un-weaned puppies. Medications that have expired
may not have the desired effect intended. The licensee shall provide adequate veterinary care by only treating
animals with medications that follow the manufactures label and that have not met their expiration date.
2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There was a black, female Pug born on 7/24/2015, also listed in the previous two inspection reports that did not
have official identification. In addition, there was a female English Bulldog juvenile born on 12/20/2015 that did not
have official identification. Proper identification of each animal is needed for record keeping and animal traceability.
The licensee shall ensure each animal at the facility is officially identified.
3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The plastic dog houses in two of the outdoor enclosures had sharp, pointed screws that protruded upwards from thebase plate edge surrounding the outside of the house. It appeared that the screws had been used to secure the
floor of the dog house to the top and to secure the wind and rain break to the entrance. The sharp points of the
screws are at ground level and easily accessed by the dogs. Screws with sharp points such as these, were also
identified during the previous inspection. The licensee shall ensure that all primary enclosures are constructed so
that they do not have sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.

disease. The licensee shall incorporate an effective pest control program to prevent and treat fleas and other
external parasites. TO BE CORRECTED BY:05/25/2016
