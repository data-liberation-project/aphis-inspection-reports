2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* Erin, a seven year old female Golden Retriever, (ID#: 61), has hair loss on both back hips. The hair loss on both
sides is approximately 4 inches in diameter. The skin is dark in these areas and dry. The hair loss in these areas
could be external parasites and or various skin disease conditions. The hair loss can cause suffering and irritation
to the dog. This can cause the dog to excessively scratch these areas.

The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document
this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals
receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Five enclosures have a buildup of brown to black grime on the walls, dog doors and the inserts for the dog doors.
This indicates that daily spot-cleaning is not taking place. Without daily spot-cleaning these surfaces have an
accumulation of grime and increase the disease hazards for the six adult dogs housed in these enclosures.
All surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily to prevent an accumulation of waste and grime. Daily spot-cleaning will
decrease the disease potential for the dogs.
To be corrected by, 27-February -2016.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.* The south enclosure, housing two adult dogs, has an accumulation of fecal waste, snow and ice. This indicates
daily spot-cleaning is not taking place. The accumulation of fecal waste can increase disease hazards and odors.
The snow and ice can allow for the dogs to be constantly wet when melting. The snow and ice can harbor fluid
waste that can potentially cause odors.
Enclosures must be spot-cleaned daily to prevent an accumulation of fecal waste, snow and ice. Daily
spot-cleaning will decrease the disease potential, odors and allow for the dogs to remain dry.
