3.1(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
The outdoor enclosure housing "Nellie", a female boxer, has a 4 inch section at the lower left side of the shelter entrance
where the metal is rusted. Rusted metal surfaces can not be adequately cleaned and sanitized and could harbor bacteria
or other infectious organisms that could cause disease.
All surfaces that come in contact with dogs must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and
sanitation, or that affects the structural strength of the surface.
3.4(b)(3)

Outdoor housing facilities.
Nine outdoor enclosures housing 11 dogs and 9 puppies have shelters that do not have wind and rain breaks at the
entrance. Wind and rain breaks on shelter entrances provide important protection from the elements for dogs housed
outdoors. Without them, dogs are potentially exposed to rain, snow, and wind that could cause physical stress and
detrimentally effect their health and well-being..
All shelters in outdoor enclosures must be provided with a wind break and rain break at the entrance.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.


The Program of Veterinary Care does not include a plan for sampling for parasites. Sampling for parasites (Heartworm
and intestinal) is important to ensure prevention and treatment schedules are effective in protecting dogs and puppies
from the disease and health issues these parasites cause.
The Program of Veterinary Care must include a plan for sampling for parasites (including frequency and numbers to be
tested) in accordance with a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian,.
