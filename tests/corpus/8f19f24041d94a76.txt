ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 230pm on
14-Nov-16.
I called the facility and the owner was working at a different location and was unable to come home to conduct an
inspection at this time. We discussed hours of availability.
