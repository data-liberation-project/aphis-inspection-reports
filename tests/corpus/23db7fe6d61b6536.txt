as soon as possible.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence separating the public from one of the Bat-Eared Foxes was found to be non-compliant with
regulations, and should be fixed / modified as soon as possible. The fence must be constructed so that it protects
the animals from contact with the public. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the enclosure to
prevent physical contact between the animals inside the enclosure and persons on the other side of the perimeter
fence. The fence should be not less than three (3) feet in distance from the primary enclosure.
