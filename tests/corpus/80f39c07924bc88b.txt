2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
**While reviewing records it was noted that Section D, Emergency Care on the program of veterinary care refers to
"Abbott attending veterinarian or backup veterinarian would provide emergency care", however, the name of the
back-up veterinarian is not indicated. Not listing the backup veterinarian on the program of veterinary care does not
ensure the animals have access to appropriate emergency veterinary care. The program of veterinary care should
be reviewed by the attending veterinarian on a regular basis to ensure appropriate veterinary care is being provided
to the animals.
