Primary enclosures.
The primary enclosure of a 3.64 years old female Cynomolgus macaque was not safe for this particular animal as it did
not protect the primate from injury. The animal was found dead inside the cage on October 14th, 2021; the head was
entrapped between the squeeze back mechanism bar and the ceiling of the enclosure. Primary enclosures must be
designed and constructed so that they protect the nonhuman primates from injury. The facility should ensure enclosures
are appropriate for the animals housed within to protect them from injury.
