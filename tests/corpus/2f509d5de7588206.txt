2.40(b)(4) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the Pleasant Hill site it was discovered that an expired vial of Ketamine (Lot # 111211A), internally identified as
vial # 14, expiration date Nov 2014) had been used to provide anesthesia for three different animals / procedures in
December, 2014, before the notation on 12/5/14 "Discard - Expired".
Steps should be put into place to ensure the verification of quality / expiration date prior to use or need of all drugs
to be used on animals. Expired drugs should be clearly labeled and / or removed, so that they are not accidentally
employed. The use of expired drugs could negatively impact the health and well-being of the animals.
This is a repeat citation, cited previously at the San Leandro campus on 1/22/14.
The inspection was completed at the San Leandro and Pleasant Hill campuses.
An exit interview was completed with a facility representative at each location.
