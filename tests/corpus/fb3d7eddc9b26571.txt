INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Attending Veterinarian has not been paid for her services since October 2014. An Attending Veterinarian is an
essential and required component of an institution's animal welfare programs. The IACUC has recognized this, and
cited this as a Significant Deficiency on their Semi-Annual Program Review. Despite this, no progress has been
made, and this remains an uncorrected Significant Deficiency. Although the Attending Veterinarian has continued to
provide services, this situation could pose a threat to the health and safety of the animals, if left unresolved. The
IACUC is responsible for reporting uncorrected Significant Deficiencies to APHIS and any other Federal agency
funding activities, in writing, within 15 days of failing to meet a scheduled plan for correction.
The facility should notify APHIS in writing of this deficiency, with a plan for correction, by 5/15/15.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
