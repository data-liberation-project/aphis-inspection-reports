ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***One of the rabbits had excessively long nails that were causing the toes to turn in an outward direction due to a
lack of nail trimming.
Failure to appropriately maintain nails can cause postural and gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause
injuries. As part of the facility’s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals
receive appropriate nail care in a timely manner.
This rabbit must have the nails trimmed by November 9, 2016
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
