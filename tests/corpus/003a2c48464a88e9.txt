***** During the time of inspection, there was a 1000 ml bottle of Safeguard cattle and goat dewormer for use in
parasite control at facility. This medication did not have a prescription label or instructions for its use. If Safeguard is
handled or administered improperly, it can be injurious or fatal to the animals and/ or owners and personnel.
Adequate guidance to personnel must be provided to those who are involved in handling, dosing, and administering.
The licensee was using medications not approved for use in dogs and not approved by the attending veterinarian.
All medications not approved for use in dogs must be approved by the attending veterinarian and must be listed onthe Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). The mixing instructions (if any), dosage, and directions for use must also be
listed on the PVC.

bottle- expired 08/13, Amoxicillin 500 mg expired 12/23/13, and bottle of Metronidazole 250 mg expired 12/13. In
addition there was a reconstituted brown bottle of an unknown substance without a label with no expiration date
and no labeled dosage or directions for use. These medications were intermingled with other pharmaceuticals that
are currently being used in the sheltered facility and are therefore ready for use.The effectiveness of the dosage
level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated to dogs could be drastically changed or may not
work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure that all medications used are not expired and labeled properly in
