Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There has been a recent change in the part-time Attending Veterinarian for the Licensee. Although the new AV has
recently visited the premises several times and provided care for the animals, there is no written Program of Veterinary
Care from the new Attending Veterinarian.

Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care.

Primary enclosures.
There was no protective cover on the ceiling-mounted fluorescent light fixture located in the Lemur primary enclosure in
the barn, exposing the light bulbs. Uncovered light bulbs can become damaged resulting in possible injury from the
broken glass. There are also elevated perches and a climbing structure in the primary enclosure below the uncovered
light fixture so that the light is within reach of the animals.



Primary enclosures for NHPs must be constructed so that they protect the non-human primates from injury. The
licensee needs to address the uncovered light fixture for the safety of the lemurs.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
There has been a recent change in the part-time Attending Veterinarian for the Licensee. Although the new AV has
visited the premises and provided care for the animals, there is not a plan directed by the new attending veterinarian for
the environment enhancement to promote the psychological well-being of the lemurs.

Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote
the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as
directed by the attending veterinarian.

Facilities, general.
There was some damage noted to outside wall and doorframe of the camel barn. The camels had chewed along the
length of the left side of the doorframe and there was also a 10”x10” hole in the outside wall near the door that exposed
the inner frame construction of the barn wall. It was also noted that the bottom corner of 2”x4” wire mesh on camel pen
fence that is near the tortoise pen had detached and was bowing inwards into the camel pen. The detached corner had


sharp points that could cause an injury.

Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury. The Licensee needs to make repairs to the outside wall of the camel barn and the fencing.
