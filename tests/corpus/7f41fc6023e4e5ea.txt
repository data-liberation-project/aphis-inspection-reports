2.26 REPEAT
ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS.
Twelve puppies younger than six months old were imported from Colombia without documentation and/or
justification showing animals were intended for research or veterinary treatment. Under USDA rules, you cannot
import a dog younger than 6 months old into the United States for resale or adoption and must have a justification to
import them at that age for research or veterinary treatment. All dogs imported for any of those purposes must have
a valid vaccination against rabies, have certain other vaccinations, a veterinary health certificate and not show signs
of disease on import. The registrant must only import puppies of proper age by following USDA rules.

3.17(c) CRITICAL
CARE IN TRANSIT.
At the time of inspection, five French Bulldog puppies (approximately three months of age) were found to be in
distress and in need of immediate veterinary care. The carrier must determine whether any of the dogs are in
obvious physical distress, and arrange for any needed veterinary care as soon as possible. If a dog is obviously ill,
injured, or in physical distress, the carrier must ensure the animal (s) not be transported in commerce, except to
receive veterinary care for the condition. Before the conclusion of this inspection, the carrier proactively arranged
for immediate veterinary medical care by contracting services with a local veterinary clinic.
