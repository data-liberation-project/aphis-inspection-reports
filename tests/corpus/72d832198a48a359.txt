2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection, a white male Maltese puppy (born 9/4/16) was lateral having trouble getting up. I examined the
puppy and found him to be listless. I placed him back down on all four feet to see if he could stand. His back legs
collapsed. He was able to sit somewhat upright with his front legs, but he was unable to stand on all four or walk
around. I examined him further and found his gums to be pale. He also had diarrhea pasted on his fur near his
anus. After examining the puppy, the licensee placed him into a new enclosure to isolate him. His condition
appeared to be getting worse over the next few minutes as he continued to lay laterally and wasn't even lifting his
head to see what was going on around him. The licensee had noticed the puppy was not quite as active as the
other puppies a few days prior and had treated him with Nutrical, but he had not contacted the Attending
Veterinarian about the puppy's condition prior to the inspection.
A dog that has trouble standing or walking around, is listless, has pale gums, and has diarrhea indicates that the
dog has a serious medical condition that needs to be attended to by a Veterinarian immediately. The licensee must
follow up with the Attending Veterinarian to ensure that the puppy receives the appropriate treatment for his
condition.
Note: The licensee contacted the Attending Veterinarian during the inspection and had initiated treatment for the
puppy as per the Attending Veterinarian's instructions.
Note: The veterinary care issues identified during the last inspection on 5/18/16 have been addressed by the
licensee.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
