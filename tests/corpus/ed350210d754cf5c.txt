REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
On October 12, 2016, after reviewing several cybernetic regulated exotic animal for sale adds (www.hoobly.com)
posted by Ms. Jessica Monteagudo, this inspector was able to contact the seller to discuss the unlicensed activity of
advertising/selling USDA regulated animal species.
Any person operating or intending to operate as a dealer, and/or exhibitor, except persons who are exempted from
the licensing requirements under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, must have a valid license. The owner of the
establishment must apply for a license by submitting the required information/documentation to the
USDA-APHIS-AC Regional Director in Raleigh, North Carolina. In the license application form, the establishment
must provide the information requested, including a valid mailing address through which the owner could be
reached at all times, and a valid premises address where animals, animal facilities, equipment, and records may be
inspected for compliance. Packets of the license application materials were mailed to the establishment by the
USDA-APHIS-AC Regional Office. Also, this inspector will mail a license application packet on this day.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT OBTAINING A VALID USDA LICENSE.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Ms. Jessica Monteagudo.
