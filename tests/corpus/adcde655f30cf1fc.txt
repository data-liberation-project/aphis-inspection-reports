HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
In the sheltered whelping building, the temperature was 89.8 degrees F at about 2:00 pm. An adult female English
Bulldog and her four unweaned puppies along with 7 weaned English Bulldog puppies and one weaned Pug puppy
were present in the building. All of the dogs were panting heavily and some of the weaned puppies were vocalizing.
The adult female with her 4 puppies and 2 of the weaned puppies were locked inside the building. Shade was not
present in the outdoor portions of the enclosures. A window air conditioning unit was on and showed the
temperature as 90 degrees F. A wall thermometer was present but was broken. Excessive heat can cause pain
and suffering, can affect the health of the dogs, and can lead to death. The inspectors stopped the inspection and
instructed the licensee to correct the problem before the end of the day.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee and with Konnie Plumlee-VMO.
