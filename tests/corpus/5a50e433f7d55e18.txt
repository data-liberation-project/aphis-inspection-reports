ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:35 pm on
13-Feb-17.
I visited the facility and no one was home. I called and spoke to Licensee. He is out of town and unable to
accompany inspection today.
