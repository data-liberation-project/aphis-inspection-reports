PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* There were four adult cats housed in individual enclosures which had no elevated resting surfaces. Elevated
resting surfaces are necessary for the cats' well-being, providing them the opportunity to express normal behavior
such as jumping and perching.
** The licensee must ensure that each primary enclosure housing cats has an elevated resting surface that is large
enough to hold each cat comfortably. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 13 April 2015.
The inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted with the licensee. The licensee acknowledged the
correction date of 13 April 2015 at the time of the exit interview and stated it would be corrected by 11 April 2015.
