FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength.
*****At time of inspection the shelter for the cow, sheep and goat had portions of the wooden boards which made up
the side walls missing. This allows for the potential for injury to an animal and can lead this building to become
structurally unsound if this were to continue.
Repair or replace all boards that are damaged or broken to prevent injury and to keep this building in good repair.
***** The fence to the pasture to the east side of the residence which had sheep, goats, llama and alpaca has
become damaged by falling tree limbs and needs repair to prevent animals from escaping and to keep in good
repair.
***** An old barbed wire fence to the east of the residence needs to be repaired, replaced or removed to prevent
injury to the animals. It has become rusted and sags and is unattached from the posts in several areas.
