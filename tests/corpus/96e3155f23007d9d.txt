3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
The facility self-reported an incident involving a chinchilla kit that occurred on July 1, 2021. A 24-day old chinchilla kit was
found dead in the adjacent cage of two adult chinchillas after escaping from its own cage. According to the facility, the
chinchilla kit had escaped two times previously. Modifications had been made to the caging following each of these
escapes; however, the kit was able to escape a third time, which resulted in its death. The facility has since moved all
dams and kits into different, modified caging and there have been no escapes since this change was made.
Inadequate housing facilities can allow animals to escape which can result in injury or death. All housing facilities must be
appropriate for the animals involved and shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.
To be corrected by 22 October 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
