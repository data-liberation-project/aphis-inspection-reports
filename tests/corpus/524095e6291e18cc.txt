Veterinary care for dogs.
The current program of veterinary care (PVC) on file (APHIS form 7002) is not complete. The PVC does not address the
sampling for worms, coccidia, giardia, or heartworm with a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian. In addition,
the PVC does not address a preventative care and treatment program to ensure healthy and unmatted hair coats,
properly trimmed nails, clean and heathy eyes, ears, skin, and teeth. These items need to be address in the PVC to
ensure preventative and adequate treatment is provided to the dogs. APHIS form 7002A was left with applicant to help
with documenting the program of veterinary care.

This is the 1st re-license inspection for a Class A license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or within 60 days of today or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next re-license inspection.
Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA until it expires.
