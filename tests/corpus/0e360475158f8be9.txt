INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The protocol R258 included drug dosages of 30-50 mg/kg of Ketamine and 3-5 mg/kg of Xylazine for anesthesia for
all guinea pig procedures. A review of the records revealed that for the last 6-9 months dosages of 27 of mg/kg
Ketamine and 0.6 mg/kg of Xylazine have been used on a majority of animals for imaging procedures that require
immobilization but do not require a surgical plane of anesthesia. The lower dosages of anesthetic were developed in
conjunction with the clinical veterinarian, but the protocol was not amended and approved by the IACUC, as
required for this significant change. Additionally, the newly approved version of this protocol (effective 3/24/16) still
contains only the higher dosage of these drugs for all procedures, despite the fact that this is not what is currently
being used for the non-invasive procedures.
Making significant changes to animal use protocols without IACUC review and approval could be detrimental to the
animals, as the review process allows consideration of the best methods to minimize pain and distress.
If the lower dosage is to be used for some procedures, then the current protocol should be amended and approved
prior to any additional animal use that does not adhere to the protocol, and the facility should ensure that all
personnel understands that significant changes to protocols cannot be made without IACUC approval.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
While reviewing the controlled drug logs in an animal procedure room, it was discovered that Xylazine that expired
in March 2014 was still used on guinea pigs through September of 2015, and Euthanasia solution that expired in
October 2014 was still used on guinea pigs through November of 2015.
Use of expired medical materials in anesthesia and euthanasia is not appropriate, and risks inadequate
effectiveness of these drugs which are meant to minimize pain and distress.
The facility should take steps to retrain personnel, and ensure that expired drugs are not used on covered speciesfrom this time forward.
This inspection was conducted on 3/23/16 and 3/24/16 by Veterinary Medical Officers Pamela L. Smith and
Katharine C. Frank.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representatives.
