2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The licensee was unable to provide the inspector with a copy of the facility's current Program of Veterinary Care
(PVC) upon request during the inspection. A written Program of Veterinary Care is required when veterinarians are
employed on a part-time basis in order to ensure that animals receive adequate veterinary care.
The licensee must develop and document a Program of Veterinary Care in consultation with their current attending
veterinarian. This Program of Veterinary Care must be made available to the inspector upon request.
To be corrected by, 4-October-2016.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* There were no APHIS Forms 7019 (Record of Animals on Hand Other Than Dogs and Cats) available to the
inspector upon request during the inspection.

Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with
certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals.
To be corrected by, 4-October-2016.
2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
* An enclosure housing five goats had two unlocked gates entering into the enclosure. There was a coin operated
feeder inside the enclosure. The public was observed going into the enclosure to feed and pet the goats. However,
there was no attendant available in the area when this took place for the monitoring and handling of the animals.
This can increase the risk of harm for the animals and the public. Public exhibition of animals or animals the public comes into contact with must be handled so there is minimal risk
of harm to the animals and the public. This will ensure the safety of the animals and the public.

3.50(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The enclosure housing 10 rabbits had chicken wire attached to a wood fence for the primary fencing. In two
areas, the chicken wire was not securely fasten to the wood fence. The wire was bowing outward along the bottom.
One area, the wire was protruding outward into the enclosure and was accessible by the rabbits. This wire could
injure the rabbits from the protruding points or from getting tangled in the wire.
All rabbit enclosures must be maintained and kept structurally sound. This will prevent injury to the animals.
