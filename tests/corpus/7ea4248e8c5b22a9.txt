PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A nesting box used by two marmosets in the primary enclosure was made of raw wood which cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates including boxes, perches, shelves, swings,
houses, dens, etc. must be constructed in a manner that allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or
removed or replaced when worn or soiled. A system of maintaining contact surfaces which can be readily cleaned
and sanitized to ensure the health and well-being of the animals must be in place.
