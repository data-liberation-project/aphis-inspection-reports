2.31(c)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
No written documentation was available at the time of USDA inspection of the Rapid City site (site 005) on
08-31-2017, nor on follow-up inquiry with CSUSM on 09-01-2017 and 09-14-2017, to support that semi-annual
facility site visits to the Rapid City research site (site 005) had been conducted by members of the CSUSM IACUC
during the past 12 months.
Semi-annual IACUC site visits are an important means for identifying, reporting and correcting deficiencies which
may have a negative impact on the well-being of institutional research animals. It is the responsibility of the IACUC
to conduct these semi-annual site visits. Failure to conduct semi-annual IACUC site visits may additionally hinder
the ability of the institution to adequately assess and maintain its program of humane animal care and use.
The IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research
facility's animal facilities, including animal study areas, using Title 9 Chapter 1, Subchapter A - Animal Welfare, as a
basis for evaluation.
