The facility's current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available for review at the time of inspection. A
written and approved PVC is required to demonstrate to APHIS officials that a veterinarian is overseeing the
husbandry and care of the animals and that the program is being followed by the facility to ensure the health of the
animals. The licensee must ensure all records required to be kept by the facility are made available for review at
the time of inspection.
