ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:40 AM on
10/30/2014.
Arrived within the hours of operation listed on door of the facility, but I was not able to establish contact with the
licensee at the facility, at the residence or by phone. I remained at the facility for 30 minutes.
Please contact your inspector at (601) 966-4437 to confirm your normal business hours or hours when you are most
likely available for an unannounced inspection.
