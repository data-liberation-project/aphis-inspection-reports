ensure provision of an appropriate standard of care for the regulated animals. The program must be complete to
include all regulated species, regularly, reviewed, and updated as necessary by the attending veterinarian.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**The coyote Cheyenne was observed lying down in her enclosure and appeared unwilling to move. When she
arose and began to walk to her den, her gait was very slow, stiff, and unsteady. The Caretaker reported that she
had been running around when last observed up, but has been lying down in her den more often as the weather
turned colder. It is thought that Cheyenne is 18 years old.
Changes in gait and reduced mobility often indicate pain or discomfort in animals. This animal should be evaluated
soon by a veterinarian to determine an appropriate method to diagnose and treat her condition.
