2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
-The licensee has an attending veterinarian (AV) and no written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). The AV is
working on a written PVC and had a deadline by the IACUC of 31 May 2015. However, no PVC is written at the time
of the inspection 3 months post deadline. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian and develop a
complete and accurate written program of veterinary care that reflects the practices at this facility. The written
program of veterinary care will ensure that there is accurate communication between the applicant and the
attending veterinarian and ensure that all routine medications and vaccines provided to the animals by the applicant
are done with the direction and knowledge of the attending veterinarian.

2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
- Study and quarantine animals are not being attended over weekends or holidays. The facility policy defines
working days as weekdays only. Animals are provided food and water to last them through the weekend, but there
is no one
observing or checking them during this time. On the daily observation records the weekends were dated and
marked
NA. I asked the facility representative who NA was and he stated that no one came in on the weekends and the
technician would mark those days as NA and date the form. Each research facility shall have a person providing
daily
observation of all animals to access their health and well being. The observation may be done by a person other
than
the attending veterinarian as long as there is direct and frequent communication so timely and accurate information
on problems of animal health, behavior, and well being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.(cid:9)
