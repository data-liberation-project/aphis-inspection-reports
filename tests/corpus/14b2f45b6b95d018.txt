ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The carbon dioxide tank used for the euthanasia for small rodents has a pressure reducing regulator, but there is
currently no flow meter. The 2013 edition of the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals states that an
appropriate pressure regulator and flow meter or equivalent with demonstrated capability for generating the
recommended displacement rates for the size container being utilized is absolutely necessary for the humane
application of CO2. A flow meter needs to be added to the CO2 tank and pressure reducing regulator to ensure the
animals are appropriately euthanized following the AVMA Guidelines. Correct by providing a flow meter to the CO2
tank to monitor the rate of flow for euthanasia. Correct by July 5, 2016.
