RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection on February 27, 2014, records of animals births and deaths were not maintained for
the guinea pigs. The slips used for sales were not complete. The sale slips did not include the name and address of
the buyer. Records must be kept on animals for animal tracking, assessment of the animal care program, and to
comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that records on animal births, deaths are
kept and maintained. Sale records must include the complete name and address of the buyer to document changes
in ownership and to keep track of animal sold. APHIS 7020 forms were left with the licensee during this inspection
to help maintain records.
Correct form this day forward.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Heating. At the start of this inspection there was no heater present in the guinea pig room. Temperature in the room
was 48.8 degrees Fahrenheit without a heater present. The guinea pigs were huddled together in the corners of
their enclosures in order to stay warm. The owner brought in a propane tank with a gas burner on top during the
inspection. The temperature rose to 54.7 degrees Fahrenhiet with the heater on after 30 minutes.
A safe and reliable heater must be installed in the guinea pig room to prevent the ambient temperature from falling
below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Animals may become ill if the temperature is not closely monitored and kept betweem
60 - 85 degrees Fahrenheit. The licensee must ensure that the temperature is maintained at acceptable levels
regardless of changing conditions outside. The ambient temperature must not fall below 60 degrees Fahrenheit in
the guinea pig room to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
Correct from this day forward.3.31(a)(4)
SANITATION.
The licensee stated during the inspection that he has not disinfected the guinea pig enclosures since he remodeled
the enclosures and restocked animals in the fall. Lack of a sanitation program exposes the animals to potential
disease hazards such as bacteria, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once
every 2 weeks or as necessary with proper agents to sufficiently disinfect all surfaces that the guinea pigs may
come in contact. Sanitation of primary enclosures is necessary to minimize risk of disease to the animals housed
therein. Correct by ensuring a sanitation program is put into effect.
