A dark brown alpaca was not sheared this year. Its coat is very long and thick. The day was hot with a temperature
of 81 degrees and a humidity index of 49% at the time of inspection which was about 12:30 PM. The sun was
directly overhead on a cloudless day. This alpaca had no shade for its enclosure. The small shelter in the pen did
not provide enough shade for the alpaca to get out of the suns direct rays. This alpaca needs to be sheared. This
lack of basic alpaca husbandry is causing unnecessary discomfort to this animal and could lead to pain and even
death as temperatures are expected to reach the upper 80's for this area of the state. This alpaca needs to be
sheared. Get this alpaca sheared.

sunlight.

EMPLOYEES.
Lack of properly trained workers still remains an issue for the facility. The fact that basic husbandry for the alpaca
such as shearing was not done and that no one at the facility noted that the alpaca had no shade illustrates this
point. This facility has a long history of poor animal husbandry and failure to recognize animal health concerns in a
timely manner. The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of properly trained employees can result in facility
and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Most if not all of the facility issues could becorrected with an adequate number of properly trained workers. Animal numbers must be reduced or more properly
trained workers must be added.
An exit interview was conducted at the conclusion of the inspection with the facility CEO and APHIS personnel Kurt
Hammel and Carrie Bongard. The inspection report could not be completed and delivered at that time as the facility
CEO had to leave the facility immediately for personal business. APHIS expectations regarding the alpaca were
clearly conveyed to the facility CEO at that time, including the need for immediate shade. A formal exit interview
was conducted with the facility CEO and APHIS representative Kurt Hammel on 7-28-16.
