3.127(d)(4)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
* There was a 6 foot, chain-link, perimeter fence surrounding the entire circus including the tigers' primary
enclosures and their exercise enclosure. A drive-through gate in that fence was left open and unattended several
times during the inspection. The open gate was approximately 100 feet away from and in plain view of the tiger
transport trailer and enclosures. There was a fence immediately around the tiger transport enclosures, but it was
only 4 feet tall and was within arms reach of the enclosures. At one point, the gate was left wide open after the tiger
caretaker and much of the rest of the circus staff left the premises for a break. An unauthorized person could have
easily approached and made contact with the tigers at that time.
* Perimeter fence gates left open and unattended do not adequately prevent unauthorized personnel from coming in
contact with the animals and do not adequately function as secondary containment systems. This could result in
something harmful happening to the tigers or the public.

*** The licensee must ensure the tigers' primary enclosures are contained within a secure perimeter fence which is
at least 8 feet tall and 3 feet away from the enclosures OR provide appropriate alternative security measures.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: this non-compliant item was corrected prior to the end of the inspection.
The inspection was conducted on 22-23 July 2014 with a facility representative. A verbal exit interview was
conducted in person with a facility representative and via telephone with the licensee on 23 July 2014.
