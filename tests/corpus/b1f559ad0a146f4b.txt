3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The facilities overall cleanness is insufficient. There is dust, dirt, debris, hair and cobwebs on the inside of the building
structural supports, fixtures, walls and ceilings. The Facility representative stated that he washes these areas down with
water daily but does not clean and/or sanitize these areas as often as it should be done to prevent the build up. The odor
within the facility was strong enough to make the inspectors eyes and throat feel irritated and itchy. The insufficient
cleaning of the overall facility is directly contributing to the strong odor within the facility. All surfaces, to include walls
doors, ceilings, dividers and structural supports, of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to
satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. Sanitization may be done using any of the methods
provided in § 3.11(b)(3) for primary enclosures.
Correct By: Overall cleaning of areas listed above was completed and cobwebs were removed at the time of the exit
completed on 5/20/2021.
3.6(a)(2)(ii)

Primary enclosures.
During today's inspection there was one internal enclosure that had a hole at the bottom of the enclosure large enough for
the husky female contained therein to stick her head through. This hole was not large enough for the animal to easily
escape the enclosure but could easily allow the animal to get stuck or injured. All primary enclosures must be maintain

and constructed in good repair to protect the animal from injury and contain the animal securely.

3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
All of the wash downs in the puppy and adult area on today's inspection has a significant build up of mineral deposits,
feces, food waste, dirt and debris adhered to/built up on its surface. The Facility representative stated that he washes the
washdowns with water daily but does not clean and/or sanitize these areas as often as it should be done to prevent the
build up. The odor within the facility was strong enough to make the inspectors eyes and throat feel irritated and itchy.
The insufficient cleaning of the wash downs and under portions of enclosures are directly contributing to the strong odor
within the facility. The pans under primary enclosures with grill-type floors and the ground areas under raised runs with
mesh or slatted floors must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent accumulation of feces and food waste and to
reduce disease hazards pests, insects and odors.
Correct By: All wahdowns were cleaned and sanitized at the time of the exit on 5/20/2021.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
All enclosures containing dogs inside the "barn area" and outdoor sheltering structures during today's inspection had a
moderate to excessive accumulation of black/brown, food waste, mineral deposit, dirt and debris on the walls, enclosure
mesh, stepping blocks and doggy doors. In addition the suspended mesh flooring had an excessive accumulation of hair,
food waste, feces and debris hanging down from under the enclosure/between the mesh sots.
The Lixit system also had a significant build up a mineral deposits, dirt and debris on the areas where the dogs access for
drinking purposes. In addition most of the Lixit tubing inside and outside of the enclosure had an excessive accumulation
of fly spotting/feces, dirt, cobwebs and hair build up.

The Facility Representative confirmed that he had not properly cleaned or sanitized any of the adult areas within the last
two weeks. The improper cleaning is directly contributing to the strong odor within the facility and can easily aid in
attracting unwanted pests and insects. All used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more
often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
Correct By: All enclosures had been cleaned and sanitized by the time of exit completed on 5/20/2021.
3.11(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The three outside enclosures are mowed and maintained on a regular bases. However; the facility representative stated
that he does not weed eat around the fencing to deter the dogs from digging. During todays inspection, there were
several areas with overgrown grass and/or weeds around the outside perimeter of the enclosures. Overgrown grass and
weeds can be harboring and breeding locations for pests and insects. Weeds, grasses, and bushes must be controlled
so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control, and to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
Correct By: Facility representative was actively removing weeds at the time of the exit that was completed on 5/20/2021.
The remaining weeds in this area must be maintained by 5/26/2021

This inspection was completed on 5/19/2021 with the Primary Inspector and Facility Representative.
