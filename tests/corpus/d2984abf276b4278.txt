3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The program of veterinary care (PVC) does not have instructions for deworming adult dogs (how often, product, and how
much to give) and lacks a plan for blood and intestinal parasites testing. A plan for deworming and parasite testing is
important for adult dogs to ensure the overall health of the kennel. Ensure that the PVC has an adult deworming plan and
plan for blood and intestinal parasite testing.
