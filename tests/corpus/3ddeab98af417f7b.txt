3.1(c)(1)(ii) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
Four metal feeders, accessed by approximately 3 dogs and 5 puppies, have areas around the food cup that are damaged.
The broken metal at the corner of the feeders creates jagged and sharp edges and the inspector observed some of the
dogs coming into direct contact with these areas. Sharp points could cause injury to the animals.

Surfaces of housing facilities that come in contact with dogs must be free of jagged edges or sharp points. The licensee
must remove the damaged metal feeders or alter them in a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the dogs. The
licensee must ensure the housing facilities are safe for the animals and protect them from injury at all times.
3.13(b)(3) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
Eight French bulldog puppies have no written medical records documenting the vaccinations and deworming treatments
they have received. Written medical records are necessary for APHIS officials to determine that the animals are receiving
adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep medical records for dogs that include the names of all vaccines and treatments administered and the


dates of administration. The licensee must ensure that all vaccinations and deworming treatments provided to adult dogs
and puppies are documented in writing and available for APHIS inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
