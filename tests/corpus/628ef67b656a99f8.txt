ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The skin on the end of the black leopards tail is red and the hair is missing. The reddened skin and hair loss may be
an indication of an infection or allergies which can cause the animal to lick and further irritate the area. A facility
employee with veterinary training was aware of this condition last week, however the attending veterinarian had not
been notified the leopard has a medical issue. No treatment has been provided. It is important to notify the
veterinarian of issues so appropriate treatment plans can be developed and followed. The daily observation of
animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian but a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior,
and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
