HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Two young pot belly piglets were noted to be huddled and shivering in their enclosure, which contained no bedding
or heat source. Pigs this young are not able to thermoregulate adequately and require additional care to prevent
being chilled to maintain their health. When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being,
appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected
to any combination of temperature, humidity and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking
into consideration such factors as the animal's age, species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation. Towels
and a heat lamp were added during this inspection.
