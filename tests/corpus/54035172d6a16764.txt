track the movement of animals and to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee must maintain complete and
accurate records of all cats at all times at their facility. The licensee must make, keep, and maintain records or forms
which fully and correctly disclose the full and correct information required concerning each dog or cat purchased or
otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported,
euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. Correct by 3/8/23.

3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on the exterior fiberglass walls of an estimated 10
enclosures. An estimated twenty dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located on the exterior walls of sheltered
housing. The affected area covers approximately 20 to 25 percent of the wall area. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to
prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that
could lead to potential disease or health risks. Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly increase the risk of
disease hazards for the dogs. Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the animals. All surfaces of housing
facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
The licensee must ensure that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot cleaned daily and
sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (B) of this sub part to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards.
Correct by 2/10/23.
3.1(f)

Housing facilities, general.
* Fecal waste was observed accumulating in the rock ground floor in 12 outdoor enclosure housing 25 dogs. An
estimated 50 percent of the total floor area was covered with fecal waste. The licensee is placing turf carpeting in the
outside runs to collect the animal waste. When the turf carpeting is removed from the enclosure, fecal waste need to be
removed before carpeting is put back down. Fecal waste can attract pests and rodents, become a disease hazard or area
of contamination to the animal. Odors, insects, disease hazards, and pest infestation from fecal waste accumulations can
have an adverse effect on the health and well-being of the animals at this facility. The licensee must provide for the

regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food waste, bedding, debris, garbage, water, other
fluids and wastes, and dead animals, in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. Correct by 2/15/23.
