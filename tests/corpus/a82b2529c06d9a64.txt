3.53(a)(4) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Rabbit enclosures numbered 5-3, 8-2, 8-3, and 8-4 each still have holes in the corners of the wire floors. These
holes, which are approximately 2.5 inches to 3 inches across, have developed due to rust and urine, thus leaving
openings with protruding, sharp points. The openings, as well as the jagged, sharp edges, could cause injury to the
rabbits housed therein.
The damaged flooring, in these four enclosures, must be replaced and/or repaired to maintain structural strength
and to protect the rabbits' feet and legs from injury.
All enclosures floors should be assessed to determine if rust damage has begun.
The previously documented non-compliant item (section 3.56(a)(c)) has been corrected.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
