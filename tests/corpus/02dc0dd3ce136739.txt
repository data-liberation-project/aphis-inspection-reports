In the western most animal room of the newly occupied indoor building there are two double stack rows of raised
wire enclosures. The indoor housing room is a high moisture environment. The first two enclosures on the lower
western side of the room contain a total of four adult dogs. Above these enclosures is a hot electrical wire
connected to a light bulb fixture. The electrical wire and light fixture are attached to the underside of the wash down
for the upper enclosures. The wire and light fixture are not properly or safely installed. The electrical wire is hanging

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The kennel facility consists of one indoor housing building. The building is divided into three parts, two animal
housing rooms and a food storage room. In the animal rooms there are double stacked rows of enclosures along
two walls. There is a wash down structure between the upper and lower sets of raised wire enclosures. The wash
downs are higher on the northern end to enhance flow of waste to the southern end. At the southern end of the
wash down the waste washes over the side and onto the floor where a drain is located. On the western side of the
second (western) dog room the last lower enclosure contains two adult dogs. When the waste is washed over the
end of the wash down it can splash into the bottom enclosure onto the two adults. The dealer must repair or
replace the drainage system to prevent the animals from being contaminated from the waste material. Housing
facilities must be equipped with disposal facilities and drainage systems that are constructed and operated so that
animal waste and water are rapidly eliminated and animals stay dry, to protect the health and welfare of the animal,
and to prevent the spread of disease.
