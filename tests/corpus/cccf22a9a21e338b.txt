2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One of the 3 overweight domestic sheep housed in the sheep pen is limping when walking and slow to lay down. The
animal appears to be otherwise in good health. Daily observations have already been conducted for the day whereby the
lameness went unnoticed, and the attending veterinarian was not contacted. Signs of illness and/or discomfort that go
unnoticed can negatively impact an animals’ health and overall well-being. Observations of all animals must be conducted
daily to assess their health and well-being, in addition to a mechanism of direct and frequent communication being
required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to
the attending veterinarian.
