2.38(b)
MISCELLANEOUS.
On March 12, 2014 at 10:30am, the registrant failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal
welfare inspection. The research facility could not be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act,
regulations and standards to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. This is the FIRST ATTEMPTED
INSPECTION. A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct immediately.
