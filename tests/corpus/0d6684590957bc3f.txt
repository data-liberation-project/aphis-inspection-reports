Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The vaccines for the dogs are inappropriately stored. The temperature of the refrigerator containing the vaccines is 56
degrees F per the inspector's Kestrel. The licensee has only a small number of vaccines in the refrigerator, which are
required to be stored between 35-45 degrees F.

Failure to store vaccines at appropriate temperatures may interfere with their effectiveness resulting in an increased risk
of disease.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must store all vaccines at the required temperatures to ensure that all dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.
3.13(b)(1) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility representative presented an itemized bill from the veterinary clinic containing the medical information for
Cavalier #492, Cavalier #444, Pekingese #460, and Shih tzu #479. The official identification number for each dog was not
listed on the medical records. In addition to these dogs, several other adult dogs and puppies are listed on the bill, but
their official identification is missing also. Failure to provide information concerning the identity of the animal on medical

records does not allow APHIS officials to determine which dog the medical record belongs to and interferes in the
inspector's ability to determine if the animal has received adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer shall make and keep medical records for dogs that include the identity of the animal, including identifying
marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s breed, sex, and age. The licensee must ensure that all medical
records contain the identification of the dog in order to allow APHIS officials to determine if a specific dog has received
adequate veterinary care.
3.13(b)(2) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
At the previous inspection of the facility conducted by APHIS officials, five dogs were identified that required veterinary
care from a licensed veterinarian. The facility representative presented an itemized bill showing the medical treatments
for each dog. The itemized bill did not include the actual treatments applied to four of the five dogs. Instead the bill
stated:
Shih tzu - exam, overheated/not feeling well, indoor boarding
Pekingese - exam, matted/sore, indoor boarding
Cavalier 1 - exam, matted/sore, indoor boarding
Cavalier 2 - exam, matted/sore, indoor boarding
Failure to maintain medical records indicating the treatment received and/or a complete treatment plan does not allow
APHIS officials to ensure the animals have received adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer shall maintain medical records that include the problem identified, the date and description of the problem,
examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed. The licensee must

document in writing all required information for any dog with a medical concern in order for the inspectors to determine the
animal has received adequate veterinary care.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
