Handling of animals.
An employee of four years transported dogs under the influence and had an accident while making a run that was not
authorized by the company. The animals were not properly contained and there was no knowledge of them being
transported. During the accident one dog was untethered while in the front cabin of the vehicle, escaped and was lost for
5 days in the heat of the Florida Everglades. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as
possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary
discomfort. The vehicle was totaled but the animals were recovered and reunited with the owners. Since the incident the
employee has been released from the company. Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
