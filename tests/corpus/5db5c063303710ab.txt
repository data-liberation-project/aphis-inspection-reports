2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**At least 3 of the adult dogs at the facility were identified as having excessively long toe nails; female Westie MC#
0A02256059, male Westie MC#049301275, female MC#000013318362 . The adult female MC#000013318362 had
extremely long nails that curled to the side of her digits. Excessively long toenails can become entrapped and torn
or can result in abnormally positioned toes, which is painful. The licensee must establish an effective program of
toenail maintenance.
*** In addition to having excessively long toe nails the female, adult dog MC#000013318362 was holding her rear
leg up. She intermittently put the leg down but did not bear full weight or stand correctly on the leg. The condition
was identified by the inspectors and the dog was not receiving treatment. Lameness can be painful and maybe the
indication of a serious medical condition. The licensee shall have the dog seen by a licensed veterinarian to obtain a
written diagnosis and treatment plan, and should provide follow-up care as prescribed.
**Note: The licensee trimmed the toe nails of the 4 adult dogs identified in the previous inspection. The licensee
also provided health records for puppy with the identification # 15279 which was seen by the attending veterinarian.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
