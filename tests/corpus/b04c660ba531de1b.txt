2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility has incomplete records. Records don't fully disclose animals' disposition for deaths and euthanized
animals. The licensee stated that it was unknown that records of animal deaths/euthanized animals must be
recorded. The facility had recently euthanized some animals under recommendation from the veterinarian. Some
cages were marked and empty for euthanized animals however we could not completely ascertain the disposal of
three animals that were in need of treatment on the February-11-2016 report. The licensee reports that they were
euthanized. Without complete records, the facility may have problems tracking animal health and treatment
progress and APHIIS officials cannot accurately verify the disposition of the animals.
Correction: Maintain records complete from this day forward.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.

the Direct and Non-direct items cited under 2.40(b)(2). Animals needing veterinary treatment were seen by the
