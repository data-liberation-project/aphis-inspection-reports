2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The Facility is in the process of changing attending veterinarians. The new arrangements need to include a
written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor. In addition the
facility has acquired a new species (Fisher) that needs to be included on the PVC to assure the vet is aware of the
multiple species at the facility and their dietary and health care needs are being addressed.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** The facility could not locate the records of animals on hand which would have included information on animals
that have left the facility. These records are an important part of the recordkeeping process and need to be
maintained in a timely and accurate manner. This needs to be addressed to monitor movement of animals to and
from the facility.

3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The facility has had a squirrel and two foxes escape from their enclosures. One fox was re-acquired in a safe
trap but the other animal is still loose. The licensee is not sure whether the animals were intentionally let out or if the
foxes chewed out through a hold in the wire. Enclosures must be maintained in good repair and contain the animals
for their safety.

It should be noted that a new fox enclosure has been built and the one remaining fox will be moved as soon as the
ground thaws, in addition the hole has been patched. An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection.
