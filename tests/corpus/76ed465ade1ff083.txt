3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The premises does not have a perimeter fence that can exclude unauthorized people or animals from entering the
premises. There was a perimeter fence along one side of the property, but it did not surround the enclosure. The
squirrel is housed in an enclosure that has outside access via mesh fencing. Unauthorized people or animals could
have contact with the animals through this mesh, posing a risk of disease transmission, stress, or injury.
The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the
outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or
persons outside the perimeter fence. A variance may be requested in writing from the Administrator.
