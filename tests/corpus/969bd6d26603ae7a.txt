FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a ninety foot section of the retaining wall in the bison enclosure which is approximately six feet high made
of
horizontal wooden railroad ties. It appears that several of the vertical support posts in this location are no longer
able to safely hold back the wooden railroad ties and that the entire structure is leaning inwards. This section of the
bison outdoor enclosure is no longer structurally sound and could potentially injure the five bison housed inside of it.
This section of the retaining wall must be repaired or replaced to safely contain the bison and to protect their health
and well-being. To be corrected by: October 28, 2016.
There is a thirty foot section of six foot high chain link fence (exhibit gate entrance area) where there is a welded
wire
panel placed in a gap in the fence. It appears that several of the vertical metal support posts in this location may be
broken/compromised as there is a metal chain securing two of them together and the fence is leaning outward. This
section of the bison outdoor enclosure is no longer structurally sound and could potentially fail to contain the
animals.
This section of the chain link exhibit gate entrance must be repaired or replaced to safely contain the five bison and
to
protect their health and well-being. To be corrected by: October 28, 2016.
