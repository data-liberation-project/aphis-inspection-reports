Records: Carriers and intermediate handlers.
Copies of the health certificates for the dogs and cats that were transported were not being maintained. Copies of health
certificates are necessary to ensure that each dog or cat delivered for transportation was examined by a veterinarian
within 10 days and determined to be free of any infectious disease or physical abnormality that would endanger other
animals or public health. The registrant must keep and maintain copies of health certificates for each dog and cat that is
transported. To be corrected by December 8th, 2021.

Minimum age requirements.
On June 28th 2021, the registrant transported 50 cats from a shelter in South Carolina to an animal rescue in Canada. Of
those 50 cats, 5 were kittens approximately 5 weeks of age maintained in an enclosure with their dam. Transporting
kittens under 8 weeks of age that have an underdeveloped immune system and have not been properly weaned or
vaccinated increases the risk of health problems occurring during transport. Puppies and kittens must be at least 8 weeks
old and weaned prior to being transported in commerce. To be corrected by December 3rd, 2021.
3.15(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.


The enclosures used for the most recent transportation of dogs lacked “live animal” signage and directional arrows. The
lack of appropriate labels on crates used for animal transfer increases the risk of mishandling by transport personnel
therefore increasing the risk of injury to the animals. Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it
should be clearly marked on top and on one or more sides with the words ``LIVE ANIMALS", in letters at least 1 inch high,
and with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the primary enclosure. To be corrected by
December 16th 2021.
3.17(c)

Food and water requirements.
The enclosures used for the most recent transportation of dogs did not have food receptacles attached inside the crates
that can be filled without opening the door. Not having food receptacles that can be filled from outside increases the
chances of escape or harm occurring to the animals when opening the door to feed. Food and water receptacles must be
securely attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that the receptacles can be filled from outside the enclosure
without opening the door. To be corrected by December 16th, 2021.
3.18(a) Critical

Care in transit.
On June 28th 2021, a kitten died while in transport. The registrant was transporting 50 cats from a shelter in South
Carolina to an animal rescue in Canada. Of those 50 cats, 5 were kittens approximately 5 weeks of age maintained in an
enclosure with their dam. At the Canadian border, the Canada Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) veterinarian noticed that
one, a black kitten, was dead. The veterinarian also noticed that another, a grey kitten, had green discharge oozing from
both eyes with crusty eyelids which were sealed closed. The transporter did not identify the condition affecting the kittens
and therefore did not seek veterinary guidance in time to prevent death of the one and undue pain and distress to the
other. The registrant must ensure that the operator or person accompanying the operator determines during transport


whether any of the dogs or cats are in obvious physical distress and obtains any veterinary care at the closest available
veterinary facility. To be corrected by December 3rd 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
