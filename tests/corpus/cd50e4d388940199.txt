FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The small feline enclosure located on the back side of the exhibit area and the raccoon enclosure have wooden
floors that have rotted from extensive rains this summer. This flooring needs to be repaired or replaced.
The wire mesh fence for the deer has an area at the front side that has a gap roughly three inches wide. This area
needs to be addressed so that the enclosure fence is secure and the same strength throughout. Outdoor housing
facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.
