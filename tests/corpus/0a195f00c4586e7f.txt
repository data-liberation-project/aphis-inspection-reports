2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A written program of veterinary care was not available for review at the time of this inspection. A formal relationship
with a veterinarian is very important for the health and well being of the facility animals. The veterinarian should be
involved in all aspects of animal care including decisions on frequency of routine health visits to the facility by the
veterinarian, determining preventative health protocols for the animals, and consultations concerning problems with
the animals' health, behavior, husbandry and diet. A document generated by the veterinarian outlining their plan to
accomplish the above functions needs to be available for review during USDA inspections.
