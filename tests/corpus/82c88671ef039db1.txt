PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
Upon inspection of the records from auction sales on June 6th & 7th, 2014 and October 3rd & 4th, 2014, it was
apparent that several animals were accepted for consignment from individuals without a valid USDA license. The
consignments for the June auction from two unlicensed individuals are: one female and two male white nosed
coatimundi tag numbers 058, 059 and 067, and a male skunk tag number 062. The consignments for the October
auction from three unlicensed individuals are: a breeding pair of kinkajous with tag number 210, a male rhesus
macaque tag number 234, and a male and female cotton top tamarin pair tag number 150. No official one time
exemption forms were included in the auction files. In order for APHIS Officials to track animal movement,
investigate disease outbreaks, and to prevent illegal movement the person consigning the regulated animals to the
auction sale must have a valid USDA License. The auction must not obtain an animal from any person who is
required to be licensed but who does not hold a current, valid, and unsuspended license.
Correct by December 31, 2014.
This is a focused inspection of the records from the June and October 2014 auctions conducted on December 4th,
2014.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative, an Animal Care VMO and Animal Care Inspector.
