A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:47 on September

voicemail when the phone was not answered. The inspector waited 30 minutes to see if contact would be made. After 30
minutes the inspector attempted another phone call. When there was no answer, another voicemail message was left
indicating the attempted inspection. Prior to departure, the inspector attached a leave behind flyer on the closed gate.
