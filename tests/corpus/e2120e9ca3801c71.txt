3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility perimeter fence throughout and surrounding the wolf enclosure is currently 6 feet in height. All outdoor
housing facilities for potentially dangerous animals including wolves must be surrounded by a perimeter fence at
least 8 feet in height. The required perimeter fence height is necessary to help ensure that unauthorized persons or
animals cannot access the facility and to effectively function as a secondary containment system in case of animal
escape. Fences less than 8 feet in height for potentially dangerous animals such as wolves must be approved in
writing by the Administrator.

The current facility perimeter fence surrounding the wolf enclosure must be repaired or replaced to achieve 8 feet in
height or approval must be obtained.
