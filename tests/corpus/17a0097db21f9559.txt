2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adult, male Yorkshire terrier with chip number 103 563 099 has a thick coating of brown material completely
covering his rear "(cid:28)cheek teeth"(cid:29) (premolars and molars) and partially coating his canine teeth. The first two (cid:28)"cheek
teeth"(cid:29) on the top left are loose to the touch. The gums above the upper left (cid:28)"cheek teeth"(cid:29) are recessed from the
surface of the teeth and there is a white creamy discharge along this area of the gum line. The gums are also
recessed away from the surface of the upper right back "(cid:28)cheek teeth(cid:29)." These are all signs consistent with dental
disease. Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth and mouth structures. Dental disease can
be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. The animal
listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian by close of business 28 May 2015 in order to ensure that
an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information,
including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the
inspector upon request.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are wire points protruding into enclosures from the wires used to secure the T-posts to the divider panel and
from broken wires of the divider panels on the outdoor elevated enclosures.
Also there are two places where lower sections of the divider panels on the outdoor portion of elevated enclosures
are missing. This is causing a gap between the divider panel and the flooring material.
Also two heat lamps in the large dog whelping building are in use where the heat lamp bulbs are not protected from
contact with the dogs in these enclosures.
Also there are holes dug in the dirt in at least three enclosures on the ground. This has resulted in holes in the
buried panels, holes along the primary enclosure fence, and holes along the side of a dog shelter.

Hot bulbs and wire points may cause injury to the dogs in these enclosures. Gaps between enclosures may not
securely contain the dogs. Holes dug in the dirt of the enclosures may cause injury to the dogs. All housing
facilities must be constructed in a manner that securely contains the dogs and protects them from injury.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is wet bedding, mud, standing water and dirt and debris in 24 outdoor dog shelters. Contaminated bedding
and wet conditions in dog shelters may make the dogs reluctant to use the shelters or may lead to an increase in
odors, pests and disease hazards. All shelters must be cleaned spot-cleaned on a daily basis and sanitized at least
every two weeks, and contaminated material must be replaced more frequently if necessary. Correct by 2 June
2015.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are five outdoor enclosures that have areas of either standing water or (cid:28)"sloppy"(cid:29) mud that is causing the dog
to become wet and soiled. Wet and soiled hair coats are uncomfortable and can lead to skin problems. The licensee
must ensure that housing facilities have adequate drainage that allow for water to be rapidly eliminated so that
animals stay dry. Standing puddles of water in animal enclosures must be drained or mopped so that animals stay
dry. To be corrected by 29 May 2015.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is one enclosure in the whelping building housing a female Yorkshire terrier and her puppies. One of the
puppies was seen walking off the pad provided onto the wire floor of the enclosure. The puppy'(cid:25)s feet were seen to
slip through the openings in the wire floor. Feet that slip through the openings in the floor of an enclosure can cause
injury. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures have floors that do not allow the dogs(cid:25) feet to pass through
openings in the floor. To be corrected by 28 May 2015.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
At least six of the small white feeders in the whelping/weaning building have chewed edges resulting in a roughened
surface. There is a build-up of material around the upper surface of these receptacles. The rough surface does not
allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces within the facility must be constructed in a manner that
allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 2 June 2015.
3.10
WATERING.There are six water receptacles in outdoor enclosures that are soiled with either a brown or green colored material
on the interior surface in contact with the water. Dirty water receptacles can contaminate the water and play a role in
disease transmission. In addition, dirty water receptacles can discourage dogs from drinking which can result in
dehydration. The licensee must keep all water receptacles clean and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11 (b). To
be corrected by 28 May 2015.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO.
