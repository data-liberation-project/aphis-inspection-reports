INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC approved protocols #2015-006 and #2016-007 each involving covered species does not adequately provide
a clear rationale for the justification of the numbers of animals requested. Neither protocol provides an explanation
as to how the requested numbers were derived. An inadequate rationale for animal numbers requested for use
could result in unnecessary use of animals.
The IACUC is responsible for ensuring that appropriate numbers of animals are used in each approved activity. In
order to perform this function the IACUC must know both how many animals are needed for an activity and why that
number of animals is needed. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that each activity involving animals
contains a clear and adequate rationale for the number of animals being used.

SANITATION.
Surgery suite#1: There was a moderate accumulation of dust on two computer monitors as well as on a rolling
equipment cart. The base of an IV fluid stand had a moderate buildup of rust near the wheels and additionally
contained a buildup of a whitish, mineralized debris. The surgery table had a Velcro-type strip adhered to it which
had a buildup of a brownish debris/matter. A Mayo stand tray next to the surgery table had a few areas with dried
blood or other organic material.
Surgery preparation room: A large, pad on top of a surgical prep table had an accumulation of clipped hair and
areas of dried blood or other organic material.
According to medical records and the staff, the last procedures occurred approximately one week ago. Animal
procedure areas and equipment should be kept clean, sanitized and maintained in good repair to reduce thepotential for contamination and to protect the health and well-being of the animals. A system must be in place that
adequately facilitates the prescribed husbandry practices.
