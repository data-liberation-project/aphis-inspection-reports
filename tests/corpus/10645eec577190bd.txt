FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The support wooden board for the wire mesh fencing in the front paddock for the goats has been split apart from the
goats head-butting it. This board needs to be replaced with something stronger to withstand the goats pushing and
head-butting on it. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the
animals involved.
