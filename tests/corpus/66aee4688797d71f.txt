ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
(b) Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include: (2) The
use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of
emergency, weekend, and holiday care;
Two Guinea Pigs and one rat had problems with their eyes. One baby Guinea Pig with black and tan markings had
white discharge coming from the left eye. The other Guinea Pig (hairless black and pink) had a white spot on its
right eye. An African Soft Fur Rat had problems with both of its eyes. The rat was constantly squinting with its left
eye and it appeared to be irritated. The right eye had some kind of reddish bulge coming out of the socket. It is
unclear if the bulge is the eye itself or some kind of growth coming out of the eye. Eye problems can indicate
underlying health issues, can be painful, or may spread to other animals. The licensee must ensure that these
animals are evaluated and treated per the attending veterinarian's instruction.
Another African Soft Fur Rat had an open abscess on its left rear leg. The licensee stated that the rat injured itself
over the summer, but it has only recently gotten worse. Abscesses can be painful and cause an infection that could
result in the animal(cid:25)s death. The licensee must ensure that this rat is evaluated and treated per the attending
veterinarian's instruction.
