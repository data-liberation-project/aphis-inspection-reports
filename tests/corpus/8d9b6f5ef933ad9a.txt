FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is mud and excess water pooling in several of the outdoor enclosures. Within the white tiger enclosure, there
is excessive mud and water around the fence line and surrounding the waterer. The wolf enclosure also has a large
accumulation of mud and pooling water near the entrance to their shelter. The enclosure housing bison and cattle
also has large pools of standing water and mud surrounding their water trough. Within the sheep and llama
enclosure, there is excessive mud and water pooling around the waterer. These animals cannot approach their
water receptacles or shelters without walking through water and mud. Excessive mud and standing water can lead
to hoof or foot health issues, create a reluctance to enter water or shelter areas, and can attract pests. The licensee
must provide a suitable method for the rapid elimination of excess water.
