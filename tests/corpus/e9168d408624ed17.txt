**The licensee is cleaning these dogs' eyes and applying artificial tears ointment but has not consulted with the attending

**Adult, male Akita with chip number OAO2262114 ("Dusty") has a stiff, uneven gait. The licensee moved this dog to an
indoor enclosure from his usual outdoor enclosure due to intolerance to the cold weather. The licensee stated that the dog
appeared to be painful and vocalized when the weather was cold. During the inspection, the dog appeared reluctant to
walk and the gait appeared to be abnormal while in the indoor enclosure. The attending veterinarian verified that he is
aware of this dog's body condition and coat/skin condition. However, the licensee observed that this dog was showing


signs of pain or possible orthopedic problems but has not communicated that to the attending veterinarian.

Failure to observe medical problems and/or communicate those problems to a veterinarian can result in prolonged pain or
even death. The facility representative must observe all animals daily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication with a veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of health, behavior, and
well-being are conveyed and so that the medical conditions of the animals can be evaluated by the veterinarian. To be
corrected by close of business on 16 April 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
