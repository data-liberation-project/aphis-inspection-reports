3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There are four outdoor primary enclosures that have a moderate amount of feces in the yard that has not been picked up
on a daily basis. The yards were cleaned three days ago and need to be increased to daily pick up. There is an enclosure
with seven puppies that has a large buildup of feces and urine in the holding pan beneath the cage that needs to be
cleaned more often than once a day. There is too much accumulation with the large number of puppies requiring daily
pick up to be increased to at least twice a day to prevent the accumulation of feces and urine.

The buildup of feces can be a possible source of disease and discomfort for the regulated animals if they can not get
away from it, and a source of vermin and flies.

Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily, and from under primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs.
