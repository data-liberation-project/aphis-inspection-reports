3.127(b) Direct

Facilities, outdoor.
4 sheep were kept outside in a snow covered pen and a small shelter which had standing water covering the floor where
the animals were fed. Animals kept outside must have adequate shelter including dry space for feeding and resting.
Inadequate shelter and lack of a dry area may contribute to stress, animal discomfort, inability to access uncontaminated
feed, and an inability to appropriately thermoregulate. The licensee must ensure all animals in the enclosure have access
to dry shelter.
