3.80(a)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the outdoor enclosure for the chimpanzees there was paint missing and peeling from metal grating that
comprises the walls of the outdoor enclosure, as well as paint peeling from the metal frames that hold the grating,
and frame the doorways in the outside enclosure. There is also evidence of some rust in these areas.
Whereas the facility has made great strides in addressing paint and surface maintenance all around the zoo, and
plans are underway to provide maintenance to this enclosure as well, at the time of inspection this outdoor portion
of the chimpanzee enclosure has yet to be addressed.
Surfaces inside the enclosures for non-human primates should be maintained so that they can be readily cleaned
and sanitized, and should be replaced or repaired when worn or soiled.
Non-human primates that are exposed to surfaces that cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected due to
deterioration, or that are exposed to debris from peeling paint or decomposing surfaces, could suffer ill effects to
their health and well-being. Surfaces should be maintained in good repair, free of debris, and such that they can be
adequately cleaned and disinfected.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Whereas the perimeter fence has been improved to achieve full compliance, at the time of inspection a portion had
been removed due to a construction project. This section of fencing, including an electric gate, will be moved. The
temporary fencing put up to fill this gap - approximately 50 feet of fencing - measures only six feet in height. The
fence should be at least eight feet in height, due to the presence of animals defined as dangerous animals, and it
should prevent animals from passing under or through the fence, as well as providing secondary containment in the
event of an animal escape from its primary enclosure.
The fence should be maintained in good repair so that it consistently meets the standards described here.
Temporary fencing should also meet the requirements. Failure to meet these standards could endanger the healthand well-being of the animals in the facility.
This inspection was conducted on 4/4/17 and 4/5/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
