3.75(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
A spider monkey enclosure had an elevated wooden platform on the back side which was unsealed and worn with cracks
and rough, ridges on the top surface. Also, the wooden ladder leading up to this platform was unsealed with exposed raw
wood surfaces.

The ring-tailed lemur enclosure had an elevated wooden platform in the southwest corner which was worn, unsealed and
had areas of surface staining with a whitish colored material which appeared to be dried bird droppings. Additionally, the
wooden ladder in this enclosure had several unsealed surface areas exposing raw wood.

Surfaces which cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized such as unsealed, raw wood are porous and can trap debris,
bacteria, or other harmful organisms. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities
that cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled.
