Handling of animals.
On February 4, 2022, a member of the public entered the facility through the front door and removed the bobcat. The
facility was closed at the time and no employees were on site. There were signs that read “Closed for Winter” posted at
the entrance ramp and front door. Access to the facility is normally prevented by a garage door but it was a new system
and reportedly malfunctioned leaving the door open. The man went past a sign that read “Please pay here to enter” and
through several access doors that were marked "Employee Only" and was able to remove the bobcat from the indoor
exhibit. He carried the bobcat to his vehicle and left the facility. When an employee arrived and discovered the bobcat
was missing, police were notified and the facility reported that he was charged with breaking and entering. The bobcat
was returned to the facility approximately 6 hours later. The facility had the bobcat examined by a veterinarian and the
animal was not injured.
Failure to have adequate barriers between the public and the animals during exhibition can result in injury to humans
and/or the animals.
During public exhibition, animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals


and the public.
