Primary enclosures.
A female pomeranian/chihuahua mix was seen jumping over and out of the enclosure during inspection. The facility
reports that this dog doesn't wander from the property but has learned to jump out at times. A dog that is not safely
contained could get injured. Ensure that the enclosures securely contain each dog.

adult dogs for parvo and distemper were due Nov 28, 2021 per records and the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) but
have not been completed. For the health of the dogs; a written plan for physical exams of all dogs is now required and
adult vaccines are required to be completed on time. Ensure that the written PVC is updated with required information
and that adult vaccines are completed as described in the PVC.
