2.32(a) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
The facility self-reported an accident to the USDA which occurred on 6 January 2017. An adult, male cat (“Tyson”
#BH0550FM) was placed in a temporary holding/transport device (consisting of 4x4 stacked enclosures) while the
open room he shared with multiple other cats was undergoing routine cleaning/sanitation. The cat, which was dark
gray, went unnoticed by the staff when the cats were placed back in the open room. The large, dark gray
holding/transport device was then sent to the enclosure wash. Upon completion of the cleaning cycle, the cat was
found deceased in the enclosure. The respective supervisor stated employees were instructed to inspect all
enclosures for pets before the enclosures are sanitized, however, there was no documentation identifying that this
specific training for cleaning enclosures was provided. The facility has well-documented protocols to ensure
employees and contractors are qualified and properly trained to perform their duties. The facility acted promptly and
appropriately to address this accident. They conducted an immediate investigation and implemented immediate
changes to their animal enclosure and room cleaning procedures, including adding the appropriate training
documentation. Additionally, the IACUC discussed the incident and as a result, certain Standard Operating
Procedures (SOP’s) were modified to ensure the accident could not be repeated. All employees involved with
cleaning/sanitizing pet rooms or enclosures have since received re-training on the new SOP’s and that training is
well-documented. This non-compliant item was already corrected by the facility.
The inspection was conducted 8-9 August 2017 and a thorough exit interview was conducted with facility personnel.
