2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Dachshund puppy (DOB 02/06/2016) has hair loss on her head, snout, ears, around her eyes, and on her
legs and feet. The skin in the hairless areas on her head, snout, eye area and ears has thickened and become
crusty and flaky. There is a buildup of a yellowish crusty material around the lower lid of the right eye and there are
strands of the yellowish material from the top eye lid attached to the bottom eye lid. The inside of both ears have
thick, dark colored material surrounding the ear opening. Both ears have a white/yellowish colored discharge
coming from them and the inside of the left ear is moderately reddened. The inspector noticed that the puppy
seemed lethargic and cried out when she was touched.
The licensee stated that she had taken this puppy to the vet at the end of March but a diagnosis of the puppy's
condition was not available at that time. The veterinarian had provided her with a bottle of Cephalexin to give to the
puppy orally twice a day for 30 days. The treatment began on April 9, 2016 and ended on May 9, 2016. The
licensee stated that the puppy's condition had not improved and the puppy has not been taken back to a
veterinarian to be re-evaluated. Abnormal skin conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.
Male Dachshund ("Sam", 497-115-1616, DOB 2009) has a thick brown/grey material encasing half of the surface of
the upper canine teeth and upper front teeth. The material is also encasing half the surface of the lower canine
teeth and the entire surface of the remaining cheek teeth. Strands of dark colored hair have been entrapped in the
material of the upper right canine tooth and the upper right front teeth. The gums have become slightly reddened.
This dog had been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for dental health in September 2015 and a treatment plan
was established to give the dog chew bones and chip the teeth by hand if necessary. The licensee stated that she
has been giving the dog a "Greenie" dental chew once a week since September. The dog's dental health has not
been reexamined by a veterinarian since September. Poor dental health can cause pain and discomfort to the dog
as well as lead to further health complications.
Female Chihuahua ("Sweet Pea", No ID) has a blue/whitish colored left eye. The right eye appears normal in color.
The licensee stated that she had recently acquired this dog and did not have any documentation concerning this
dog's eye. This dog's toenails are also overgrown and the toenails of the left hind foot have become so long that
they have curled underneath the foot. Abnormal eye conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Overgrown toenails can also cause pain and discomfort as well as affect the dog's normal gait.
All three dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis of their conditions and to establish
an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented and available to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
"Sweet Pea" must also have her toenails trimmed to an acceptable length and the licensee must ensure that all
dogs receive adequate toenail maintenance to ensure that their toenails do not become overgrown. The licensee
trimmed the dog's toenails at the time of the inspection.
Exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
