ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at
11:30-12:00pm on 17-DEC-18.
I tried to make contact at the facility. I left a message at the number on file and honked my horn in the driveway. I
waited in the driveway of the facility 30 minutes before leaving the premise.
