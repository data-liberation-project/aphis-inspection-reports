FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following structural items were present:
(1) The chain-link fence is bowed inwards along the ground in the kangaroo enclosure in two sections.
(2) The chain-link fence is bowed inwards and curled upwards along the ground on the front side by the walkway in
the Scottish highlander enclosure.
(3) There is a roll of chain-link fence on the ground near the deer shelter.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals. The chain-link fencing needs more support along the bottom to prevent the fence from bowing
inwards in the kangaroo and the Scottish highlander enclosures. The fence must be repaired to prevent possible
injury the animals. The roll of fencing in the deer enclosure must be removed to prevent possible injury to the
animals. Correct by September 18, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
