Sanitation.
Cleaning of Enclosures

Sheep Pens: New flooring and substrate are used in the pens per a protocol requirement. The floors and straw are damp
for an extended period following cleaning. There is no presence of a strong urine odor. The current husbandry practices
do not allow for the proper cleaning and drying of the pens in a short period of time. Alternative husbandry practices must
be implemented to ensure the sheep are not exposed to disease due to the damp conditions of the floor surface. Correct
by April 5, 2022.

NOTE: The facility discussed alternatives during the inspection and will seek PI and IACUC approval.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Institutional Official and the Research Director.
