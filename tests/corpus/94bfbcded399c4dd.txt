3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One outdoor enclosure housing sheep, goat, llama, and alpacas has a couple of items that need repair in order to
be structurally sound to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals:
1) The wire fencing is very loose and sags on two sides and is loose in spots on the other two sides. A portion of the
wire fencing is lying on top of the ground and may entrap an animal's feet if they step on it. The sagging portion
makes the fence too low in height and isn't sound/strong. One young llama came to the fence and laid the upper
half of his body over the fence while greeting us. The topline of this fence has some sharp points present where the
sagging wire fencing came under strain. The sharp points need to be repaired or removed.
2) The metal sheet forming the roof of a low shelter structure is damaged with a couple of corners bent downward
and one corner appears loose. Sharp edges are present at animal height and present an injury hazard.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. Correct by 4/24/15.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility no longer houses the muntjac but does still house the two cavy. The cavy were moved into a stall in a
three sided barn however the side of the barn facing the house is open and no perimeter or secondary fence exists
to prevent unwanted animals or people from entering or to help contain the cavy. The facility shall construct a
perimeter fence of at least 6 ft in height and 3 ft in distance from the primary enclosure along the open side of the
barn or shall request and obtain a variance from the Animal Care Regional Office.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
