2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male Yorkie named "Hank" (ID 7E10015509) had an excessive accumulation of tartar and calculus on the upper teeth.
There was no gum erosion or ulceration, and no loose teeth. Buildup of dental tartar is an early stage of dental disease,
which can lead to oral infections and ulceration, loose or lost teeth, difficulty chewing/eating, and possibly systemic
disease. "Hank" needs to be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and treated appropriately to prevent disease
progression.

Housing facilities, general.
Two sections of the washdown over the shar-pei outdoor runs is not in good repair. This is allowing contaminated fluids
to spill directly onto the outdoor portion of one enclosure housing two dogs. The front lip of the washdown is sagging, and
the connection with the vertical drain at the back of the washdown is loose. This allows contamination in two different
areas. The washdown needs to be secured and repaired to minimize the potential for contamination of the animals
below.
