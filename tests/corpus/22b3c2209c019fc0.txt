FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** In the first wolf enclosure, containing two arctic wolves, next to the water trough there was exposed wire fencing
that use to be buried. The wolves walk on this wire to access water. The licensee stated that when the trough water
over flows during watering the run off clears away the dirt exposing the wire fencing. The wolves could potentially
catch a paw or hang a toenail injuring themselves when walking across it. Also in the adjacent enclosure, containing
four arctic wolves, there was an area along the fence line where the water run off has exposed the buried wire
fencing. These wolves could injure themselves when running the fence line. The wire fencing needs to be covered
to prevent the wolves from injuring themselves. Correct by January 26, 2016
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
