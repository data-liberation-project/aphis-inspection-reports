NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.
The registrant has moved from the address listed with us approximately six months ago. At the time of the move,
she was informed by me that she needed to update her address with the regional office within ten days of the move.
Approximately three months ago, I left a message on her voicemail reminding her that she still needed to update
her address with the regional office. To date her address has not been updated with the regional office. Not
updating the address of her business with the regional office doesn't allow APHIS officials at the regional office
know where she is conducting her business activities. The registrant must notify the regional office within ten days
as to what her new address is. Correct by 6/29/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
Note: As of today, the registrant has not conducted any regulated activity, but she plans on starting to conduct
regulated activity by the end of the calendar year.
End of report.
