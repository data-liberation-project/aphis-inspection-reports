3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Excreta is not being removed as often as necessary to prevent a buildup from under the elevated whelping enclosures.
Under at least 2 indoor enclosures containing 2 adult dogs was a pool of urine and organic material. The inspector could
smell an obvious odor in the kennel. The facility representative states the kennel was last sanitized on 17-October-2022
and was going to clean the floors today. Standing pools of urine and organic material and odors may result in disease
hazards to the dogs.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily, and from under primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats contained
in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. The facility must remove excreta
from under primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an accumulation and reduce odors in the dog kennel.
To be corrected by: 4-November-2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
