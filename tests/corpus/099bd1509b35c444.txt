2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The previously cited female Boston terrier (MC # 85049) diagnosed with dry eye, was treated according to the
veterinarian’s instructions, but looked no better during this inspection; having heavy amounts of bilateral mucoid
material in both eyes, and was continually squinting and blinking. This dog was removed from the breeding colony
during this inspection.
An adult female Shih Tzu had a very watery right eye. Although her cornea appeared normal, the excessive
watering from the one eye needed to be recognized as not normal and needed to be addressed with extra grooming
or other means to prevent it.
A white adult female Bulldog (MC #456114) having puppies in the whelping building was slightly squinting and had
bilateral crusts on the lower eyelids. There was a pronounced white opacity in the right eye, suggestive of an injury.
One caretaker stated the veterinarian was consulted, but the dog is not currently under any treatment.
The male Boston Terrier in pen 30 has a healing eye lesion on the upper half of his left eye. Blood vessels are
growing into the white tissue on his cornea. The caretaker states no issues had been observed with this animal
until the inspectors pointed him out.
Although veterinary care issues are being addressed and observed more since the last inspection, dogs with eye
issues are still being missed or not adequately addressed. All animals need to be observed on a daily basis and any
veterinary care issues appropriately addressed to prevent diseases or injuries from progressing. Daily
observations of animals by someone other than the attending veterinarian requires direct and frequent
communication in a manner so that timely and accurate information of the animal’s health and well-being is
conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected from this day forward.
3.2(b)INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Upon entering air conditioned whelping building number 4, a very strong ammonia odor was detected. When the
doors were opened, the odor dissipated over several minutes. The catch tray under the elevated wire dog pens is
cleaned daily, but something in the room is accumulating urine odors and causing increased ammonia odors in the
room. Chronic ammonia build up can cause health problems in the dogs. The source of the odor needs to be
determined and measures taken to prevent it from recurring.
To be corrected by 6/19/19.
3.6(a)(2)(x)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In whelping building number 4, the dogs are on raised wire floors. The entire leg of a puppy was observed to slip
through the wire in two different cages of two pups with their moms. One of these pens had a solid surface mat in it,
but the puppies were off the mat. The other pen did not have a mat in it; the caretaker stated because the mother
dog defecates on it. Flooring that allows the feet to pass through can cause serious injuries to the small puppies,
resulting in severe trauma. Floors should be constructed in a manner that protects the dogs’ feet and legs from
injury, and prevents the feet from passing through the openings in the floor.
To be corrected by 6/7/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner and caretakers.
