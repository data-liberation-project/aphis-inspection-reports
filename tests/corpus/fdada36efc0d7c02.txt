2.27(a)

Notification of change of operation.
Attempted to conduct an inspection. The calling system at the apartment complex stated that the contact number was no
longer in service indicating that the registrant was no longer located at this address. There is no indication in our database
that the Deputy Administrator was notified of the change in operation. Failure to notify the Deputy Administrator of
changes in operations does not allow for APHIS Officials to conduct inspections for compliance with the Animal Welfare
Act. Notify the Deputy Administrator of the current business address. Correct by: 9 July 2021

A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:25 PM. Dialed the
