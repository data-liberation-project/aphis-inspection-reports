Facilities, general.
Inside My Big Backyard the outdoor enclosure housing 3 rabbits has a hole along the left front corner. The corner has a
pile of rocks where the ground underneath has eroded away leaving a hole. This area poses a risk of injury to the animals
and is not structurally sound. Outdoor facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury.
This was corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Vice President of Animal Care.
