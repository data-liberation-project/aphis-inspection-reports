CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
Review of this transporter's records revealed that on multiple occasions the transporter has accepted dogs for
transport to without having the correct information for consignee's name, address and phone number. For example,
on 5/22/2017 the transporter accepted ten puppies for transport that had incorrect consignee information on the
waybill and health certificate. The waybills and health certificates indicated various delivery locations in multiple
states for the puppies to be delivered to. However, all ten puppies were suppose to be delivered to an individual in
Rhode Island. The Carriers and intermediate handlers must not accept a dog or cat for transport in commerce
unless they are provided with the name, address, and telephone number of the consignee.
*To be corrected by 6/21/2017.
3.14(e)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At time of inspection there were four large breed dogs in enclosure #21 of the Northeast transport truck that did not
have adequate floor space. The four puppies did not have space to turn about normally while standing, to stand and
sit erect or lie in a natural position.The black puppy, located in the very back of the enclosure, only had space to sit
erect and was not able to lie in a normal position without obstruction of another dog. Adequate space is necessary
for normal postural movement and to allow access to water and food receptacles. Licensee shall ensure that
enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats must be large enough to ensure that each animal contained in the
primary enclosure has enough space to turn about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a
natural position.
*Licensee relocated two of the puppies upon request during the inspection.
*To be corrected by 6/21/2017.
