HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the dog rooms, and the hallway where they are turned out for exercise, there are many areas where the
epoxy/paint is missing from the floor, revealing different layers of epoxy/paint, and/or exposed concrete. In the
enclosures where the dogs are on the floor, there is a baseboard-like lip of a metal material that separates the floor
and wall, and the epoxy/paint on its surface is in the process of coming off in nearly all rooms, and there is
discoloration and evidence of deterioration. One door jam shows discoloration and rust, as does a metal support in
the hallway.
Surfaces in animal areas that have missing and peeling epoxy/paint, deterioration, and corrosion cannot be
adequately cleaned and disinfected. Poor sanitation could be detrimental to the health of the animals. All surfaces
should be maintained in good repair on a regular basis.
To be corrected by 8/15/15.

Food for Non-Human Primates was not stored appropriately. In a food storage area there was a bag of spaghetti
that was open, with noodles protruding from the bag. There was a jar of peanut butter that had been opened in
January, 2014, had passed its (cid:19)"best-used-by" date, was not refrigerated, and appeared to be still in use. There was
a box of miscellaneous items, such as rusty chain links, blood collection supplies, a rag, an ear tag, and old
padlocks, stored in an open plastic bin on the same shelf with the food.
Food for Non-Human Primates should be stored in a manner that protects it from contamination, vermin infestation,
and spoilage. Failure to appropriately store food could be detrimental to the health of the animals.
To be corrected from this time forward. An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
