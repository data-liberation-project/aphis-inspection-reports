SANITATION.
***Goat Pen: The hay cover has several holes. The holes will allow rain to pass through. Excessive moisture of the
hay could lead to mold and reduce the nutritive value of the hay. The hay cover must be repaired or replaced to
adequately protect the hay from excessive exposure to moisture and to ensure the hay the goats receive is
wholesome.
The exit briefing was conducted with the manager.
