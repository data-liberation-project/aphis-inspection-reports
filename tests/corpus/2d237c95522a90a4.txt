3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The wooden shelter box for the Ring tail lemurs has not been cleaned and sealed and the wood in the back
sheltered building for the Macaque has also not been sealed. These enclosures cannot be adequately cleaned and
sanitized on a routine basis. These areas of wood need to be sealed to facilitate husbandry cleaning for the species.
3.84(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The macaque indoor area has feces that are not being removed daily. Per this regulation and for the health of the
animals, feces need to be removed daily to reduce disease hazards and odors.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The coyote pen has exposed chainlink wire on the bottom of the enclosure. Exposed wire can entrap a paw and
cause injury to the animal. Housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
Ensure that the floor wire is adequately covered to protect the animal(cid:25)'s feet and limbs.
*** The cougar enclosure has a wood sheltered box that is constructed of plywood. The box is not lined inside with
any material to add structural strength to the sheltered area. This needs to be addressed to assure containment for
the species.
*** A large section of fencing securing the primary enclosure of the watusi and bison is damaged or missing. This
allows the enclosed watusi to fully extend his head, horns, and shoulders out of his primary enclosure and have
physical contact with staff and the viewing public. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound andmaintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Although progress has been made in organizing the freezer storing meat for the big cats and exotics at the facility, it
needs to be addressed further. There are boxes and bags of unidentified meat in the freezer. There are no dates on
most of the meat and no rotation schedule in use to assure food is used in a timely manner. The method of food
being stored in this freezer has improved but is not yet considered professionally acceptable to assure the food is
protected from deterioration and contamination.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosures housing the raccoons, hyena, lions, pigs (3 areas), foxes, bear and tigers are mostly dry today,
since it has been hot with no rain recently. However, only the white tiger's enclosure has had any drainage
improvements made. A small amount of gravel has been placed into the deepest areas. Gravel is in the pick up
truck on premises ready for future use. Standing water and mud that does not dissipate rapidly can lead to hoof
and foot problems and other health concerns for the animals that cannot get or stay dry. Additionally, being wet for
extended periods of time may be distressing to the animals and impact their well being. The facility needs to take
immediate action to facilitate drainage in these enclosures for the health of the animals.
Note: 2.40 (b) 2 citation from May 04, 2016, inspection has been corrected. The alpaca has been sheared and a
shearing plan is being implemented.
