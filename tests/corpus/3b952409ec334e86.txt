2.40(b)(4) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility is utilizing a method of euthanasia for guinea pigs that is not included in the Program of Veterinary Care.
The Program of Veterinary Care specifies that euthanasia is to be performed by the veterinarian using
pentobarbital. However, the facility is performing its own euthanasia by blunt force trauma. This method does not
meet the guidelines of the Animal Welfare Act which requires euthanasia to be performed by a method that
produces rapid unconsciousness and subsequent death without evidence of pain or distress, or a method that
utilizes anesthesia produced by an agent that causes painless loss of consciousness and subsequent death. The
licensee reported 2 guinea pigs were euthanized this way approximately one month ago. The attending veterinarian
was contacted regarding the euthanasia method and did not approve this method being used without prior
discussion and proper training.
Failure to utilize a method of euthanasia consistent with the attending veterinarian’s guidance and according to the
requirements of the Animal Welfare Act is likely to result in unnecessary pain and suffering to the animals.
The facility must utilize a method of euthanasia approved by their attending veterinarian and that complies with the
requirements of the Animal Welfare Act.

2.75(b)(1)(iv)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility’s disposition records are incomplete. The sales slips do not include the address of the dealer or person
to whom the guinea pigs are being sold.
Failure to maintain sales records that include addresses of the buyer can make it difficult to track animals for trace
back and trace forward and to document changes in ownership.
The facility must maintain sales records that include the address of the buyer.

2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility’s inventory of guinea pigs only includes adults and totaled 60. A total of 105 adult guinea pigs,weanlings, and newborns were counted during this inspection. The facility’s inventory of rabbits only includes adults
and totaled 30. A total of 64 adults and young rabbits were counted during this inspection. The facility is not
including weanlings or newborn guinea pigs or young rabbits in their inventory as required. In addition, the facility is
not recording the number of dead animals.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses
by deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure
their humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose
the number of animals held, owned, and acquired including any offspring born and for animals euthanized or
otherwise disposed of including animal deaths.

SANITATION.
Approximately half of the rabbit enclosures including the majority of those with wire flooring have accumulations of
excess fecal material, hair, and discarded food throughout the enclosure and in the pans underneath the enclosures
and are in need of more frequent cleaning. Many enclosures have a wooden resting area that contains an
accumulation of large amounts of fecal material. The licensee reported the enclosures were last cleaned
approximately 5 days ago.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the
enclosure, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of fecal material, hair, and other debris.

3.56(c)
SANITATION.
There was a buildup of dirt, grime, and debris on the wall behind the food storage bins and 3 rabbit enclosures. The
licensee reported the walls were not being cleaned on a routine basis.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dirt and debris may attract pests into the room, result in unpleasant odors,
and may contribute to spread of disease.
The buildings used for housing animals must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices and maintain the health of the animals.
