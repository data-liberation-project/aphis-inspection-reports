enclosure had pointy loose ends of wire on the inside of the pen. The goats and sheep could also get access to the
barbed wire on the top of the fencing. There was another area of the fencing that buckled at the bottom of the
fencing giving potential for an animal to get their hooves entangled in it. All fencing for any animal should be
