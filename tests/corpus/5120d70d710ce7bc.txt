ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 4 month old female pug, #29, had a cloudy right eye with a 2-3mm divot. The veins in the white part of the eye
were swollen, engorged, and had a red appearance. There was also a 1/8 inch line of blood collected at the top of
the eye where the white part meets the colored part.
The lack of proper veterinary care can lead to chronic or irreversible conditions which can cause pain and
discomfort to the animal. The licensee is responsible for developing appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
The attending veterinarian was contacted and proper diagnosis and treatment was given by the end of this
inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
