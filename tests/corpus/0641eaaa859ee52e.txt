SANITATION.
Rabbit enclosure: In the right side, lower cage, there was a build up of hair and mixed excreta and urine waste in
one front, corner of this cage. Also, there was a dirty wooden board on the cage floor which was heavily stained
from excreta and urine waste.
Primary enclosures shall be kept reasonably free of excreta, hair, cobwebs and other debris by periodic cleaning.
The cleaning schedule for this enclosure is inadequate, as evidenced by the build up present. Additionally,
enclosures with raw wood that cannot be properly sanitized must be replaced as needed. A system of timely
cleaning and sanitation must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Pig enclosure: There was an approximate 12 inch X 7 inch gap/opening with protruding wires along a bottom
portion of the chain link fencing. Openings and loose, pointed wire ends of fencing may potentially cause the
animals to be injured or trapped. Also, openings of this size may potentially permit other animals entrance into this
enclosure.
Goat pen: A large, plywood platform on the ground in this pen was heavily worn with jagged, edges, at least two
protruding nail heads, and a broken piece of a board creating a sharp, pointed and protruding end. Sharp,
protruding points or edges in areas of contact with the animals may lead to injury.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, openings or other hazards in
order to protect the animals from injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility
repair and maintenance must be in place.Correct by 10/01/2016.
