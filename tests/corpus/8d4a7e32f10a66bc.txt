FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A pile of partially burned food items (within their casings/wrappings) was identified in close proximity to the food
storage/preparation trailer; large counts of flies and other insects were observed next to it. If garbage disposal is
going to be accomplished by burning, the facility must ensure that all burned debris and/or partially burned garbage
is properly disposed in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations to minimize insect/vermin infestation,
odors, and disease hazards. The pile of partially burned food items was observed must be picked up, items should
be disposed quickly, and the immediate grounds cleaned (after the removal of the burned pile of debris).

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shading for an enclosure with two adult tigers was missing. Also, for several other enclosures, partial shading was
identified due to damaged or malfunctioning shade cloths/structures. Appropriate and sufficient shade (natural or
artificial) from sunlight is needed and must be provided at all times for animals that are kept outdoors to prevent
them from overheating and discomfort. If the facility is to use shade cloths to provide shelter from sunlight, the
missing shading must be provided, and all damaged shade cloths must be repaired or replaced.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility's perimeter fence on the south side was observed to be damaged, and has a hole large enough for
people or animals to go through it. The perimeter fence must be constructed and maintained in good repair, so that
it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility, so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the facility. The large hole identified on the south side of the facility's perimeter fence must be repaired.To be completed by: July 19, 2018

SANITATION.
Excessive growth of vegetation was observed all around the grounds of the regulated facility, particularly in areas
between adjacent enclosures. Also, several areas on the grounds were observed with garbage (mostly plastic
bottles), construction supplies and debris. All affected areas at the facility grounds must be mowed, trimmed,
cleaned and maintained in order to minimize infestation by flies, insects, and other vermin and to facilitate all
necessary husbandry practices.
