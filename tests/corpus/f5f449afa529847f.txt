ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Bongo was lying down in a corner of the enclosure. When I approach him he stand and began walking away
with his right leg lifted in the air indicating there was a possible problem at the distal part of the limb. Upon
examination of the records it was found that the issue started in February 2016 and there has been an intermittent
treatment without a definitive diagnosis and without resolution of the issue.
Currently the animal is under an oral supplement of Hyaluronic which doesn't appear to be helping too much.
An appropriate method to diagnose and treat the condition causing the lameness shall be implemented since it has
been two month since the animal appeared to be lame.
To be corrected immediately.

There is a metal and wood table with discarded material at the entrance of the elephant barn. The table is in

barn to feed the elephant.
Discarded material shall be properly disposed off to avoid the reproduction of pest which may cause disease and
health issues to the animals.
