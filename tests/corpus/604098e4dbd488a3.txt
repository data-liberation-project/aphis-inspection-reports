ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current Program of Veterinary Care recommends twice annual visits by the attending veterinarian. The animals
at this facility range from middle age to geriatric and several of them are in poor body condition. The lack of
adequate veterinary care for the past several years and the ongoing health problems of at least one animal would
indicate the attending veterinarian needs to visit more frequently, at least initially until all animals have been
evaluated and diagnosed to be healthy.
Licensee stated that fecals and lab work on some of the animals at the facility other than Batman had been done
since the last inspection was conducted. No confirmation of this or records from either the licensee or attending
veterinarian have been provided as requested by the inspectors as of 9/26/14.
Licensee stated that other veterinarians with experience with all aspects of the exotic felid medicine had been
contacted to provide veterinary care and provide assistance to the attending veterinairan of record. As of 9/26/14 no
documentation such as a Plan of Veterinary Care, contract for services, or any verification of this arrangement has
been provided to APHIS OFFICALS as requested.
The licensee is responsible for ensuring the veterinarian provides the facility with an adequate Program of
Veterinary Care. This facility needs to retain an attending veterinarian or a consultant for the current attending
veterinarian that has experience with all aspects of exotic felid medicine.
2.40(a)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The diet outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care does not adequately address the nutrition needs of the resident
animals. The PVC states they feed approximately 2 to 3% of the animal(cid:25)s body weight then goes on to state lions,
tigers, cougars, and leopards are fed 8 to 15 lbs a day. There is a large difference in weight between healthy adult
lions and tigers and healthy adult cougars and leopards. Cougars and leopards fed 8 to 15 lbs. of meat a day arebeing fed well over 3% of their body weight. Animals receiving this much food should be in better body condition
than the tiger known as Sampson currently at the facility.
The thin body condition of a male tiger named (cid:28)Sampson(cid:29) are obvious indicators that sufficient quantity and/or
nutritive value appear to be lacking.
At the time of the inspection the amount of prepared diet which is now fed by the facility and being thawed for the
days feeding consisted of five 10lb. bags of food. This 50 lbs of prepared diet was to be the days ration for 4 Lions,
3 Tigers, 1 Leopard, 1 cougar, 3 Servals and 1 Bobcat.
The facility is not following the recommended feeding practices outlined in the facility Plan of Veterinary Care as
developed by both the facility and attending veteriarian. Deviations from this has to be with veterinarian approval
and must be appropriate to maintain the animals in good health and provide for all their nutritional needs.

(cid:28)Batman(cid:29), one of the male lions, continues to have a squinty eye with the third eyelid protruding across the right half
of the eye. The clinical notes from the exam performed by the current attending veterinarian on August 10, 2014
indicate she found no obvious abnormalities with the eye. Her recommendations were to monitor for (cid:28)erythema and
color to the discharge(cid:29). Licensee stated during this inspection that an ophthalmologist had been consulted and had
recommended antibiotics to be given to Batman. Licensee was asked what the expected outcome was to be and
what follow up evaluation or discussion was to take place between the facility, attending veterinarian and the
ophthalmologist following the antibiotic treatment, an answer was not provided. Licensee could not recall the name
of the ophthalmologist when asked by the inspectors. Documentation for this care and treatment was requested by
the inspectors and as of 9/26/14 none has been recieved. Guidance for this animal was given on the last inspection
and if it has been carried out documentation should be available to confirm treatment. It is evident by visual
observation that the porblem with the eye still persists and further evaluation and treatment is needed.
At time of inspection the lion known as Batman displayed no signs of ataxia. But the condition having been
previously identified by the attending veterinarians still has not been evaluated and diagnosed for possible causes
which can in some cases be treated. The licensee is responsible for ensuring appropriate methods are used to
adequately prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee needs to provide adequate
diagnostics and treatment for this lion'(cid:25)s eye and ataxia in order to alleviate the pain and suffering he has endured
for the past several months.

***** At time of inspection the following Documentation or supporting records were requested by APHIS OFFICALS

the attending veterianrian when asked to do so in an email from the licensee to the ATV has failed to do so. The
licensee cc'd the inspector on this email to provide his email address to the ATV should she not have it.
2. Documentation of any nature such as a plan of veterinary care, contract for services agreement, or other type of
agreement between all veterinarians and the facility to provide services for adequate veterinary care to the animals

TO BE CORRECTED BY: 6:00pm on the 9/29/14
3.129(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
Food fed to the animals should be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination. The food being thawed for
the days feeding was contained in a wheelbarrow filled with a static water source. The agreed upon method for
thawing in the facilites plan of veterinary care states that it will be carried out by cold running water.
Failure to follow the recommended thawing procedures allows for the water to become warm and possible
contamination of the food source which puts the animals health and well-being at risk when fed this mishandled
meat product.
Even though the USDA, APHIS thawing guide was witnessed at the April 2013 inspection the licensee still does not
abide by the recommended thawing guidelines. This guidance document is meant to provide information to the
licensee and veterinarian to be utilized to insure proper handling of the food products used at facilites such as this
one.
The licensee needs to develop a protocol for adequately thawing and preparing the meat to be feed to the animals
at this facility that will prevent possible contamination.
