2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of animals on hand was not available for review. Exhibitors must make, keep, and maintain records of
animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in possession or under his or her control, or
which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by the exhibitor. Failure to maintain these records can
make it difficult to keep track of animals, document changes in ownership, and identify animal losses by deaths or
decreased number of animals. The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which
fully and correctly disclose the number of animals, held, owned, acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.
