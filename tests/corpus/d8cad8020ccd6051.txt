***An adult, gray, female Japanese Chin-Poodle cross named (cid:24)Squirrely(cid:25) (no other identification present) was
huddled in the back corner of her enclosure. The dog appeared lethargic and did not move from her position when
the inspectors approached the enclosure. The licensee was asked to remove the dog from the enclosure and upon
visual inspection, the skin from the base of her head to the base of her tail appeared to be sloughing off. The
affected area was about one inch wide at her neck and widened at the shoulders and back to at least 4 inches wide.
The affected skin was black, thickened, and leathery. It had shrunken and was pulling away from the body. The
tissue beneath the affected skin was bright pink and moist in appearance. A yellow discharge was visible under the
affected skin. The licensee stated that the skin problem started about a week ago after he shaved the dog(cid:25)s hair.
The licensee had not taken this dog to a veterinarian for examination and treatment. Severe situations in which the
outer skin layer is sloughing away from the body exposing large areas of underlying tissue are painful and are
considered a medical emergency that requires proper veterinary treatment. The licensee was verbally told multiple
times that he must have this dog examined by a veterinarian today. The licensee must follow the treatment
recommended by the veterinarian and must provide inspectors with written medical documentation upon request.
***Two dogs had excessively matted hair. An adult female Cocker Spaniel named (cid:28)Sassy(cid:29) (no other identification)
had matted hair on the lower third of both of her ears. An adult female Shih Tzu named (cid:28)LuLu(cid:29) (no other
identification) had matted hair on her face around her eyes. The hair was heavily twisted and ropey to the point that
the skin was difficult to visualize in those areas. Excessive matting causes pain and discomfort to the animal. In
addition, matting can foster skin infections and can compromise the hair(cid:25)s ability to provide protection from the heat
or cold. The licensee must remove the matted hair from these animals and must establish an effective program of
haircoat maintenance.
***The licensee is using an unlabeled medication to treat an injured adult, gray, female Japanese Chin-Poodle cross
named (cid:24)Squirrely(cid:25). An unlabeled syringe was lying on a table in one of the buildings housing dogs. The licensee
stated that it contained an antibiotic that he was using to treat the dog. The licensee was also using a bottle of
medication containing a mixture of (cid:28)Keta, Morph, Xy(cid:29) that he bought from a veterinarian, which did not have an
expiration date. The label stated that it was for (cid:28)AKC Golden Retrievers(cid:29) at a dose of (cid:28)1 cc per 15#.(cid:29) The licensee
stated that he was using the medication to sedate his small breed dogs before shaving their hair. Medicationswithout labels or with incomplete labels can result in an animal receiving the incorrect medication, the incorrect
dose, or expired medication. The licensee must use medications only for animals that they are intended for. The
licensee must ensure that all medication containers are labeled with the following information: Name of the
medication; Dose (the amount to be given); and the Expiration Date.

***The licensee stated that he has been using a (cid:28)9 mm or succinylcholine(cid:29) to euthanize his dogs himself for many
years. The licensee could not produce a Program of Veterinary Care from his new Attending Veterinarian but his
previous Program of Veterinary Care states that the dogs are to be euthanized by a veterinarian using a
(cid:28)Euthanasia Solution.(cid:29) Gunshot and succinylcholine are not approved humane methods of euthanasia for dogs
according to the AVMA Guidelines on Euthanasia. Inappropriate methods of euthanasia can result in distress
and/or pain to the animal and can be a safety hazard. The licensee must follow his Attending Veterinarian(cid:25)s
instructions in the Program of Veterinary Care regarding euthanasia. TO BE CORRECTED MAY 12, 2015.
This is a focused inspection report of only the direct and critical non-compliant items found during the inspection.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, Konnie Plumlee-VMO, and a state trooper.
