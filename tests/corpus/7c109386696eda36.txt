3.103(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility does not have a perimeter fence sufficient to deter and prevent the entry of unauthorized people and
animals. Whereas the fence that encircles the majority of the facility has undergone extensive repairs and
improvement, there are still some places where the perimeter fence falls short of the requirements.
Specifically, the following were observed:
-(cid:9)Some sections of the white PVC fence has gaps underneath the fence of four to six inches.
- There were gaps under chain-link fencing and under/between gates that measured five to nine inches.
-(cid:9)There were several sections of fence-line that did not meet the six foot height requirement.
Inadequate fencing puts the animals at risk from unauthorized persons and animals which could enter the facility
and come into contact with the marine mammals, posing a risk of injury or disease. Steps should be taken to ensure
that the fencing meets the requirements under 3.103 (c). Fencing should be at least six feet in height in order to
deter trespassers, and the fence should be maintained so as to keep animals and unauthorized people from
passing under or through the fence.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the curator and attending veterinarian.
