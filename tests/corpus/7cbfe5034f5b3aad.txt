At the time of inspection a review of records for this facility showed they are using computerized records instead of the
required APHIS FORM 7005 Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on hand. At this point in time facility does not have
approval for the use of this computerized system .
If the facility wishes to continue to use a computerized system it needs to obtain approval for a variance and insure the
records meet the requirements as indicated by the APHIS FORM 7005 or use the form 7005.
