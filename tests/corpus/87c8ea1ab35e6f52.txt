2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are multiple puppy records with missing or incorrect ID numbers and missing the dates of sale. There are
several Disposition forms 7006, that are missing the ID numbers and description. While there are records being
made, there is an inconsistency with the ID numbers on the puppy records with those listed or not listed on the
disposition records.
Puppy records and Disposition records require proper ID numbers and dates of sale for the management, care and
traceability of the regulated animals.
The applicant must keep updated and accurate puppy records of all puppies born at the facility including their ID
numbers and dates of sale and complete information of all animals an information of buyers/transporters as
required on the 7006 disposition forms.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are six Newfies that are housed in an outdoor area that has only 2 dog houses and not other additional shade
or shelter. There is no other structure for the dogs to get under to provide shade or shelter from the weather. There
are only 2 dog house shelters for 6 dogs, that are growing in size, there needs to be an additional shelter provided.
It is important for there to be one or more areas of shade/shelter for all of the dogs to fit under in an outdoor facility,
besides the dog houses.
The licensee must provide an additional shade/shelter area that all of the dogs can fit under comfortably in order to
be protected from the sun or inclement weather. There must be enough dog houses large enough to be able tohouse all 6 dogs where they can lay down, stand up and turn around.
To be corrected by: December 22, 2016 for the shelter box
January 5, 2017 for the additional shade/shelter area
