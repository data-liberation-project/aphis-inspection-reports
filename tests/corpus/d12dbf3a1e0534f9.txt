ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 215pm on
31-Aug-17.
Upon arrival I was stopped at the gate, where I tried calling multiple times leaving a message on the answering
machine. I then tried honking the horn and calling out for the licensee, with negative results. I waited in the area for
45 minutes, and continued to call up to an hour later on my way back with no response, except an answering
machine. There has been no contact made by the licensee since my messages, which also asked for optimum
hours to try and conduct future inspections.
