3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The night enclosure of the lynxes and the night enclosure of the clouded leopards both had a light fixture with an
exposed light bulb that was not covered. The exposed light bulb poses a risk of injury to the animals if it breaks and
glass gets into the enclosure of these animals.
The primary fence in the mountain lion exhibit had gaps between the chain link fence reinforcement and the poles to
which they were attached. In one area the logs inside the enclosure were pressing up against the primary fence
causing a slight gap between the fence reinforcement and the poles to which they were attached. The primary fence
is there to enclose the animal and protect the public. If these gaps become larger, they pose a risk of the animal
getting out or entrapped and could be a safety issue for the public.
The primary fence in the goat exhibit had gaps between it and the ground. These gaps were large enough that a
goat's horns or head could get stuck underneath and therefore poses the risk of injury to animals in the enclosure.
A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to ensure all animal facilities are structurally
sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or escape.
