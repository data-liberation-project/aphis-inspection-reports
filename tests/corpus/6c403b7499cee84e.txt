FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The west pasture at RAIL held 1 llama and 2 alpaca. The run-in shelter had large holes in the interior wall of the
double-wall construction on the west (back) and north sides.
These holes are large enough to allow for a limb of an animal to become entrapped in the cavity between the walls.
There is also what appears to be rigid insulation in the cavity that does not appear to fill the entire cavity, which can
contribute to an entrapment, or could possibly be consumed by the animals.
Housing facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
This was corrected immediately, on the same day as the facility inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted on December 19-20, 2018 with facility personnel.
