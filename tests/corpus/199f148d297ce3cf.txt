3.6(c)(1)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two dogs housed in separate enclosures made of wire with 1 inch high spaces only had approximately 3 inches of
space between the top of their heads and the top of their enclosures. Dogs need adequate space to make normal
postural and behavioral movements. The licensee must ensure that the interior height of each primary enclosure is
at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position.
TO BE CORRECTED BY 1/10/18.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
