2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
*The zebu has hooves that are in need of trimming. They have grown so long that they appear 'sled' like in appearance.
*One brown goat with horns (ear tag 0014) is too thin. The goat’s backbone is visible with a continuous ridge. Some ribs
can be seen and there is only a small amount of fat cover. In addition, there appears to be muscle loss. The goat is active
and eating. The owner has documented that the attending veterinarian was notified in early May and the goat was treated
per their recommendations during the first part of May. The owner reports the goat appears to be feeling much better but
has only gained back a bit of weight.
Regular daily observations such as problems of health and behavior (hoof issues) or slow response to a treatment
protocol should be communicated to the attending veterinarian so that the veterinarian has accurate information. This
communication is vital to ensure that the veterinarian has the information they need to provide adequate veterinary
care/make recommendations for care.
The facility shall communicate with the attending veterinarian and provide the veterinarian with timely and accurate
information about the problems observed regarding the goat and the zebu so that appropriate veterinary care can be
provided. Correct by June 11, 2021.
2.126(a)(2)



Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
Not all of the records, such as acquisition/disposition record, program of veterinary care, environmental enhancement
plan, required to be kept by the Animal Welfare Act were able to be reviewed today due to lack of access to the computer
(no power cord) that holds the records. Some recent treatment records were available on a phone log/notebook. Review
of records is necessary to ensure compliance with the Act.
The facility shall have the required records available to be examined by APHIS officials during normal business hours.
Correct by 6/19/21.
3.75(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The indoor portion of the ringtail lemur building is currently being used for lemur housing and for storage. There are lots of
haphazardly stored materials on the floor and along the walls. Empty food bags/boxes, trash, dirty buckets, some plastic
bins, and fall decor items (all not necessary for animal husbandry) are some of the things in piles and stacks. A shelf held
numerous empty plastic bins with shavings. Food waste, dirt, and lots of cobwebs were noted on the floor, walls and
stored items. Cleaning and routine husbandry procedures cannot be easily accomplished around or behind these stored
items and pests can proliferate.
Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter including equipment, furniture or stored
materials that are not being used/necessary for cleaning and proper animal husbandry practices.
3.80(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The sheltered housing for the ringtail lemur is in need of repair. There is a round metal tube that connects the indoor to
the outdoor portion of the housing. This tube has been damaged and flattened from the bottom to the top in the center of
its length thus greatly restricting the diameter of the opening of tube (by at least 50%) leaving a very small opening for the


lemur to use to move from the indoor to the outdoor housing. The lemur was observed to be able to squeeze through the
opening. The condition of the interior of the tube should also be evaluated while repairs are made to ensure that there are
no sharp points or edges. The connecting tube needs to be structurally sound and in good repair to allow the lemur safe
access to both the indoor and outdoor housing areas.
The lemur enclosure including the connecting tube portion shall be structurally sound and kept in good repair. Correct by
6/19/21.
3.81(c)(4)

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The adult ringtail lemur is currently single housed. The lemur cannot see or hear nonhuman primates of his own or
compatible species. Ringtail lemurs exist in social groups in nature and have social needs that must be addressed to
provide for their psychological well-being. The lemur previously lived with another ringtail lemur. The enclosure and
enrichment provided appear identical to when two lived together. The licensee reports the written psychological
enrichment plan has not been updated to reflect the newly single housed status of the ringtail lemur.
The facility shall provide for special attention regarding enhancement of the environment to promote psychological well-
being for the single housed ringtail lemur in accordance with the instructions of their attending veterinarian. Correct by
6/20/21.
3.82(a)

Feeding.
The ringtail lemur is currently being fed what appears to be small round pelleted feed. The licensee reports that the
normal diet fed to the lemur by a family member consists of fruits, vegetables, turkey/meat, and all stock feed. The feed
on the floor and in the feed pails did not resemble any of those items. Ringtail lemurs need to be fed a diet of sufficient
nutritive value to meet their normal daily nutritional requirements according to generally accepted professional and


husbandry practices and nutritional standards. The current diet does not meet these standards.
The diet for the ringtail lemur must be appropriate for ringtail lemurs and must meet its daily nutritional requirements as
determined by generally accepted professional practices (can consult with your attending veterinarian, a veterinary
nutritionist or other professional guidance). Correct by 6/16/21.
3.82(d)

Feeding.
The indoor portion of the lemur enclosure contained three food receptacles at the time of the inspection. Two metal pails
were on the floor of the enclosure. One was empty/on its side and the other still contained several small round pellets of
dry feed along with dried feed debris/crumblings on the bottom and sides. Food receptacles located on the floor of the
enclosure are at risk of contamination by excreta and pests. The third is a piece of PVC pipe cut in half lengthwise and
mounted to the outside of the enclosure. It contained multiple traces of dried caked on peanut butter colored material.
Food receptacles must be kept clean and also sanitized at least once every two weeks and they must be located so as to
minimize any risk of contamination by excreta and pests. Correct by 6/10/21.
3.84(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The indoor portion of the lemur enclosure is in need of cleaning. There is a large amount of food debris scattered within
and immediately adjacent to the enclosure on the floor. Some of the dry food kibbles are deteriorating./crumbling/ground
into the floor. There is a greasy brown layer of grime present on all hard surfaces of the enclosure (bars, transfer tube,
perches, toys), on the white walls adjacent to two of the sides of the enclosure and on the floor. Daily cleaning of excreta
and food wastes is necessary to prevent excess accumulations, to prevent soiling of the non-human primate and to
reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
All excreta and food wastes must be removed daily from the indoor portion of the lemur enclosure.


3.84(c) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
*The outdoor portion of the ringtail lemur enclosure has been overtaken by thick green weeds, grasses and bush like
weeds. Some are over five feet tall. The ground is covered thickly with the weeds and cannot be visualized.
*There is an accumulation of days old fecal material (pigs) adjacent to one outside wall of the lemur building.
The weeds and grasses act as breeding/living areas for pests, rodents, and vermin and make it difficult to perform daily
husbandry practices such as cleaning. The fecal material will attract vermin/pests including flies.
The grounds surrounding the lemur building must be kept clean. Weeds, grasses and bushes must be controlled so as to
facilitate cleaning and pest control.
3.129(a)

Feeding.
The only dry feed stores on site were an all stock feed, a pelleted alfalfa and kangaroo diet. The feed bin for the pigs was
empty. The licensee states that feed for the pigs is delivered by another person on Thursdays. The feed receptacles were
empty Wednesday morning during the inspection and it is unknown when the feed will arrive on Thursday. All animals
must be fed at least once a day unless dictated by the attending veterinarian.
The facility should ensure that they have wholesome palatable feed present to be able to feed each animal at least once a
day to maintain the animals in good health. Correct by 6/10/21.
3.130

Watering.
The water receptacles for the coatimundi and the pigs were dirty. The water level in two of the pig's receptacles was quite
low and the water was visibly contaminated with mud. The third receptacle had clear water in it but multiple small clumps
of vegetative matter were floating on top. The water in the coatimundi receptacle is opaque with a silvery film on top.


Vegetative matter was seen floating on the surface. The dry parts of the receptacles were dusty/dirty too. The water
receptacles must be kept clean and filled with potable water to provide for the hydration needs of the animals.
All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary. Correct by 6/10/21.

The facility inspection was conducted with a facility representative. The exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
