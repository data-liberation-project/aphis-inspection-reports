CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A kennel containing a male black and white boxer, another holding two grey female Labrador retrievers and another
holding a grey female Labrador retriever and a female black and tan Australian Shepard showed a build up of hair
and excreta along the floor and old food in the drain. There was also a brown film on the door leading to the outside
part of the kennel and along the walls. The washdown pans which collect all the fecal material and urine under the
kennel showed a build up of both older and new excreta as well as increased insect activity. Upon speaking with the
licensee he had not had the opportunity to spot clean the kennel since Thursday and had sanitized the kennel
approximately three weeks ago.
The licensee must remove any food waste and excreta from the primary enclosures on a daily basis to prevent an
accumulation. Cleaning the enclosures on a daily basis reduces the chance of disease, pests and odors. The pans
under the primary enclosure must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent a build up. A build up on the
washdown pans increases the chance of pests, disease and odors.
Correct by cleaning the enclosures and the washdown pans by 8/9/2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee's wife.
