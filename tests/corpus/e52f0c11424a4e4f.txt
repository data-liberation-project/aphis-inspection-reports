2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female, tan and white Corgi ("Montana" DOB 1-04) with chip number 070 156 111 was lying quietly in the
enclosure and appeared reluctant to move. Her body condition is very thin with the vertebrae, spines of the
scapulae, and points of the hips easily palpated. The spine is visually protruding and the abdominal tuck is
excessive. There is thick, creamy discharge on the left side of her mouth and lips. There is a coating of dental
calculus on the canine tooth and the "cheek teeth" (premolars and molars) on the left upper side and the upper and
lower canine teeth of the right side. The gums of the canine teeth on the right side and the molars of the left side
have receded up from the surface of the teeth. Thin body condition can indicate underlying medical problems and
inadequate nutrition. Dental disease can be painful as it can cause damage to the gum tissue, teeth, and the bone
of the jaw supporting the teeth. Dental disease can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and affect the
overall health of the animal.
Female, cream colored Pekingese ("Blondie" DOB 12-09) with chip number OAO2223563 has thickened ear tissue
obscuring the opening of both ear canals. There is a mild amount of moist debris in the left ear. The licensee has
documentation showing that this dog was last evaluated by the attending veterinarian on 2-20-2017. The directions
for care given at that time state: "Keratoconjunctivitis sicca - artificial tears 4 times daily. Otitis externa - needs
surgical ear canal ablation. Gentacin ear mix will be palliative." The licensee reports they have not pursued surgery
for this dog and are cleaning the ears with hydrogen peroxide. They are not currently using the Gentacin ear mix as
directed. They are also using the artifical tears in the dog's eye twice a day instead of the 4 times as directed.
Failure to follow the directions for medical care from the attending veterinarian can result in unresolved medical
problems and prolonged illness. The licensee must follow the directions for medical care provided by the
veterinarian.

Adult, male red Shih Tzu ("Red" DOB 5-06) was observed to have a wet chin and lips. The dog resisted having his
mouth examined and pulled his head away quickly. Inspectors were able to see a thick coating of dental tartar on
the few remaining "cheek teeth". Inspectors were unable to get a complete view of the dental condition of this dog
but these signs suggest that dental disease and mouth pain are likely problems and should be evaluated by the
veterinarian. Dental disease can be painful as it can cause damage to the gum tissue, teeth, and the bone of the
jaw supporting the teeth. Dental disease can also impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and affect the overallhealth of the animal.
The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
Adult, female fawn pug ("Roxie" DOB 8-03) with chip number 062 578 296 has overgrown toe nails on her front feet.
Long toenails can result in gait problems and can be painful. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the
licensee must develop and follow a program of toenail maintenance to ensure that animals' toenails are not too
long.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the inside of three dog doors are two screws each, protruding a few inches at dog eye level. These screws had
been in place on which to hang food receptacles, but these receptacles are no longer being located there. Dogs
could get injured on these exposed screws. All housing facilities must be kept in good repair to protect animals from
injury. Correct by 12 Sept. 2017.
3.1(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a bucket without a lid containing food that is being stored in the food storage shed. This food was covered
by a tarp but was not being stored in a leak-proof container with a tightly fitting lid. Open containers of food will
attract pests and can lead to the contamination of the food. The licensee must ensure that all open supplies of food
and bedding must be kept in leak-proof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.
3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Some of the wooden fence posts have been chewed resulting in jagged, raw wood surfaces. In one enclosure, a
large portion of the wooden fence post was on the ground as it had fallen off the post, leaving a dry jagged surface.
Surfaces that are not sealed cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Building surfaces in contact with animals in
outdoor housing facilities must be impervious to moisture. Correct by 6 October 2017
Two of the dogs cited on the inspection report dated 16 Feb 2017 were evaluated by the attending veterinarian.
These dogs are male Shih Tzu ("Buddy" DOB 1-07) with chip 107 292 875 and female Shih Tzu ("Jessie" DOB1-05) with chip number 074 889 629.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
