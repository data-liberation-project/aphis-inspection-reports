2.40(a)(1) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A written program of veterinary care was not available for review at the time of inspection, therefore employment of
an attending veterinarian with a formal arrangement could not be verified. The inspector spoke with the veterinarian
the licensee referred to as his consultant, who could not say with certainty that he was currently employed under
formal arrangements by this licensee. The veterinarian explained that he only once toured the facility in 2014 and
later had sporadic conversations with the licensee about diseases, drugs and dosages. Per the veterinarian, it has
now been 1.5 years since he had any contact with the licensee, consequently he has not since been consulted
regarding sick animals, and has not recently prescribed or dispensed drugs to this licensee. During the inspection,
15 animals were identified as needing veterinary care and some were direct veterinary care issues.
A formal arrangement with a veterinarian and a written program of veterinary care are needed to establish an
adequate standard of veterinary care for the animals on hand.
The licensee shall employ under formal arrangements a veterinarian knowledgeable about rabbit health. Such
arrangement shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.

2.40(a)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The attending veterinarian has not been assured appropriate authority to ensure provision of adequate veterinary
care:
- A two month old white, black and tan rabbit was observed in poor body condition with an unkempt hair coat. The
licensee explained that the rabbit will be euthanized by decapitation with a lopper. The licensee stated that this is
his normal method of euthanasia for young rabbits and had not spoken to his veterinarian about it. The inspector
spoke to the veterinarian who explained that he did not discuss euthanasia with the licensee and he was not aware
of the method used.
- Multiple other cases of animals with medical conditions that demonstrate the lack of veterinarian’s authority are
described in 2.40(b)(2), below.
When the veterinarian is not given the appropriate authority, the provision of veterinary care may be inadequate orinappropriate. The licensee must assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the
provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. To be
corrected by October 14, 2019.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the facility, there were a number of animals the licensee identified as having a medical condition that had not
been evaluated by a veterinarian:
-(cid:9)One black and white rabbit had a 90 degree head tilt, referred to as wry neck by the licensee that was creating an
abnormal posture and gait. Three more rabbits were observed with the same condition. These rabbits were not
given medications. If their condition worsened, the licensee stated that the rabbit will be euthanized. The licensee
explained that he tried treatment in the past on other animals with the same condition, per the veterinarian’s
recommendation, but that did not work. When the inspector spoke with the veterinarian, he explained that he had
recommended treatment with fenbendazole, dexamethasone and vitamins. The veterinarian was not aware that the
licensee was no longer using this treatment and was not consulted on the new method of care.
-(cid:9)One grey rabbit was identified at the time of inspection with an excessive accumulation of thick brown crusty
material in the right ear that was being held low. The licensee referred to the condition as being caused by ear
mites. Two more rabbits were observed with the same condition. The licensee treated these rabbits with pour-on
ivermectin during the inspection. The veterinarian did not advise the licensee on this method of treatment and was
not aware that the facility’s rabbits were affected with this condition.
-(cid:9)Several rabbits were heard sneezing throughout the facility. The licensee explained that he has given treatment in
the past for respiratory disease per the veterinarian’s recommendation but found that many affected and treated
died. At this time, the licensee did not communicate this respiratory incident with the veterinarian, was not treating,
and was contemplating forgoing treatment.
-(cid:9)The licensee is supplementing his water with hydrogen peroxide as a preventative measure that was not approved
by the veterinarian.
The licensee has not sought veterinary care for these animals and is not currently treating or preventing medical
conditions per a veterinarian’s instruction. This could lead to inappropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose
and treat diseases that can be detrimental to animal’s health and well-being.
In cooperation with his attending veterinarian, the licensee must develop an adequate program of veterinary care
that includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Daily observations to assess animals’ health and well-being are not being performed adequately. Additionally, theredoes not appear to be a mechanism in place for direct and frequent communication with the veterinarian. During the
inspection, the following animals were identified in need of veterinary care, of which the licensee was not aware and
was not treating:
-(cid:9)One black and white rabbit had a 90 degree head tilt towards the right resulting in abnormal posture and gait. A
sticky yellowish opaque liquid was seen oozing out of his right eye. The skin around the eye was red and appeared
irritated and inflamed.
-(cid:9)A white rabbit, huddled up in a corner, appearing lethargic, had a large amount of thick sticky yellowish opaque
liquid oozing out of a mostly shut left eye. A significant amount of yellowish crusty material was attached to the top
and bottom eyelid. The skin around the left eye was red and appeared irritated and inflamed.
-(cid:9)Another white rabbit had thick sticky yellowish opaque liquid oozing out of a mostly shut left eye. The skin around
the eye was red and appeared irritated and inflamed.
-(cid:9)One white and tan rabbit, that was heard sneezing, had white opaque mucoid nasal discharge covering his right
nostril.
-(cid:9)One tan rabbit had dried white mucoid discharge and hair mats around his nostrils
-(cid:9)One grey rabbit had an excessive accumulation of thick brown crusty material in the right ear that was being held
low.
-(cid:9)A tan rabbit was found dead in his enclosure with fecal staining around his anus and the back of his hind limbs.
In addition to the rabbits listed above, two more rabbits were seen with a moderate amount of dried brown opaque
discharge staining the area about the nostrils and two more had an excessive accumulation of thick brown crusty
material in an ear that was being held low.
The conditions affecting these rabbits were not identified by the licensee, therefore the veterinarian had not been
contacted and care had not yet been provided. Failure to promptly identify diseases and injuries delays treatment
and causes undue pain and distress in animals with conditions such as these listed here.
A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented in order to assess their health and
well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for timely diagnosis and
adequate medical attention. The currently affected animals need to be seen by a veterinarian for an appropriate
diagnosis and treatment plan.
