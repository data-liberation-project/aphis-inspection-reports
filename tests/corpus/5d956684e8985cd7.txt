In August 2019, fourteen hamsters were found deceased one morning. An investigation determined a caretaker the
previous night had not properly reconnected the hamster rack to the Likit watering system which allowed one waterer to
continuously run. This created a flooding situation in the top container and continued to spill over into the two lower
containers until it was discovered the next morning. Corrective action has included retraining the staff on ensuring proper
connection to the watering system to prevent further incidents.

It shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal technicians,
and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties. This responsibility
shall be fulfilled in part through the provision of training and instruction to those personnel.
