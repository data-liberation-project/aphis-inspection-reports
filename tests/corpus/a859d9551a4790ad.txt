ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: Two animals housed in the barn need veterinary care.
1) The zebu has long hooves, especially the back feet. The lateral hoof on both back feet are curled up and out.
Overgrown hooves may cause foot problems and lameness. The feet must be trimmed to prevent discomfort and to
maintain the health of the animal.
2) The black alpaca has its lower front teeth protruding out its mouth over the left side of the upper lip. The teeth
are long and are not in alignment. Long teeth outside the mouth may break and cause discomfort to the animal.
The alpaca must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to provide the appropriate care.

Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The ground under the side gate used for vehicles in the enclosure housing 10
sheep, 14 goats and 9 fallow deer has eroded away leaving an 11 inch gap under half of the gate. The animals
may try to go under the gate and be injured and/or leave the enclosure. The gap under the gate must be filled to
prevent injury to the animals and to contain the animals.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility vice president.
