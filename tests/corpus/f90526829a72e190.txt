Housing facilities, general.
The animal area in two buildings housing macaques had cleaning supplies sitting out. In the first building, a full bottle of
Dawn dish detergent was sitting on the backside of one of the cages. Though this cage was vacant, the cage right beside
it housed a macaque.

The second building had an opened, large bottle of bleach sitting on top of the cabinet where the remainder of husbandry
supplies was stored. The bleach did not have a cap on it. Beside it was a spray bottle of a cleaning solution that was also
left out. The cabinet was positioned beside cages housing macaques. Although the facility representatives stated the
newer employees were not aware of the storage keeping requirements, another facility representative referenced these
procedures as apart of the standard operating procedures at the facility.

At least two buildings had opened bags of feed sitting out. The opened bags were left on top of the lids of the food storage
containers in between feedings, instead of returned to the container while not in use.
Opened bags of feed not stored in containers with lids are more exposed to cleaning agents, and additional forms of
contamination that can compromise its nutritive value, including the attraction of other bugs and pests. Additionally, toxic


substances kept out in animal areas can be very harmful to the primates if contact, spillage, or ingestion occurs.
Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and
vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and
around the supplies. Open food not in use must be kept in leak-proof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage
and contamination. And substances that are toxic to nonhuman primates, but are required for normal husbandry
practices, must not be stored in food storage and preparation areas, but may be stored in cabinets in animal areas.

Corrected before the inspection ended.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives and authorized person.
