ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:50 a.m. on
08-Feb-17.
On February 8, I arrived at the facility at approximately 10:50 a.m. and knocked on the front door. As there was no
response, I called and left messages on phone numbers (805) 449-0050 and (805) 279-5245 at 10:52 a.m.. I
waited at premises and called again at 11:19 a.m. I called the numbers again at 11:54 a.m. and left messages
again. On 09 February 2017, I received an email at 1:40 p.m.from the licensee in which she noted that she was
out-of-state at the time of the inspection.
