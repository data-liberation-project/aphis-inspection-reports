Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
At time of inspection the outdoor shelters were covered in brown coating of grime. The enclosures (indoor portion) of the
sheltered facility, housing puppies, had a build up of brown grime on the walls, floor and heating pad. A build up of hair
was noted along the front of the same enclosures. The outdoor portion of the sheltered facility, housing adults, exhibited
an accumulation of fecal material. Cleaning of the primary enclosures, removing excreta and sanitizing, is extremely
important to reduce disease hazards, prevent soiling of the dogs, insects, pests and odors. The licensee shall implement
a proactive cleaning regimen to include sanitizing and additional aggregate (outdoors) to assist the cleaning process.

Veterinary care for dogs.
At time of inspection the hands on exams, conducted on 6/25/21, noted the dental disease score of each animal. The
program of Veterinary Care outlined a plan of action for animals exhibiting a dental score of 4 dental disease. The plan of
action is to have a complete dental prophylaxis treatment within 6 month of diagnosis. There were 12 dogs noted to have
a grade 4 dental disease on the hands on exam document. The 12 dogs diagnosed with the grade 4 dental disease have
not had a complete dental prophylaxis at time of inspection.
Dental disease can cause significant health issues if left untreated. Following the outlined procedure required by the
Attending Veterinarian is important to the animals health and well-being. The licensee shall make arrangements to have
the animals, noted with the grade 4 dental disease, treated as prescribed by the Attending Veterinarian.
In addition, the preventative care should include properly trimmed nails. One of the adult female Corgi
(941000022312240) was exhibiting long nails that curved to the side due to their excessive length. Improper nail care can
cause an impact on the animals health and well-being. The licensee shall implement the nail care preventative as outlined
by the Attending Veterinarian.
