WATERING.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that a few of the water receptacles were in need of attention. The Jacob
sheep, Nubian goats, and alpaca pens had water receptacles that had an accumulation of grain, hay and algae
present. It was also noted that the fallow deer only had access to the pond for drinking water. To ensure that the
deer have access to potable water, another source will need to be provided.
