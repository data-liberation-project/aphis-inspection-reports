2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee had 3 river otters from last year. The licensee acquired 20 wild caught North American River Otters on
February 5 and February 17, 2019. Of the 20 otters acquired, 3 escaped while being transported by the licensee
and were never recovered, 1 is still at the facility, 9 were sold and 10 died at the facility. I spoke with the attending
veterinarians office and the veterinarian was unaware of the deaths. The licensee never contacted the attending
veterinarian to consult on these sick/dying otters.
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of veterinary care that include daily observations and a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal
health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
Contact the attending veterinarian promptly with all animal health problems to prevent suffering and/or death. A
diagnosis and program of veterinary care must be established and maintained to reduce the mortality rate of these
wild caught otters.
To be corrected from this day forward.
2.132(d)
PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
The licensee acquires wild caught otters from a trapper in Louisiana. The trapper does not have a USDA, APHIS,
Animal Care license to sell wild animals.
No exhibitor shall knowingly obtain any wild animal from any person who is required to be licensed but who does
not hold a current, valid, and unsuspended license.
All wild or exotic animals must be obtained from a USDA, APHIS, Animal Care licensed facility.
To be corrected from this day forward.3.137(a) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
The licensee transported two shipments of live caught North American River Otters to his facility from Louisiana.
One shipment on February 5, 2019 was 11 otters. When the licensee overnighted at a hotel, 3 of the otters chewed
out of their wooden enclosures, then chewed the screen in the open window of the cap on the back of the truck,
escaped and were never recovered.
Primary enclosures, such as compartments, transport cages, cartons, or crates, used to transport live animals shall
be constructed in such a manner that the structural strength of the enclosure shall be sufficient to contain the live
animals.
Containers used to transport animals must contain the animal to prevent escape, injury, and/or death.
To be corrected from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
