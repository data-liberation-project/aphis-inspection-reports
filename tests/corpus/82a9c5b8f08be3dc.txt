RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
At today's inspection, several APHIS 7006 Forms were found to be incomplete and missing key information There
was 1 form that was missing the sales date. In addition, there were approximately 7 other 7006's that were missing
the puppies age or date of birth. When the Licensee was asked to provide the missing information from the
puppies ID/Cage Card, it took the licensee approximately 30 minutes to find 4 cage cards with some of the missing
information. Although the Licensee had several cage cards to look through, he was not able to find all the cage
cards for the puppies from the forms with missing information. Several puppies' dates of birth are still unknown at
this time. The Licensee stated that his broker fills in the information on the 7006 Form and he was unaware that it
was his responsibility to ensure that information was all correct and complete at the time of Disposition. Not having
accurate and up to date Acquisition and Disposition records for all animals does not allow a proper accountability of
the animals to be conducted. The Licensee must ensure that all records are kept up to date with accurate
information for all animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held or otherwise in his possession or under his
control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold or otherwise disposed of for the facility. This information includes
age and date of birth of the animals that are sold.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor areas of several enclosures had a buildup of urine and fecal material on the concrete along the walls
and ground. There were multiple outdoor enclosures that had been rinsed of solid wastes, the waste had been
caught along the edges of the enclosure and has begun to collect. One outdoor enclosure with four adult small
breed dogs had a buildup of fecal material and urine on the floor and walls of the doghouse. At the time of exit, all
animals were removed from this enclosure. Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b) to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease
hazards.
The outdoor wash-down areas were found to have a heavy buildup of urine and fecal material. Three indoor
wash-down areas were also found to have a buildup of dried excrement. One open wash-down drain area had alarge buildup of fecal material, the kennel owner indicated that the wash-downs had been rinsed this morning and
that the drain did not appear to be functioning properly. All surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and
sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
The buildup of this material within the enclosures and wash-down areas promotes conditions for the spread of
pathogens and does not promote the health and wellbeing of the animals within the kennel.
