ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*The facility has a written program of veterinary care however, it is incomplete. A young domestic cat is
currently*Th living in the store, roaming free and interacting with other regulated animals on the premises. Staff
provided proof of current vaccinations, however the program of veterinary care does not list vaccinations, parasite
treatment or control, euthanasia method or any other provisions for veterinary care for cats.
The program of veterinary care should be completed by the attending veterinarian to accurately reflect the practices
at this facility for domestic cats. The written program will ensure that there is accurate communication between the
licensee and the attending veterinarian and ensure that all routine medications and vaccines provided to the animal
by the licensee are done with the direction and knowledge of the attending veterinarian.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two young ferrets housed together in a primary enclosure are very thin, with shoulder blades and spines protruding
and concave abdomens. The ribs were too easily palpable indicating little subcutaneous fat and poor body
condition. The white ferret appears dehydrated, exhibiting skin tenting; the brown ferret seems reluctant to move
and possibly depressed.
The manager stated that the ferrets arrived on April 3, 2017 and were thin and anorexic at that time. The ferrets
have not been examined or treated by a veterinarian since their arrival. Poor body condition, depression,
dehydration and diminished appetite can indicate a serious medical condition. These animals must be examined
and treated as directed by a veterinarian.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A plastic resting surface installed in the corner of the marmoset enclosure has an excessive build-up of a hardened,crusted brown material mixed with hair on the front rim. The unidentifiable brown material may be excreta, food or
food waste or a combination of these materials.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily and as often as necessary to prevent an
excessive accumulation of feces and food or food waste. Adequate cleaning will reduce disease hazards and odors
and prevent soiling of the non-human primates. The brown material should be removed from the enclosure and
future cleaning should be done on a daily basis.
