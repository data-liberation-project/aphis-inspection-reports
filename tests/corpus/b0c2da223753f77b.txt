2.50(b)(3)(3)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
*** The facility had recently acquired several puppies from other licensed facilities. The plastic collar on a few litters
only listed the breed of puppy. The collars did not list the required info in 2.51 including the licensed facility number
where the dogs originated from, sex of the dog or individual identifying number. This information is an important part
of the identification and recordkeeping requirement and needs to be addressed to track the movement of puppies.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** A few of the shelter boxes had feces in the boxes that were not being checked and removed daily. Fecal and
food waste must be removed daily from primary enclosures to prevent the dogs from becoming soiled. This needs
to be addressed and the boxes spot cleaned daily for the health of the dogs.
Corrected at the time of inspection and from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection.
