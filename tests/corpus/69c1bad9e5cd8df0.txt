at this time.

to the animal and to keep a minimal issue from becoming a major condition. The licensee must provide immediate
care and treatment in conjunction with their veterinarians recommendations as soon as issues have been identified.

There was a female sow #1257 that had an extremely large abscess approximately 5 inches long (approx. 10inches
in diameter) on the right side of the neck/top front shoulder area under the back of the jaw line. The skin was dark
red and pulled tight due to the pressure of the infection, with scab material running the length of the abscess. It took
several days for the abscess to get to this size and it had not been observed or treated by the facility until it was
identified during this inspection.
It is important that all illnesses, injuries or health issues are identified, treated and communicated to the veterinarian
in a timely manner in order to prevent prolonged discomfort or pain to the regulated animals and to prevent a
treatable issue from becoming a chronic untreatable condition.The licensee must conduct daily observations of all regulated animals and identify health issues in a timely manner
and contact the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of health issues.
The abscess had been lanced, cleaned and treated by the manager before the end of this inspection. This sow was
put on the treatment records for the facility for proper follow up treatment until the issue is resolved.
