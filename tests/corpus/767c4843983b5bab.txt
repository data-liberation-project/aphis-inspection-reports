CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
**There was an excessive buildup of animal excreta underneath the outdoor runs of the enclosures. Excessive
buildup of animal excreta/waste increases ammonia odors, risk of disease in the animals, and accumulation of flies.
Areas under enclosures must be cleaned regularly and frequently to protect the health and wellbeing of the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
**Outside the kennel on the east side of the building there is a large paper bag that was torn and overflowing with
empty containers of canned dog food. There are also several empty containers of canned dog food on the ground
outside the paper bag along with some spray paint cans. Accumulation of trash around the kennel does not allow for
proper cleaning of the premise, can cause injury to the animals, and also attracts pests. The paper bag, containers
of empty canned dog food, and spray paint cans must be removed and disposed of properly to ensure for the health
and wellbeing of the animals and prevent pests.
