2.40(b)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The refrigerator that is used to store medical products has not been maintained in a state of cleanliness appropriate for
these items. The interior surfaces of the refrigerator that are in contact with these products have an accumulation of a
brown-to-black material. The products stored include vaccines in plastic trays, bottles of dewormer and a vial containing a
penicillin-based antibiotic for injection.
Direct contamination of these products during storage in a refrigerator that isn't kept clean or removal from their container
may occur. The use of contaminated products may cause illness in animals, such as infection at the site of injection.
Equipment that is used to store or administer medical products must be maintained to be free of contamination, such as
by regular cleaning or sanitization.

Outdoor housing facilities.
At least 15 primary enclosures holding dogs have wood that is unsealed, with some of the wood being part of the floor.

Building surfaces in contact with animals in outdoor housing facilities must be made impervious to moisture or replaced
with impervious materials.
