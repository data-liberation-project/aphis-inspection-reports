The primary fencing of the Eland enclosure is in need of attention. There is a section, across from the ostrich enclosure,
that has a missing board along the base. This missing board has allowed the wire mesh to bow upwards by ~ 1.5 ft. To
ensure that unwanted animals are not allowed into this pen, this section of fence will need to be addressed.

Sanitation.
In the winter quarters barn a coatimundi is being housed next to Egyptian Flying Bats. The bats are hanging off their wire
meshed ceiling. However, when they defecate it is collecting on the top of the 4’ tall wall of the coatimundi enclosure. To
ensure that the coatimundi is not affected by this quano it will need to be cleaned off on a regular basis.
