ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Upon inspection, 4 adult dogs in the kennel were found to have advanced dental disease, including tartar build up,
reddening/discoloration and swelling of the gums, and mild to moderate whitish discharge on some teeth.
Microchips are used to identify the animals in the kennel: 032 (female Bichon), 294 (male Yorkshire Terrier), 242
(female Yorkshire Terrier), 280 (male Yorkshire Terrier). These dogs have not been under treatment by the
licensee to address their dental care needs. Ensuring proper dental health in the kennel is important to prevent pain
or other illnesses as a result of dental disease. Corrective action is to ensure adequate veterinary care is provided,
by having the attending veterinarian evaluate these dogs' dental conditions and following all treatment instructions
as given by the attending veterinarian.
