Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The areas underneath the dog's primary enclosures are not being cleaned as often as necessary to prevent accumulation
of dirt, dust and feces. Approximately half of the adult dog primary enclosures that consist of raised runs with mesh
flooring have cobwebs hanging underneath them. Most of the pans under the primary enclosures in the whelping area
have more than 1 days accumulation of feces, where some of the feces is becoming moldy. The accumulation of feces
and cobwebs can lead to disease hazards, pests, insects, and odors, which ultimately can be potentially injurious to the
animals. Correct by ensuring areas underneath the primary enclosures are cleaned as often as necessary to prevent
accumulation of feces and cobwebs. Correction date: 25 November 2021.
