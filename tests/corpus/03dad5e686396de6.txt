2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
A class "A" breeder must have identification permanently attached to each adult dog. Two, black and white five
month old female border collies, Jan and Jill, have no identification on their bodies. The breeder/owner must attach
identification to each of these dogs. This helps in being able to properly identify these dogs, for proper vaccinations,
safety, and for their best care and good health. Correct by 02-14-2017.
