ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1250 on
30-May-18. I went to the house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I honked my car horn a half dozen
times and did not see anyone around on the property. I called the licensee. She informed me she would not be
home for a while. I informed her I would try back another day.
End of report.
