The three Angora goats need to have their hooves trimmed. The hooves are in various stages of overgrowth with
the worst ones beginning to cause the digits to be in an abnormal position. If left uncorrected, this could eventually
cause joint or foot problems. To avoid future problems a regular program of trimming needs to be maintained, with
trimming occurring on an as frequent basis as is necessary to maintain a normal hoof and foot posture. Correct by
August 14, 2014 and then continuously.
