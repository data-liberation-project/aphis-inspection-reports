FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There were 16 enclosures housing 3 opossums, 6 skunks, and 13 woodchucks located in a building that regularly
has double sliding doors in the open position creating an outdoor facility requiring a perimeter fence. The doors
were open at the time of the inspection and no perimeter fence was present around the building.
A perimeter fence is required around these animals in order to protect them from unauthorized persons and other
animals and to provide for a secondary containment system. All outdoor facilities housing regulated animals must
be enclosed by a perimeter fence. It must be of sufficient distance (3 feet or more) from the outside of the primary
enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside of the
perimeter fence and can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
