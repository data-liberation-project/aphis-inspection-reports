2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public is permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosure of the ibex and deer and another enclosure
containing the prairie dogs. There are no barriers or signs present to discourage public contact and the guests are
encouraged to feed food sold near these enclosures. There are no attendants present during public contact and
guests may walk directly up to the enclosures to feed the animals. Primary enclosure fences for the ibex and deer
are made of material with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch
the animals. The prairie dog enclosure's wall is low enough that the public can reach into the enclosure and touch
these animals. Continued unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals.
Licensees must ensure that during periods of public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or
barriers between the animals and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** In one of the tiger's enclosure the corner of the wood climbing/shade structure was bent upward and created a
sharp exposed edge and exposed nails that could come into contact with the animal and cause injury.
*** In the Aoudad (Barbary sheep) enclosure, there was a 8 inch gap in the bottom of part of a section of fence next
to the overlook sight. This gap was large enough that the animal's horns or head could get stuck underneath and
therefore poses the risk of injury to animals in the enclosure.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points and protruding edges in order to protect the
animals from injury. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to ensure all animal
facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or escape.

WATERING.
In a bear enclosure, the large pool, which is the only water source for the animals, was dirty and there was green,
brown slimy debris on top of the water. It is the responsibility of the licensee to make sure water receptacles be kept
clean and sanitary for the overall health and well-being of the animals.
