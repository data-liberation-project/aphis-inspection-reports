HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing two lemurs has a hole dug at the fence line and partially under a concrete platform. The
digging appeared to be from the inside and there is a risk that if the hole is expanded it would enable the lemurs to
escape or allow other animals to enter the enclosure. Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed
and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They
must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict
other animals from entering. Correct by September 24, 2016.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** On the floor of the night den of the grey-cheeked mangabey, "Marcell", there was an accumulation of dried and
old feces. The enclosure needs to be spot-cleaned daily.
*** The night den of the rhesus macaque, "Bubba", had multiple cockroaches in it with roach feces and eggs. There
were spider webs with spiders and their egg sacs that were attached to the inside of the lid and sides of the
enclosure which indicated that it had not been opened for days. It was mentioned that the volunteer was responsible
for cleaning but apparently hadn't done so.
*** The night den of the Japanese macaque, "Chico" had chunks of crumbling plaster on the inside. It was said by
the facility that they knew the macaque was picking at it but had not been cleaned.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease
hazards. It was corrected by the exit interview.
3.75(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** There was a large amount of peanut hull waste near and around the enclosure housing a rhesus macaque
named "Baby" and a bonnet macaque named "Sophie". When asked about this debris, the facility representativesaid that this was raked out of the primate enclosure and she considered it as mulch. However, the quantity of this
food waste was significant and the material had not been composted or processed in anyway and it was clearly
identifiable as peanuts and hulls. Additionally, the process described to the inspectors indicates that other excreta
and waste was likely included in the debris and not just the peanut hulls. This creates a sanitation concern that
could potentially have disease or health risks for the animals including the potential for attracting pests and vermin.
Housing facility operators must provide for regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food
wastes, bedding, dead animals, debris, garbage, water, and any other fluids and wastes, in a manner that
minimizes contamination and disease risk. Correct by October 14, 2016.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** There was an accumulation of pests including spiders and roaches in the rhesus macaques "Bubba" night den
enclosure. There were other areas of the facility with the presence of spiders and roaches as well. The facility
should practice better husbandry and, establish and maintain an effective program to control the pest therefore
promoting the health and well-being of the animals and to reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. Correct

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The den walls for the tiger "Magoo" was made of wood landscape timbers. Some of the timbers were rotten and
crumbling and had holes in them. The weakness of the walls could cause a break posing the risk of escape or
injury.
*** The enclosure for the leopard "Jack" had a bench in the sheltered den area which had deteriorating and
splintering wood which could cause injury to the animal. The outdoor enclosure for this same leopard had a broken
and splintering landscape timber in one of the resting platforms. Broken and splintering wood poses a risk of injury.
*** The the enclosure housing three Patagonian cavies and several tortoises had a very large tortoise burrow in
one corner about 2 to 3 feet away from the fence line. The burrow was very deep and the end could not be
visualized causing concern that the tunnel may go under the fence. The burrow so close to the fence creates a risk
of potential escape or injury to the cavies if the surface were to potentially cave-in.
*** The enclosure housing two prairie dogs has sharp pointed wires bending into the enclosure which could cause
injury. There is also a rotten landscape timber in the wall that has a very large hole on the outside that is almost full
thickness into the enclosure and which could create a hole where the animals could escape. There is no wire, panel
or other structure on the inside that would prevent the formation of a through and through gap if the decayed area of
wood spreads further. ***In the enclosure housing four black bears there is a large chunk of concrete with a wood post sticking out. This
debris in the enclosure poses and injury hazard to the bears. Additionally, the bear den area has damaged wood on
two bench platforms which could pose an injury hazard from splinters. The den area was dark and there was not
sufficient light to properly inspect, or for the keepers to assess their cleaning, without supplemental light from the
flashlights. The inspectors had to use flashlights, a small light on the wall and the camera flashes to at least get a
partial assessment of this enclosure.
*** The wolf primary enclosure has a very large excavation in the ground at the fence line of the lock-out portion of
the enclosure. A portion of this large hole, which is big enough for the wolf to fit in, extends under the fence and
there is a risk of a gap opening up that would allow the wolf to escape.
***In "Namib" the black leopards night house there was bowing of the floor panel creating concern that there is
separation of the wood from the rest of the structure. The night house is not contained within the primary fencing but
is an extension of the primary enclosure. If the floor gives way and the animal were to escape it would be a major
concern for the public and ultimately the animal. Other large cats enclosures at this facility have a similar design
with wood dens that are extensions of primary enclosures, which creates general containment concerns since
decaying wood is not secure. Namib's disposition, displaying aggression and tearing at the fencing raises additional
concerns.
The housing facilities must be repaired and/or replaced and should be maintained and kept structurally sound to
protect and contain the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the preparation room there was a chest freezer that was being used to refrigerate chicken and other meats.
When the freezer was opened a foul odor wafted up from the inside of the freezer. The freezer was very full and
there was a large amount of ice accumulated around the walls of the freezer and some of the ice on top had red
coloring that appeared to be blood mixed in it. The strong foul odor, the amount of ice build up, and the unclean
nature of the freezer create concerns that there may be decaying meats in there and that the freezer may not be
functioning properly or maintained in a manner which will properly preserves the animal foods. The freezer is in
disrepair or not being maintained and cleaned properly and needs to be cleaned, replaced and/or repaired to
prevent spoilage of the food content contained within and illness of the animals ingesting it. Correct by October 22,
2016.
3.125(d)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** On the perimeter fence in front of Special the tigers primary enclosure there was an object hanging that appeared
to be a large chunk of dried meat. Once the object was removed by the facility representative it appeared to have
muscle fibers which is indicative of flesh. The meat was dried onto the fence and had to be removed by poking it
with a stick therefore it had apparently been there for some time. It was never observed by the facility. Food waste
and dead animals shall be removed to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards. It was corrected at
the time of the inspection.
** There was a large piece of meat in Special the tigers enclosure on her platform. The meat was discolored and
had a dark appearance, the fat appeared to be melting and the flesh was decomposing and breaking down. The
facility stated that they fed the cat the night before.There were also two other pieces of meat in her lock-in that
looked the same but had flies swarming and a foul odor. The cat tried to eat the meat in the back but dropped it and
backed away. Food waste should be removed to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards. Correct
by September 29, 2016.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
** There were decaying grapes in the prairie dogs primary enclosure. The facility stated that they were just fed that
morning. The grapes had a dark brown discoloration and the flesh had a viscous appearance with the seeds oozing
out. The outer skin appeared to be shriveled and drying out. The facility should inspect the produce before feeding
them to ensure that the food is wholesome, palatable and of nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
*** The was an excessive amount of feces within the bobcats primary enclosure. The feces was pushed to the
edges of the front and sides of the enclosure but were dried, old and discolored. Some piles were decomposing on
the ground and blended in with the debris from the trees and leaves.Excreta shall be removed from primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize
disease hazards and to reduce odors. Correct by September 24, 2016
*** There was an excessive amount of feces, strong urine odor and stains in the shaded shelter within the cavies
primary enclosure. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. It was
corrected by the exit interview.3.131(c)
SANITATION.
*** There was an accumulation of clutter around the tiger "Magoo" enclosure. This included rolls of spare
chain-linked fencing, trash, and a discarded blanket all of which had to be stepped over and were creating a tripping
hazard when trying to evaluate the tiger enclosure. The presence of this debris makes is difficult to access the area
safely to evaluate the status of the tiger enclosure. The premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to
protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Correct
by October 6, 2016.
** There was a full trash can located in the gazebo across from the wolf enclosure. There was a very foul odor of
rotten garbage emanating from the bin and something that smelled like fermented grain or fruit. The presence of
garbage with such an odor indicates that trash is not being removed in a timely manner and may pose a risk of
attracting flies and other pests or vermin which could impact the health of the animals. Premises (buildings and
grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas
and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals. Correct by September 23, 2016.

EMPLOYEES.
** Based on new and repeat non-compliant items cited during this inspection and previous inspections, as well as
the fact that there is only one paid full time employee and one voluntary full time employee, it does not appear that
the licensee has an adequate number of employees to carry out an acceptable level of animal husbandry and
maintenance for this facility. Without adequate personnel or time to properly perform the required functions of a
licensee, the facility can fall into further disrepair, waste and debris can accumulate, and the animals may not
receive adequate care causing negative health and sanitary issues to occur. The licensee must have adequate
labor to provide adequate husbandry for the animals no later than October 22, 2016
This inspection was conducted with the facility representative, Dr. Annette Chapman, VMO, Dr. Suzan Loerzel,
VMO and IES Investigator. The exit interview was conducted with facility representative, Dr. Annette Chapman,
VMO and Dr. Suzan Loerzel, VMO.
