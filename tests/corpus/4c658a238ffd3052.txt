ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has two capybara. One of the capybara appears to have a slight limp and has red, inflamed skin
between its back legs. The licensee was notified of this problem approximately 2 weeks ago by a patron. The
licensee had not notified the attending veterinarian of this veterinary issue with the capybara until inspection.
Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include: The use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of
emergency, weekend, and holiday care.
It is the licensee responsibility to notify the attending veterinarian at the first sign of a veterinary problem with any
animal held at the facility. This must be done so that the attending veterinarian has the opportunity to diagnose the
animals condition and recommend treatment for the animal. This must be done to prevent pain, suffering and/or
death.
The licensee contacted the attending veterinarian at time of inspection.

3.85 CRITICAL
EMPLOYEES.
One of the licensees animal caretakers has been bitten for a second time by a black and white ruffed lemur.
Every person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3) maintaining nonhuman primates
must have enough employees to carry out the level of husbandry practices and care required in this subpart. The
employees who provide husbandry practices and care, or handle nonhuman primates, must be trained and
supervised by an individual who has the knowledge, background, and experience in proper husbandry and care of
nonhuman primates to supervise others. The employer must be certain that the supervisor can perform to these
standards.
The licensee did make a change in the enclosure after the first bite by adding a trap door to be used to feed and
water the lemurs without going into the enclosure. This change did not prevent the caretaker from being bit a
second time.
It is the licensees responsibility to train all employees in husbandry and handling practices to prevent animal bites.
Enclosures must also be designed and constructed to ensure the safety of employees.

interfere with their health or cause them discomfort.
