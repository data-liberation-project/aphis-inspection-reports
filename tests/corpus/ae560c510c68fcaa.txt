Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A Golden Retriever #58, has an area of hair loss on the top of her head. The area of hair loss was most of the top part of
the head. The middle of the hair loss region, the skin was pink and red, appeared slightly swollen and cracked with a
yellow substance in the cracks. The edges of the hair loss had a brownish/black dried matter. The licensee stated they
thought this dog may have got a cut on the top of her head from another dog in next enclosure thru the chain link fence
about a week ago, but had not treated the dog. This dog's condition could be due to an injury, infection or a variety of
other veterinary medical conditions. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding this dog's condition
in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The
licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure
that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
