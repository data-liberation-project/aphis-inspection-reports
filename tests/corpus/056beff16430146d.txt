3.13(c)(3) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection around noon on 11/1/17 at the SFO United Airlines Cargo Office there were two dogs and
two cats in four separate crates. There were problems with three of these shipments:
One dog on waybill # 016-SFO-30890156 headed to Fort Lauderdale on UA Flight 1094: The consignor did not
provide any instructions for feeding and watering during transit.
One cat on waybill # 016-SFO-45632996 headed to Honolulu on UA Flight 300: Regarding instructions for feeding
and watering during transit, the consignor filled in the time and date for feeding and watering with the "null" symbol.
Additionally, although the consignor’s certification was signed by the consignor at "9:30" on "11/1/17", it stated that
the cat had last been offered food and water on "31/10/17" at "12:00" - suggesting either 9.5 or 21.5 hours prior to
leaving the cat with the transporter.
One dog on baggage tag # 5-16-254498, that had originated from Spokane, and was headed to Frankfurt via UA
Flights 58 and 1602: The consignor did not provide any instructions for feeding and watering during transit, nor did
they indicate the last time the animal was offered food and water.
Upon accepting an animal for transport, the carrier must ensure that the consignor has provided the required
information regarding feeding and watering, specifically there must be a certification from the consignor in writing
that the dog or cat was offered food and water during the 4 hours before delivery to the carrier, to include the time
and date the animal was last fed and watered and the specific instructions for the next feeding(s) and watering(s) for
a 24-hour period. This certification must be securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure in a manner
that makes it easily noticed and read. Instructions for no food or water are not acceptable unless directed by the
attending veterinarian, in which case this should be clearly visible on the certification.
Failure to ensure that this information is collected and attached to the carrier could be detrimental to the health and
well-being of the animals while in transit. This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives in the United Cargo Office.
