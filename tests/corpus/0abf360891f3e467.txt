ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***On January 16, 2013, when overnight low temperatures were approximately 17 degrees according the facility
staff, one male elephant (M12029) sustained injuries (burns to both front legs) from a torpedo style heater while
housed outdoors. The general curator stated to the VMO, the facility can't house all elephants indoor simultaneously
due to the configuration of the building, herd dynamics and compatibility issues. Because of this, the facility stated
the male had to be housed outdoors overnight despite the extremely cold temperatures when he sustained the
injuries. The facility is still unable to house all elephants indoors in the event that outdoor conditions present the
potential to harm the health and welfare of the elephants. The licensee must have the appropriate facilities,
personnel, equipment and services to comply with a program of adequate veterinary care as determined by
professionally accepted standards and the Animal Welfare Act.
This non-compliance has been corrected
This was a focused inspection regarding the elephant incident.
Exit briefing was conducted on-site with the general curator on 11/6/15.
