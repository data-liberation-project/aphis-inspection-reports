CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Swarms of fruit flies were observed inside of the building containing the nonhuman primates. The fruit flies were
concentrated on the upper walls, light fixtures, and ceiling of the facility, but were also seen in and around the
nonhuman primates' enclosures. Additionally, several brown fly spots were observed on the upper walls and light
fixtures. Multiple sticky fly traps were present inside of the building, however; they were not effectively controlling
the population of fruit flies. Flies can carry and spread disease.
Implement and maintain an effective program to control the fruit fly population to promote animal health.
