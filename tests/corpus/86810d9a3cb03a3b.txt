ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult brown and white female bulldog identified by tattoo #257 has a wound on the left side of its neck. The area
affected is approximately 1.5 inches long and 0.5 inch wide. The appearance is reddened and moist. Hair-loss is
also present on the wound. There is no documentation available showing the dog's wound has been treated or
evaluated by a veterinarian. Open wounds can cause pain and discomfort and lead to other health problems.
An adult Golden Retriever identified by microchip #015-812-600 (Spike) has a problem that is affecting the dog's
back legs. The dog is periodically carrying its left rear leg and trying to put as little pressure as possible on it. The
dog is also slightly hopping on its rear right leg and making other abnormal movements when it(cid:25)s walking around the
enclosure. The abnormal movements can be an indication of health problems and also be painful.
The dogs listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administrated.
Documentation must be maintained on all medical problems, diagnosis and treatments.
Two adult tan colored Wheaten Terriers identified by tattoo #135 and tattoo #66 have overgrown toenails. There are
long toenails that are laying sideways when the dog's foot is on a flat surface. Toenails that are excessively long are
also passing through the wire flooring and could potentially get caught. Overgrown toenails can cause pain and
discomfort to the dogs. The licensee must trim the nails of these dogs to an appropriate length. The licensee must
also develop an effective plan to maintain the toenails of all dogs.
All dogs must receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
*The Golden Retriever (#015-812-600) and Bulldog (#257) were evaluated by the attending veterinarian at the time
of inspection.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure in the "Bulldog Building" containing a black labradoodle and a blonde labradoodle has flooring with
rusty broken wires creating an opening and sharp points. The opening is located on the left side of the enclosure
and is large enough for the dogs(cid:25) feet to pass through.
The sharp points could potentially injure the dogs and the rusty surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of
housing facilities are maintained in good repair at all times.
*The female King Charles Cavalier #38, female Shiba Inu #041-515-020, male yellow Labrador #145559516A, and
female Shiba Inu #0C00021664 listed under 2.40 (b) (2) on the December 16, 2015 inspection report received
veterinary care.
