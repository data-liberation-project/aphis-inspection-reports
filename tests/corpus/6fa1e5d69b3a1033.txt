2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Lhasa Apso (#956 000004174161 & 0A02201909) had discharge around both eyes and long toenails. An
abundance of black to dark green crusty material was matted in the fur surrounding both eyes with a thick amount of
the material present in the corners of the eyes. The left eye had a heavier amount of discharge present around it
compared to the right eye. The left eye also had a thick green mucous-like discharge that covered a portion of the
surface of the eye. The dog’s right front and right rear toenails were observed to be very long and were curling
outward. According to the licensee, he was not aware of the dog’s eye condition. There was no written
documentation of any treatments administered for the dog’s current condition. Eye discharge can be due to an
infection and/or other veterinary medical condition which can be uncomfortable and may lead to more serious health
problems. Long toenails can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of an abnormal gait. The licensee must
have this dog examined by a licensed veterinarian for its eye condition. The licensee must also ensure this dog’s
toenails are trimmed and establish an appropriate nail trimming schedule for all dogs. The veterinary examination is
required in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed
and followed. The licensee must document this information and provide it to the inspector upon request. The
licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sharp points
Inside two enclosures, affecting 3 dogs, there are twisted and broken wires with the sharp points pointing inward
and at the dogs’ level. These sharp points could cause injury to the dogs. The licensee must remove these sharp
points from these enclosures and ensure that all sharp points or edges are removed or repaired at all times to
protect the animals from injury.

3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.Cleaning
In an empty enclosure, immediately adjacent to an enclosure housing an adult female dog, there is an upside down
food receptacle that appears to be mostly covered in fecal and/or other organic material. The back section of the
floor of the empty and adjacent enclosure also has a heavy accumulation of fecal and/or other organic material.
This is a disease hazard to the adult dogs and puppies in the facility. The licensee must clean and sanitize the dirty
adjacent enclosure and ensure that all surfaces with which the animals come into contact with are spot cleaned
daily and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks, or more often if necessary and all other surfaces of housing
facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and
practices. Sanitization may be done using any of the methods provided in § 3.11(b)(3) for primary enclosures.
3.9(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
Inside of the indoor whelping facility there is a food receptacle that contained a piece of old, dried fecal material
which was whitish and light brown in appearance, intermingled with the food. This dried piece of fecal material
could indicate that it is more than a day old. Fecal material can contaminate the food and make it unpalatable for the
dogs and a potential disease hazard. The licensee was instructed to remove the feeder from the enclosure. The
licensee must ensure that all food is uncontaminated, wholesome, palatable, and of sufficient quantity and nutritive
value.
Corrected at time of inspection
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
In two of the indoor whelping facility enclosures, affecting 2 dogs and 6 puppies, the food receptacles were dirty.
There is a buildup of dirt, grime and other organic material on both the inside and outside of the receptacles. When
questioned as to when the last time these receptacles were cleaned and sanitized the licensee replied “It had been
a couple of weeks”. The licensee must clean and then sanitize these food receptacles and ensure that all food and
water receptacles are clean and then sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to prevent
and accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
