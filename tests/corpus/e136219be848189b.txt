HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One divider fence between two adjoining enclosures is loose from its support creating a gap between the fence and
flooring material. This gap and loose divider fence does not securely contain the dogs. Housing facilities must be
maintained and kept in good repair to protect the dogs from injury and contain the dogs securely. Correct by 27
March 2018.
