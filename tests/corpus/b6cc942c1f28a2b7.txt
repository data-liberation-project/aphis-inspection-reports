ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Outdated medications including Scarlet Oil (12/14), Betadine Scrub (4/15), and Valbazen (Albendazole) (10/13)
were found in medical cabinet in feed room. The use of expired veterinary products is not considered acceptable
veterinary practice and therefore not considered accurate veterinary care. Expired medications may not be used on
regulated animals, and must be segregated from other drugs and clearly labeled as "expired". Ensure that all drugs
are within date. Correct by July 7, 2017.
