FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The tiger enclosure housing two tigers “Thelma” and “Louise” had a door with severe rust in the lower left corner of
the frame. The metal tube door frame was rusted through in that corner so that the bottom horizontal frame no
longer came into contact with the left vertical fame creating a gap. The compromised structural integrity of the door
creates weak spot that potentially could pose a risk of escape of the tigers from the enclosure. The tiger enclosure
housing “Diva” and the one housing tigers “Malaya” and “Liberty” also had significant rusting in the lower corners of
the door frames. In these enclosures it was not yet to the point of breaking but enough to be concerned about
structural integrity. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and contain the animals. The doors must be repaired or replace. The door of the enclosure housing
“Thelma” and “Louise” was repaired by the time of the exit interview.
