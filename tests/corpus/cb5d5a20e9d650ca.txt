COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
The licensee and facility representative stated an adult female Golden Retriever identified by microchip
(900085000063484) died as a result of injuries sustained from a fight with one or two of the dogs housed in the
same enclosure. Records indicate the dog died on 1/13/2016. The other dogs in the enclosure were two adult
female Golden Retrievers identified by microchip (00071F229E) and (981020005194335). The licensee and facility
representative both stated they have never seen the three dogs exhibiting signs of aggression before.
Dogs housed together must be compatible. Failure to do so can result in ongoing stress for the animals involved,
injuries which can be painful for the dogs, and even death such as the female Golden Retriever listed above.
The licensee must ensure that dogs housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible.
To be corrected by close of business today.
This is a focused inspection to address a complaint in reference to compatibility and veterinary care.
Exit briefing conducted with the licensee and facility representative.
