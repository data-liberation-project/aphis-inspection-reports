PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On the back wall of cages containing pigmented rabbits, the cage size was 30"x14"=420 inches. Two out of the 20
rabbits on the back wall were over 9 lbs (weighed in at 10 lbs, 7 oz & 9 lbs, 15 oz) and required 540 inches of
space, based on the requirements for cages acquired before 1990.
These two rabbits were immediately moved to larger cages, while the 18 rabbits under 9 lbs stayed in the cages on
the back wall.
Corrected during inspection.
