2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- The licensee uses a veterinarian under consulting arrangements to provide veterinary care for the animals but
does
not have a formal agreement nor a written program of veterinary care. The last recorded visit to the facility from a
licensed veterinarian was 3-2-2006. The licensee does not have written guidance from the attending veterinarian to
provide preventative care or treatment for routine and common veterinary problems. In order to ensure problems of
animal health are addressed adequately, a written program of veterinary care should include the species housed
and used in regulated activities, what common health problems they may have and how these will be addressed
(eg. by the licensee or the attending veterinarian (AV)). If the licensee is to provide veterinary care to the animals for
common health problems, how this will be identified, what treatment will be provided (medication, dose, route,
frequency, duration), and, if not resolved by that treatment, that the AV will be contacted for further guidance.
Each dealer shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care
and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- - There is a 15 year old female capuchin identified as "Elizabeth" housed with another primate. Upon inspection,
Elizabeth's rump and legs as well as flank area is observed to be missing patches of hair. The licensee states this
has been present for approximately 6 weeks. Abnormal conditions to the haircoat my indicate improper social group
housing, poor diet or psychological abnormalties in primates that can lead to addtional health problems for the
animal. The female capuchin "Elizabeth" must be examined by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment
administered. Documentation must be maintained for any health related problems and it must include the following
information:
- Identity of the animal.
- Descriptions of the illness or injury.
- Dates, details, and results of examinations, tests, and other such procedures.- Dates and other details of all treatments, including the name, dose, route, frequency, and duration of treatment
with
drugs or other medications.
- Follow-up exams to determine resolution of problem.

- -The following medications stored in current drug storage area were past the expiration date:
Ace 25 mg Expired 4-8-10
Ampicillin inj (polyflex) Expired 8- 97
Prednisone liquid suspension Expired 12-11-08
An unlabeled syring of an unknown medication with an unknow dose and an unknown expiration date.
These medications were intermingled with other pharmaceuticals that are currently being used in the sheltered
facility
and are therefore ready for use.
Use of expired medications is not be an appropriate method to prevent, control, and treat diseases and injuries
since the expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience pain and distress due to
mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or due to unexpected side effects.
The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired and labeled properly in accordance
with standard veterinary practices and manufacturer's recommendations.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
- Environmental enrichment. The physical environment in the primary enclosures must be enriched by providing
means of expressing noninjurious species-typical activities. Species differences should be considered when
determining the type or methods of enrichment. Examples of environmental enrichments include providing perches,
swings, mirrors, and other increased cage complexities; providing objects to manipulate; varied food items; using
foraging or task-oriented feeding methods; and providing interaction with the care giver or other familiar and
knowledgeable person consistent with personnel safety precautions.(cid:9)- The environmental enrichment provided to the nonhuman primates is not adequate. There is no plan denoting the
enrichment and no log book or calendar showing that enrichment takes place. The animals have different items in
their enclosures, but there is no schedule of rotating or changing the items in the pens. The enrichment must be
documented on the environmental enhancement plan, and the plan must be completely developed, signed by the
attending veterinarian and followed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- Open food storage bags where present on a shelf above the pig as well as above the rabbits. Open feed is an
attractant for rodents and pests, which could lead to contamination of stored feed. The open bags of feed must be
stored and protected to prevent contamination by vermin, mold or deterioration.
- At the time of the inspection there were two boxes of produce sitting on the floor in front of the refrigerator. The
licensee stated she had received 6 boxes of produce on Friday but had not made it through the last two boxes.
These boxes had been unrefrigerated for 48 plus hours. This is a potential source of contamination.
Refrigeration shall be provided for supplies of perishable food.
