ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1317 on
03-Apr-17. We called the licensee at 1:17pm from the facility driveway to announce an inspection. The licensee
said that they have new litters and that they are closed to the public and don’t want visitors because of newborn
litters present because mothers may get stressed and injure/kill the litters if visitors come on the property. We
respected their desires that no one visit to avoid causing litter rejection problems but explained that a reasonable
manner of inspecting the facility year-around needs to be developed so that the facility can be inspected also during
times of newborn litters if needed.
End of report.
