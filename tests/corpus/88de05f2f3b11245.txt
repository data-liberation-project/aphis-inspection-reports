2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection on December 11, 2013, records of animal births and deaths were not maintained for
the guinea pigs. Records must be kept on the guinea pigs for animal tracking, assessment of the animal care
program, and to comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that records on animal
births and deaths are kept and maintained for guinea pigs.
Correct from this day forward.
3.31(a)(4)
SANITATION.
The licensee stated during the inspection that he disinfects the guinea pig enclosures using clorox , but does not
use a detergent. Lack of an effective sanitation program exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as
bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or as
necessary with proper agents to sufficiently disinfect all surfaces that the guinea pigs may come in contact. Proper
sanitation of primary enclosures is necessary to minimize the risk of disease to the animals houesed therein.
Correct by ensuring a proper sanitation program is put into effect.
Correct from this day forward.
