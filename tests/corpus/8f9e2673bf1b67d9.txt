***One adult female Nubian ibex is observed to be non-weight bearing on her left front leg. The animal is reluctant to
move; when standing she touches her left forefoot on the ground or raises it outward in front of her. When walking, she
carries that leg out in front and the gait is affected as she heaves her left forequarter forward. Lameness can be caused
by a variety of problems including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and
affect the health and well-being of the animal.

The veterinarian evaluated the animal on Aug 27, 2021. She prescribed meloxicam daily for 2 weeks. She advised the
licensee to come to her clinic to discuss weights of the animal so that the correct dose could be prescribed. As of 12pm
on Aug 31, 2021, the licensee had not picked up the medication, therefore the licensee has not followed the veterinarian’s
recommendation. The licensee needs to follow the veterinarian’s recommendation.

***One adult female fennec fox has multiple hair mats present on her back. There are six distinct hair mats among
tangled fur which extends along the top of the back from the shoulder blade area to the base of the tail and along both
sides of the animal. Matted hair can lead to medical problems, it can cause skin irritation, pain and progress to infected


lesions.

The veterinarian evaluated the animal on Aug 27, 2021. She recommended removing the matts by shaving or brushing.
This has not been done, therefore the licensee has not followed the recommendation of the veterinarian. The licensee
needs to follow the veterinarian’s recommendation.

***Three adult female and two adult male white-tailed deer were observed to be thin to emaciated, with protruding hip
bones, spine, and ribs. The bones of their spines, hips, and long bones were visible, and each rib was easily seen by both
APHIS inspectors upon inspection. They have rough, unthrifty hair coats and overgrown hooves that are affecting the
angle of their feet.

The veterinarian evaluated these animals on Aug 27, 2021. She recommended increasing protein and fat in their diets,
deworming with ivermectin, and contacting a farrier to address the hoof problems. As of Aug 31, 2021, a farrier has not
been contacted about the feet problems therefore the licensee has not followed the veterinarian’s recommendation.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries.

*** At least five adult Nubian Ibex have overgrown hooves affecting the angles of their feet due to a lack of hoof trimming
and inappropriate substrate.

The veterinarian evaluated these animals on Aug 27, 2021. She recommended contacting a farrier to address the hoof
problems. A farrier has not been contacted about the feet problems therefore the licensee has not followed the


veterinarian’s recommendation. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be
painful or cause injuries. The licensee needs to follow the veterinarian’s recommendation.

***According to the veterinarian, there is an addax/oryx that has a growth on its brisket area. The veterinarian
recommended this animal be started on meloxicam and antibiotics. She advised the licensee to come to her clinic to
discuss weights of the animal so that the correct doses could be prescribed. As of 12pm on Aug 31, 2021, the licensee
had not picked up the medication, therefore the licensee has not followed the veterinarian’s recommendation. The
licensee needs to follow the veterinarian’s recommendation.

The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan, then follow the
plan.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
***All four of the camels had an excess number of flies causing them discomfort. One camel consistently used his left
back leg to kick at his elbow area to get rid of the flies. This camel had mild fly strike on his right ear. Another camel had
severe fly strike on both ears to the point that the tips of the ears were missing.

According to the veterinarian, the licensee is supposed to use fly spray to control flies. Either the licensee is not using the
fly spray, or the fly spray is not working, and the licensee has not communicated this to the attending veterinarian.

The licensee needs to discuss a pest control program with his attending veterinarian. A mechanism of direct and frequent


communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being
is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
At the time of inspection, there is an inadequate written plan in place for environmental enhancement for most of the
nonhuman primates, including two spider monkeys, three lar gibbons, 11 ring-tailed lemurs and three brown capuchins.
There is limited environmental enrichment within the lar gibbon, spider monkey and capuchin enclosures, which consists
of items for climbing and swinging, but none that facilitate cognitive/sensory enrichment.

Environmental enhancement is important to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. A plan for
environmental enhancement that addresses social grouping, environmental enrichment, and other special considerations
such as juveniles and individually housed animals, must be developed and followed for each nonhuman primate at the
facility. This plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards and approved by the
attending veterinarian.
3.84(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

In the enclosure housing three brown capuchin monkeys, there is an accumulation of decaying vegetable matter, food
debris and feces on the bench inside the shelter, completely covering one third of the bench and scattered less densely
across the remaining two-thirds.



Routine cleaning and sanitation must be done daily to protect the health and well-being of nonhuman primates. Dirt, fecal
material, food waste, and other debris must be removed daily to prevent contamination of food, prevent nonhuman
primates from becoming soiled and to reduce disease hazards.
3.130 Repeat

Watering.
A couple of the water troughs had thick, slimy green-brown material and/or have cloudy water with debris floating on the
surface.

Unsanitary water receptacles and unpotable water can be unpalatable to animals and lead to illness. It is the responsibility
of the licensee to make sure all water receptacles be kept clean and sanitary for the overall health and well-being of the
animal.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
***In the muntjac enclosure containing three adult and two juvenile muntjacs, there is a decomposing bird carcass. The
presence of dead and decaying animals can attract pests and vermin and be a source of disease-causing agents and
odors.
3.131(d) Direct

Sanitation.
There were a large number of flies observed in animal enclosures, on animals, and on animal food. According to the
licensee, he uses fly spray on the animals as his method of pest control. This does not appear to be adequate
considering the number of flies throughout the facility.



Flies can transmit disease and spoil food not adequately stored. They can also cause irritation to the animals.

The facility needs to establish and maintain a safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and
avian and mammalian pests.
