FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The following enclosures needed repairs:
1) The enclosure housing 2 Markhor goats had the bottom of the fence curling up above the ground for the section
of fencing just past the shelter entrance on the left side (adjacent to the fallow deer enclosure). Hoof stock walk the
fence line and may injure a foot or leg if caught in the curled up fencing. After the condition of the fencing was
identified by the APHIS official, facility personnel repaired the fence during the inspection. Corrected during the
inspection.
2) The enclosure housing 18 white sheep and 13 mouflon sheep share a common fence line. The metal farm gate
between the enclosures had broken wire mesh fencing attached that may injure the animals rubbing against the
metal points/ends. After the condition of the gate was identified by the APHIS official, facility personnel replaced the
gate during the inspection. Corrected during the inspection.
3) The same enclosure identified in the above item 2 had three loose fence posts leaning into the white sheep
enclosure to the left of the described gate. The fence posts must be secured to provide structural strength for the
fencing to contain the animals in their enclosures and to prevent injuries. Correct by securing the fence posts so
they are no longer loose. Correct by May 11, 2017.This inspection was conducted with the son of the owner and the exit interview was conducted with the owner and
his son.
