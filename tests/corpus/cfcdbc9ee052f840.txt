3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility has recently made many repairs to the animal enclosures, however the enclosure for the serval named
Nurani is in need of repair:
Painted corrugated panels have come loose, exposing an area behind the panel that is as large as the animal itself
where there is extensive wood rot, making the structural integrity of the enclosure questionable. Another corrugated
panel of similar size shows deterioration, probably from repeated urine exposure, and it appears brittle and has
openings in its surface beginning to form.
Enclosures should be maintained in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury or escape.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the small shed where the hay for the goats and alpaca are stored, there were many rodent droppings throughout
the shed, and the hay is clearly not being adequately protected from vermin contamination.
Food and bedding should be stored in a manner which adequately protects it against deterioration, molding, or
contamination by vermin. Failure to properly store animal food could be detrimental to the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
