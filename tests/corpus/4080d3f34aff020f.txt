2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Multiple medications at the ranch were found to be expired. These medications included vaccines, antibiotics, eye
ointments and other drugs as as well as suture material and acupuncture needles. The facility IACUC had
discovered expired medications at this site on the April 2018 facility inspection. The manager was instructed that
"expired drugs should be disposed of promptly upon expiration". Some of the expired medications discovered on
inspection had expiration dates prior to this April 2018 facility report. Expired medications are not guaranteed to be
safe or efficacious, and should not be used in regulated animals. Expired medications should be disposed of
immediately upon expiration.
Correct from this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
