2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:15 AM on
08-NOV-16.
The inspector arrived at 10:15 AM on 11/8/16 to conduct an inspection but the Licensee was not on the premises.
The inspector tried to reach the Licensee by phone but the call went to voicemail. A worker arrived at the facility
while the inspector was waiting and it was learned that the Licensee was doing a program at a distant off-site
location and would not return for several hours.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other authorized facility
representative available to accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility and animals.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of this Licensee. Report delivered by e-mail 11/8/16.
