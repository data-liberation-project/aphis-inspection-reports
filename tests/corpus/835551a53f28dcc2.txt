INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A new protocol (#40) using hamsters was approved this past year. The protocol needs to have more detail
including a more complete rationale for the proposed number of animals to be used instead of just stating the
number to be used. The protocol also lists by name the student teaching labs which will be performed but there is
only a minimum description of the actual lab and procedures (mostly observational). The protocol also states that
24 hour food deprivation will occur before the laboratories, but this is not further described in the protocol and
actually may not be done. More details need to be provided as to when, how, and why food restriction is to be
done and a justification provided to be approved by the IACUC. The protocol needs to be re-written or amended
to provide these details.
To be corrected by 3-9-16.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
