2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**While reviewing facility records it was noted that the Program of Veterinary Care was not complete. Section IV,
Part E, Euthanasia indicates "humane euthanasia performed by vet", however, does not list agent that will be used.
The program of veterinary care should indicate the method of euthanasia to be used. The program of veterinary
care should be updated to accurately reflect the method of humane euthanasia. Lack of a complete program of
veterinary care does not ensure that proper veterinary care is being provided in accordance with currently accepted
veterinary medical standards.
