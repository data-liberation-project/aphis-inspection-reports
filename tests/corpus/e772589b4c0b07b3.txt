INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC conducted a semiannual facility inspection and program review on January 12th, 2017. During the
facility inspection, the expired euthanasia solution was not identified. There was a discussion in the meeting
minutes asking for the QA/QC report for drug use review, but the drug logs indicating expired euthanasia solution
used on covered animals for October, November and December 2016 were not reviewed. The QA/QC process had
only been completed for October 2016, and at the time of inspection had not been completed for November 2016
through April 2017.
IACUC Semi Annual facility inspections should include all aspects of animal care and use, including the review of
expiration dates on medical materials and drugs, especially analgesics, anesthetics and euthanasia drugs.
Correct for all future IACUC inspections.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During inspection, the emergency euthanasia syringes in the Guinea Pig room were found to be expired, from Sep
2016. The facility had recently ordered and received a new bottle of euthanasia solution and had labeled the old
bottle of euthanasia solution as expired (September 2016). A review of the controlled drug log indicated that the
expired euthanasia solution was used on approximately 20 guinea pigs from October 2016 to April 2017. The
euthanasia SOP was reviewed - the animals are all confirmed to be deceased as part of the protocol, but the
protocol does not require that the expiration date of the euthanasia solution be confirmed prior to use.
Guidance from a veterinarian and the use of appropriate methods to treat animals are crucial components of
veterinary care and are necessary to avoid and minimize pain and distress in animals. Utilizing expired euthanasia,
analgesia or anesthetic drugs is considered inadequate veterinary care.
Identified and corrected by facility prior to inspection.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
