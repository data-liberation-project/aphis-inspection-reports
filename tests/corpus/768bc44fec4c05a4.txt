Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee is storing a bottle of Dexamethasone Injection on a shelf in the large whelping building. The temperature in
the area the bottle is stored in is 91 degrees F according to the inspector’s Kestrel. The instructions on the label state that
Dexamethasone should be stored between 68 degrees and 77 degrees F. Failure to store medical products at proper
temperatures may compromise their ability to be effective and the health of the animal may suffer.
Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee
must store the Dexamethasone and all other medical products at the required temperatures at all times.

Male Shih tzu (#477) has excessively overgrown toenails on the front feet. When the dog stands on a solid surface the
toenails splay out sideways across the flooring and the toenails have developed a severe curve. Overgrown toenails
could cause pain and discomfort as well as affect the dog’s natural gait.
Each dealer must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease and injuries. The licensee
must trim the dog’s toenails to an appropriate length and ensure the toenails of all dogs are kept at a proper length at all
times.

Handling of animals.
Numerous adult dogs and puppies located throughout the facility are showing signs of heat stress including:
At least 12 adult Cavalier spaniels are housed outdoors. All the dogs were exhibiting signs of heat stress such as open
mouth breathing, high respiration rates, and tongues extending out of the mouth beyond the teeth. Several of the dogs
had a raspy sound associated with their breathing.
In both the sheltered housing building and the large whelping building the majority of puppies under the age of 7 weeks
were observed showing signs of heat stress such as open mouth breathing, high respiration rates, and tongues extended
out of the mouths. Puppies were also observed spread out across the enclosure floor with their legs sprawled out.
In an outdoor enclosure containing approximately 8 dogs, the dogs were showing signs of stress from the heat and 4
dogs were observed lying down in a muddy area where there is an accumulation of liquid waste that overflows or leaks
from a drainpipe running parallel to the enclosure. This muddy area is also in the shade, so the dogs were sitting in the
waste as they sought relief from the extreme temperatures. These dogs, soiled with contaminated mud, are at increased
risk of disease.
The temperatures taken throughout the facility by the inspectors Kestrel ranged from 91-97 degrees F with a heat index
up to 125 degrees F. On the day of the inspection, The National Weather Service had issued a heat advisory for the
area.
Heat stress can be detrimental to the health and well-being of the animals and can even result in death.
When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to
alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity,
and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must alter the temperature to a level that is
comfortable for the dogs. The licensee must ensure the dogs are maintained in appropriate climatic conditions at all times.

Housing facilities, general.
The waste from the sheltered housing building is run through a pipe that lays on top of the ground and runs alongside of
an outdoor dog enclosure. Liquid waste is flowing from the pipe and through the dog enclosure, containing
approximately 8 dogs, and the dogs were observed lying down in the waste. The areas near the liquid waste are covered
in a green algae and there is a large amount of mud around the stream of waste. It is thought that the pipe may be
leaking or that waste overflows the pipe where it leaves the building. Drainage of waste through the dog enclosure may
allow the dogs to become contaminated and increase the risk of disease.
The pipe leading from the septic system of the house is dumping wastewater down a slope that is causing the water to
pool in one corner of an outdoor enclosure containing approximately 9 Bernese Mountain dogs. The dogs can come into
direct contact with this pool of standing water. The stream of waste running down the slope is located near the fencing of
the enclosure and has a created a large amount of mud containing green algae. Numerous wasps were seen landing on
the wet, muddy areas near the dog enclosure.
Housing facilities must dispose of animal and food waste, water and other fluids in a manner that minimizes contamination
and disease risk. Drainage systems must minimize pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All drains must
be properly constructed, installed and maintained. The licensee must alter the drainpipes in a manner that eliminates the
waste from entering the dog enclosures and keeps the areas around the dog enclosures free of waste material. The
licensee must ensure that all drains are working properly at all times.
3.6(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
Two puppies are located in the basement under the house and are contained in enclosures constructed of coated wire.
One puppy does not have 6 inches of space between the top of his head and the top of the enclosure when in a normal
standing position. The inspectors used a tape measure to determine that the puppy had only approximately 2.5 inches of


space between the top of its head and the top of the enclosure. Failure to provide appropriate head space could limit the
puppy’s freedom of movement which could have a negative impact on its health and well-being.
The interior height of a primary enclosure must be at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the
enclosure when it is in a normal standing position. The licensee must provide the puppy with 6 inches of space between
the top of it’s head and the top of the enclosure in order to support its health and well-being. The licensee must ensure
that all dogs are housed in primary enclosures which are compliant at all times.

Feeding
In one outdoor enclosure, containing 4 adult dogs, the licensee has attached a hose that is spraying water into the air to
help cool the dogs. The water is spraying into the metal self-feeder that is attached to the fence and has the protective
push door open. The food in the feeder has become fully saturated and soggy and the feed scattered on the ground is
also saturated and soggy. Dog food soaked in water may cause the food to deteriorate or become moldy, caked and
unpalatable.
Food receptacles must be located so as to minimize contamination. Measures must be taken to prevent molding, caking
and deterioration of the feed. The licensee must locate this metal feeder in an area of the enclosure that will eliminate the
risk of the feed getting wet by the water from the hose. The licensee must ensure that all food for the dogs is protected
from contamination at all times.
To be corrected by: The licensee moved the feeder to a dry and removed the contaminated feed at the time of the
inspection.

Watering


At least 14 dogs contained in outdoor housing have non potable water in their water receptacles. The water is a brown
color and has a layer of sediment built up on the inside of the receptacle. Dogs were observed to be standing and digging
in the water receptacles and dogs were observed drinking the non potable water. The temperature in the outdoor area
was at least 94 degrees F with a heat index up to 125 degrees F according to the inspectors Kestrel. A heat advisory
issued by the National Weather Service was in affect for the area.
Failure to provide potable water could have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the dogs.
Potable water must be continuously available to the dogs. The licensee must provide potable water to the dogs and
ensure they have access to potable water at all times.
3.13(b)(2) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
A Samoyed puppy was under a treatment plan from a licensed veterinarian, but there is no documentation of the
treatment plan.
Female Shih tzu #389 and female Shih tzu #479 have both received treatment for medical conditions. The only
documentation indicating these dogs have received treatment is a written statement that says “Shih tzu 389 +479 were
treated 7-28-21. There is no documentation of the actual medical problem for either dog, or for the treatment that was
provided.
Failure to fully document medical conditions and treatment plans does not allow APHIS officials to ensure the animals are
receiving adequate veterinary care.
Each dealer shall keep copies of medical records which include the description of the condition, examination findings,
treatments provided, and procedures performed. The licensee must ensure that all medical issues are documented and
all medical records are complete and contain all required information.
