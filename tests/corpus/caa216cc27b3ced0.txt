treat diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed. The animals may experience pain and
distress due to unrelieved symptoms or unexpected side effects from the use of expired medications. The program for
providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries. This includes establishing and following procedures to ensure expired medications are not
administered to animals.
