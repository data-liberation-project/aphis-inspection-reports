2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
27 animals were found in need of veterinary care at the time of inspection. This includes:
1. One male, albino skunk is observed holding up the right front foot. This animal is non-weight bearing at a walk
and only occasionally puts weight on the foot when standing still. When removed from the cage, the outer two
digits of the right front foot are very swollen and there is a rough scab on the edge of the foot above the last digit.
This skunk(cid:25)s ration of food remains un-eaten on top of its enclosure. Swelling of limbs such as this can result from
trauma, infection and a variety of medical problems and can be painful. The lack of appetite supports the likely
possibility of pain and can also be present with infection and other medical problems.
2. One female, black and white skunk has a significant swelling on the bottom of the right hind foot extending just
above the toes. There is a firm swollen area on the bottom of the foot that is approximately 2cm x 3 cm and is warm
to the touch. The skin on the bottom of the foot has broken open exposing red tissue and a thick, yellow discharge.
Problems such as this can result from trauma, infection and other medical problems and can be significantly painful.
3. One female, light sable ferret is observed squinting her right eye. There is a clear discharge in the fur around her
eyelids and a small cloudy area with a red outline on the surface of the eye (cornea). Eye problems can be a result
of trauma, infection, and other medical problems and can be painful.
4. One dark sable, male ferret is observed to be sneezing. This ferret has yellow discharge around his nostrils.
Respiratory problems can result from infections, environmental conditions, and other medical problems. Without
treatment these may progress and lead to unnecessary suffering.
5. One cinnamon colored raccoon in cage 204 has a pile of partially formed feces mixed with bright red bloody fluid
under its enclosure. This animal(cid:25)'s ration of food remains un-eaten on top of its enclosure. Diarrhea and loss of
appetite can result from a variety of medical problems.
6. One dark sable ferret has a firm swelling under the right side of its jaw and extends into the neck approximately3cm x 3cm. Swelling such as this in a ferret can result from problems such as infection, trauma, dental disease,
cancer and other medical problems and can be painful.
7. One sable, male ferret has a large area of moist, red skin over the shoulders and center of the back
approximately 2in x 1 in. Dark crusts and hair loss are also present. Skin problems can result from trauma, infection,
and a variety of other medical problems and can be painful.
8. One silver, white ferret has hair loss on the margins of his ears. The exposed skin is dark in color and thickened
along the entire edge of both ears. Skin problems and hair loss can result from parasites, trauma, infection, and
other medical problems.
9. One sable, female ferret has an abnormality with her right eye. The eyeball is not visible and there is a small
amount of brown staining around the uneven eyelids. One of the eyelids has a fleshy mass that gives the
appearance of a furry growth in place of the eye. The causes of this could range from simply not having an eyeball
to having the eyeball obscured by infection, trauma, etc. Veterinary examination and diagnosis are necessary to
determine the appropriate treatment plan.
10. One sable, female ferret has an irregular edge where the pinnae (ear flap) appears to be missing. There is a
dark discharge in the ear canal. Ear problems such as this can be caused from trauma, infection, and other
problems and can be painful.
11-17. There are 7 ferrets with a white opacity or color visible in one or both eyes. It is possible that this could be
chronic condition such as cataract formation but other medical problems cannot be ruled out without a veterinary
exam. The licensee stated that the attending veterinarian has examined some of the ferrets for eye problems but
was unable to provide documentation and could not identify which animals had been evaluated. The licensee must
provide documentation regarding medical conditions including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution. In the case
of chronic, ongoing conditions, documentation should include symptoms or changes that indication re-evaluation of
the condition is required.
18-27. There are at least 10 ferrets that have a clear discharge or dried discharge around the eyes. All of these
animals were housed in the indoor buildings. Ocular discharge can be caused by both environmental factors and
medical problems, and can indicate discomfort.

The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
*** At least 50 percent of the raccoons are exhibiting abnormal repetitive (stereotypic) behaviors at the time ofinspection. These animals were each moving with varying patterns, but the pattern shown is consistent for each
affected animals. The patterns expressed included:
- Several raccoons were observed pacing. These animals were consistently quickly walking several steps,
turning, and returning to the starting location. Generally, effected animals were consistently pacing along one
enclosure wall although a few did turn and begin pacing at the opposite end of the enclosure when approached.
This pacing behavior was exhibited consistently when observed for several minutes, and the path was generally
only altered when another animal interfered or it was otherwise interrupted by noise or approaching.
- Several raccoons were observed weaving / bobbing. These animals were observed quickly shifting weight from
one hind foot to the other while reaching with the forelimbs from one side to the other. Occasionally this was also
seen in combination with movement of the head up and down. Generally this motion was facing outwards from the
enclosure and several animals were observed rubbing their heads on the enclosure wires while preforming this
motion. A few animals had areas of hair loss on the head which corresponded to the areas that they were rubbing
on the wires as they repeated this behavior. This includes a dark color male raccoon in enclosure number 285 that
has hair loss on the head over the right eye. The skin central to this hair loss has a central area that appears
red-brown consistent with an abrasion. A male raccoon in enclosure 288 was observed weaving and also has
areas of hair loss over both eyes, though the underlying skin appears normal on this animal.
- Several raccoons were observed wall walking. This behavior was often observed in conjunction with pacing, and
animals were observed quickly walking along the kennel and then turning by partially extending their hind legs and
walking their front end up the wall of the enclosure. The extension of the hind limbs is limited by the enclosure
height (18in per the licensee).

Several individual animals were observed for 5-10 minutes each and the behavior continued generally without
significant variation, though some animals shortened strides moving from pacing into weaving as time progressed.
Animals continued these behaviors until interrupted such as by another animal entering their path or by noise.
Raccoons were observed both cage-side and from a distance and were seen exhibiting these behaviors well before
approached by inspectors or the licensee. These abnormal behaviors also continued for the entire duration that
inspectors were in the building, even once they had left the immediate area of the particular enclosure. When asked
about the behaviors, the licensee stated (cid:24)that is what raccoons do(cid:25). Abnormal repetitive behaviors, often called
stereotypies, can develop in response to many stressors including: lack of total space, lack of the ability to hide
from other individuals or humans, overcrowding, incompatibility of animals, and over or under stimulation in their
environment. Because these behaviors often develop in response to distress, they are important indicators of
behavioral ill-health and require veterinary intervention to properly diagnosis the most likely causes and prevent
farther deterioration by providing an appropriate treatment plan to address the stressor as well as the abnormal
behavior. Correct by having the raccoons evaluated by the attending veterinarian for diagnosis of the cause of
these behaviors and development of an appropriate treatment plan to address this issue. Written documentation
the Attending Veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations regarding alterations to cage space, provisions of hide areas,
enrichment, and any other steps necessary to address this abnormality shall be maintained by the licensee for
review by APHIS Officials. Additionally, the licensee shall maintain documentation of the implementation of theserecommendations for review.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several enclosures are in disrepair. There are at least 15 ferret enclosures with broken wires and nails that
protrude into the enclosures. Sharp, protruding metal points can cause injury to the animals. Two wooden nesting
boxes being used by ferrets are in disrepair. There are chewed and worn areas along the bottom half of the boxes
that are creating openings large enough the ferrets could escape. The licensee must ensure that all housing
facilities be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an excessive accumulation of fresh and old excreta beneath the enclosures located in both ferret buildings
(worst in the east shed). Under the enclosures along the wall there are numerous live maggots, fly pupa, and
hatched pupa casing present in the piles of excreta. Pupa casings are also present under the cages not currently in
use and there are a large number of flies in the facility. There is a significant accumulation of hair, organic matter,
and other debris along the cage supports in both ferret buildings. There is also an accumulation of dried raccoon
and cat feces on the floor along the southeast corner of the building. The dirt flooring in the raccoon building has an
excessive buildup of fresh and old excreta that has a white moldy appearance beneath and around the enclosures
being used.

Excessive accumulations of animal waste in the housing area can lead to poor air quality, disease hazards and pest
infestations. Poor air quality is linked to the development of health problems and many fumes, such as ammonia,
can cause discomfort to animals and can lead to conditions such as respiratory and eye abnormalities. The
licensee must remove animal and food wastes as often as necessary to minimize the odors, vermin, and disease
hazards for the health and well being of the animals.

3.127(b) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. There are two ferrets located in two separate enclosures of the outdoor housing facility that are consistently
shivering. The wooden nesting boxes contain little to no bedding material. The ambient temperature recorded at the
time of inspection was 40 degrees F using a Kestrel. The temperature inside the nesting box was 46 degrees F
using a Raytek MiniTemp MT6 . According to the National Weather Service, the forecast for the low temperature
tonight is 31 degrees F. Not having adequate shelter does not ensure the ferrets can maintain a safe body
temperature and conserve body heat. The licensee must ensure that adequate shelter appropriate for the local
climactic conditions for the species is provided by natural or artificial means. Correct by providing an appropriate
shelter by moving the affected animals, adding supplemental heat source, and / or adding a sufficient amount of
bedding to prevent discomfort to the animals during inclement weather.

3.128 DIRECT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The enclosures for the raccoons do not provide adequate space. According to the licensee, the largest raccoon
enclosures are 30in x 57in and 18in tall. These enclosures housed an average of 3-4 adult raccoons in breeding
groups. Smaller enclosures were 24in x 57in and 18in tall typically housing 2-3 adults and approximately 30in x 30
in and 18in tall housing 1 adult raccoon. These enclosures are not tall enough to allow a raccoon to sit up on its
haunches or stand on its hind legs both of which are normal postural adjustments for raccoons. Additionally, these
enclosures are all one level which does not allow for climbing or other species-typic behaviors. During the
inspection raccoons were observed sniffing at the enclosure tops and turning partially on their hind legs brushing
their head or nose on the enclosure tops. Several individual raccoons have partial or complete hair loss on the tail
and abnormal, irregular chewed appearance to the hair on their sides and flanks. Additionally, approximately 50%
of the raccoons are exhibiting abnormal repetitive (stereotypic) behaviors farther supporting the inadequacy of
space for these animals. Enclosures must be constructed and maintained to provide sufficient space to allow each
animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Correct by enlarging
or modifying these enclosures to meet these needs.

3.131 REPEAT
SANITATION.
There is a wooden nesting box being used by a striped skunk that has a buildup of wet excreta covering the entire
floor surface located in the outdoor housing area. Two wooden shelters being used by four foxes have an excessive
accumulation of excreta and soiled bedding covering most of the floor surface. Excessive excreta in primary enclosures can contribute to odors, insects and other pests, and can play a role in
disease transmission. Additionally, the presence of wet bedding and excreta decreases the effectiveness at
providing shelter from the elements and may make animals less likely to use these when needed. No other shelter
is provided to these animals in this area. The licensee must ensure that excreta be removed as often as necessary
to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
