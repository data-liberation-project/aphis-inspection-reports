Sanitation.
In two enclosures, housing one hedgehog each, the wheels have excessive fecal material on the inside.
One bat enclosure housing approximately 10 bats has excessive fecal material staining the walls and climbing racks. The
build-up is worse behind the racks which is approximately 2ft x 8ft.
The outdoor goat enclosure, housing 4 goats, has two shelters. The entrance to one shelter has a significant fecal build-
up in front. The goats cannot enter this shelter without having to step through feces. The second shelter has a significant
build-up on the inside of the shelter.
Fecal material shall be removed from the primary enclosure as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals, minimize disease hazards, and to reduce odors. Licensees must clean frequent enough to maintain an adequate
level of husbandry to keep the animals healthy.

Facilities, outdoor.
There is no perimeter fence surrounding the primary enclosure for two dingoes. A perimeter fence is required for all
outdoor housing facilities that must be of sufficient height, 6’ minimum, to keep animals and unauthorized person out, and


to be used as secondary containment in the case of escape from the primary enclosure.
The licensee must finish construction on the current perimeter fence or request approval for a variance from the
Administrator.
