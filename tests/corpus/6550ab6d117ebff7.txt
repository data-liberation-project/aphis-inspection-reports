2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A dog, number 5223, was found during inspection with a circular wound, about the size of a quarter, along the lateral
aspect of the left rear tarsus. The wound was inflamed, thickened with hair loss, and slightly ulcerated. The animal was
not under any form of treatment for the condition, the attending veterinarian (AV) was unaware of the issue for this animal,
and daily observations had already been performed. There were no other apparent findings. Daily observations serve as a
key function in assessing the health and well-being of the animals. As such, when conditions go unnoticed, it contributes
to worsening of said condition and further discomfort and stress for that animal. The facility must establish and maintain
adequate programs of veterinary care that include daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being.
Furthermore, if daily observations are performed by someone other than the attending veterinarian, a mechanism of direct
and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior,
and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. The animals’ ID number was recorded after the findings to notify
the AV.
