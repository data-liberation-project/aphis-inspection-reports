2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male Boston terrier with microchip ending in 0711 is not being provided with appropriate veterinary care. This dog's left
eye is red with large blood vessels present in the white of the eye, and on the surface of the eye over the iris there is a
~2mm-diameter black nodule with blue cloudy discoloration of the remainder of the eye. There is no ocular discharge and
the dog is not squinting, but the eye does appear smaller than the opposite eye. This dog was seen and diagnosed with a
corneal ulcer by the veterinarian and prescribed an ophthalmic ointment on 19 January 2022. The veterinary record says
to have the eye re-checked 7 days from that time if not resolved. No additional medical records were available at the
facility, so the inspector contacted the veterinarian to ask about follow-up. The veterinarian said they had not re-examined
this dog, and given a description of the eye's current appearance, they are not satisfied with the current treatment and
would like to re-evaluate and pursue further diagnostics and/or treatments.

Follow-up care such as status updates, re-examination, and further diagnostic and treatment methods are part of
providing adequate veterinary care. Even though treatment was initially given as prescribed, the amount of time elapsed
since the veterinarian wanted to re-check the eye if not resolved is inappropriate and not consistent with adequate
veterinary care given the dog's current condition. Correct this by ensuring appropriate methods are used to diagnose and


treat diseases & injuries as they occur through to their resolution, including re-examination and follow-up care as
prescribed by the veterinarian in the case of longer-lasting conditions.
