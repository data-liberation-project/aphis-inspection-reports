ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A female Maltese (#098*333*071) had fecal material and bedding debris matted in the fur under her tail and rear
legs. According to the licensee, this condition was due to changing the food a couple of days ago. Matted fecal
material can be uncomfortable and can increase the risk of skin sores. The licensee must ensure this dog's fur
under the tail is cleaned and groomed from the matted fecal material. The licensee must establish an appropriate
grooming schedule for all dogs. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all
times. TO BE CORRECTED BY: April 22, 2015.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***There were at least 5 water receptacles, including stainless steel and rubber receptacles, which had an
accumulation of a dark green algae-like growth on the inside surfaces. Water receptacles which are not properly
cleaned or sanitized can harbor disease-causing organisms. The licensee must ensure that all water receptacles
are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris,
food waste and other disease hazards.
