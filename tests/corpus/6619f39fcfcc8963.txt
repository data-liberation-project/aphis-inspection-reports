Cleaning of Enclosures
In the sugar glider room, the first enclosure to the left, there is an accumulation of feces inside the enclosure on top
of a wooden box that is used as a perch that contains two sugar gliders. Excreta should be removed as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained and reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The
cleaning schedule of this enclosure should be more timely and effective to prevent the build-up of excreta.To be corrected by August 14, 2014
