ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
* There was one female Java Macaque housed in an enclosure by herself. Her enclosure had two large PVC tube
type structures fixed to the side walls to serve as perches. The enclosure contained no other enrichment items. The
licensee's environmental enhancement plan directed by the attending veterinarian states that the licensee "will
provide several different enrichment toys and psychologically enriching items rotated on a weekly basis" for any
individuals alone in an enclosure.
** Environmental enhancement plans should be followed as directed by the attending veterinarian to promote the
psychological well-being of nonhuman primates.
*** The licensee must follow the environmental enhancement plan as directed by the attending veterinarian. TO BE

SANITATION.
* There was one enclosure housing two kinkajous which had urine and feces piled and/or smeared throughout most
of the floor. There was only one small area, approximately 1 foot in diameter, which was void of waste material.
Therefore the animals could not move about freely in their enclosure without becoming contaminated by the waste
material.
** Excreta which comes in contact with the animals poses a health risk for them.
*** The licensee must remove excreta from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of
the animals and to minimize disease hazards. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 19 February 2014.
The inspection and an exit interview were conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
