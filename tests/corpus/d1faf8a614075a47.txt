2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Yorkshire terrier (tag #156) has an abnormal appearance to the right eye. There is a circular shaped white,
glassy area located in the center of the right eye. The licensee stated the dog has not been evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian for the condition of the eye. Abnormal eye conditions could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment
plan. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.6(a)(2)(x)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In one enclosure, containing one adult female dog and two puppies, the flooring is constructed of wire. The
inspector observed the front legs and hind legs of at least one puppy fall through the openings in the wire flooring
numerous times. Openings in flooring that are large enough for the feet and legs to pass through could cause injury
to the foot and leg or result in entrapment of the puppy.
Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from
injury and does not allow the dogs' feet and legs to pass through any openings in the floor. The licensee must alter
the flooring in a manner that does not allow the feet and legs of the puppies to pass through the openings. The
licensee must ensure that the flooring of the enclosures is safe for the dogs at all times.
At the time of the inspection the licensee moved the adult and puppies to an enclosure with smaller openings in the
floor and the puppies were placed within a solid floored whelping box. (cid:9)
