2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The licensee allows the public (under direct supervision) to feed the panthers using a feeding stick with a flat edge.
This type of edge does not minimize the risk of injury to the cats as they are being fed.
The use of feeding tongs is recommended for this type of public feeding to minimize the risk of injury. You may also
modify the end of the current feeding stick (or other modifications or implements) to minimize potential injury during
the feeding interactions.

3.129(b)
FEEDING.
The feeding stick that is being used by the public to feed the panthers has accumulations of old, dried, crusty
remnants of meat around the top and bottom of the raised orange marker on the stick. There were live weevils in
the omnivore feed receptacle. Both of the deer feed troughs also had accumulations of old, dried, white, avian fecal
droppings.
These conditions do not minimize contamination of the food by bacteria &/or parasites which can potentially harm
the animals.
All food receptacles and implements shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times.
