FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is no perimeter fence surrounding the male Patagonian cavy enclosure. The male Patagonian cavy has been
moved into an outdoor enclosure since the last inspection. Perimeter fences prevent unauthorized persons and
animals from contacting the animal(s) contained within. Perimeter fences also provide a secondary containment
system if the animal(s) escape.
A perimeter fence measuring at least six feet in height and at least three feet from the enclosure must be erected.
