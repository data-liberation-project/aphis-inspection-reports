MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling. During the weekend of July 19th 2014, an investigator had begun to train several bats and separated
them from the main housing area to individual wire mesh enclosures within the bat housing room. Those
enclosures had not been used in several months. Neither the animal care staff nor were other laboratory members
informed of the change in housing for those animals therefore the animals were not fed over the weekend. Upon
their discovery, the animal care staff initiated treatment yet 3 died. The facility has instituted a plan of correction to
prevent further recurrence.
This item has been addressed and was a self-reported incident to the USDA by the facility.
The inspection was conducted on July 21-22nd 2014 followed by an exit briefing with the Program Director on July
22, 2014.
