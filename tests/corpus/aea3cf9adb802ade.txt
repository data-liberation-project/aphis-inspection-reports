ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At time of inspection a female Golden Retriever, housed in an outdoor enclosure with two other dogs (identification
unknown), was observed to be thin. Upon closer examination, the dog's waist was extremely tucked and the ribs,
spine and hip bones were very prominent. The gums of the dog were noted to be white with no capillary refill time
when pressed. At that time, I stopped the inspection and requested that the dog be taken to a licensed veterinarian
for examination immediately. An extremely thin body condition, if left untreated, can adversely affect the health and
well-being of the dog. Additionally, the dog may not be able to handle weather extremes due to her condition. Lastly,
the white gums may signify a serious medical condition.
*The dog was not currently undergoing treatment for the condition.
* The dog has constant and unfettered access to two self feeders that were full of dog food.
*The licensee took the dog a licensed veterinarian immediately for an examination.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Licensee.
*This was not a full and complete inspection due to a veterinary care issue noted at the beginning of the inspection.
