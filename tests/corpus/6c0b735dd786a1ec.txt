3.127(d) Critical

Facilities, outdoor.
On November 20, 2020 16 javelinas escaped their primary enclosure and two dug under the perimeter fence. Prior to
escaping, the javelinas were placed on a pen adjacent to their primary enclosure for extra browse. The adjacent pen's
gate did not latched well and they were able to push their way through the gate, into a pen that did not have a dig barrier,
and the javelinas were able to dug under the fence. The employees were able to find the javelinas and heard them back
to their primary enclosure, but two were unaccounted for. Once out, the two javelinas unaccounted for, were able to dig
under the perimeter fence and escaped. Of the two, one javelina was found on the same day and returned to the primary
enclosure. The remaining javelina was found and returned to the facility the next day November, 21, 2020. Animals that
escaped a perimeter fence can be severely injured and even death. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the
animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact
with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the
facility.
