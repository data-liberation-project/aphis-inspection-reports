FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Where the santa cruz sheep are housed there are sharp wire points pointing into the southwest corner. The facility
had covered these points in the past with a black drain tile, however the cover has come off. Sharp points can
injure animals. To safely contain the animals, the facility must maintain enclosures free from sharp points.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-The rectangular raccoon enclosure had an excessive amount of soiled food waste and animal waste underneath it.
It had odors and a large amount of flies on the waste and some flies that would come up into the enclosure. The
large number of flies and strong odors increase risk for diseases in the animals. The licensee said that it is not
regularly cleaned underneath because it cannot easily be moved. To protect the health and well being of the
raccoons, the food and animal waste underneath this enclosure must be removed often enough to minimize flies
and odors.
-The indoor area across from where the serval and bobcat are has feeder rats with excessively soiled enclosures.
The rat enclosures have strong odors coming from them and an excessive amount of wet feces building up in them.
Th excess amount of waste in these enclosures and the odors coming from them is causing a disease hazard for
the bobcat and serval. The facility must ensure that the feeder rat enclosures are maintained clean and sanitary to
protect the serval and bobcat from excessive odors and disease hazards.

SANITATION.
There were excessive feces in half of the llama shelter. A portion of the feces are discolored, indicating they have
not been removed in some time. Feces produce odors and attract flies.

SANITATION.
Dense swarms of flies are located in and around the enclosure containing five North American brown bears. The
largest pockets of flies were concentrated in the den where the are bears fed, on water melon rinds adjacent to the
enclosure den and within the enclosure, and the area directly behind their enclosure. Some provisions for fly control
were located behind the enclosure, however; they are not effectively controlling the population of flies.
Several flies were observed on the fallow deer. The flies were located on the animal's abdomen, legs, and head.
There were no provisions for fly control in or around this area during the time of inspection.
An abundance of flies are present on the west side of the enclosure containing five skunks. The flies are
concentrated around the soiled, wet area adjacent to the skunks' water receptacle. There were no provisions for fly
control in or around this area during the time of inspection
A swarm of flies is present on and around the watermelon rind within the capybara enclosure. The flies were seen
swarming every time the animal walked past the watermelon rind. There were no provisions for fly control in or
around this area during the time of inspection
Flies can agitate the animals and spread disease.
Implement/increase provisions to effectively control the fly population at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
