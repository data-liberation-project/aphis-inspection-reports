ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two adult female fawn and white pet Chihuahuas, “Roo” and “Trixie,” temporarily housed in the Whelping Building
due to both being in heat, have toenails that need to be trimmed. The dogs’ toes are twisted, and their feet do not
have a normal shape while standing due to the excessive length of the nails. In addition, two adult dachshunds in
the Sheltered Building have toenails that need trimming.
Toenails that are too long can affect the dogs’ gait, be uncomfortable or painful, and could cause injury.
The licensee must ensure that as part of the program of veterinary care, dogs are groomed and toenails are
trimmed as often as needed. The licensee must follow the facility’s veterinary care plan at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In between two runs in the North Pens, approximately one-third of a metal divider panel is excessively rusted at the
bottom, and is rusted through in an area at least ten inches long. At least one other divider is also rusted at the
bottom.
Excessive rust prevents proper cleaning and sanitization, causing possible disease hazards, and can affect
structural strength.
The licensee must repair the rusted areas or replace the panel. The licensee must create and follow a program of
maintenance to ensure that all surfaces are free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and
sanitization, and affects the structural strength, as part of the facility’s regular plan.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One run in the South Pens has a mangled, torn metal water bowl with exposed, sharp edges. In the North Pens,
another metal water bowl has a bent and folded area, also with a sharp edge. In the Whelping Building, a plastic
self-feeder has a corner with metal trim that is twisted and broken with sharp points and edges.
Sharp edges and points create an injury hazard to the dogs.
The licensee must remove, replace, or repair any sharp points or edges from all enclosures. The licensee must
create and follow a program of maintenance to ensure all surfaces to which the animals are exposed are free of
sharp points or jagged edges as part of the facility’s regular plan.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one run in the South Pens, a plastic food bowl is chewed and roughened on the edge, and in another, a plastic
panel near the front of one doghouse is also chewed and roughened. In addition, a doghouse in the first run on the
left in the West Pens is chewed on the top section of the entrance.
Chewed and roughened surfaces are difficult to properly clean and sanitize, creating disease hazards.
These surfaces must be repaired or replaced to ensure proper cleaning and sanitization. The licensee must
develop and follow a regular maintenance program that ensures all surfaces including houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, are repaired or
replaced when worn or soiled as part of the facility’s regular plan.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the Sheltered Building, most enclosures have dirt and grime in the corners and on the walls, and there is
grime and uneaten food in the wash-down gutters. Although the water pipes to this building had been frozen forapproximately one week according to a facility representative, other methods could have been used to clean these
enclosures. In the outdoor portion of the building, there are several pens with excessive fecal material in and on the
floor grates. In the outdoor housing area pens, many of the runs have an excessive amount of fecal material, some
to the point that the dogs could have a difficult time avoiding contact with the excreta. In the last run on the right in
the West Pens, there were no visible piles at all, indicating excreta may have been mixed and ground into the
substrate. In addition, in the Whelping Building, two enclosures have rubber mats that have an extreme amount of
dirt and grime ground into them, and one has hair adhered to the grime. A facility representative stated that it had
been about a week since everything was cleaned thoroughly, and the runs were raked.
Dirt, grime, and fecal buildup create disease hazards.
The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces and all other surfaces to which the dogs are exposed are
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with subpart 3.11 (b) to prevent the accumulation of excreta and
reduce disease hazards. Floors made of dirt, sand, gravel, or other similar materials must be raked or spot-cleaned
with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Most of the dogs housed outdoors had little to no bedding in their doghouses at the time of inspection. Although
there was evidence of some bedding in the runs indicating the dogs had pulled it out of the doghouses, it had not
been replaced with fresh bedding. The temperature at the time of inspection was approximately 34 degrees
Fahrenheit, and the minimum temperature recorded in the region on the day of inspection was 23 degrees
Fahrenheit, according to wunderground.com. Although the dogs housed outdoors are breeds that tolerate low
temperatures well, and the inspectors did not see evidence of cold stress during the inspection, bedding still must
be present in all outdoor housing shelters. Bedding was provided to the dogs at the time of inspection.
Having little or no bedding in low temperatures can cause major stress and discomfort, and affect the health and
well-being of the animals.
The licensee must continuously monitor the temperature to ensure that all dogs are provided with clean, dry,
bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and ensure additional clean, dry
bedding is provided when the temperature is 35 degrees or lower.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In two runs in the North Pens, the wire mesh under the substrate is exposed in an area approximately one square
foot in one run, and in a smaller area in the other run, creating holes where the dogs had dug underneath the wire.
The two dogs in the run with the larger holes were moved to another run at the time of inspection. In addition, near
the back of the fifth run from the right in the South Pens, there is a section approximately two feet square of
exposed wire mesh.
These holes can be an injury hazard to the dogs if they get a foot or leg caught in the wire mesh.
The licensee must fill these and any other holes with enough substrate so the wire mesh does not create a hazard
to the animals. The licensee must continually monitor all enclosures to ensure they are structurally sound and
protect the dogs from injury as part of the facility’s maintenance plan.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Rodent droppings are present inside the Sheltered Building and in two water bowls in the outdoor enclosures of the
building. The presence of droppings in the water bowls was corrected at the time of inspection. There is a bird nest
on each side above the upper enclosures in the outdoor portion of this building. Although no dogs were present in
the upper enclosures at the time of inspection, they were present in the lower enclosures. In addition, there is what
appears to be a rodent hole in one run in the North Pens.
Pests and vermin create disease hazards to the dogs.
The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of insects, external parasites, and bird
and mammal pests, to promote the health and well-being of the animals and to reduce contamination by pests in all
animal areas as part of the facility’s regular plan.
