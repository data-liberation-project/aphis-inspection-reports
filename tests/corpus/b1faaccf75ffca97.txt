3.58(a)
CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
Section 3.58(a) Classification and separation: Three rabbits were housed in the same enclosure with chickens and
geese. Poultry excrement may contain bacteria and parasites than may cause the rabbits to be come ill. The
poultry were moved from the enclosure during the inspection. Rabbits must not be housed in the same primary
enclosure with any other species of animals for the health of the rabbits.
Correct from this day forward.
3.75(b) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.75(b) Condition and site: The room housing a marmoset, a bushbaby and a ring-tailed lemur has torn floor
linoleum by the door and the right corner. The torn floor linoleum allows debris to accumulate and the floor can not
be adequately cleaned. A mat was placed over the area with no linoleum by the door, but debris still accumulates
under the mat where there is no linoleum. Debris can also go under the linoleum where it is torn or missing. The
linoleum on the floor must be repaired and the floor cleaned as part of the proper husbandry practices to keep the
animals in a healthy environment.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(b) Shelter from inclement weather: The wood shelter in the enclosure housing seven pigs is in
disrepair and will not provide adequate protection from precipitation and wind. The front of the shelter is missing the
top panel to the left of the door. The left front vertical strip over the panels is torn and detaching in the lower left
corner. On the roof of the shelter there is a section of wood fencing over a tarp. The tarp is hanging over the sides
of the shelter and could be pulled down by the pigs. The front of the shelter and the roof must be repaired to
provide the pigs with protection from inclement weather and prevent discomfort and/or injury.
Correct by November 3, 2014.
3.131(c) REPEATSANITATION.
Section 3.131(c) Housekeeping: Wood, old enclosures and miscellaneous items are still stored around outdoor
animal enclosures and perimeter fence. However, since the last inspection many items have been removed from
the premise or moved away from the animal area. The remaining clutter around the animal area provides good
hiding places for mammalian pests and prevents vegetation from being cut/trimmed around enclosure fencing.
Animals may be injured when walking through these areas to move to other enclosures or into the transport trailer.
Animal areas must be free of clutter and debris to deter pests and for the safety of the animals.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
