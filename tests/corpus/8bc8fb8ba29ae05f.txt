ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 on
15-MAR-17.There were no knowledgeable facility representatives available according to a family member. Optimal
hours for inspection were discussed.
Lack of availability renders the regulatory process impossible. Licensees must ensure that a knowledgeable facility
representative is available for inspection during regular business hours. Correct from this time forward.
