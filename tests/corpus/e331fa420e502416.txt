Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
Review of the records of auctions held in Nov. 2020, Mar. 2021, May 2021 and Sep. 2021 show multiple instances in
which animals were consigned for auction by the auction operator without the person consigning the animal being
licensed under the Animal Welfare Act.
Nov. 2020 auction: DF consigned one male porcupine (Tag 194)
Mar. 2021 auction: TF consigned five sugar glider females (Tag 103 two females, Tags 104-106 pairs) along with five
female chinchillas (Tags 107-112)
May 2021 auction: DH consigned three raccoons (Tag 508 pair, Tag 509 female), RR consigned one male wallaby (Tag
5460)
Sep. 2021 auction: MG consigned one male kinkajou (Tag 1869), KH consigned two ringtails on an expired license (Tags
1894 and 1895), SK consigned 23 hedgehogs (Tags 1581-1603)
These consigners did not hold a current, valid USDA license under the Animal Welfare Act as required to sell exotic
animals. No one time exemption was noted on file. The facility may not consign any animal from a person required to be
licensed but who does not hold a current valid unsuspended license.
