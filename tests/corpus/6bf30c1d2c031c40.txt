Primary enclosures.
In Barn 2, sharp points were protruding into 40 primary enclosures containing rabbits. Rabbit feeders are secured onto
cages with a wire holder, and in 40 enclosures, the end of the wire was protruding at eye level adjacent to the feeder.
Sharp points can injure the rabbits. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained in good repair to protect the
rabbits from injury. Correct by 2/16/23
