Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
An evaluation of IACUC records indicate that the IACUC completed a semi-annual program of humane care and use
review on 22 May 2019, 11 November 2019, 2 March 2020, and 1 September 2020. On a checklist evaluation the
program of humane care and use, the IACUC stated that the Animal Use program is acceptable in all aspects. However,
the IACUC failed to write reports of its semi-annual evaluations conducted and to submit the reports to the Institutional
Official as required under 9CFR2.31(c)(3). Thus, their program is not meeting all the requirements of title 9, chapter 1,
subchapter A-Animal Welfare which is required to be used as a basis of semi-annual evaluation. Animal welfare may be
negatively impacted if the facility’s IACUC committee is not thoroughly and effectively reviewing the facility’s Program of
Animal Care and Use.
2.31(c)(3) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
An evaluation of IACUC records indicate that the IACUC completed semi-annual facility inspections and program of
humane care and use reviews on 22 May 2019, 11 November 2019, 2 March 2020, and 1 September 2020. However, the
IACUC did not prepare and submit to the Institutional Official the required reports of the evaluations it conducted on those
dates. The IACUC records reviewed showed that the IACUC identified multiple deficiencies during the semi-annual facility


inspections it conducted including holes in the yard, outdoor housing needing repairs, broken doors, paint chipping in
runs, and a back door needing repair. However, a lack of completing the required evaluation reports means that the
IACUC members failed to distinguish these deficiencies as significant or minor and failed to document a reasonable and
specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting these deficiencies. Failure to continuously provide complete and
thorough semiannual reports to the Institutional Official hinders the facility’s ability to adequately address animal welfare
concerns appropriately.
2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
An evaluation of IACUC records show that the Palatability, Boarding and Zinpro Skin and Coat protocols have PP, an
individual who is no longer associated with the facility, listed as Program Manager/Principal Investigator. Another
individual, JP, has been designated as the facility’s Program Manager. The IACUC did not review and approve this
change. A change in the Principal Investigator of a protocol is considered a significant change to a protocol. The IACUC
must conduct a review of all significant changes to a protocol in order to determine that the proposed animal activities and
personnel changes are in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act Regulations. The IACUC must review and approve,
require modifications in (to secure approval) or withhold approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and
use of animals in all ongoing protocols.
2.35(a)(1)

Recordkeeping requirements.
The meeting minutes available for review included those dated 22 May 2019, 11 November 2019, 2 March 2020, and 1
September 2020. The minutes included records of attendance and participation in the semi-annual reviews. The minutes
did not include any deliberations of the Committee. No votes on full protocol review were noted and no records of
proposed significant changes in activities involving animals. The minutes need to reflect accurately all that occurs at the


IACUC meetings to act as record for future reference. The minutes of IACUC meetings shall include records of
attendance, activities of the Committee and Committee deliberations. Correct starting with the next IACUC meeting.
2.35(b)(8)

Recordkeeping requirements.
An evaluation of facility records found that the facility is acquiring dogs from unlicensed individuals without obtaining a
certification that the animals were born and raised on that person’s premises and that the person has sold fewer than 25
dogs and/or cats that year. This certification is required to ensure that the dogs are being obtained from a legal source
and that random source dogs are not being used for research purposes. Correct from this day forward.
2.38(h)(1)

Miscellaneous.
An evaluation of facility records found dogs acquired for the purposes of research were transported by the research
facility without health certificates. Research facilities shall not transport in commerce any dog, cat or nonhuman primate
unless the animal is accompanied by a health certificate executed and issued by a license veterinarian. Failure to do so
endangers the health of the animal and poses a public health risk by not ensuring the animal is free of any infectious
disease. Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility's Program Manager.
