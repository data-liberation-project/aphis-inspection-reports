Handling of animals.
Upon inspection, two main issues were identified regarding handling that included insufficient control of animals during
public interactions and lack of adequate public barriers.

During the public interaction with the servals and the small-clawed otter, there was insufficient direct control of the
animals:
• During inspection, the female otter appeared hyperactive, incessantly moving/playing in her enclosure while constantly
vocalizing. Furthermore, when the licensee entered the enclosure with a mask on, the otter attempted to take the mask
and bit the licensee on the left forearm causing her to bleed from two significant puncture wounds. This otter
demonstrated her potential to be dangerous. Yet, during public interaction, the otter, unrestrained, is allowed free roam
and complete contact with patrons seated on a bench or on the floor in the enclosure. Per the licensee, the otter is
allowed to climb up the patrons, reaching past their shoulders to their heads. There is no direct control of this otter during
broad contact interactions as she is not physically restrained with a leash or harness and she is not trained for recall.
• The public is allowed to go into the servals’ primary enclosure, accompanied by the licensee, while both servals are
unrestrained. Neither animal has a harness or leash on, and they are not trained for recall. The patrons seated on a


bench are allowed to freely touch/interact with the male serval roaming around. Servals have the potential to be
dangerous given that they are wild predatory cats with sharp teeth and a significant bite force.
Given the potentially dangerous nature of these animals there is a high risk of injury to the public in the way the
interactions are being conducted with insufficient direct control.

Two areas were found to have insufficient public barriers:
• There was no public barrier outside the servals’ primary enclosure and the wire that made up the enclosure had gaps
large enough to allow a paw or a small hand to go through.
• Large tree trunk logs were placed in front of three enclosures containing rabies vector species. One enclosure held three
red foxes, another had four racoons, and finally, the last one contained an artic fox. The large tree trunk logs were placed
approximately 3-4 feet away from the enclosures at a height of approximately 18-20 inches but with significant breaks in
between the logs, where a patron could easily walk between them and gain access to the wire of the primary enclosures.

There was insufficient control of the animals during the public interactions and insufficient public barriers in place that did
not provide a safe environment for the public or the animals. These interactions and lack of public barriers could result in
not only a member of the public becoming injured, but potentially also the animal. Handling of the animals during public
exhibition must be done in a manner so there is minimal risk to the animal and the public. Proper handling includes
having sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the general viewing public to assure the safety of the
animals and the public. Adequate control of the animals during public interactions and appropriate public barriers must be
provided.

Facilities, general.
Seven rabbits were housed outdoors on the ground in an enclosure consisting of four sides of wire fencing about 3 feet
high. There was no cover or top to the enclosure and free-range chickens on the property were seen flying in and out of
the rabbits’ primary enclosure. Moreover, a clutch of chicken eggs was found in the straw bedding for the rabbits in their
shelter. Other animals having access to the enclosure may stress, injure, or transmit diseases to the rabbits. Outdoor
housing facilities for rabbits must protect the animals from injury, contain them and restrict the entrance of other animals.

Outdoor housing facilities.
The outdoor enclosure housing three ring tailed lemurs does not have a public barrier. The inspector could easily reach
into the enclosure standing at the current public viewing area. Without a barrier, there is insufficient restriction of physical
contact between the public and the nonhuman primates which could result in stress or injury to the animals and the public.
Fixed public exhibits housing nonhuman primates, must have a barrier between the primary enclosure and the public at
any time the public is present, in order to restrict physical contact between the public and the nonhuman primates.

Facilities, general.
Three enclosures had a live unprotected electrical cord that was accessible to the animals. The live cords were powering
the Asian small-clawed otter’s pool, the cat’s water fountain and the ring-tailed lemurs’ heater in their respective
enclosures. Electrical cords pose a significant health risk to animals that may chew or pull on them. Unprotected powered
electrical cords that are within an animal’s enclosure allows access to an electrical hazard that can cause electrocution,


injury and/or death. Housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect animals from injury including limiting
access to electrical cords.
