2.31(e)(3) Critical

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
A 5-week-old male white New Zealand rabbit was observed to have an approximately ½-1 inch triangular shape portion of
his right ear missing at the tip. The edge of the wound was scabbed. The skin of the front portion of the ear, adjacent to
the wound edge, was reddened. The lab performed an unauthorized method for the approved tissue sampling procedure
that led to this complication. At the time of the inspection, the veterinary staff had already notified the lab to discontinue
use of that procedure.

A significant change was made to the protocol without veterinary authorization. This failure does not give the IACUC and
veterinary staff a complete understand of the animal’s use as well as the opportunity to identify any potential for animal
pain or distress. It is essential that a complete description of all animal procedures used in the protocol be discussed and
approved to ensure humane and judicious use of these animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
