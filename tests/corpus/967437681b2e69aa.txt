ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the outdoor facility, there was an adult female Bichon identified as #307 that had hair loss over approximately
60% of the body, including sides, legs, chest and hips. There were several red raised areas on the skin under the
left front leg, the right chest area and the right hip. The licensee stated that this dog whelped puppies approximately
three months ago and began losing hair at that time. There was also another female Bichon identified as #322 that
had hair loss under the chin and down the neck. The licensee stated that a veterinarian had not been contacted.
Hair loss is an abnormal situation that could indicate a serious medical condition. The licensee must have these two
dogs evaluated by a licensed veterinarian, follow the treatment plan and assure that all of the dogs are provided
with adequate veterinary care as required.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces. (2) Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
***In the whelping house, there were two enclosures containing bred females that had plastic type whelping boxes
that were cracked and chipped. In the adult sheltered facility, there were black rubber bowls that were being used
for beds. Two of these bowls were chewed on the side walls. All of these beds had chewed around the edges
preventing appropriate cleaning. Chewed, chipped and cracked surfaces can prevent proper cleaning and can
increase the risk of injury and disease to the puppies and adults by harboring pests. The licensee must repair or
replace these surfaces as required.

3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***In the whelping house there were two enclosures that were constructed with wire flooring. The holes in the wire
flooring were large enough to allow six puppies feet to pass through the holes. Allowing feet and legs to pass
through the openings in the flooring increases the risk of injury to the animal. The licensee must assure that the
floors are constructed so that the animals feet do not pass through the openings as required.To be corrected by August 24, 2015.
This inspection began at 1335.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative, Kevin Wilken, ACI and Beverly
