located inside of the barn containing 10 sheep, 15 goats, 1 cow, and 1 alpaca. The shield has been pulled away

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor area of the enclosure containing 10 sheep, 15 goats, 1 cow, and 1 alpaca is saturated with excessive
mud and water. A thick layer of mulch was placed over the concrete (ground) in the outdoor area of the enclosure
approximately 1 year ago. The animal traffic, combined with the winter weather, has turned the mulch into mud.
Excessively muddy enclosures can make it difficult for animals to walk.
Remove the mud/old mulch and assure that a suitable method to rapidly eliminate excess water is in place.
