3.56(c)
SANITATION.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. The enclosure for the two rabbits housed in an outdoor
enclosure at the front of the property had an excessive amount of weed growth to the point that the licensee and I
could not see if the shelter was in the enclosure or had been removed. The weeds need to be cut down so a proper
inspection and daily observation of the animals can be accomplished.

licensee via email.
