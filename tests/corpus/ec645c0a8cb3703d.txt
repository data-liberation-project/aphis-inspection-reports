3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The coating is chewed or worn off on top of the frame that runs along the sides and front section of the guinea pig
enclosures. The chewed edges can no longer be adequately cleaned and sanitized. Ineffective cleaning and
sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal and viral diseases. Primary enclosures
must be maintained in good repair and constructed of smooth material substantially impervious to liquids and
moisture. The frame on sides and the front section of the guinea pigs enclosures must be repaired or replaced so
that surfaces are impervious to moisture so that they can be repeatedly cleaned and disinfected and won't retain
odors or absorb moisture. Correct by March 31, 2016.
