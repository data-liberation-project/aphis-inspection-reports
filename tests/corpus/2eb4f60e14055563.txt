2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Records of guinea pigs on hand is only being done monthly for adults and babies. Records were not available for guinea
pig deaths. Failure to keep these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal
losses by deaths or decreased number of animals born, and to track guinea pigs being used in regulated activities to
ensure their humane care and use. The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals
which fully and correctly disclose the number of guinea pigs held, owned, acquired and disposed of including births and
deaths. Correct by January 8, 2021.

This inspection was conducted with the owner's son and exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
