3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The enclosure housing one fox does not have the required perimeter fence. This primary enclosure needs a 6’ perimeter
fence at least 3’ from the primary enclosure fence. It should serve to keep unauthorized persons and animals from going
through it or under it and having contact with the fox. It should serve as a secondary containment system for the fox.
Construct a 6’ perimeter fence for this enclosure at least 3’ from the primary enclosure.
