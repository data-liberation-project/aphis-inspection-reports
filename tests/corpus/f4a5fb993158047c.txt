2.126(b)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00pm on Thursday
15-July-2021. The licensee has designated Thursdays as the optimal day for inspections. I arrived at 1:00 pm and
knocked on the residence door and honked the horn to see if anyone was around. At 1:13 I phoned the licensee and left
a message. At 1:18 the licensee returned my call and said they had been called into work unexpectedly and would not be
able to be present for an inspection today.
