Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocol #042022 reviewed during this inspection identified the number of animals to be used and a rationale for the
number of animals used but did not give a rationale for using live animals or the appropriateness of the species being
used. A rationale for using animals and the appropriateness of the animals to be used must be stated in the protocol to
allow the IACUC to complete a thorough review of the protocol and to ensure that using animals and the animal species in
the activity are appropriate. Ensure Principle Investigators include a rationale for using animals, the appropriateness of
the species and numbers of animals to be used as required. Correct by 20 December 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with IACUC Chair.
