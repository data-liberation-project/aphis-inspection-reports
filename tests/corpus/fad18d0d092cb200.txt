3.13(c)(3) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
A cat arrived at SFO Airport after traveling from Salt Lake City on Alaska Airlines, waybill # 027-SLC-3744-6242.
The primary enclosure did not have a consignor's declaration with instructions for feeding and watering during
transport.
Failure to complete and attach a written consignor's certification regarding feeding and watering could have a
negative impact on the well-being of the animal. The airline should ensure that complete information is provided on
each crate, by the consignor, prior to taking possession of the animal.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with cargo facility personnel.
