2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several instances were identified in which the facility is not using appropriate methods to prevent, control and treat
diseases and injuries.
*The Baytril 100 multi use bottle had dried medication and debris on the lid, specifically where the needle is inserted
to withdraw medication to be injected into the rabbits. The kwikstop/styptic and blue-kote bottles were also sticky
with residual medication and are applied to open wounds, and contamination of medication can cause infection.
*A spray bottle filled with liquid in the supply cabinet was unlabeled. Without a proper label, an employee could
injure the animal using a caustic solution directly on the animal.
*The parasite control program of the Program of Vet Care specifies that "fecal material is removed from enclosures
a minimum of twice weekly to minimize the attraction of flies." The big llama pen contained an excess accumulation
of excreta, and there was no documentation that they had cleaned the pen twice in the last week, in accordance
with their PVC.
Failure to provide appropriate methods to prevent, control and treat diseases and injuries could jeopardize the
health and well-being of the animals. The facility should ensure that their program of veterinary care appropriately
addresses the medical needs of all animals under their care and they are following it.

WATERING.
All three guinea pig enclosures had dirty water bowls at time of inspection. The water in the bowls contained excreta
and some shavings. Animals were observed drinking the dirty water during inspection. Water for guinea pigs must
be clean and potable and provided daily unless food supplements consumed by the animals supplies their normal
water requirements. The room log showed that water was checked daily, but fresh water was only provided onFebruary 3rd, 4th, and 11th and that the cage had not been cleaned since February 2nd. The facility SOP AF-211
specifies that "animal cages are cleaned at least once per week" and it has been more than a week since cleaning.
Open containers such as water bowls must be placed in or attached to the primary enclosure as to minimize the
contamination from excreta. Water that contains dirty bedding and excreta can expose the guinea pigs to disease
hazards or make it unpalatable. Correct by ensuring that potable water is offered as often as necessary to ensure
the health of the animals and at least daily. Additionally, ensure that watering receptacles are free from
contamination and are properly sanitized when dirty.

3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures. Guinea pig enclosures are not being cleaned adequately or often
enough to remove accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, debris and stains. There were accumulations of
excreta, soiled bedding, urine stains, and grime on the sides and floors of enclosures. The room log showed that
the cage had not been cleaned since February 2nd. The facility SOP AF-211 specifies that "animal cages are
cleaned at least once per week" and it has been more than a week since cleaning. Ineffective cleaning and
sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards such as bacteria, fungal, and parasites. Primary enclosures must
be cleaned often enough to prevent accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, dirt, urine stains and grime.
Enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks, or in accordance to the facilities SOP. Correct by
ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent accumulation of excreta
and debris.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the large animal pens, there were several pens that were not maintained in good repair and contained elements
that were potentially hazardous to the animals:
*The sheep enclosure had a loose piece of wire with wool caught on it at the height of a sheep head, which could
cause damage to the face or eyes.
*Several enclosures had loosely wrapped rusty wire on the pipe corral fence panels, including the previous cow
enclosure and the new llama enclosures.*The new llama enclosures had areas of rust on the pipe corrals that weakened the structural integrity of the
enclosure and created sharp edges that could cause injury to the animals in the enclosure.
*The first new llama enclosure had a shelter area with a plywood wall that had two holes in it near the ground,
creating a potential for a hoof to get caught in one of the holes.
The enclosures must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury, and a system of maintenance must
be in place to ensure that the enclosures are kept in good repair and are structurally sound.
