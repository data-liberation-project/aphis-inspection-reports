HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**** There were multiple spots on the floors in both housing rooms where there were cracks in both the floor and the
epoxy paint around it. In some spots, directly under the enclosures, where waste and excreta continuously drops,
the paint was chipped excessively. Waste could easily become trapped under the chipping paint and not be readily
removed during daily hosing of the floor. In some spots there were small (approximately 1 cm in diameter) deep
(unknown depth) holes in the floor which could collect waste and not allow it to be easily flushed out. The
enclosures in both rooms are constructed so they are semi-permanently fixed to the walls and cannot be easily
removed to clean behind them. In Room #2 there was waste splattered on the walls behind some of those
enclosures where the floors meet the walls which had not been cleaned. The licensee stated the enclosures can be
removed from the walls but they are not readily removable and are therefore only removed very rarely to clean
behind them. As a result, that area showed evidence of waste and grime on the back walls. Surfaces which cannot
be readily cleaned and sanitized pose a health risk for the animals housed in those rooms. The licensee must
ensure surfaces of housing facilities are constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be
readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.

3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**** In Room #2, the "triangle area" (formed by the washdown, the top of the bottom enclosures, and the back wall)
was not getting properly cleaned and sanitized. This area was in very close proximity to the animals. They were
observed coming in contact with parts of that area by sticking their fingers through the bars on the tops of the
enclosures. Nearly all the enclosures on the bottom row had a brown grime on the tops of the bars at the tops of
those enclosures. The back walls had a black and brown grime splattered on the walls in some spots where the
drainage system was clearly not effective. There were cobwebs and multiple spiders observed in this (cid:28)triangle
area(cid:29). The licensee used a brush during the inspection to remove some of the cobwebs. Some of the PVC
drainage pipes which were adjacent to the tops of the primates' enclosures had brown, grimy material on their
backsides with which the animals could make contact. The floor in that room collects excreta and waste whichdrops freely from the bottom row of enclosures. Although the room had been recently hosed down and minimal
solid waste was observed on the ground, there was a thin layer of a brown, slimy material spanning much of the
floor space directly beneath the enclosures. According to the licensee, the floors are hosed down and sanitized
daily and the brown discoloring was a stain. The inspector rubbed a covered shoe over the brown material and
slimy, brown debris fairly easily scraped up from the floor onto the inspector's shoe cover. This floor is in very close
proximity to the animals housed on the bottom row and by sticking tails through bars they could almost come in
contact with the floor. Rooms which are not properly cleaned and sanitized pose a health risk for the animals. The
licensee must ensure that hard surfaces which the nonhuman primates come in contact with are spot cleaned daily
and sanitized at least once every two weeks and as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of
dirt, debris, waste, food waste, excreta, or disease hazard. Furthermore, the licensee must ensure that all other
surfaces of the nonhuman primate housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to reduce disease
hazards and satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**** In Room #2, the long PVC pipe which drains excreta and food waste from the upper enclosures had multiple
PVC joints and several screw holes that were leaking into the enclosures below. At least one leak was dripping into
the front left corner of the enclosure where monkey biscuits had been placed. The drainage pans that attach to the
walls in the "triangle area" above the bottom enclosures had several areas that were leaking down the back wall
behind the lower enclosures in close proximity to the nonhuman primates. Properly functioning drainage systems
are necessary to prevent disease transmission. The licensee must provide for regular and frequent collection,
removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes, water, and any other fluids and wastes, in a manner that
minimizes contamination and disease risk. The licensee must also ensure drainage systems are constructed and
maintained so that animal wastes and water are rapidly eliminated and the animals stay dry.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
**** There were 41 macaques in the "general room" which were individually housed 24-7. Seventeen of them had
varying degrees of hair loss (minor to severe) on their arms, legs, chests, and in one case, on the animal's back.
The licensee's Environmental Enhancement Plan states that all nonhuman primates housed at the facility, except
those exempted, are provided with regular access to social contact through group housing. The plan also states the
animals can be exempted from social contact by the Attending Veterinarian and records of any exemptions will be
maintained and available to USDA inspectors upon request. The licensee had no documentation of exemptions for
the singly housed animals and stated they had not been exempted by the Attending Veterinarian. The licensee stated and had supporting documentation to show that only three macaques at the facility were
receiving additional enrichment (daily television viewing) to help reduce their stereotypic hair plucking behavior.
The licensee stated that two televisions are positioned near those three animals so they can view them. According
to the Environmental Enhancement Plan, any animals exempted from social contact should receive supplementary
enrichment. Room #2 housed 111 primates at the time of inspection. There were other monkeys besides the three
identified with special needs which could also view the televisions. However, due to the numerous enclosures in the
large room, there is no way all 41 of the individually housed primates could view the televisions and benefit from
that form of additional enrichment. There was no other supplementary enrichment provided for those animals,
according to the licensee and documentation.
The only food present in the facility at the time of inspection was commercial monkey biscuits. There were no
supplies of produce, nuts, seeds, or any other food enrichment items. The licensee stated that fresh produce is
usually purchased once a week and distributed to the animals for foraging on that same day to avoid food spoilage.
The Environmental Enhancement Plan states that every animal is offered a foraging opportunity for additional food
at least twice a week unless it is exempt.
The licensee had a good Environmental Enhancement Plan but was not following it as written. The plan was
therefore ineffective, resulting in animals exhibiting abnormal behaviors such as stereotypies (pacing, spinning, and
hopping) and hair plucking. As stated in the licensee's own plan, "the purpose of this plan is to prevent or respond to
nonhuman primate aberrant behaviors and improve the quality of life for the nonhuman primates".
The licensee must follow the Environmental Enhancement Plan as directed by the Attending Veterinarian to
promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates.

According to documentation, nonhuman primate #32471 identified on the last inspection report (30 July 2014) was
noted on 22 October 2014 to have "hair loss recovering". This animal left the facility on 24 November 2014 so it
could not be observed during this inspection.
