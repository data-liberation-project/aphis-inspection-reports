RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Although the licensee keeps the required information on her computer, she has not kept up to date with putting all of
her litters born since the last inspection on APHIS form 7005 (Record of Acquisition and Dogs and Cats on Hand,
nor completed the required APHIS form 7006s when the puppies were sold.
The records (7005s) need to be updated to show all puppies born and sold since being licensed. APHIS 7006s
need to be written for the current litter and all future dispositions - whether puppies or adult dogs. To be corrected

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Most of the adult dogs are housed inside the house in dog crates or kennels in one room during inclement weather
and at night. During this inspection, this room was found to be excessively dusty. Although the inside of the
kennels had clean newspapers, there was dirt and fur on the tops and sides of the crate kennels. The overhead fan
is dirty and some dust is on the walls. This room needs to be more dedicated to dog housing by removing items not
necessary for the care of the dogs. Items stored in the closet in this room need to be organized to allow cleaning
and allow the door to be kept closed.
Housing facilities are to be kept clean to facilitate the required husbandry practices and to reduce or eliminate
breeding and living areas for pests. All areas in the dog housing room need to be available for easy cleaning in
and around structures. To be corrected by 4-20-18.
