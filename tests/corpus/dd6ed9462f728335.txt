2.40(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Approximately half of the medications available in the veterinary clinic (including those in the emergency field box
and controlled substances safe) are expired. These include (but are not limited to): epinephrine, atropine,
diphenhydramine, xylazine, diazepam, midazolam, dexdomitor, yohimbine, telazol, and naloxone. Some of these
had been previously identified and labeled by veterinary clinical staff as expired; however, they were not kept in a
separate area, and especially in the field box there was not always an alternative to the expired drug. The use of
appropriate equipment, including non-expired medications, is required to ensure adequate veterinary care is
provided. Expired medications must be clearly labeled and kept in a separate area where they are not likely to be
used in an emergency situation on covered species.
Correct by: from this point forward.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Director of Animal Management and the Vice President.
