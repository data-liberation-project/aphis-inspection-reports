SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
*****There was a very strong ammonia and waste odor inside the kennel building. This can potentially cause
serious respiratory problems and distress to the animals. There must be sufficient ventilation to minimize odor and
to provide for the well being of the animals. The ventilation system must be turned on more often or the inside of
the kennel cleaned more frequently.
