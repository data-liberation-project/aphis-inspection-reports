ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A bottle of Vitamin B injectable that was in the refrigerator expired 2/06, and another bottle of Fluphenazine expired
on 1/31/14. There was also a vial that had a faded label which could not be accurately ascertained (may be
Xylazine) with an unreadable expiration date.
This facility does not appear to have a program of checking all medications and removing those that have expired.
The use of expired medications is considered adulterated and not an appropriate method to prevent or treat
diseases or injuries.
Establish a program of checking all medications and removing those that have expired to assure that only in-date
medications are administered to the animals.

3.75(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL. There was a portion of the spider monkey enclosure wire mesh which was previously broken. The licensee fixed
this by applying & twisting together a narrow gauge piece of flexible wire tie to close the gap on this enclosure. This
piece of flexible wire was so disintegrated that when touch by this inspector it broke off completely.
The right lemur enclosure (opposite the house) has advanced, flaking, deteriorating rust along the back right vertical
& horizontal cage supports and is no longer structurally sound or in good repair.
All surfaces must be structurally sound to contain the animals and prevent injury.
Inspect all metal surfaces for deteriorating rust and structural weakness and correct accordingly.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were several open plastic bags of wood chip shavings in the back of the primate cages # 2 & # 3 night
houses.
Open bags of bedding in animal areas must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitted lids to prevent
contaminations by pests &/or vermin

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are accumulations of old feces, food, and other debris on, behind, next to, and around the exterior of the
rhesus enclosures that has been previously washed out of the enclosures.
The accumulations of feces and food debris that has allowed to remain on, and around, the enclosures have
created a foul odor of decaying food & animal wastes. These conditions will attract insects and vermin which can
pose a disease hazard to the nonhuman primates.
The facility must provide for regular, frequent, & thorough collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food
wastes in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risk.3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The upper and lower enclosure hog wire fence panels on the right side of the kangaroo enclosure are not secured
together and have enough "give" to potentially entrap the animals if they should get any part of their body between
the panels.
There are several large areas in the cavy enclosure that have experienced soil erosion which has now exposed the
wire mesh which was previously covered with soil. Additionally, there are large holes underneath the wire mesh.
These conditions pose a risk of injury to these animals if they should get their limbs through the wire mesh.
These enclosures shall be repaired accordingly to protect the animals from injury and contain them.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The rear of the kangaroo's enclosure does not have a perimeter fence. This enclosure fence shares this fence line
with an adjacent property owner. At the time of the inspection, a barking dog was only a few feet away from this
fence and has the ability to come right up to the fence. This dog can potentially stress these animals which can
subsequently cause injury to these types of animals.
A six foot high perimeter fence shall be erected which is at least 3 feet from the primary enclosure.

WATERING.
The water in the bucket in the kangaroo enclosure appeared to be milky white. When the facility representative
emptied this plastic bucket the inside was completely white. A swimming pool stabilized chlorine tablet fell out of
this bucket as it was being emptied. The white color observed in the bucket was presumably due to the
longstanding oxidation/bleaching by the chlorine.
The licensee does not monitor chlorine levels to determine if this water is potable and safe to drink without causing
harm or illness to the animals.
Potable, as well as palatable, water shall be provided at all times for the health and well-being of the animalsCorrect immediately.
This was a partial inspection, The exit interview was conducted with the licensee's representative.
