2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The following animals require veterinary care.
1) Marmoset (Direct): The marmoset has hair loss on its tail and rear end. The upper 3-4 inches of the tail is wet
and appears slimy. The back of its rear legs are also wet and appear slimy. This animal has not been seen or
treated by the attending veterinarian for its current condition. Marmosets are small animals that can easily become
dehydrated and weak. Once the APHIS official identified the condition of the marmoset, an employee brought the
animal to the attending veterinarian for the small animals.
2) Fallow deer: There is an open wound about the size of a quarter on the right hip of the fallow deer. This deer is
very old and often lays on its right side in its shelter. The wound may be a pressure sore. The deer has not been
seen or treated by the attending veterinarian for its current condition. The open sore may attract flies that could lay
eggs in the wound. The wound could become infected and/or contaminated with fly larvae. Once the APHIS official
identified the condition of the fallow deer, an employee called the attending veterinarian for the livestock.
Veterinary care is a recurring non-compliant item that was cited on the March 19, 2015 and June 10, 2015
inspection reports. Each exhibitor must establish and maintain adequate programs of veterinary care that include
the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Correct by having
animals with health problems seen by the attending veterinarian and following the recommendations of the
veterinarian.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(3) Veterinary care: Two animals (a marmoset and a fallow deer) were identified as requiring
veterinary care during this inspection by the APHIS official that had not been previously identified by facility
personnel. See the citation for Section 2.40(b)(2). All animals must be observed daily to assess their health andwell-being. There must be a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian for the
animals to receive the appropriate veterinary care. Correct from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the co-owner.
