3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On March 19, 2018, seven 5-day old piglets were found by to have escaped a farrowing pen in the west farrowing
room of the site 006 facility. Six of the piglets were recovered alive from a drainage pit located below the west floor
of the room. The seventh piglet was not found and was presumed to have entered into the main drainage pit. The
facility contacted the USDA on March 19 2018 to inform them of the adverse event and their planned corrective
actions.
No hogs were present within the facility during USDA inspection on April 02 2018. Discussion with facility
representatives revealed that fasteners securing a panel in the farrowing pen had failed due to the weight of the sow
pressing on the panel. This had allowed enough of a gap for the piglets to escape the enclosure. On the morning of
the incident, the west floor drain grate was also found ajar and this further enabled the piglets to gain access into
the drainage pit.
Indoor and outdoor animal facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect animals from
injury and to contain the animals. Structures which do meet the strength requirements for the species housed, or
are not properly maintained, may pose a risk for animal escape, injury or death.
Corrective actions should address both the reinforcement/securing of panels in the farrowing pen to prevent further
escapes, and the securing of floor drainage grates to prevent exposure to drainage pits in the event of a possible
escape.
Correct by 04-14-2018 and prior to further animal usage.

Veterinarian..
