ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female coyote has a swollen digit on her right, front foot. The area appears red and swollen with a moist
abrasion and missing hair. The affected area is approximately 1 cm in diameter. The animal occasionally lifts up the
affected paw when she's standing in place. The licensee states this animal was bit by the other coyote on May 1,
2014. The licensee states no veterinarian has been contacted and no medications have been given.
One of the coati mundi has an approximate 2 inch by 2 inch patch of hair-loss at the base of the tail (left side). The
skin does not appear red or swollen. The licensee states no veterinarian has been consulted about this condition.
The capybara appears thin. The hip bones are prominent and the animal has scaly skin with thinning hair on the
back half of the body with patches of hair-loss around the base of the tail and the backbone. The licensee states this
animal is old and no veterinarian has been consulted regarding these conditions.
Failure to seek medical care for the conditions listed above can lead to unnecessary pain and discomfort for the
animals.

The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian BY 5:00 PM ON MAY 23, 2014 in order to
ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This
information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made
available to the inspector upon request.
One barbados wether has excessively long back hooves. The hooves are splayed and are curled up at the ends.
The licensee states all sheep hooves were trimmed on December 27th, 2013.
Excessively long hooves can cause pain and discomfort to the animals. Further, it may cause animals to alter their
stance or their gait and create musculoskeletal related issues. This animal must have its hooves trimmed BY JUNE
4, 2014 to remove the excessive growth. The hooves must be maintained routinely in order to prevent and control
diseases and injuries.3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
Within the wolf hybrid enclosure there is a build-up of old feces and food waste mixed in with the dirt and gravel that
makes up the floor of the enclosure. There are three wolf hybrids in this enclosure. Failure to properly clean and
sanitize primary enclosures can lead to disease hazards for the animals. Floors made of dirt, absorbent bedding,
sand, gravel, grass, or other similar material must be raked or spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all
animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta. Contaminated material must be replaced whenever this raking
and spot-cleaning is not sufficient to prevent or eliminate odors, insects, pests, or vermin infestation.

3.25(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.
Within the "reptile house" there is a large container of bedding. The licensee states this is what was used in the
guinea pig enclosure. The container does not have a tight-fitting lid. There are two smaller lids sitting on top of the
bedding within the container. There are flies, a moth and bird feces on the inside surface of the container. This
storage system does not ensure the bedding supply is protected from vermin and other contamination. Supplies of
food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against spoilage or
deterioration and infestation or contamination by vermin.

WATERING.
The water bottle in the enclosure housing four guinea pigs was empty. The licensee stated she had watered the
animals the previous day. The bedding within the enclosure under the water bottle and on the low end of the
enclosure was damp. The licensee provided water to the animals upon request. When given fresh water, at least
one animal drank vigorously for over a minute.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
Lack of clean water for animals can cause dehydration and other medical conditions.The licensee must ensure that potable water is offered to the animals as often as necessary to provide for their
health and comfort.
3.31(a)(2)
SANITATION.
Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures.
Nearly all of the bedding within the enclosure housing four guinea pigs was damp and soiled. One inspector
touched the bedding. The bedding was moist and clumping. The water bottle in the enclosure was empty.
Failure to provide clean, dry bedding can lead to health hazards for the animals.
In the event a primary enclosure becomes soiled or wet to a degree that might be harmful or uncomfortable to the
animals due to leakage of the watering system, spoiled perishable foods, or moisture condensation, the bedding
shall be changed or the guinea pigs shall be transferred to a clean primary enclosure.
To be corrected by: May 23, 2014
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
There is a large amount of dust, dirt, and/or debris on the floor and walkway surrounding the enclosure housing four
guinea pigs. Failure to clean the premises can lead to health hazards and can contribute to the development of
pest breeding and living areas. The premises must be kept clean in order to protect the animals from health
hazards, to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for pests and to facilitate good husbandry practices.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
Throughout the "reptile house", there is an excessive amount of dust, dirt, and/or debris on the floor surrounding the
enclosures. The ruffed lemur, the ring-tailed lemur and vervet are located in this area.
There is brown to black grime and cobwebs on the walls within the ruffed lemur and ring tailed lemur enclosures. Within the primate building, there is a large amount of dust, dirt and/or debris on the floor surrounding the
enclosures. All of the primary enclosures within this building have a build-up of dust, dirt, debris, and/or grime on the
wire panels that make up the primary enclosure. There are objects (play house, tires, etc) within the outside yards
of all of these enclosures that have a thick build-up of dust, dirt and/or grime. These enclosures contain two
macaques and four baboons.
One enclosure containing two bush babies has a build-up of food waste and/or animal waste on the floor of the
enclosure.
Failure to clean animal housing areas, including primary enclosures, can lead to health hazards, pests and odors.
Hard surfaces with which non-human primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and indoor primary
enclosures must be sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an excessive
accumulation of dirt, debris, animal or food waste, or disease hazards.
If the species scent mark, the surfaces must be sanitized or replaced at regular intervals as determined by the
attending veterinarian in accordance with generally accepted professional and husbandry practices.
All other surfaces within housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally
accepted husbandry standards and practices.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.
Within the refrigerator in the "reptile house" there are containers of strawberries. Throughout all of the visible
containers, the strawberries are heavily molded. The licensee states this refrigerator is not running. There is a ruffed
lemur, a ring-tailed lemur and a vervet in this portion of the facility. Within the refrigerator in the "primate building"
there are cobwebs, mouse droppings, dirt and/or debris sitting on the shelves. There are supplies of fruits and
vegetables for the primates located in this refrigerator. Failure to store food properly can lead to animal illness. The
refrigerators must be cleaned and supplies of food must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from
spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. Food requiring refrigeration must be stored accordingly, and all
food must be stored in a manner that prevents contamination and deterioration of its nutritive value.

EMPLOYEES.
The high number of serious noncompliant items and repeated problems on the current inspection report
demonstrates that the work load at the facility continues to exceed the current staffing level.
An adequate number of appropriately qualified and trained employees is required to ensure that all primates receive
necessary care and that the facilities are maintained and cleaned on a regular and consistent basis.
A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level
of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Such practices shall be under a supervisor who has a background in
animal care.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The vertical guillotine style doors on enclosures and/or shelters for some of the potentially dangerous animals rely
on the weight of the door to hold them in the closed position, according the licensee. On some of the enclosures
there is no locking mechanism or device preventing the doors from being lifted by the animals, which could result in
escape or injury. The licensee must evaluate all enclosure doors, in consultation with an appropriately qualified
veterinarian or other zoological expert if necessary, to ensure that they are designed in a manner that prevents the
animals from lifting or opening them.
There are several enclosures throughout the facility in need of repair.
There is a rusted door leading into a shift area in one of the lion enclosures. One of the solid metal gates on one of
the bear enclosures is severely rusted at the bottom. In both enclosures, the rust has eroded through the metal and
has created holes and/or gaps.
The wall by the animal door within the serval enclosure has a hole in it exposing severely worn wood.
There is a section of fence on the South side of the camel enclosure with a broken support at the top of the fence.
This broken support is making the fence bend in the middle and is unstable. The fence moved easily when one
inspector shook it. The camel was observed pressing against the fence, pushing it outwards, in order to access a
tree on the other side.
There are several places where the chain-link fence within the enclosure housing one Fallow deer and the
enclosure housing two Meishan pigs is curled up at the bottom. The curled up edges have sharp points that extendinto the enclosures, and a gap is present at the bottom of the fence in some places.
Within the sloth enclosure, there a door that has been scratched and/or worn and as a result, the surface of the door
is peeling.
These areas are not in good repair and could lead to animal escape or injury.
These areas need to be repaired or replaced so they are structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair
to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste disposal.
There are piles of animal and food waste and/or old bedding sitting outside of animal enclosures throughout the
facility. Some of the piles are located next to animal enclosures. At some of the piles the licensee states it has
"been there a long time". There is a barrel of animal and food waste and/or old bedding sitting directly behind a lion
enclosure. The licensee states this is an old burn barrel. Failure to remove animal and food waste can lead to pests
and odors. Provision shall be made for the removal and disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding, dead animals,
trash and debris. Disposal facilities shall be so provided and operated as to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and
disease hazards. The disposal facilities and any disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding, dead animals, trash,
and debris shall comply with applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations relating to pollution control or
the protection of the environment.

3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from inclement weather.
There is no shelter within the outdoor enclosure housing two Patagonian cavy. Failure to provide a shelter for
animals housed outdoors does not ensure they are protected from the elements. Natural or artificial shelter shall be
provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.
To be corrected by: May 28, 2014
3.127(c) REPEATFACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Drainage.
There are large areas of standing water within multiple enclosures. In most of the areas the water has collected
under and around leaky automatic waterers. These locations are within the following enclosures: four-horned sheep,
fallow deer, lion, and bear.
Improper drainage within enclosures does not ensure a clean, dry environment for the animals. A suitable method
shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water from within the enclosures.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter fence.
There is a gate on the portion of the perimeter fence surrounding the big cats that has become detached from the
fence post. The gate is leaning out from the fence and sitting crooked which creates a large gap between the gate
and the fence. This fence is not in good repair and does not effectively restrict animals and unauthorized persons
from going through it. The perimeter fence needs to be repaired or replaced in order to effectively prevent animals
and people from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility.
There are two coati mundis in one enclosure that is sitting next to a portion of perimeter fence. The primary
enclosure is less than three feet from the perimeter fence. It must be of sufficient distance (3 feet or more) from the
outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or
persons outside of the perimeter fence.
Perimeter fences cannot be less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure unless written approval is
granted by the APHIS Administrator. The facility does not currently have this approval. If the facility wishes to
pursue this approval, they must submit a request in writing to 2150 Centre Avenue Bld B MS 3W11, Fort Collins,
CO 80526.
3.130 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
The water bottle in the enclosure housing ten degus was empty. The licensee stated she had watered the animals
the previous day. The licensee provided water to the animals upon request. When given fresh water, the animals
crowded around the water bottle and drank vigorously for well over a minute. The animals gathered around the
water bottle in a tight group after it was added to the enclosure. Some of the animals vocalized while waiting to
drink. One of the larger degus was observed pulling the water bottle towards itself, out of the mouth of anotheranimal, in order to drink.
The water within one coyote enclosure was green and had debris sitting on the bottom.
The water within the enclosure housing two porcupines was brown and had debris and/or feces mixed with the
water.
The gerbils in the "reptile house" had no water at the time of the inspection; the bowl was filled with moist bedding
and debris.
Lack of clean water for animals can cause thirst, dehydration and other medical conditions.
The licensee must ensure that potable water is offered to the animals as often as necessary to provide for their
health and comfort.

enclosures: Two ferrets, four kinkajous ("reptile house" and "education center"), ten degus, three potbelly pigs, five
tigers, one bobcat, two lions, two bears, one capybara, two African crested porcupines, three chinchillas and one
sloth. In some of the areas the build-up is very thick and is mixed in with the bedding or floor substrate. In some of
these locations there is an odor and the waste is attracting flies.
On the walls within the kinkajou enclosure in the "reptile house", the coati mundi shelter and the capybara
enclosure, there is a build-up of black to brown grime.
Within both coyote enclosures there is a build-up of dust and dirt on the objects within the enclosures (kongs,
shelter, etc). There are large numbers of old chicken bones scattered throughout and around both enclosures.
There are two coyotes in these enclosures.
Failure to clean animal enclosures can lead to health hazards, pests and odors. Primary enclosures shall be
cleaned and excreta shall be removed in order to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to
