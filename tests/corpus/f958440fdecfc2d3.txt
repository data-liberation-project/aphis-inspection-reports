2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
In September 2020, hamsters that underwent research procedures as per the IACUC approved protocol experienced
unanticipated outcome. After consultation with the veterinarian, laboratory staff euthanized the animals and disposed of
the carcasses, leaving the primary enclosures for animal care staff to clean. Later the same day when animal care staff
was preparing the enclosures to take them to cage wash, they found one cage that contained two dead hamsters and one
alive. Veterinary staff was contacted, and the hamster was immediately euthanized.

Per this Section of the Regulations, handling of animals by all personnel, including laboratory staff, should be done as
carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm, behavioral stress, or unnecessary discomfort. The
delay in euthanasia of this animal may have resulted in unnecessary discomfort, pain, and distress for the hamster.

The IACUC and AV acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation and implementing corrective
actions to prevent future incidents. Corrective actions included but were not limited to re-training of the laboratory staff on
euthanasia, appropriate carcass disposal, and cage preparation for cage wash. No additional incidents have occurred.



This item was corrected by the research facility prior to the inspection.

This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on 9/20/21 and 9/21/21, and the exit briefing was held with
facility representatives 9/21/21.
