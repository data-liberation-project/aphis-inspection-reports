2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
The licensee has added a site in Florida without notifying Animal Care and conducts regulated activity from a site that has
not been approved in Kaufman TX. At approximately 1:29pm EST on November 17th, 2021, USDA Officials arrived at site
001 and were unable to contact the licensee via cellphone requesting to conduct an unannounced inspection.
Additionally, they knocked on the door of the residence, texted and emailed the licensee over the next 5 minutes. USDA
Officials did not make contact with the licensee and waited 30 minutes for a response back. They then drove to a second
address suspected to be a possible residence for the licensee. The second address was an empty undeveloped plot of
land. USDA Officials confirmed with neighbors that the licensees were not local residents in the area. At that time, USDA
Officials drove to a final address suspected to be the new residence for the licensee. They identified the licensee and
confirmed with her that this property would be a site under her license. Licensees are required to notify Animal Care no
fewer than 90 days before any change in the name, address, substantial control or ownership of his business or
operation, locations, activities, and number or type of animals.

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.


Upon arrival to the property USDA Inspectors saw the licensee unloading 5 rabbits from her truck. The licensee showed
us the property and one pasture with 10 goats. USDA Inspectors were unable to review an updated inventory, a
disposition paper of one skunk, and a program of veterinary care as required by the Act. Licensee stated that all records
were in storage at the time of the inspection. A Program of Veterinary Care, records of acquisitions, and animals on hand
must be available in accordance with the regulations and to ensure all animals receive adequate care. Each dealer,
exhibitor, intermediate handler, or carrier, shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to examine records required
to be kept by the Act and the regulations in this part. Partway through the inspection the licensee received a phone call
from her mother who instructed the licensee to direct APHIS officials to speak with their lawyers. USDA inspectors
explained that they were conducting an inspection and that stopping the inspection at this time would be considered a
refusal of inspection. The licensee called her mother again and explained that the inspectors were conducting an
inspection; the licensee’s mother directed USDA inspectors to return at another time to avoid getting citations because
they were between properties. The inspectors informed licensee of the noncompliances she would be receiving and left
the premises. Refusing to allow APHIS officials access to inspect a facility prevent an assessment of the welfare of the
animals at the facility and prevents the Secretary from enforcing the Animal Welfare Act. The licensee during business
hours must allow APHIS officials to enter its place of business and inspect animals, facilities, and records. Correct by
January 1, 2022.

An incomplete inspection was conducted with the licensee. An exit interview was not conducted due to the licensee's
refusal of inspection.
