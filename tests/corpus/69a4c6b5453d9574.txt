2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:05 pm on
16-Mar-17.
The inspectors arrived at the facility at 2:05 pm and rang the doorbell and then called the phone number. An
automated voice answered and stated that "the number you dialed is no longer in service". The inspector called the
phone number again and received the same automated response, therefore, the inspector could not leave a
message.
