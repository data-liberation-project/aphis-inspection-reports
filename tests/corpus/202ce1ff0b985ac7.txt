3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure doors in the 2 sheltered Raber-type kennels, one by the main building and a second by the large
breed dog area, are excessively rusty. There are 6 adult dogs housed in the kennel near the main building and 11
adult dogs housed in the second kennel near the large breed outdoor area. There are a total of at least 10
enclosures with rusty doors. Excessively rusty surfaces prevent required cleaning and sanitization. Correct this by
repairing or replacing these surfaces.

3.3(c)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The sheltered housing facility near the large breed dog area was not lighted well enough to permit a routine
inspection. The licensee and inspector used flashlights in order to observe the dogs and the facility. The licensee
stated that there is a problem with the battery that powers the lights in this facility. Although the dogs do have
access to light by going outside using doggy doors, there is not enough uniformly diffused lighting throughout this
facility to maintain good housekeeping practices, adequate cleaning, and adequate inspection of animals. Correct
this by providing and maintaining sufficient lighting.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is excessive feces accumulation in the 5 outdoor enclosures housing a total of 14 adult dogs. These
enclosures have large stones as substrate and there is feces scattered throughout the enclosures and, in some
areas, smashed feces where the dogs have pressed it into the stones from being stepped on. It is obvious by the
amount of feces in these enclosures that the licensee is not removing the feces daily. Failure to remove feces often
can lead to disease hazards and soiling of the dogs in those enclosures. Correct this by removing feces on a daily
basis as required. Correct by: 01 FEB 2020
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A large accumulation of rodent feces were found in the washdowns of the sheltered kennel near the large breed dog
area. There were 11 adult dogs housed in this kennel. Failure to establish and maintain an effective pest control
program, which includes monitoring and cleaning up of rodent feces, may result in potential health problems for the
dogs. Correct this by establishing an effective and safe pest control program.
