Facilities, general.
Structural strength. Five enclosures had missing blue strips on the front sides. Without the extra blue strips the sides are
only 4 inches in height that are low enough that guinea pigs can easily cross the barrier. The highest enclosures are as
much as 5 feet from the ground. Licensee must ensure that all housing facilities for guinea pigs are constructed in a
manner that contains the guinea pigs and prevents injury and escape. Correct by October 1, 2021.

This inspection was conducted with a family member and the exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
