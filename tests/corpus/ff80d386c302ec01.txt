Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Many rats were seen running in and out of the non-human primate complex made up of 4 chain link enclosures. Three of
the enclosures contained individually housed macaques while the fourth housed three lemurs. The rats could be seen
running through the underbrush in one of the macaque’s enclosures, climbing the fencing, as well as eating and drinking
from the primate’s food/water containers. Rats are pest that can transmit disease and cause sanitation issues which can
negatively affect the animal’s general health. The facility must establish and maintain an effective program for control of
pests including pest mammals.
