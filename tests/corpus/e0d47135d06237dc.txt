PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During this inspection it was noted that a 4 sectioned rabbit hutch, across from the garage, was in need of repair.
The doors on these hutches had damaged wood frames. The wire mesh edges along the frames were now exposed
and jagged edges were present. To ensure that the rabbits are not injured on these areas, the doors will need to be
addressed.

The 2 sectioned rabbit hutch, to the right of the previously mentioned hutch, was also in need of attention. The door
on the left section was excessively chewed. There was now and approximate 3 inch gap between the door and the
frame. Again to ensure the safety of the rabbit this will need to be addressed.

SANITATION.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that two of the goat enclosures were in need of a thorough cleaning. The
goat enclosure, to the left of the barn, had an excessive accumulation of bedding present. The goat enclosure
across the walkway was in the same condition. These accumulations have decreased the fence height by
approximately 12 inches. These enclosures will need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis.
