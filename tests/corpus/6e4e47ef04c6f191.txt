ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A female wolf was favoring the right front leg. Documentation at the facility indicated that the licensee had first
noticed that the animal was not "weight bearing at all" on the front leg on 1/2/16. According to the licensee, the
animal had not been physically examined by a veterinarian and was not receiving any medication for this condition.
The licensee had caught the animal and detected "some heat in the shoulder" on 1/3/16. According to
documentation at the facility, the licensee had taken a phone video of the animal on 1/4/16 and showed her
veterinarian. The facility document continues: "she said leave her and observe to determine if it will resolve". Only
one attempt to give Rimadyl to the female wolf was made according to the record; however, one of the two other
wolves that share her enclosure "grabbed it". On 1/27/16 an entry on the record indicates that the animal started to
put some weight on the leg but was still "packing it". On 2/15/16 another entry states that the licensee spoke with
the veterinarian about the lameness and proposed a new treatment plan as a possibility in the spring or summer.
Currently, this treatment had not been started. The next and last entry was documented on 3/31/16 stating that
there is still a "slight right front limp". According to the written documentation, the licensee "can't medicate", the wolf
"will limp 9m-1y then periodically" and it is "to much stress to cage rest" the animal. There was no written
documentation of a possible diagnosis. Furthermore, the licensee indicated that no diagnostic testing had been
performed. Lameness could indicate arthritis, an injury, infection, or other veterinary medical condition which can
be painful. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must
document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request.
***There was a female adult tiger named "Honey" who appeared to be excessively fat. The licensee stated that in
January 2016 she slowly began decreasing the cat's amount of food from 7 pounds of meat per day down to a
current amount of 5 1/2 pounds per day. The licensee stated the tiger has lost weight since January, but she made
that determination using visual estimation since she is unable to weigh the tigers. The facility's written nutrition plan
for the animals' non-commercial diets shows that "Honey" and the other tigers receive 7 pounds of meat per day.
There was no documentation showing that "Honey's" diet was decreased nor that the decrease was approved by
the Attending Veterinarian. The licensee stated that "Honey" is separated from the other tigers during feeding time
to restrict her intake. However, at the time of inspection, there were meat scraps found in the enclosure containing
"Honey" and the other tigers. Overweight animals have an increased risk of developing health problems. Felines inparticular have special nutritional needs which require veterinarian-approved non-commercial diets to help decrease
the risk of health problems. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis is made and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this
information and make it available to the inspector upon request. Due to the special nutritional needs of wild and
exotic cats and to ensure the diet is appropriate, a diet plan must be documented and approved by the attending
veterinarian when a facility is feeding a non-commercial diet.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times. To be corrected by: May

SANITATION.
*** The barn containing the indoor portion of the tigers' and liger's enclosure had an accumulation of dirt, debris, and
clutter just outside of the enclosure. There was a stack of bags of kitty litter covered in dust leaning up against the
animals' chain link enclosure as well as other miscellaneous items such as a plastic food rack. There was dirt and
straw on the ground. The licensee stated she has been unable to sweep that area for the past six months because
the bags of kitty litter were in the way. Additionally, there were cobwebs and dust on the walls and rafters in that
barn in very close proximity to the tigers' and liger's enclosure. Regular housekeeping of the animal barns and living
areas is necessary to minimize vermin infestation and the risk of disease transmission. The licensee must ensure
that premises (buildings and grounds) are kept clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in
subpart F. To be corrected by: May 31, 2016.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Amanda Owens (VMO) and Dr. Erika
Leisner (VMO).
