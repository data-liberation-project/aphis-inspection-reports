3.19(a)(3) DIRECT
HANDLING.
During this inspection 2 dogs were identified outside on the back dock. They were scheduled to fly out of DFW that
morning but had just returned from the site of the aircraft. The explanation was that the aircraft scheduled was
changed to an aircraft that did not allow animals. When asked how long the dogs had been waiting outside at the
aircraft the manager responded at least an hour. The temperature outside at that time was in the mid-40s. One of
the dogs was an adult standard poodle that did not appear affected by the cold. The other dog was a 2 pound mini
schnauzer puppy that was huddled in the back of the kennel, shivering.
When transporting dogs or cats from the terminal facility to plane side, the animals must not be exposed to
temperatures below 45 F for longer than 45 minutes.
The puppy appeared cold and uncomfortable. Small breed puppies are extremely susceptible to hypothermia.
Size and age of animals should be considered when exposing them to temperature extremes for extended periods
of time. Some method for providing a temperature controlled environment plane side might need to be considered.
