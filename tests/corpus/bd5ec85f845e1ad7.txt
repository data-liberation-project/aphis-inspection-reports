ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:50 a.m. on
16-Feb-18.
Knocked on two different doors at the house. Went to town for cell signal, called all three numbers in the file for the
licensee. Left a message on the one with voice mail. Waited 30 minutes for reply before leaving.
