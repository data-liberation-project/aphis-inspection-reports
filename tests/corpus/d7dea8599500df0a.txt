2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs was not available for review. A total of 146 guinea pigs including adults, weanlings, and
newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records showing the number of adults, weanlings,
and newborns on hand or the number of guinea pigs that died in the last few months. Failure to keep records of the
number adults, weanlings, and newborns including deaths makes it difficult to track changes in production, losses due to
death, and to assess the animal care program. Licensee must ensure that records are kept on guinea pigs held, owned,
sold, including births and deaths to keep track of animals, document changes in ownership, and to assess the animal care
program. Correct by February 26, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
