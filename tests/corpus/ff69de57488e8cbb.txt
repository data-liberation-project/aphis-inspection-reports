3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* One adult dog was observed placing its entire head through the opening in the galvanized gate frame fencing.
The opening located along the bottom of the enclosure gate is large enough for the dog to completely pass through
it. Three dogs are in contacted with the affected area located in outdoor housing. Large openings in the fencing
could result in dogs escaping from the enclosure. Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so
that they protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and keep other animals from entering. The
licensee must alter the open area in the fencing in a manner that ensures the dogs cannot escape through it.
Correct by 11/14/19.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two separate holes were observed in the exterior wood wall are chewed exposing a jagged, splintered,
roughened edge. In addition, insulation was exposed due to holes in the exterior wall. Three dogs are in contact
with the affected area located in outdoor housing. Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized. A chewed, roughened surface could harbor disease causing agents which affects the health
and well-being of the dogs. The potential exists for dogs to ingest splintered wood which could cause potential
health issues. The licensee must ensure all surfaces are being maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot
be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled or altered in a manner that allows for
cleaning and sanitation to occur. Correct by 11/21/19.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 11/7/19 were conducted with the licensee.
