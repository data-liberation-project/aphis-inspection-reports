2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 988 adults, 210 weanlings, and 164
newborn guinea pigs were counted during the inspection. There were no inventory records for the number of adult,
weanlings, and newborns for the last few months. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the
health of the caviary by identifying guinea pig additions and losses by deaths or decreases in the number of animals born
or animals kept for replacement breeders. The facility must maintain complete records containing the required
information which fully and correctly discloses the number of guinea pigs held, owned, and disposed of including births
and deaths. Correct by November 23, 2021.
3.26(d)

Facilities, indoor.
Interior surfaces. There is bare wood on the left side of the guinea pig room by the large windows. Indoor building facilities
must be constructed and maintained so that surfaces are impervious to moisture so that they can be readily cleaned and
sanitized and won't absorb moisture and liquids. Correct by sealing or covering bare wood so that surfaces can be
repeatedly cleaned and sanitized, won't retain odors, and do not permit the absorption of liquids and moisture. Correct by
December 16, 2021.
