ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:30pm on
12-Dec-17.“A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection
process.
***On Tuesday, December 12, 2017, between 14:30pm and 15:00pm, a responsible person was not available to
conduct an inspection. Inspector attempted to contact licensee by (calling cell/home and leaving message,
knocking on door, honking while in driveway). This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct from this day forward.”
(Contacted licensee on her cell phone and she said Tuesdays are a bad day for inspections).
