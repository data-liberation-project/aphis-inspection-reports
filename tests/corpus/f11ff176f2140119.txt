ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
An approximately 6 year old, individually housed, female white-headed capuchin is showing signs consistent with
psychological stress. Patchy hair loss is visible near the base of the tail and hind limbs. The licensee stated that the
capuchin plucked areas of its hair on one occasion while she was absent from the facility. The licensee also stated
that the capuchin has been difficult to handle and has exhibited unusual aggressive behavior. The facility's current
enrichment plan that was approved by the attending veterinarian, has been deviated from due to the capuchin's
unpredictable behavior. Additionally, the capuchin hasn't been on public display for a couple months because of the
licensee's concerns with its current temperament. The licensee has recently consulted the attending veterinarian,
however, the environmental enhancement plan has not yet been altered or updated by the veterinarian beyond a
few suggestions. The facility has been offering a wide variety of enrichment items but the current plan has not
included special considerations for nonhuman primates that are showing signs of being in psychological distress.
The abnormal behaviors exhibited by the capuchin may be an indication that the psychological/social needs of the
animal are not currently being met. Nonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs that must be
addressed when in captivity. Failure to do so can result in a variety of behavior problems.
The licensee must provide certain nonhuman primates special attention regarding enhancement of their
environment based on the needs of the individual species and in accordance with the instructions of the attending
veterinarian. Nonhuman primates that show signs of being in psychological distress through behavior or
appearance must have these special considerations addressed in the written program of environmental enrichment.
