FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Within the indoor guinea pig building, the ammonia level is extremely high. The USDA inspector felt a burning
sensation in her throat throughout the entire inspection and the USDA extern student felt a burning sensation in her
eyes and throat throughout the inspection as well. High levels of ammonia could cause discomfort to the animals as
well as lead to further health issues.
Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs shall be adequately ventilated to minimize drafts, odors, and moisture
condensation. The licensee must reduce the ammonia in the building to a level that will support the health and
well-being of the guinea pigs. The licensee must ensure the ammonia remain at an appropriate level at all times.
