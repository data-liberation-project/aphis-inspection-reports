2.31(c)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Semi-annual program and facility reviews were not conducted during 2013. According to the facility representative,
there were no covered animals used or covered activities conducted during this time period. Although the facility did
not engage in covered activities during 2013, it does not exempt the IACUC from fulfilling its required functions.
A system should be in place to ensure the IACUC evaluates the facility's animal program, facilities, and procedures
every six months and reports their findings to the Institutional Officer.
To be corrected from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representaitve.
