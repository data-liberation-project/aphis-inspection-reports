3.1(a) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The two outdoor enclosures(right and left side of facility) containing four wolf hybrids continue to have multiple areas
where the wire fencing on the ground is dug up, exposing 1-2ft holes beneath the wire. There is one area in the hybrid
enclosure on the right side of the facility containing two wolf hybrids, that has a hole (approx 1ft) dug under the left side of
the lockout fence that could potentially be an entry point for one of the hybrids to get into the lockout area. There is
exposed fencing over a deep hole near the water bucket on the left side of the facility containing two wolf hybrids, and
along the walking path between the entry gate and their igloos. Due to the freezing conditions the past two weeks and
solid ground the holes have not been able to be filled at this time of the year with dirt.

Exposed fencing with holes beneath it can be a possible source of injury as the wolf hybrids run and walk over these
areas. It is possible for the regulated animals to drop their foot into a hole through the fencing that could cause a leg
injury. The hole under the lockout area could provide a mode of escape from the primary enclosure into the lockout area,
where they could try and dig out of the primary enclosure.

All holes should be filled and exposed fencing covered to prevent possible injuries, and any holes under the inner fence
into the lockout area should be filled to prevent escape into the lockout section.

Watering
The water buckets in the three wolf hybrid enclosures was frozen not allowing the regulated animals access to fresh water
on a continual basis. There were 'lick out' indentations on the surface of the ice in the buckets that show the animals tried
to get water from the ice. Due to the licensee being in the hospital, fresh water was not being provided often enough
during the freezing weather from the people organized to assist the owner.

Frozen water is not sufficient access to fresh water for the regulated animals, and can be a source of distress or possible
health issues when they do not have enough water to drink.

Potable water must be continuously available to the wolf hybrids. The licensee is responsible to provide proper help if
they are unavailable, that will continue to care for the regulated animals according to the regulations.

The licensee provided a new care giver that filled all three buckets with fresh water by the end of the inspection.

This inspection was conducted with a family member and exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
