FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** At the time of the inspection, there were two camels housed in a round pen adjacent to the lower barn. There is
no shelter in the pen from inclement weather. The pen was very muddy and the camels were caked with mud along
their feet, legs and hocks. According to the licensee the animals have been housed in the pen for the past two
weeks. This area of PA has received significant amounts of rain with rain expected in the forecast the next day. A
shelter shall be provided for all animals housed outdoors to afford protection from the elements.
*** The shelter area in the main park was housing a large watusi that had been aggressive earlier in the day and
was now being separated from the other park animals. This closed off the only shelter for inclement weather to any
other park animals. There was a gap that allowed the pot bellied pigs to get into the shelter, but once in, there was
no separation from a potentially aggressive watusi. Additional shelters should be available for the animals that
choose to use them to remain dry during inclement weather.
