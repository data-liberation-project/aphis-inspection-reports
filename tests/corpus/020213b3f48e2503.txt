At the time of inspection, two wolves were observed to be in need of veterinary care.
(cid:28)"Baci", a 15 year old male artic wolf was observed with a dark, black, thick discharge coming from the rectum. The
discharge was so profuse that it stained the fur around his hindquarters. The animal was observed licking the area
repeatedly. The licensee stated that "Baci" had cancer and that the veterinarian said if the tumor was removed
surgically, it would likely come back. The licensee said she was told to keep the animal comfortable until it was time
to euthanize. The veterinarian stated that the wolf had been seen last December for a mass on the rectum. A biopsy
was performed and it was diagnosed as a perianal adenoma. However, the veterinarian recommended that the
animal be neutered at a clinic and told the licensee that neutering was often curative. The licensee declined to have
surgery for "Baci".
"Coco", a 14 year old wolf was diagnosed with mammary cancer last July. The licensee stated that the veterinarian
told her to bring the wolf home and make her as comfortable as possible. According to the veterinarian, he told the
licensee that "Coco" was near the end of her life and prescribed Rimadyl, 75 mg tablets, to be given to "Coco" twice
each day to help with inflammation and pain. However, the licensee stated that Rimadyl caused liver problems and
thus did not administer this medication. Instead she was giving "Coco" an herbal supplement called Raviola.
The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat animals is a requirement of this section of
the Animal Welfare Act. Failure to obtain surgery for "Baci" and not administering medication per veterinarian(cid:25)s
instructions for "Coco" caused both animals unnecessary pain and discomfort. All medications, including
supplements, must be prescribed or approved by the attending veterinarian.
Correct by having these animals seen by a licensed veterinarian and following all recommendations including those
regarding examination, diagnosis, treatment and future recheck examinations as needed. Additionally, the licensee
must maintain a record of these recommendations for APHIS officials.
The license was verbally instructed to have "Baci" and "Coco" examined by the veterinarian by Friday, 5/23/15, two
days after the inspection.2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were 2 wolves identified on this inspection that were in need of veterinary care. The licensee had not
contacted the veterinarian to address "Baci's" worsening cancer and the copious discharge from the tumor. In
addition, "Coco" had not been followed up for veterinary evaluation since she was diagnosed with mammary cancer
10 months ago. The licensee must observe all animals daily to assess their health status. The licensee must also
establish a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and
accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being is conveyed in an accurate and timely
manner.
