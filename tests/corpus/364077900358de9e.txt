3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During inspection the licensee informed me that one of the river otters had escaped its enclosure in July of this year.
The otter was able to crawl out underneath the back gate of the enclosure. The staff has not been able to locate the
otter. An animal that escapes its enclosure can be preyed upon by wild animals outside of the park. In addition the
otter may not have the skill set to survive on its own outside of the park. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosures in the park are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to contain the animals. Correct
immediately.
Note: At the time of inspection, the licensee had already fixed the river otter enclosure so the remaining otter is not
able to escape from it. The enclosure was fixed the day it was realized that the otter had went missing.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
