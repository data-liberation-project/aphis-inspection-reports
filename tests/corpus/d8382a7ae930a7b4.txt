2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee didn't have a recent Program of Veterinary Care to review. I called the Attending Veterinarian. The
Attending Veterinarian has not seen or consulted with the licensee since March 2017, which was the last time the
Attending Veterinarian visited the licensee's premises, and the Attending Veterinarian considered the Program of
Veterinary Care to be inactive. Not having a current or active Program of Veterinary Care and not having the
Attending Veterinarian conduct regular site visits doesn't ensure that the animals are receiving optimal care. The
licensee must have the Attending Veterinarian provide a written Program of Veterinary Care and conduct regularly
scheduled visits to the premises. Correct by 12-4-18.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
Note: No animals were on site during inspection.
End of report.
