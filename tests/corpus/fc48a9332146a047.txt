WATERING.
When assessing the guinea pig housing room, 45 guinea pigs did not have access to water for an unknown amount
of time. The water connection from the main line was disconnected from the rack’s automatic water line. The water
line was reconnected at 10:00 am, and the guinea pigs began competing for the water source. Additional water
bottles were attached to each cage beginning at 10:18 am. The attending veterinarian was contacted at the time of
inspection and instructed staff to assess dehydration status by skin tent and behavior. She also instructed to allow
them free access to water and provide additional sources of water such as apples. By 10:45 am, the guinea pigs
were still drinking actively. After resuming the inspection and returning at 11:07 am, one cage containing 5 guinea
pigs had completely finished their water bottle and it was refilled.
Unless food supplements consumed by guinea pigs supply them with their normal water requirements, potable
water shall be provided daily except as might otherwise be required to provide adequate veterinary care. Access to
clean potable water is necessary for the health and welfare for animals.
Facility staff shall provide clean potable water to animals at all times unless their IACUC-approved protocols or
veterinary directive dictate otherwise.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
The inspection was conducted on 22 -23 August 2019.
