2.31(b)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Review of the available IACUC meeting minutes from 2014 and 2015 shows that since the last USDA inspection on
April 10, 2014 there have been six IACUC meetings. The Attending Veterinarian has attended only two of the six
meetings. The unaffiliated member has also only attended two of the six meetings. Representation from the
veterinarian, who has direct and delegated program responsibilities for activities involving animals, and the
unaffiliated member, who represents the general community interests, is vital to having a fully functioning IACUC. A
veterinarian and an unaffiliated member shall be regularly attending members of IACUC functions so the IACUC
can perform its mandate of assessing the research facility(cid:25)s animal program, facilities and procedures. Correct by
Oct. 31, 2015.
2.31(c)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Since the last USDA inspection on April 10, 2014 the IACUC has conducted three semi-annual program reviews
and facility inspections. Checklists used for the reviews and inspections along with the corresponding semi-annual
evaluation reports sent to the Institutional Official were reviewed. The reports to the IO did not state all the
deficiencies identified on the checklists. Several deficiencies identified in all three reports did not include a specific
plan and schedule with dates for correcting the deficiencies. For instance, two identical minor deficiencies were
identified during the program reviews on the Oct 2014 and April 2015 reports. Neither included a specific plan and
schedule with dates for correction. The April 2015 report identified a significant deficiency noted during the facility
inspection. No specific plan and schedule with dates for correction was stated. The IACUC shall prepare a report
based on its semi-annual evaluations for the IO that identifies all deficiencies found, designates them as minor or
significant and that contains a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency.
Exit conducted with the Institutional Official and other facility representatives.
