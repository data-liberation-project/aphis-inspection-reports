INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***Protocol A, an infectious disease protocol, states there is the potential for an animal to experience loss of
coordination and behavioral changes. Appropriate endpoint criteria have been outlined. Most animals may not
experience these symptoms, however the potential exists as part of the disease process. The pain and distress
category is listed as C in the protocol. If there is the potential for animals to experience any pain or distress the pain
and distress category should be D. The protocol must be amended to reflect the appropriate pain category on the
initial review of a protocol to ensure animals are reported under the appropriate pain and distress category on the
Annual Report and to ensure that animals do not experience unnecessary pain and distress.
This NCI was corrected during the inspection by the established IACUC procedures.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representatives
