ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**An adult female tiger in enclosure #2, Buffy, was noted to be squinting and excessively blinking her eyes in the
sunlight before moving to pace the fence. Buffy has opaque coloration to the cornea of both eyes with the left eye
appearing completely white. The other female tiger in this enclosure, Spangles, also has an opaque and cloudy
appearance to both eyes, the left eye being more noticeably affected. Spangles was observed excessively blinking
and squinting her eyes in the sunlight. Both of these tigers had been cited for this condition and the enclosure was
cited for inadequate shade during the previous inspection conducted on 9/9/2015. This condition has been
documented that it is considered chronic in nature by the attending veterinarian (AV). A note made by a
veterinarian on Buffy's medical record on 9/9/2015 stated "Bilateral, chronic, progressive, solar induced keratitis. It
was going to continue to worsen". A note made by a veterinarian in Buffy's and Spangle's medical records on
11/2/2015 stated "Solar Induced keratitis is the same". There is no plan to address the progressive deterioration of
the vision, pain, or discomfort due to the diagnosed condition.
Eye conditions, particularly chronic conditions that become more active, are serious, often painful to the animal,
and, if not treated quickly, may result in loss of vision. These tigers need to be re-evaluated by a veterinarian to
provide a plan for treating and/or monitoring this condition.

**A male tiger in enclosure #32, Waldo, had an abnormal gait affecting his right front leg, which was cited during the
inspection on 9/9/2015. When walking, his head bobs downward noticeably when landing hard on his left front leg.
He would stretch out the right front leg gently before walking at times not putting full weight on that leg. Waldo's
pelvic bones were becoming prominent and were easily visible. Invoices from a veterinarian dated 3/4/2014 and
4/19/2015 list digital radiographs of right elbow and right front leg for Waldo but these were not made available for
review. A note made by attending veterinarian in Waldo's medical records on 11/ 17/2015 that it was a chronic limp
and non-responsive to pain medications. "Plan was to provide glucosamine/chondroitin, can restart
tramadol/meloxicam if limp worsens for more than 48 hours". There were no records available during this
inspection showing that this animal is receiving glucosamine/chondroitin , no plan to monitor, and no plan to
re-evaluate or attempt any other diagnostics or treatment for this animal despite no change in this abnormal
conditionLameness and/or abnormal gait with muscle or weight loss may be indications of injury or underlying illness and this
tiger needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to provide a plan for diagnostics, treating and/or monitoring these
conditions.
**A male tiger in enclosure # 65, Toni has an abnormal gait affecting his right front leg, which was cited on the
nspection conducted 9/9/20/15. When walking, his head bobs downward when placing his left front leg and does
not appear to bearing his full weight. A note was made by a veterinarian on Toni(cid:25)'s medical record 11/2/2015 "no
improvement in RF lameness on Tramadol". A note made by the attending veterinarian on 11/17/2015 was that it
was a chronic limp, (cid:28)plan to provide glucosamine/chondroitin supplement. If limp worsen for more than 48 hrs restart
tramadol/meloxicam(cid:29). There were no records available during this inspection showing that this animal is receiving
glucosamine/chondroitin, no plan to monitor, and no plan to re-evaluate or attempt any other diagnostics or
treatment for this animal despite no change in this abnormal condition.
Lameness and/or abnormal gait with muscle or weight loss may be indications of injury or underlying illness and this
tiger needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to provide a plan for diagnostics, treating and/or monitoring these
conditions.
**An adult male lion in enclosure # 28, Zazu was observed to have an abnormal stance and appeared to be
hunched on his hind quarter. Below the hock it appeared to be at an abnormal angle. He was very reluctant to walk
inside the enclosure. Zazu also has an opaque coloration to the center of the left eye which a note by a veterinarian
on 11/2/2015,"eye looks good." No diagnosis, treatment or plan available during the time of inspection to address
these medical issues.
Eye conditions, particularly chronic conditions that become more active, are serious, often painful to the animal,
and, if not treated quickly, may result in loss of vision. Lameness and/or abnormal stance with reluctance to walk
may be indications of injury or underlying illness. This lion needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to properly
diagnose the cause and provide a plan for treating and/or monitoring these conditions.
**An adult black leopard in enclosure #61, Sinbad, was noted to have two large lumps protruding from the left hip
and left lateral thigh with a third faintly noticeable on his right mid-lateral thigh. This condition was cited during the
inspection on 9/9/.2015. The veterinarian that was on site during the inspection conducted on 9/9/2015
recommended no treatment at that time, but to monitor them daily for change. A note made by a veterinarian on
Sinbad's medical record 11/2/2015 animals needs to be darted, verify they are lipomas. There has been no
documentation that these lumps have been monitored and/or treated. Sinbad also appeared to have an abnormal
gait by walking lightly and not bearing his full weight on the right side. This condition had not been noticed by thefacility staff at the time of this inspection.
Lumps in or under the skin may be a sign of infection, inflammation, or tumors and should be measured and
monitored, at a minimum, for changes in size or character. Lameness and/or abnormal gait may be indications of
injury or underlying illness. This leopard needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to properly diagnose and provide a
plan for treating and/or monitoring these conditions.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
**An adult male tiger in enclosure #26, Andy, was again observed sitting on his hind limbs, stroke his penis with his
front,paw and then get up and urinate. This is unusual behavior and was first noticed by the inspectors on the last
inspection conducted 9/9/2015. A note made by a veterinarian on Andy's medical record 9/9/2015 she observed
the animal doing this behavior and believed the tiger was masturbating, a behavior seen in tigers. Going to discuss
with the AV. A note made by a veterinarian in Andy's medical record on 11/2/2015 urinating normally. There are no
records available during the time of inspection from the AV that any diagnostic testing has been accomplished and a
plan for treatment.
A veterinarian should examine this tiger to determine if this is behavioral or indicative of an underlying veterinary
condition which may require diagnostic testing (i.e. blood work, urinalysis) and further evaluation and plan for
treatment and monitoring for resolution of any underlying condition or behavioral disorders.
**A 6 week old lion, Hercules is being housed in the veterinary clinic next to two 8 week old tiger cubs, Snowflake
and Schroeder. Snowflake and Schroeder have been diagnosed and are presently being treated for "ringworm" (a
contagious fungal skin infection).. The middle fence is shared between the enclosures allowing Hercules to have
direct contact and exposing this immature, young lion to this contagious condition.
The facility must consult with a veterinarian and develop a plan to monitor, diagnosis, treat and prevent the
spreading of this condition.
** A juvenile tiger cub in enclosure # 41, Elvis along the left shoulder had three circular areas where the hair was
missing. The animal had been obtained from another individual who had confirmed cases of "ringworm" (a
contagious fungal skin infection). Currently, this juvenile tiger had been placed in the enclosure with two juvenile
tigers that had already been at the BCSS facility. The condition of this tiger had not been noticed by the facility staff
at the time of inspection.
Areas of hair loss may be symptoms of other veterinary conditions and should be evaluated by a veterinarian todetermine a diagnosis and plan to address this condition.
**Three juvenile bears in enclosure # 8, Rachey, Xena and Koda have significant hair loss along the rump. Koda
appeared to have bi-lateral hair loss on the hindquarters extending forward to the mid-back area. Rachey and Xena
have hair loss on the hindquarters and thinning hair coat over the lower back. In addition, all three bears were seen
to be excessively scratching their flank and abdomens during the time the inspectors observed them. The AV had
not been notified of these animals condition at the time of inspection. The facility had changed the bedding, as it
was assumed to be an allergic reaction, however the condition remains unchanged.
Areas of hair loss and pruritus may be symptoms of nutritional deficiencies, internal organ dysfunction, allergies,
external parasites, and/or many other veterinary conditions. These animals need to be evaluated by a veterinarian
to determine a diagnosis and plan for this condition.
In addition to the adult tigers Buffy, Spangles, Waldo, Toni, Andy and the adult leopard, Sinbad, the following
animals listed on the previous inspection conducted September 9, 2015 were evaluated by a veterinarian:
Binturong- Chip, Tiger cub Joey, adult tiger-Capricho, Adult Leopard-Aramis, and 2 coatimundi -Molly and Macano.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
- The plan for the environmental enhancement to promote the psychological well-being of the nonhuman primates, 2
ring-tailed lemurs acquired in July 2014, was not available for review at the time of this inspection. The plan, at a
minimum, must address social grouping, environmental enrichment, special considerations, if applicable, and
restraint devices and their use. The plan and environmental enrichment must be approved by the attending
veterinarian (AV) and documented when provided to the animals on the environmental enhancement plan.
There was nothing documenting (i.e notebook, calendar) that enrichment is taking place. The animals have
different items in their enclosures, but there is no schedule of rotating or changing the items in the pens.
Nonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs that need to be addressed when in captivity. A
written plan that is directed by the AV, guided by current professional standards, and available for review by APHIS
officials is required to ensure that the psychological well-being of these animals is being appropriately addressed.

Must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environmental enhancement of nonhuman primates
that is in accordance with currently accepted professional standards and as directed by the AV.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Enclosure #36 housing 2 black bears, Cody and Pebbles, has a large hole in the wooden shelter structure on the
upper right side, This shelter is in disrepair and the hole can allow wind and rain to enter the structure which could
cause discomfort to these animals.
In the following enclosures, the doorframe around the den (shelter) had chewed and ripped wood which are in
disrepair and which could cause an injury to the animals:
**Enclosure # 11 housing 2 adult tigers, Charlie and Chainsaw
**Enclosure # 12 housing 2 adult tigers, Seth and Gabrielle
**Enclosure # 23 housing 2 adult tigers, Tutt and Nefertiti
**Enclosure # 24 housing 2 adult tigers, Shenandoah and Sabre
Enclosure # 24 housing 2 tigers, Shenandoah and Sabre, the chain link fencing on the west side of the enclosure
adjacent to the den is pulled and is not in good repair, posing a risk of injury to the animals.

Enclosure #5 housing 2 tigers, Opie and Lyla the ramp and elevated resting platform has chewed, ripped wood in
disrepair and could cause an injury to the animals.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.
When the door was opened to the main food preparation area (commissary) a very foul odor of rotting meat could
be smelled by the inspectors. Inside this area there were multiple packages of raw chicken, fish and meat in
approximately 25-30 large cardboard boxes that were past the expiration dates (Dec 6, 2015 noted on some
packages). Facility staff stated that the meat had been delivered on 12/8/2015.. All of this meat was being stored
at room temperature since it was delivered and most of the meat was thawed and warm to the touch.
Food that is past the expiration dates on the manufacturer's packaging and which is not stored under proper
conditions (eg. refrigeration for raw meat products) deteriorates quickly and may become contaminated with highlevels of bacterial pathogens which are a risk to the health of the animals being fed this improperly stored food.
Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. Refrigeration and appropriate storage shall be provided for
supplies of perishable food.
3.126(a)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The indoor enclosure # 52 housing for 3 five month old tigers, Lakota, Joey and Khaleesi is not being sufficiently
regulated for extreme temperature changes. The inspector opened the side door to the indoor enclosure and felt a
rush of cold air. The enclosure has two baseboard heaters that are not being utilized. These heaters are presently
being urinated on and poses a health/fire hazard to the animals. The floor in the indoor enclosure is made of
concrete and the only area for the animals to stay warm is by burrowing into the wood shavings on the elevated
bed. Facility staff stated that they leave the window open even during the night allowing cold air to enter. These
lower temperatures could cause undue stress and discomfort to these young tigers.
The licensee needs to sufficiently regulate extremes of temperature by heating or cooling the indoor housing
facilities to protect the health of the animal and to prevent discomfort.

Two tigers and one lion were noted to have abnormal conditions affecting their eyes. Several animals were
observed laying in the restricted shadow of shade available to them in their enclosures.
Inadequate protection from direct sunlight has the potential to cause eye damage and may affect an animal's ability
to thermoregulate without the ability to access shade. In addition, inadequate shade may restrict the animals from
utilizing the full enclosure space.
Shelter from sunlight is required when overheating or discomfort of the animals is likely.
3.127(b) REPEATFACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from inclement weather.
The shelter structure in the outdoor enclosure #35 housing an adult leopard, Selbit, is not adequate to protect this
animal from the local area's climatic conditions (eg. rain, wind, snow, hail). This enclosure previously housed
bobcats, a much smaller animal than an adult leopard, and the shelter structure entrance is too small for a leopard
to enter this structure or to have adequate room to make normal postural adjustments if able to gain access.
Animals housed outdoors should have appropriate shelter, natural or artificial, where they can escape adverse
climatic conditions and stay warm and dry.
Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for
all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
An adult male tiger in enclosure # 55, Shirkahn has slabs of ice and standing water under and around the water
bowl. This area is not adequately draining and does not allow the animal to stand on a dry surface while drinking.
Two adult tigers in enclosure # 56, Charaka, Priya has excess an excess amount of ice, water, mud under and
around the water bowl. This area is not adequately draining and does not allow the animals to stand on a dry
surface while drinking.
An adult tiger in enclosure #57, Stripes has excess an amount of standing water, mud under and around the water
bowl. This area is not adequately draining and does not allow the animals to stand on a dry surface while drinking.
The excess accumulation of standing water, ice, mud could be a source for contamination, odors and diseases.
Establish and maintain an effective drainage system to eliminate excess water to prevent potential contamination
and diseases.

FEEDING. According to the diet plan observed by the inspectors, it calls for "Added calcium supplement for cubs".The plan lists
two calcium supplements to be given, Prima Cal 2 scoops of supplement per pound of meat and Calcium Citrate 4
scoops of supplement per pound of meat. Only Prima Cal was found during the inspection and the facility staff
stated that was all they were using. Lameness and joint swelling in young, growing cubs may be caused by
inadequate calcium in the diet and can lead to serious injury and health consequences (i.e fractured bones).
The licensee should ensure that the calcium supplementations are being given as directed by the AV.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and the diet shall be prepared with
consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
In enclosure #36 for two black bears, Cody and Pebbles, the horse trough provided for the bears' enrichment and
for cooling themselves had a small amount of brown liquid mixed with dirt and debris. The bears were observed
licking the brown liquid and climbing inside the trough. Consumption of the dirty brown liquid with debris poses a
risk to the animals' due to bacterial contamination. An employee was called to remove this trough from the
enclosure.
In enclosure # 24 for two tigers, Shanandoah and Sabre, is one small water receptacle with no water for the
animals. Facility staff stated at one time they did have a large water receptacle, but it got torn up. An employee was
called to provide water to these animals.
Animals not provided with adequate potable drinking water are at risk for dehydration and overheating. If other
types of water receptacles are provided to animals, these and all drinking water receptacles shall be kept clean and
sanitary in order to minimize contamination by bacteria, algae, and other potentially toxic or infectious materials.
If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health
and comfort of the animal and all water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
In enclosure #36 housing 2 bears, Cody and Pebbles is an excessive accumulation of bird droppings on and around
the food receptacle, southwest side of the fence and a tree stump. These pests may carry and transmit diseases to the animals and a more effective method of monitoring and
preventing their presence in/around primary enclosures and food should be implemented.
The licensee shall establish and maintain a safe and an effective pest control program.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
The licensee is not regularly involved in the day to day care of the animals and facilities. Facility staff stated that
they have 2 employees that live on site and another employee has not seen and unsure of his status. The
employees who are living on site have not been adequately trained for emergency situations. This was evidenced
by them being unable to explain the emergency protocol for an escaped animal. The facility recently acquired 11
more animals making the current total of 127 animals including 12 species. These species have complex medical,
behavioral, nutritional, and other husbandry needs. Conditions at the facility currently do not meet the professional
level of husbandry practices described in the regulations and standards. For example, in the last 16 months, 9
tigers,1 lion, 1 bobcat, 1 leopard, and 2 kinkajous were found dead. During this inspection, 7 tigers, 2 lions and 1
leopards were identified with veterinary care problems that were no(cid:25)t receiving appropriate care. Young animals (2
tiger cubs, 1 lion) at the facility were being hand raised and require around the clock specialized care and feeding. A
total of 37 enclosures, affecting 76 animals, had no shade(cid:20). This has been an ongoing problem that has been cited
since May 2009. At least 8 enclosures were in varying degrees of disrepair that was cited on 9/9/2015 inspection.
The excessive number of animal welfare concerns indicates that there is not a sufficient number of adequately
trained employees to maintain a professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices and in emergency
procedures.

Facilities are required to utilize a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professional
husbandry standards described in the regulations and standards to ensure that the animals are kept in appropriately
maintained, sanitary facilities and receive appropriate monitoring, veterinary care, feeding, watering, and care.

The licensee must evaluate the current work load and staffing level and ensure that a sufficient number of
adequately trained employees are utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices
described in the regulations and standards.
A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level
of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.Inspection conducted on 12/9/2015 with a facility representative, AC Supervisory Animal Care Specialist, Tanya
Tims, DVM and Animal Care Inspector Cindy Rhodes.
Due to the unavailability of the licensee to conduct the exit briefing in person, it was conducted by telephone on
12/14/2015 with the licensee and AC Inspector Cindy Rhodes. The exit briefing included a detailed description of
the animals requiring veterinary care.
