Primary enclosures.
In an employee office, a marmoset is being housed in an enclosure that on one side adjoins a cabinet. It was observed
that the drawer of the cabinet does not remain closed, and the animal could potentially reach into the drawer, which
contains boxes of paper clips, which could pose a risk of injury or ingestion.

Primary enclosures for primates must be designed and situated so that they protect the animal from harm. To be
corrected immediately; and the facility is currently in the process of placing this rescued animal in a forever home.
3.101(a)(1)

Facilities, general.
The stadium and painted surfaces surrounding the dolphin pool at Toyota Stadium are deteriorating and present a risk of
introducing foreign materials into the water that the dolphins reside in. The surfaces of the concrete steps of the stadium
are crumbling, and there is a gravel-like substance that can drain into the pool through pool access openings at the
bottom of the stairs. In one area there is a place where moisture staining shows that liquid and potentially debris is
draining directly into the haul-out area of the pool from the stadium stairs. In Dolphin Harbor many areas of painted wall
surfaces have peeling paint that is above or adjacent to the surface of the water, and one large metal pillar shows a large


area of rust around the bottom, with pieces flaking off near the water. Another spot on the painted pool-side flooring is
cracked and peeling.

Failure to maintain all surfaces in good repair presents a risk of debris and contaminants entering the water, which could
affect water quality and / or present a risk of ingestion.

The facility should repair and maintain all surfaces in good repair in order to protect the well-being of the animals. To be
mitigated as much as possible immediately, with all repairs to be completed by 4/15/2022.
3.105(d)

Feeding.
At the time of inspection it was observed that the large walk-in freezer where fish is stored was at 7 degrees F. Facility
representatives stated that the freezer had failed to go into defrost mode resulting in a build-up of ice on the fans.

Frozen fish for marine mammals must be stored at a maximum temperature of 0 degrees F in order to protect nutritive
value. The facility should take steps to ensure that the freezer functions properly, and maintains the appropriate
temperature range from this time forward.
3.106(b)(1) Repeat

Water quality.
Over the last month, the number of coliform colonies found per 100 ml of pool water exceeded the maximum allowed limit
and was found to be out of compliance with requirements on two occasions in one marine mammal pool. In the Seal Cove
pinniped pool the coliform count was 6405 on the 12th of January, and 2282 on the 21st. Follow-up testing at 48 and 96
hours showed improvement, but the average of the tests exceeded required limits.



The facility is in the process of overhauling and upgrading life-support water quality systems and procedures, and great
improvements have already been observed. Responses to the high coliform counts were appropriate and effective.

The coliform bacteria count for a primary enclosure pool should not exceed 1000. When the count exceeds 1000 then
corrective actions should be taken, and an average of retests of day one added to tests at 48 and 96 hours should not
exceed 1000 in order to maintain compliance. Coliform counts exceeding 1000 could be unhealthy for marine mammals.
The facility must consistently maintain water quality which is not detrimental to the health and the well-being of the
animals.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
A pig is being housed inside an employee office, with access to an outside yard. Inside the office, the pig is left
unattended in a space where there is a macaw parrot housed in the same space, with potential nose-to-nose contact, and
there are two outlets accessible to the animal, one for a phone / fiberoptic cord, and another that is an electrical outlet with
office equipment cords accessible to the animal. There was also a loose cord on the floor.

Housing for swine should be free of any hazardous items. Exposure to electrical cords that could be chewed on presents
a risk of electric shock. Cords present an ingestion risk. Unattended exposure to a large parrot presents a risk of injury or
disease transmission. The facility must ensure that all animals are housed in enclosures that protect the animals from
harm. To be corrected immediately; and the facility is currently in the process of placing this rescued animal in a forever
home.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
