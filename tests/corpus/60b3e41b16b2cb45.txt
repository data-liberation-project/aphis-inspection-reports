ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Shih tzu (microchip #0A01572579) has an abnormal appearance to the right eye. The eye is cloudy and
blue in color and the white of the eye is moderately reddened. There is a mass of dark red material located in the
center of the eye. The licensee stated that he had observed the dog the evening before, but was not able to verify
what condition the dog’s eye was in at that time.
Poor eye health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues. The above
mentioned dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector
upon request.
During the inspection the licensee called the attending veterinarian and made an appointment for the dog to be
evaluated later that evening.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.(cid:9)
