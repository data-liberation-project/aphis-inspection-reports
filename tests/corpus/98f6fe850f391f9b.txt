2.31(d)(1)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 14-087 describes a veterinary teaching protocol in which veterinary students are taught cattle dehorning
and castration, both procedures known to involve potential for pain and/or distress. The protocol's alternative
search section lists databases and keywords used for a literature search for alternatives to these two potentially
painful procedures but there is no narrative or summary of the findings of the literature search indicating whether or
not any alternatives were identified. Without a narrative or summary that includes information regarding the search
results the IACUC is not able to assess that a reasonable and good faith effort was made to determine the
availability of alternatives or alternative methods. The IACUC shall ensure that the principal investigator has
considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals
and has provided a written narrative description of the methods and sources used. Correct by Aug. 15, 2016.
2.33(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During this inspection the inspectors reviewed animal use and animal medical records for the veterinary teaching
cattle currently housed at the dairy farm. Review of the records and conversations with facility employees show that
daily observations of animals to assess their health and well-being are being conducted with problems being
identified and noted but that these issues are not being conveyed to the veterinarian in a timely manner to allow for
appropriate and timely treatment of the cattle. Cow 488 was noted in the records to be lame on her right rear leg on
9/1/15. The medical record shows that the cow was not evaluated until 9/28/15 at which time she was treated for an
abscess in the right hind medial claw. Cow 769 was noted in the records to have a swelling on the 3rd eyelid. No
medical evaluation or treatment records could be found. Cow 5090 was noted to be limping on her left rear leg on
11/3/15. She was evaluated and treated for horizontal hoof cracks on 11/6/15 with a note by the veterinarian that
the facility needs (cid:28)to retrim her in 6 wks(cid:29). No record of retrimming or reevaluation was identified. Several cows were
noted with longer than normal claws today. The facility representative stated that there is no protocol for regular foot
trimming and that the claws are trimmed when needed.
The facility must ensure that all problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the attending
veterinarian and the appropriate clinical veterinarian responsible under the facility(cid:25)'s program of veterinary care
(instituted 9/17/15) to ensure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure provision ofadequate veterinary care. There must be daily observation of all animals and there must be a mechanism of direct
and frequent communication of daily observations of animal health and well-being issues to the attending
veterinarian.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In Building 439, the ceiling had a large and relatively deep hole which could compromise the structural integrity of
the building as well as provide a nesting area for vermin. The door frames securing the doors leading to the outside
enclosure space within each of the pens had completely rusted off at the base. The ceiling/roof had surface
peeling.
Two pen gates in C barn had holes from excessive rust which could lead to a structural failure of the pen gate to
secure the animals.
Indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect animals
from injury and contain the animals. Correct by Sept. 30. 2016.
