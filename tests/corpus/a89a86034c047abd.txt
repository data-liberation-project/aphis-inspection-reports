SEPARATION.
On May 16, 2016 an adult female ring-tailed coatimundi named Stella was able to gain access to an area where a
juvenile Bennett(cid:25)s wallaby named Alfie was being housed. Once Stella gained access to the area she attacked Alfie
causing injury. The licensee took Alfie to their attending veterinarian and Alfie ended up needing to have his middle
digit amputated on his left front foot and approximately an inch amputated from his tail. Animals that are housed
together that are not compatible can cause injury or discomfort. All animals that are housed together must be
compatible.
