ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility acquired two capuchin monkeys in April 2015. The vet records that arrived with the animals indicated
they were last examined in 2000. The attending vet has not examined these animals to assess their health as a
baseline of care. The current professional standard of care for non human primates is that during a quarantine
period the animals would have a vet assessment to assure their health care needs are being met and to rule out
any zoonotic disease hazards including TB. In addition one of the capuchins was to be transferred out of state to
another facility the next day and did not have a valid health certificate at the time of the inspection. The facility
needs to have the animals assessed by the vet for their health and well being and to ensure the vet has proper
authority in the guidance and care of the animals. In addition a valid health certificate must accompany the animal
out of state.
Correct Immediately.
(The licensee contacted the inspector by phone within an hour to state he had vet appointments for both animals)
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee at the time of the inspection.
