CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The enclosures housing the Black and White lemurs as well as the enclosures housing the Olive Baboons need to
be cleaned. There was a build-up of food waste and fecal material on the floors and shelving platforms. Buildup of
wastes should be removed to promote the health of the animals and to reduce disease hazards. Excreta and food
waste must be removed from inside each indoor primary enclosure daily and from underneath them as often as
necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent the nonhuman primates from
becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors. The Indoor primary enclosures must
also be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. These enclosures were cleaned at the time of the inspection.
Correct from this day forward.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***The enclosure housing the cougars need to be cleaned. Upon inspection there was an accumulation of carcass
materials within the enclosures. When providing carcasses, after 24 hours the carcasses should be removed to
prevent disease spread and to promote the health of the animals.
***The enclosure housing the African Crested Porcupines had a buildup up food and fecal material. This enclosure
needs to be cleaned often enough to remove the waste and prevent future accumulations. The waste should be
removed to promote the health of the animals and to reduce disease hazards.
