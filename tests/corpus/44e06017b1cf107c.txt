ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult male golden retriever mix named "Sunshine" has a matted hair coat. Approximately 25% of the hair coat is
matted, with the mats located behind all four legs. The mats vary in size from 2 to 6 inches in width and are pulling
tight against the skin on the legs. Some of the mats under the tail contain dry fecal material and small gray debris.
Matting can be painful and can lead to skin disease and other medical conditions. A program of routine hair coat
maintenance must be established and maintained for all dogs at this facility in order to prevent diseases associated
with excessive matting. To be corrected by: April 29, 2016.
