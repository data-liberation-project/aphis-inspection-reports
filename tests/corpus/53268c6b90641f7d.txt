Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:15 am on
19OCT2022.

Called and left message, waited 1/2 hour. Mrs. Curtis returned my call and left a message. She is out of town today and
won't return until next week. She is moving and submitted a change of address request. Will inspect new site when the
request comes through.
