ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The two reindeer cows had overgrown hooves to the point that the front dewclaws made contact with the ground
and, for the cow named Bossy, the front toes were starting to cross. Excessive hoof growth can contribute to
abnormal gait which can cause a change in the toe joints and may contribute to osteoarthritis especially in older
animals such as these.
The facility needs to have a better plan to manage the growth of the hooves to prevent them from getting too long
instead of only once a year when the antler velvet is shed. The attending veterinarian was contacted immediately
following the inspection to setup an appointment for hoof trimming and evaluation of the animals.
The program of veterinary care must include appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases,
injuries, and other conditions that may arise.

FEEDING.
The hay and mineral block supplement for two reindeer cows are being fed directly on the ground. These food
items can be easily contaminated by excreta in the pen and by the animals walking through the hay, which is
directly in front of the water receptacle and the entrance to the shelter structure.
Contamination of feed can lead to intestinal parasitism or overgrowth of microorganisms which pose a risk to the
health of these animals and feeding off the ground reduces this risk.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health.
