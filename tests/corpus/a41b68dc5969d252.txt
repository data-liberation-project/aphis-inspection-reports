2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are two piles of loose, reddish-brown colored feces with mucous in one enclosure with two dogs. "Robert" a
male, adult Pekingese (number 65) in this enclosure was lethargic and did not move around as much as the other
dog. Upon examination there was also a build-up of loose feces at the base of his tail and rear end. Lethargy and
loose feces may be caused by parasites and/or diseases. This dog must be examined by a veterinarian to ensure
that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This
information must be documented in writing and made available to the inspector upon request.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO
and Kendall Lundy, ACI.
