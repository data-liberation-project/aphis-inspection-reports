ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***At least 2 of the 14 Ibex had excessively long hooves. The tips of the hooves were growing upward, away from
the ground. Even though these Ibex were not limping when they walked, they were having to stand and walk in an
abnormal position on their heels. Excessively long hooves can cause the animals to stand in abnormal positions,
can cause pain, and can affect the gait. The licensee must trim these hooves and must establish an effective hoof
maintenance program.
***Two medications located in the refrigerator were past their expiration dates. There were 6 vials of Feline
Rhino-Calici-Panleuk killed vaccine with an expiration date of August 13, 2015. The Curator stated that she was
aware that the vaccine was expired, but was having difficulty locating this product for purchase. She stated that she
was planning to use the expired vaccine in her exotic cats if she didn't find additional product. There was also a
bottle of Dura-Pen with an expiration date of November, 2015. Expired medications or vaccines can lose their
effectiveness and their ability to prevent or control disease. The licensee must ensure that all medications and
vaccines are within their expiration dates at all times.
TO BE CORRECTED BY DECEMBER 9, 2015.
