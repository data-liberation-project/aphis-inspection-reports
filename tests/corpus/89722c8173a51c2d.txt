2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One tufted capuchin was noted to have a hair loss on the tail and top of the forearms extending to the fingers at the
time of inspection. The underlying skin in these areas is pigmented, typical for the species and there is no obvious
sign of redness. There is no crusting of the skin or obvious signs of scratching and the animal was not observed
hair plucking during inspection. The primates condition has not changed since the last inspection and the licensee
stated that the monkey was not currently receiving any treatment for this or any other medical condition. The new
attending veterinarian did not recommend diagnostics or treatment but there was no documentation at the facility
regarding the hair loss and no record of the veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations regarding this animal or the hair loss.
While the condition has not worsened, it also has not improved and may require further diagnostic work. Any
recommendations by the veterinarian must be written and maintained by the facility to assure that the
recommendations are followed. Correct by having this animal re-examined by a licensed veterinarian and following
all recommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Additionally the licensee shall maintain record of this
examination, the veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations, and any treatments for future evaluation by APHIS Officials upon
request.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility Director.
