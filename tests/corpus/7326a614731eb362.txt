3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the breeding barn, an enclosure had rusty wire that had broken in several places, impacting the structural
integrity of the enclosure. The enclosure was no longer in good repair, and the broken wire created a sharp point
that could cause injury to the rabbits. All enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to
protect the rabbits from injury. The facility immediately moved the rabbits out of the enclosure into a structurally
sound enclosure in good repair.
Corrected during inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the general manager.
