Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC did not review the program of humane care and use of animals at the intervals required by the Animal Welfare
Act, which is every 6 months. Records indicates that the last time the IACUC reviewed the program for humane care and
use of animals was 9 months ago in October 2021. One of the IACUC functions is to review at least once every 6
months, the research facility's program for humane care and use of animals. This is to ensure protocol changes, adverse
events, personnel changes, and other issues are addressed in a timely manner.
To be corrected by August 2022
2.31(c)(2)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Records indicate that IACUC failed to inspect facility at least once every 6 months. Last facility inspection was 8 months

including animals study areas.
To be corrected by August 2022.
2.36(b)(6)

Annual report.


The USDA annual report filed for fiscal year 2021 did not account correctly the use of dogs and cats. Both dogs and cats
were listed under Column C instead of Column D. The animals were used in procedures accompanying pain or distress.
Properly identifying animals used in research on the annual report is necessary to inform the Institutional Official and
USDA Animal Care of the scope and extent of the animal use at the facility.
To be corrected by August 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
