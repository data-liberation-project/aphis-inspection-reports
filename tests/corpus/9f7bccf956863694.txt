3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Although the side walls of the enclosures measured approximately 7 inches in height, during the inspection, there were 3
guinea pigs observed to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The enclosure must contain the animals. The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times
and does not allow them to escape.
3.26(a) Repeat

Facilities, indoor.
Although there was a wall heater, the temperature in the guinea pig housing facility was 54 degrees F as measured with a
kestrel.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may cause discomfort and
predispose them to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
