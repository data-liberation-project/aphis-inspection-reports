Sanitation.
There was large number of black flies present in the swine housing areas. The flies were most noticeable in the farrowing
and weaned piglet housing area where the ambient temperature is kept warmer than the other housing areas. The
insects were observed on the walls and other surfaces, flying inside the rooms, and flies were also present on many of the
animals. Although the facility is utilizing fly spray and there is fly tape above all of the pens, these methods were not
effectively controlling and reducing the number of black flies.

Per this Section, a safe and effective method to control insects and other pests should be established and maintained to
minimize and control unwanted pests. Flies can transmit disease-causing agents and can also be distressful to the
animals. A more effective pest control program should be put in place to reduce and better control insects for the health
and comfort of the animals. Correct by 5/9/22

This inspection was conducted 4/27/22 and the exit briefing was held 4/29/22 with facility representatives.
