FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The building's temperature inside during inspection was 52 degrees F (measured on the kestrel) and the facility has
not connected the heater installation. While the guinea pigs aren't displaying signs of being cold today, this week's
outdoor temperature is forecasted to get much colder by Thursday night. Cold temperatures may cause discomfort
to animals and increase risk for health problems. The facility must install the heater and not allow the indoor
temperature to fall below 60 degrees F.
