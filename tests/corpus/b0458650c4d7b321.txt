2.33(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
**Several expired medications were found in the drug cabinet during the inspection: 1 vial Euthasol lot #E0345 exp
12/2022; 1 bottle topical oral Lidocaine HCL lot #2616C, exp 05/2022; 1 vial injectable Dexmedesed, lot #34242, exp
01/2023; 1 vial injectable Butorphanol Tartrate, lot #AH2009T, exp 01/2023. A review of surgical and medical records
indicated 3 surgeries (2 neuters and 1 spay) were performed on 02/01/2023: dog #2282-23, 4 year old male pit mix; dog
#2104-23, 1 year old male pit mix; cat #179-23, 1 year old DSH female in addition to another neuter surgery scheduled to
take place on 02/15/2023. The SOP for the controlled drug log indicates the following: inventory expiration dates are
checked regularly each week in the lab, expired drugs are removed, labelled as expired and noted as removed in the
open drug entry form; expired medications are moved to the top shelf that is labelled for expired drugs and the Program
Chair or Attending Veterinarian is notified. The procedure outlined in the facility standard operating procedure for expired
medications was not followed. The use of expired medications is not considered to be acceptable veterinary practice and
has the potential to adversely affect the animal's welfare. It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure
appropriate methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries in order to provide adequate
veterinary care to the animals maintained at the facility.



Correction: the expired drugs were removed and placed in the expired section during the inspection.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
**At the time of inspection, the written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs had not been updated. The written
program of veterinary care (PVC) care had not been reviewed and signed by the current attending veterinarian. Failure to
establish and maintain a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs does not allow for the facility to provide
appropriate treatments and care of the animals. A written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs must be established
and maintained so that the facility has a current plan that provides for adequate preventative care and treatments as
deemed necessary. The plan must include all required components as listed in the Animal Welfare Act and Animal
Welfare Regulations, Part 3, Subpart A, Section 3.13.
