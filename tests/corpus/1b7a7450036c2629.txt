2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC did not complete a facility or program review in the Fall/Winter of 2016. No completed semi-annual
evaluation reports have been sent to the Institutional Official because no review was completed. There has been an
inspection in May 2017 and July 2016, both of these included letters to the Institutional Official. It is important to
involve the Institutional Official in the IACUC's evaluations of the research facility and to inform them of the status of
the facility's programs to allow the Institutional Official to follow up on correction of significant deficiencies. This
ensures that appropriate authority can be exercised by the Institutional Official when needed to support the facility's
continued humane care and use of animals. The IACUC must prepare reports based on the facility program review
and inspection, update them every six months, submit them to the Institutional Official in a timely fashion, and have
them available for inspection by APHIS officials.Correct by August 26, 2017.
No covered species present at the time of the inspection.
