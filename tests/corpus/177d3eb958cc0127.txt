2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was a male red-handed tamarin with hair loss on the tip of his tail. The area of hair loss extended approximately 3
inches up from the tip of the tail and the hair appeared in patches with large areas of exposed skin present. Approximately
2 inches up from the tip of the tail in an area without hair, there was a red and inflamed looking lesion/wound which
appeared about 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. According to the applicant, he had been aware of the tamarin's condition and felt that
the hair loss had been sudden but couldn't be sure exactly how long it had been that way. He also stated that he had
adjusted some of the enrichment in the animal's enclosure and he felt the animal's condition had improved since it had
originally been identified, however, the lesion was still present and a veterinarian had not been contacted about the
animal's condition. This animal's condition could be due to an injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition that
could cause discomfort. The applicant must ensure that a veterinarian is consulted regarding this animal's condition so
that a diagnosis can be made and a treatment plan developed and followed. The applicant must ensure that all animals
receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

Sheltered housing facilities.


The facility housing nonhuman primates is surrounded by a perimeter fence, however, there is a portion of the fence that
is less than the required 6 feet in height. The majority of the fence is 6 ft high, however, there is an approximately 100 ft
section that is only 5 ft high. The perimeter fence must be constructed as required so that it protects nonhuman primates
by restricting unauthorized humans and animals from having contact with the animals in the facility. The applicant must
ensure that the perimeter fence is of sufficient height, as required by this section, to keep unwanted species out at all
times.

The facility area housing the Asian small-clawed otters is surrounded by a perimeter fence, however, there is a portion of
the fence that is less than the required 6 feet in height. The majority of the fence is 6 ft high, however, there is an
approximately 100 ft section that is only 5 ft high. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the otters by
restricting unauthorized humans and animals from having contact with the otters. The applicant must ensure that the
perimeter fence is of sufficient height, as required by this section, to keep unwanted species out and so that it can function
as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility at all times.
