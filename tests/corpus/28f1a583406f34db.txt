ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 on
20-Nov-17.Upon arrival, I called the phone numbers listed and waited 30 min. A facility representative called me to
notify me they were out of the area and would not be able to return that day for the inspection process. Current
hours of operation were discussed.
This is the first attempted inspection.
