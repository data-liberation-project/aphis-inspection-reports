FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
Total Airport Services is the Intermediate Handler which operates the cargo office for Lufthansa at SFO. Lufthansa
flight number 454 arrived from France carrying two dogs in Cargo: one dog, a Carlin, originating from Portugal with
waybill number 020-50885166, and the other a Pug originating from Lithuania, with waybill number 020-72442473.
The dogs were inspected in the cargo office. It was observed that both dogs were in crates where there was only
one food / water receptacle. Transporters should ensure that there is a food AND a water receptacle in each
enclosure at the time of consignment, so that the animal can be properly cared for during transit.
Upon taking possession of a dog or cat in transit, the intermediate handler is assuming the responsibility of ensuring
that all animal welfare act regulation requirements are met. The Intermediate Handler should take steps to ensure
that the carriers for which they handle animal cargo abide by these requirements.
An exit interview was conducted with a cargo office representative.
