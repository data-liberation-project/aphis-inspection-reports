ANNUAL REPORT.
USDA Annual Report.
1. The FY 13 Annual Report submitted to the USDA by the research facility stated that all of the animals used by
the facility during FY 13 had been used only for pain category columns "B" and "C" research activities. However at
the time of the facility inspection conducted during FY 13, there were animals present that had undergone research
activities where appropriate anesthetic, analgesic, or tranquilizing agents had been used. The numbers of animals
used for those types of research activities should have been reported under pain category column "D" on the FY 13
Annual Report.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the annual report submitted by a research facility should state the common
names and the numbers of animals upon which experiments, teaching, research, surgery, or tests were conducted
that involved accompanying pain or distress to the animals and for which appropriate anesthetic, analgesic, or
tranquilizing agents were used. The numbers of animals so used should be reported under pain category column
"D" on the USDA Annual Report.
The research facility needs to submit a corrected Annual Report for FY 13 to the Eastern Regional Office of the
USDA/APHIS/Animal Care that includes the number of animals used under the applicable pain category columns.
Correct by 6/20/14.
