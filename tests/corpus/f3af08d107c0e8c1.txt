Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1430 on

Called Mark, normal working hours are 9-3, but due to unforeseen circumstances they closed slightly early on the
day I attempted inspection.
