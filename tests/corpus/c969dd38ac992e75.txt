3.1(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
In the outdoor enclosures, the pen dividers are constructed of chain link fence with metal pipe along the top and bottom to
hold the wire tight. Five of the sections on the bottom pipe have excessive rust on their surfaces. The rust has caused 2
sections of pipe to rust entirely through so there is no connection with the fence to keep it tight. The two sections have
sharp, jagged edges from the deteriorated metal. These rusted surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized and
have no structural strength. The jagged edges could cause injury to the dogs as they move about. These pipes must be
repaired or replaced to allow the proper cleaning and sanitizing and to prevent injury to the dogs.
