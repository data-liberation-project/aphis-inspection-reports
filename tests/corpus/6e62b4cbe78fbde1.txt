*** This winter the rabbits were not secured in a building but allowed to run loose around the property. Several
rabbits were observed near the main building and in the small shed storing hay items. Allowing the animals to run
loose like this does not provide them with protection against predators or contain them for safety. This needs to be
addressed for their health and well being.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** A male Elk is in an enclosure next to the main building and although there are two walls to provide some
protection from wind, there is no overhang to allow the animal to get out of inclement weather if it wants to. Per this
regulation animals housed outdoors need to have access to a shelter for their health and well being.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** In the digester building, there are two Zebra's held in a transport trailer due to cold temperatures. This trailer
does not allow the animals enough space for adequate freedom of movement. Due to cold temperatures
experienced in this area for several months of the year, a warm barn or building should be designated for these
animals so a trailer is not used due to inadequate space in the park. This needs to be addressed for the health of
the animals.
3.131(c) REPEATSANITATION.
*** The digester building which is used as a warm room in the winter months is currently housing kangaroos, a
tortoise, and a trailer with two zebra. The area around the animals is filled with farm equipment, open buckets of hay
and grain, tarps and other miscellaneous items. The area is very challenging to navigate with the trailer in the
middle of the building. Premises housing animals should be designated animal space and other items kept
elsewhere for the safety of the animals and to facilitate cleaning in the area. This building was discussed last year
for this same issue and needs to be addressed and a permanent solution for winter months needs to be in place so
animals that need a warm space for 4-5 months of the year have it in an appropriate design that facilitates adequate
space and husbandry practices.
