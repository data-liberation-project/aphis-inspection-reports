PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At the time of inspection, one outdoor enclosure contained two large breed dogs that had access to one shelter
structure. This one shelter structure did not provide enough space for even one of these large dogs. Inadequate
shelter space causes the dogs to be exposed to the elements which can result in discomfort from wet conditions,
wind, and temperature extremes. The licensee must ensure that outdoor facilities for dogs include one or more
shelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow
each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely.
