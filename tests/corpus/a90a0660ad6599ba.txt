3.1(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
There are multiple areas of clutter and accumulation of items on the floor of the south room of the house adjacent to the
kitchen area. This is an area where dogs are allowed to roam freely in the house. There were nine dogs going in and out
of the area during the inspection.

Accumulation of items on the floor that are not necessary for daily husbandry practices may hinder the ability to
adequately clean and sanitize dog contact areas. Clutter may also predispose the area to vermin and pest infestation.
Animal housing areas must be kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment, furniture and stored materials.

Non-compliance under 3.1(b) had been previously been identified and reported on inspection on 04DECEMBER2019 and
25MAR2021
3.11(b)(2) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Inside the house there are multiple areas with accumulation of grime and debris on the floor and items in the room,
including a blue plastic tote and fan in the south entry room area. There were 9 dogs freely roaming in the house at the


time of inspection.
A buildup of grime and debris on and between surfaces makes it more difficult to adequately clean and sanitize the
affected surfaces. Primary enclosures and enclosure furnishings used for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.

Non-compliance under 3.11 (b)(2) was previously identified on the previous inspections and reports dated 08MAY2018
and 22APRIL2019, 04DECEMBER2019 and 25MAR2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
