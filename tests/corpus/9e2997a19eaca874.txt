2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A red fox was observed with abnormally increased redness and yellowish crusts/secretions adhered to facial hairs
around both eyes. The licensee informed the fox's medical condition was a reoccurring issue, and apparently due
to allergies. The licensee also informed that periodically the Attending Veterinarian (AV) prescribes an injectable
anti-inflammatory drug to treat the allergies. Both inspectors assessed the fox's current condition and is serious
enough to require a veterinary examination and assessment followed by appropriate treatment of the condition. To
ensure adequate veterinary care for the fox, the AV needs to examine, diagnose and treat as appropriate to
alleviate ongoing discomfort and pain.

An adult lion identified as "(cid:28)Goldie"(cid:29) was observed by the licensee on or about May 29, 2015 and determined by the
licensee to have a closed pyometra. The licensee contacted the Attending Veterinarian (AV) and stated that the AV
prescribed antibiotics but did not come out to examine or confirm the licensee(cid:25)'s diagnosis. The lion'(cid:25)s condition
deteriorated the following day and the licensee contacted the AV who gave permission to euthanize the lion by
gunshot. On September 21, 2015 the USDA inspector for the facility tried to contact the AV for confirmation on the
diagnosis and instructions provided to the licensee concerning the care, treatment and euthanasia of "Goldie." The
AV was traveling/unavailable and medical records were not available at the licensee(cid:25)'s facility, or accessible through
the AV.
A closed pyometra is a life threatening emergency that requires prompt veterinary intervention. The licensee must
establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include appropriate methods to diagnose and
treat emergency disease conditions. The licensee failed to provide adequate veterinary care by not getting the lion
examined and the lion'(cid:25)s condition diagnosed and treated. Potential life threatening emergencies must be
appropriately diagnosed by the AV and treated to minimize potential animal suffering.

The program of veterinary care (PVC) listed gunshot by the licensee as a method of euthanasia, but did not providedetails on which species gunshot was allowed, who has been trained and qualified to perform the procedure,
explain or provide any details on how gunshot would be used to ensure euthanasia is done humanely, produces
rapid unconsciousness and death without evidence of pain or distress and in a manner consistent with the AVMA
Guidelines for Euthanasia of Animals 2013 Edition. Gunshot is not an acceptable method for routine euthanasia
when other more acceptable methods are available. The PVC cannot list gunshot as a routine method of
euthanasia without there being sufficient detail on which species it is to be used, who is trained and qualified to
perform the procedure and how the euthanasia is performed and in a manner consistent with the AVMA Guidelines.

The licensee reported that a female tiger cub was found injured on the morning of August 28, 2015; injuries included
a swollen neck and bite marks. The licensee reported the finding to the Attending Veterinarian (AV), who
prescribed via telephone medications to treat the inflammation and fever. The licensee stated the AV's plan was to
control the inflammation and fever first, and then to physically sedate and treat on Sunday August 29, 2015. After
one day of unsuccessful therapy, the cub's health condition deteriorated and died on August 28, 2015. The
licensee failed to provide adequate veterinary care to the cub by not having the AV examine, diagnose and treat the
animal's serious condition and deterioration. Medical conditions that are serious in nature and potentially life
threatening to regulated animals must be examined by the AV in order to appropriately assess the condition and to
provide adequate veterinary medical care.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The back door which provides inclement weather protection on the left side of the baboon(cid:25)s outdoor shelter is
broken, splintered and has a hole which no longer allows the surface to be cleaned and sanitized nor provide
sufficient inclement weather protection. All surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates must be structurally sound,
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. This door must be replaced or repaired to provide
adequate inclement weather protection for the baboons.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
A single brown lemur is housed in barn structure without being able to see and hear any other nonhuman primate or
a compatible species. When first observed, this animal was doing repetitive backflips which could be indicative of
psychological distress. The Environmental Enhancement plan did not include provisions for social grouping oraddress considerations for a nonhuman primate that could not see or hear other compatible nonhuman primates or
have possible psychological distress secondary to the social isolation of this animal. There was no written
documentation that the attending veterinarian had approved the plan.
The Environmental Enhancement plan must include provisions for social housing, special attention for the lemur not
being able to hear and see nonhuman primates of its own or a compatible species and address any signs of
psychological distress as manifested by stereotypic behaviors. The plan must be specifically approved by the
attending veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The plywood siding of the bobcat enclosure's shelter house was observed to be extremely damaged/rotted.
Approximately a 1/3 of the plywood siding at the back of the shelter was missing and the remainder of the siding
was rotting and separating from the shelter. There were several sharp wood splinters/points were present in the
affected areas which are injury hazards for the animals.
The inside surface of the plywood roof for the tiger enclosure adjacent to the cougar enclosure is rotting and
warping. This portion of the roof is deteriorating and not in good repair. It must be replaced or repaired to prevent
possible injury to the contained tigers.
The sides of the shelter for the single housed ataxic lion are broken, worn and in disrepair. The shelter must be
repaired to maintain the structural soundness of the shelter and to provide adequate shelter for the lion.
Also, the lock out portion for the bear's primary enclosure had a corner of the dirt flooring dug out leaving a hole with
exposed support mesh wire which could create an injury hazard. Housing facilities for all regulated animals shall be
structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury while containing the
animals. To prevent discomfort, unhealthy conditions and potential injury to the animals, both the plywood siding at
the bobcat's enclosure and the floor at the bear's enclosure should be repaired/replaced.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A medium-size utility trailer loaded with several used/opened produce boxes was observed next to the food storagecontainer and food preparation area. The opened boxes contained old produce and food wastes which were
attracting an excessive amount of flies and insects creating unsanitary conditions in close proximity of food
storage/preparation areas. Also, due to farm animal wastes deposited near the coati mundi and red fox primary
enclosures, an excessive amount of flies and insects were observed as well, creating unsanitary conditions.
The facility shall make provision for the quick removal and disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding, dead
animals, trash and debris, especially around food storage/preparations areas. Disposal facilities shall be so
provided and operated as to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards. The disposal facilities and
any disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding, dead animals, trash, and debris shall comply with applicable
Federal, State, and local laws and regulations relating to pollution control or the protection of the environment.
