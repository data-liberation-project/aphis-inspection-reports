3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
There were no dates for the administration of distemper and parvovirus vaccines for adult dogs. Licensee stated that
distemper and parvovirus vaccines are given at least annually to adult dogs. Failure to keep records on vaccines and
treatments given to dogs makes it difficult to determine when vaccines and treatments were last administered. Licensee
must keep and maintain records of the names of all vaccines and treatments given to adult dogs. To be corrected by
March 28, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
