2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On Saturday, April 16th at approx. 1:00 PM, a spider monkey "Big Guy" got out of his enclosure and was
subsequently netted and placed back into the exhibit without incident.
This incident occurred because the keeper did not follow the establish SOP, and a door into the exhibit was not
properly closed and locked after the exhibit had undergone plumbing maintenance.
The keeper has already been disciplined and has/will have tutorials on the established SOPs concerning security of
animals and their enclosures.
The facility is instituting additional measures to prevent this type of incident from occurring again in the future.
The escape of an animal from its' enclosure potentially places that animal for risk of trauma, behavioral stress, &
physical harm during the time that they are exposed to the outside environment & elements, as well as during the
recapture process.
Handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible to minimize these potential risks.
No further correction necessary at this time.
This is a focused inspection of the circumstances leading to the recent escape of a spider monkey.
The exit interview was conducted on-site with the Deputy Director of Animal Operations.
