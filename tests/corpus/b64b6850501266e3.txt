3.56(b)(3)

Sanitation.
Two rabbit enclosures are not being sanitized correctly and one has some rust developing on the metal bars of the
enclosure. The enclosures are cleaned weekly with a bleach spray followed with a detergent and water solution. One
enclosure has areas of wire caging with no coating and is beginning to rust. Small quantities of rust were able to be
removed by the inspector touching the wires. Proper sanitization of enclosures in necessary to prevent disease hazards to
the animals housed within. Rust can impede the sanitation process by creating an irregular surface in the metal that
prevent the disinfectant from contacting all surface areas. Correct by 15 May 2022 by disinfecting the rabbit enclosures at
least once every 30 days in accordance with 3.56(b)(3) such as using a detergent and soap, followed by a disinfectant,
and by eliminating areas of rusted wire.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
