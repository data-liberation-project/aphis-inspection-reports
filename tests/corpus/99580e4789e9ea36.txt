3.1(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are approximately 4 kennels in the housing trailer that have areas of rust build up. The
presence of rust may prevent the required cleaning and sanitizing and/or can affect the integrity of the surface.
Surfaces that come in contact with the dogs should be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and
sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface. A system should be in place to identify,
repair/replace rusted surfaces that come in contact with the dogs.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are 2 dog kennels with wood floors that are worn and not sealed. In the trailer, there is a small section
missing of the linoleum floor and the underlying surface is exposed.These surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized and can lead to an increase risk of disease hazards in animal areas.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities including houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility -must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that
allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.
