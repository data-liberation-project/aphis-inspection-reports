There is a female Shihtzu #218 that has an injured left eye that is dark red in color and swollen and very bloodshot
in the throughout the white of the eye, and in the center of the eyeball. There is a small circular protrusion in the
center of the eye that could be a tear or possible puncture that could be the source of the injury or result. This is
possibly a recent injury and had not been observed by the licensee until the inspection, and has not been treated.
This same female had a large buildup of brown material on her teeth, with swollen and red gums due to
inflammation. There were 2 areas on the gums where they were bleeding slightly around two teeth due to
inflammation.
It is important that all injuries are identified as soon as possible and proper diagnosis and treatment is provided to
decrease the pain or discomfort to the animal.
The licensee needs to contact the attending veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the eye.
