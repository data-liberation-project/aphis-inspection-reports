Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
Two dogs had arrived at the cargo office for Emirates airlines on an international flight on waybill # 176-33073740. The
crates for the two dogs did not have a completed consignor's certification regarding feeding and watering displayed
anywhere. In fact, there was a sticker applied where this information should have been filled in by the consignor, but it
was left blank.

Failure to ensure that this certification, which tells when the animals were last offered food and water, and what feeding
and watering instructions are during travel, could result in improper care of the animals which could be detrimental to their
well-being.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a representative of the airline at the cargo office.
