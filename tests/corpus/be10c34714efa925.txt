Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Record of Acquisition of Dogs (APHIS Form 7005) was not up to date at the time of inspection. A Goldendoodle
(microchip number 900215002579129) was listed on the form but not present in this facility. An additional male poodle
(microchip number 99000002978154) was present in this facility for breeding but was not listed on the APHIS Form 7005.
A female Golden Retriever (microchip number 99000002478178) was present in the facility but not listed on the APHIS
Form 7005. At this time, it is unclear to the inspector that there is a separation of business between this license and
another USDA license.
Accurate acquisition information is necessary for APHIS officials to make positive identification of animals during
inspection and to properly trace their movements. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain an approved method of
documentation which fully and correctly disclose all information concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired,
owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or
otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her
possession or under his or her control. The licensee must ensure all required acquisition information is properly and
accurately documented at all times.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The self-feeders found in the outdoor enclosure housing 5 adult dogs needs to be cleaned and sanitized. There is an
approximate 1/2 inch wide by 12 inch long line of brown organic material in the tray of the self feeder. The buildup is thick
enough that the inspector used her fingernail to scrape the material off the feeder tray. The facility representative states
they cleaned this self feeder this morning but did not clean inside the self feeder where food was present.
A buildup of organic material within the self-feeders could increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dog. Used
primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and more
often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The
licensee must clean and sanitize the entire self-feeder and ensure that all aspects of the enclosure are maintained in a
clean and sanitized condition in order to support the health of the dogs.
