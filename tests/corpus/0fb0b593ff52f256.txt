EMPLOYEES.
On February 21, 2016 at approximately 11:20 a.m. an employee of the facility was bitten on her hand by a black
bear and required stitches. The employee was attempting to lure a bear that had awakened from hibernation out of
the den so she could put fresh food in the den. The employee grabbed some vegetation that was growing outside
the enclosure and put her hand in the enclosure with the food to lure the bear out. While she was doing this she did
not realize that the other bear in the enclosure whom was already out of the den had approached from the other
side of her to get the food and she was bitten. The zookeeper stated that they have training procedures in place for
all employees and this employee did receive the training. However, there is no documentation to verify that
adequate training has been provided to the employee. All employees should receive adequate species specific
training for the animals that they are working with. Also, written documentation should be maintained that verifies
the employee has received the training.
