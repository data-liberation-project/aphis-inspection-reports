INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC semi-annual facility checklist and report for November 2014 shows that indoor animal and study areas
were inspected, but oudoor animal facilities, which includes the barn, goat, pig and llama areas, were not. Regular
reviews are necessary to ensure IACUC oversight of animal facilities. The IACUC, as an agent of the research
facility, should Inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research facility's animal facilities, including animal
study areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A-Animal Welfare, as a basis for evaluation.

The following housekeeping issues were noted: 1 ) In the barn, the refrigerator used to store medical materials had
a moderate accumulation of debris collecting. 2) In the indoor/ outdoor kidding area, there was a broken heat lamp
in an area that the goats could access. 3) In the indoor/ outdoor kidding area, there was debris and some cobwebs
present. 4) In goat pen number 2, a section of the back fence was in disrepair and sharp points were protruding into
the animal enclosure. There were no goats housed in pen 2 at time of inspection.
Animal areas, including buildings and grounds, should be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
