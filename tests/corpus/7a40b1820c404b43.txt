Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee has not employed an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements, and does not have a written
program of veterinary care. There are animals in need of veterinary care. The licensee must have an attending
veterinarian and written program of veterinary care, including regularly scheduled visits to the facility.
2.40(b)(3) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
*** Two goats housed with the sheep had loose feces dried on the hair of their tails and were also thin.
*** The brown alpaca still has ocular discharge draining from the left eye, matting the hair underneath the halter. This
animal is also thin with prominent ribs and vertebrae when palpated.
****A small, mostly white Nigerian dwarf goat was observed to limp intermittently on the right front leg, and was walking
stiffly with the hind legs.
The animals have not seen a veterinarian, nor have the conditions been communicated to a veterinarian for guidance,
and these conditions are indicative of poor animal welfare. The facility must ensure that the animals receive appropriate
veterinary care and ensure that they are communicating problems in a time and accurate fashion to the attending
veterinarian.



*** The female binturong was found dead in the enclosure unexpectedly about three weeks ago according to the licensee.
The death of the animal was not communicated to a veterinarian nor was any further action taken even though it was co
housed with another binturong, that has not been evaluated for the possibility of contagious disease or adverse
husbandry conditions that may have contributed to or resulted in the female binturong’s death.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There is no record of disposition for animals that have left the facility with friends of the licensee including (hedgehogs,
kinkajou, binturong, fennec fox, coati, armadillos, chinchillas, etc.). These records must be maintained as part of the
recordkeeping process to manage movement of animals for follow up on their health and welfare.

Facilities, general.
** There is still a section of wire on the back panel of the crested porcupine enclosure that has sharp edges protruding
into the enclosure that could be a potential source of injury and is a hazard to the animal. This section of wire must be
kept in good repair for the safety of the animal.

*** The two pigs housed in the outdoor shelter adjacent to the ducks and turkey has tarp material hanging down on the
sides of the chain link enclosure that is chewed and torn. This material could be an ingestion hazard and should be
removed for the safety of the animals.



** The shelter for the goats and sheep has wood that has been chewed, damaging the structural integrity, and there is an
exposed nail protruding into the shelter that may injure animals rubbing against it. The facility must ensure that the shelter
is structurally sound and will not injure the animals.

**The alpacas and several goats are now in a large, fenced space surrounding empty enclosures at the front of the
property. This area needs to be cleaned of trash and debris that is a hazard to the animals including, a downed chain link
gate, a tarp on the ground, and loosely stacked unsecured fencing next to a shelter. These items are a potential injury
hazard to the animals and should be removed for their safety.

Feeding.
Two cavies had sparse and rough haircoat, with prominent vertebrae, and the diet provided was a mixture of dog food,
herbivore pellets, and minimal grains. Improper diet may result in poor hair coat, malnutrition, general poor health. The
facility must ensure the diet provided is appropriate for the species being fed.

Three sheep were emaciated, with very prominent vertebrae and pelvic bones, without adequate muscle covering, or any
fat, and were housed with four thin goats, with palpable vertebrae and pelvic bones also lacking muscle or fat coverage,
as well as a pony, donkey and a calf. A few flakes of hay were present in one corner. The animals were observed eating
straw from the manure pack as well as hay, which not all of them could access at one time. The facility must ensure that
animals receive sufficient diet in great enough quantities to maintain good body condition and animal welfare.

Two alpacas housed with four goats in the front of the property had an average body condition of 2 upon palpation.
These animals must be provided sufficient nutrition to maintain good body condition and health. The facility must ensure


that the animals have the appropriate diet in sufficient quantities to maintain good body condition.

Watering.
The water tank for the sheep, goats, donkey, and calf had brown and green sludgy material adhered to the sides and
heater, as well as floating green thin vegetation (algae) caught in the heater, and additional debris floating in the water.
Dirty water receptacles and unsanitary water may result in adverse animal health conditions and disease. The facility
must ensure that the water tank is kept clean and provide clean water to drink.
