Sanitation.
Hair and dust has been mostly removed from the enclosures in the fox room. However, areas of rust has been exposed
on some of the enclosures. Rust prevents effective cleaning and may harbor disease agents. Enclosures, litter trays, and
housing facilities shall be cleaned as often as necessary, including the elimination of rust, to minimize disease hazards
and reduce odors.

Sanitation.


The animals are housed in rooms of the applicants' primary residence. The rooms remain overcrowded with stored items.
Stored items include donated animal food, beeding, & other supplies, personal items, and a clothes dryer which is not in
use, to name a few. Stored items are stacked, nearly to the ceiling in some areas, creating paths through the home to
access the animals. There is minimal clearance to work with and access the animals, clean enclosures and housing
rooms, as well as provide repair to and maintain enclosures. Optimal animal welfare is hindered in such cramped
quarters. Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair to protect the the animals from injury and to facilitate
prescribed husbandry practices.
