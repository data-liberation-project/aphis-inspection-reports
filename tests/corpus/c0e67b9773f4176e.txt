INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In review of the protocol using male rabbits it was noted that a potentially painful procedure is being done and
appropriate relief is withheld without a written scientific justification. The IACUC must ensure that procedures that
may cause more than momentary pain be performed with appropriate analgesics unless withholding such agents is
justified scientifically.

MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
In the protocol using female rabbits volume bleeds are described as taking 30-40 mls of blood every 7-14 days.
There is not a method described to ensure the blood volume of the animal is sufficient prior to that volume and
frequency of blood removal.
The USDA inspector observed an alert rabbit being placed in a restraint device in dorsal recumbency prior to IV
anesthesia for a routine procedure. The rabbit squirmed and vocalized loudly prior to the anesthesia.
The facility must ensure that handling of all animals is done as expeditiously and carefully as possible for the
well-being of the animals.
