3.133 Critical

Separation.
On March 1, 2021, a representative of the facility reported an incident to APHIS that occurred toward the end of January,
2021 involving the deaths of two, white-tailed deer bucks. One buck was gored by another buck, and one buck became
entangled in a fence due to fighting during the rutting season. The IACUC-approved standard operating procedure (SOP)
for “TTU Deer Facility,” (SOP059), has been in effect since March 27, 2019 and states: “Male deer will be de-antlered
using a saw each year to prevent injury to other deer from fighting.”
Despite the fact that the facility is aware that incompatibility and serious fighting can occur during this season, they kept
the males together and also failed to follow this mitigating measure outlined in the SOP. The aggressive deer’s antlers
were sharp enough to cause mortal wounds.
Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible. Animals housed in the same enclosure shall not be
housed near animals that interfere with their health or cause them discomfort.
To be corrected by 17 September 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
