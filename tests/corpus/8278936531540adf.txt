Housing facilities, general.
In the south sheltered housing building, one of the outdoor portions of an enclosure housing one adult Doberman has
wires at the bottom of the gate that connect the chain link to the galvanized tubing frame. The ends of three of these
wires are protruding two to three inches into the enclosure.
Sharp points created by wires protruding into the dog's living space pose a risk of injury. Wires and other materials used
in the construction or repair of the enclosures must be positioned so they do not leave sharp points protruding into
enclosures that could injure the dogs. Existing sharp points must be eliminated.
