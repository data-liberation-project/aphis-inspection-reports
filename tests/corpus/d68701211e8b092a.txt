HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is still a build-up of dog oil, grime and dirt on the outside walls of the four soft-coated wheaten terrier
enclosures in the west kennel building. This build-up of dog oil, grime and dirt may lead to an increase of disease
causing organisms. The licensee must spot-clean and sanitize hard surfaces in contact with the dogs on a daily
basis to prevent an accumulation of grime and reduce disease hazards.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
