INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** At the time of the inspection, the lighting for the non human primates are turned on and off daily by animal care
staff and these times vary. This does not provide the animals with a regular diurnal light cycle. The squirrel monkeys
are showing signs of hair loss on their tails which could be due to the irregular light cycle if lights are turned on and
off at different times each day. As this is an indoor building, lights should be on a time schedule which mimics a
regular diurnal light cycle for the heath of the animals.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
*** Two juvenile exotic animals are housed in a building that does not have electricity. At the time of the inspection,
the widows were closed and there was a large amount of moisture condensation on the ceiling that was dropping in
the building. Inadequate ventilation in winter housing buildings can can contribute to respiratory and heath issues
and need to be addressed through appropriate means of fans, windows or other methods to minimize odors and
moisture condensation.
