2.40(b)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A pug puppy about 4 months ago was reportedly injured by the dam. The licensee didn't contact the attending
veterinarian and the treatment method used by the kennel resulted in its death. Lack of communication with the attending
veterinarian could cause dogs not to receive appropriate veterinary care. The attending veterinarian must be contacted
for animal sickness and injuries to ensure optimal medical treatment is provided to the affected animal.
2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
An approximately 16 wk old male pug (#79) that facility reports was born in the kennel and kept for breeding did not have
acquisition information on APHIS 7005 (Record of Animals on Hand) or a kennel card available that had the required
information. Records that fully and correctly disclose required information can be important if animal tracing needs to be
done for animal health purposes. Ensure that acquisition information is kept up to date to reflect the animal on hand in
the facility.
3.1(c)(1)(ii)

Housing facilities, general.


The housing area for the 5 large breed dogs has edges of tin exposed on a gate where they were seen able to stick their
nose and paws through. This area of tin was rough/sharp to the touch and could hurt the dogs. Ensure to repair or cover
these areas of tin so that it cannot injure the dogs.
3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
A partial pallet of bedding in sealed plastic bags is stored outside without any cover on it. Unopened bedding bags are
also stored on a shelf inside the same space as the dogs' sheltered housing. These conditions could allow contamination
or spoilage of bedding. Only open supplies of bedding stored in a leakproof container with a tightly fitting lid may be
stored in animal areas. Ensure that sealed bags of bedding is stored in an area that protects them from contamination
and spoilage.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
-The last record of adult vaccinations completed for parvo and distemper was 7-15-2020 and the written Program of
Veterinary Care (PVC ) requires dogs to be vaccinated annually for parvo and distemper.
-The written schedule of vaccinations for adults and puppies is not clear and does not match the vaccine schedule being
used for puppies (although the schedule in use does cover the required vaccines).
-A method of sampling adult dogs for blood parasites/heartworm and intestinal parasites is not described in the PVC.

Routine vaccinations of adults are required to protect each dog's health and the overall health of the kennel. An easily
understood written schedule of vaccinating adults and puppies that is approved by the attending veterinarian is required to
ensure dogs will be vaccinated at an appropriate schedule, and sampling for blood parasites/heartworm and intestinal
parasites helps ensure that the facility's program of deworming is protecting dogs from parasites. Adult dogs must be


vaccinated per the PVC and the facility needs to work with the attending veterinarian to get a plan for sampling parasites
and vaccine schedules in place that are clearly described.
