3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The washdown gutters under the dogs had excessive waste material that was creating strong odors around the dogs.
The washdowns were not being cleaned out on regular basis per the licensee. The build-up of waste and odors under
the dogs could cause the dogs to get sick. Ensure that the gutters/washouts under the dogs are cleaned regularly and
kept from getting excessively soiled.

The white PVC pipe inside the enclosures and areas on walls had a build-up of brown grime on it. Build-ups of grime in
areas that dogs can touch can increase their risk of getting sick. These areas need to be cleaned and sanitized more


often to prevent this build-up of grime.

Non-compliant items were corrected prior to exit interview.
3.11(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There was old and loose insulation and waste material on the floor of the kennel where the dogs were housed. This
material on the floor was soiled and doesn't allow regular cleaning of the floor. Ensure that the floor and areas around the
dogs are maintained free of clutter and waste material to protect the health of the dogs.

Item was corrected prior to exit interview.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
