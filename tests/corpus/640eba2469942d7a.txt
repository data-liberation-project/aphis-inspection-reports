ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Several of the dogs have matted fur that needs to be groomed. Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin
which can be painful and has a high potential to causing skin irritations. In addition several of the dogs have long
nails that need to be trimmed. Long nails can get caught in the wire mesh or curl under into the foot pad. Grooming
and nail trims should be done on a routine basis to prevent these issues for the health and comfort of the dogs.
Several of these dogs were the following:
1.dog # 120 has matted fur around the face and anal region with feces trapped in the fur.
2.dog # 2536506 a poodle has matted fur around his legs.
3.dog # 072514278 male has matted fur behind the ears and has no teeth.
4. dog # 88 Millie a sheba has long nails that need to be trimmed.
*** One large breed dog: Duke #71 has some pressure sores developing on the back legs. These sores need to be
assessed and a method of treatment developed for the comfort of the animal.
*** Several of the dogs had teeth that were varying stages of dental disease. Many had tarter build up and some of
the dogs had receding gum lines and a few dogs had lost several teeth. The facility currently does not have a plan
to address dental issues in these dogs. Bad teeth in dogs can cause health issues or be painful and there should be
a plan to treat and prevent dental disease for these animals.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** At least 20 enclosures had feeders that contained feces in the feeders. The facility states that the dogs defecate
and then carry the feces to the feeders. This is not a normal behavior for dogs and could be indicative of stress or
other health or behavioral issues. In addition one dog was retching in the enclosure and that particular dog would
often eat its own feces or a cagemates feces. The facility should communicate these abnormal behaviors to the vetto discuss options for management to reduce this behavior.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Whelping box #4 has a section of wire mesh over the bottom of the box that is losing the coating off the wire and
is showing signs of rust. This section of wire mesh needs to be replaced for the safety of the puppies.
*** One of the older puppy enclosures in the center of the kennel has lost the support beam under the bottom wire
mesh. This is causing the bottom wire to sag under the weight of the dogs. This beam needs to be replaced for the
safety of the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** Several of the whelping boxes have chewed edges around the door openings between the box and the wire
mesh. These chewed edges have sharp edges that could pose a potential hazard to the dogs. These edges need to
be sanded down and kept in good repair for the safety of the dogs.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The whelping boxes that have wire mesh for the puppy(cid:25)s in the boxes are not being picked up so the box can be
cleaned daily underneath. A few of these boxes have hair and urine that needs to be cleaned for the health of the
dogs. In addition a few of the large breed whelping boxes have an excessive amount of fur that is being shed out
and not removed. These boxes need to be spot cleaned daily for the health of the animals.
Correct by: end of business day and daily from this point forward.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Approximately 20 plus feeders had feces in the feeders with the food. The facility states that that dogs are
putting the feces in the feeders and they remove the feces at least once a day. Additionally the feeders have a layerof grime on the top of the feeder and into the feeder on the metal lip that controls flow of feed. These feeders need
to be cleaned and sanitized more frequently to reduce this accumulation of grime and to prevent contamination due
to feces in feeders.
3.12
EMPLOYEES.
*** The facility has several hundred adult dogs and only two adults working in the facility. Based on the number of
non- compliant items in this report there is evidence to support that the facility does not have enough employees to
carry out the level of husbandry practices and care required for this many animals. This needs to be addressed for
the welfare of the dogs.
