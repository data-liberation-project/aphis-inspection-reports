2.38(f)(1) REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
From 1/29/2015 to 12/20/2015 there have been 12 incidents of nonhuman primates escaping primary enclosures.
Nine of these incidents were due to human error and three incidents were due to enclosure hardware failure. In
these 12 incidents, the nonhuman primates were injured due to uncontrolled interactions with nonhuman primates in
other primary enclosures in the rooms where the escapes occurred. Some lost portions of their tongues while
others needed sutures and/or partial digit amputations. In order to prevent further escapes that lead to injury of
animals, the research facility must ensure that personnel always handle animals as carefully as possible and ensure
that the enclosures(cid:25)' hardware is appropriate to enable personnel to handle animals without injury.
Note: The facility previously identified these incidents and reported them to the ACUC that oversees the
responsible unit. Corrective actions have been implemented to minimize further incidents. Affected animals
promptly received appropriate veterinary care.

WATERING.
Sometime between 12/5/2015 and 12/9/2015 a drinking water supply line for 3 rhesus macaques became
disconnected. Upon discovery of the disconnected line on 12/9/2015, the three animals required specialized IV fluid
therapy. Two animals recovered after treatment; however one animal decompensated and was humanely
euthanized. The facility must ensure that non-human primates receive water either continuously but no less than
twice daily for an hour each time or as per veterinary treatments or as IACUC approved research protocols require.


Note: The facility previously identified this incident and reported it to the overseeing ACUC and also reported it to
USDA.
Correction: Ensure corrective actions are taken and that procedures in place are properly followed.
The inspection of non-human primates and related records of the Graduate School and the College of Letters andScience was conducted from 1/5/2016 thru 1/7/2016. The exit interview was conducted by the undersigned VMO
and VMO Barksdale with facility representatives on 1/8/2016.
