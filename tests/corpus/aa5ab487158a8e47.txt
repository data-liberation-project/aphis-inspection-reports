Facilities, indoor.
Interior surfaces. There is bare wood on the door frames in the new section of the guinea pig building. Building surfaces in
indoor guinea pig facilities must be constructed and maintained so that surfaces are impervious to moisture. The bare
wood on door frames must be sealed or covered with an impervious surface so that those surfaces can be repeatedly
cleaned, disinfected, will not retain odors, or allow moisture and liquids to be absorbed into the materials. Correct by
