ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 0900hrs on
05-Sep-19.
When I arrived at the facility, no vehicles were present. I called the facility representative and she stated she was at
work and the animal care taker was away helping family.
