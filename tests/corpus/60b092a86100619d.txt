ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two 4-day old Guinea Pigs born to Animal #198 had problems opening their eyes. One baby Guinea Pig was
unable to open both eyes. The other baby Guinea Pig could only partially open its right eye. It also had small
amounts of crust around the eye. The Veterinarian had not been contacted. Eye problems can indicate underlying
health issues, can be painful, or may spread to other animals. The attending veterinarian was contacted by the
facility representative during the inspection, however was out on call. The licensee must ensure that these guinea
pigs are evaluated and treated per the attending veterinarian's instruction.
Correct by 9/24/15.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative by ACI Kevin Wilken.
