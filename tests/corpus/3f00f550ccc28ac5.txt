2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The record of animals on hand has not been updated and was incomplete. There was lacking information for
various animals that have been moved on/off of the property over the past year. Records must indicate a date and
where the animals were moved to or note if an animal died. For all of the animals listed, there was not any
information for where they came from or if they were born on the property. Records must indicate where each
animal came from. Maintaining detailed records of animals on hand is important for health management decisions
and also a requirement under the Animal Welfare Act. Maintain records as required and update them regularly.
