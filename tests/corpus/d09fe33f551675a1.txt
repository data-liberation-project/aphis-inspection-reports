Facilities, outdoor.
Four of the roll up barn doors were open, leaving gaps of at least 3-4 feet. Only one door had a metal screen to block the
opening, leaving three open spaces in the perimeter. The licensee was preparing for travel at the time of inspection.
When the roll up doors are open for ventilation, the licensee must block the openings with fence panels. Leaving open
doorways does not constitute a secure perimeter.

Space requirements.
The tigers are being held in their travel cages. The licensee had been using his performance ring to meet the space
requirements, but the ring had been taken down and loaded in preparation for an upcoming performance. Without the
exercise ring, the tigers do not have adequate space to make normal postural and social movements. If the ring is the
primary source of space for the animals, it should be taken down only at the last possible moment prior to travel. Primary
enclosures must contain sufficient space to allow all animals freedom of movement.
