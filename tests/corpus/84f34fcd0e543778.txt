2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semi-annual reports submitted to the Institutional Officer for the past year (April & October 2016) have not been
signed by a majority of the IACUC members. Without this documentation, it cannot be verified the IACUC has
reviewed and approved of the contents of these evaluations. A system should be in place to ensure this is
completed semi-annually as required.
With respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall prepare reports of
its evaluations of their program and facilities and submit the reports to the Institutional Official. The reports shall be
reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members and must include any minority views.
Correct for all future semi-annual facility inspections.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
