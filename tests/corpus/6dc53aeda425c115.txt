SEPARATION.
The skunk lives in the same primary enclosure as several psittacine birds that are overhead. The cage floor has
accumulations of bird droppings and has an odor from these droppings. The skunk remained in his den box.
This living arrangement does not minimize the risk of contamination of the bird droppings falling into the food, water
&/or onto the animal, and increases the risk of disease transmissions or discomfort.
Animals shall not be housed near animals that interfere with their health or cause discomfort.
