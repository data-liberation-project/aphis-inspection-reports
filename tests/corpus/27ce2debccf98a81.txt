SANITATION.
In the llama pen, the top and bottom corners of the shelter structures have a moderate to heavy accumulation of
spider webs. Spider webs can collect dust, debris and insects which can be harmful to the animals.
The walls of the shelters appear soiled and flies are present. Llamas are being fed in one of the shelters and food
can become contaminated. Premises should be kept clean in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices
set forth in this subpart. A system should be in place to ensure shelter structures are cleaned as often as needed to
protect the health of the animals.
