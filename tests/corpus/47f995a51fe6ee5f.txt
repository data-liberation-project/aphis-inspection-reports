3.6(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
In a wire enclosure inside the white building a black poodle had only 2 inches distance from the top of her head to the top
of the enclosure. Dogs that are not given adequate head space can decrease the dog’s ability to exhibit its normal
behavior or postural movements. The licensee is to ensure that all dogs have at least 6 inches of space from their head to
the top of the interior height of the enclosure when standing in a normal position.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In 6 of the outdoor enclosures, there was an excessive amount of feces. The enclosures measured approximately 5' x 10'
and each enclosure had 3 or 4 dogs. The dogs must walk over the feces as they move about. Some of the feces was
dried and obviously several days old. The owner stated that the enclosures were cleaned at least 3 times a week. Due to
the amount of feces in the enclosures, this is not done frequently enough. Excreta and food waste must be removed from
primary enclosures daily as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent
soiling of the dogs contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.


To be corrected from this day forward.
3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In one of the outdoor enclosures, when an igloo type shelter was lifted, at least 6 mice were observed under the shelter.
They quickly moved away and out of the enclosure. As the mice are in close proximity, they can quickly contaminate the
food, water and dog enclosure with their urine and feces.
The licensee must establish an effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs, and birds
and mammals that are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the
animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
