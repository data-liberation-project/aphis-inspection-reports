3.80(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements.
RHESUS MACAQUE:
There is an approximately 2 1/2 foot long and 1/2 inch deep trough, in the enclosure floor, that is eroded down to
the gravel layer of the concrete. This erosion of the floor is due to the macaque's urine.
BABOONS:
The three new baboons have damaged the surface of the epoxy floor of their enclosure thus leaving it in disrepair.
Floors in disrepair affect the ability to adequately sanitize the floors and to protect the health of the non-human
primates housed therein. Both floors must be repaired to maintain structural strength and kept in good repair to
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
NOTE: An outdoor enclosure is currently being renovated to adequately enclose/contain the baboons and the
animals cannot be moved at this time.
