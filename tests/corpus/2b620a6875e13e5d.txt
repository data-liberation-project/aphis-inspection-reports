3.78(d) CRITICAL
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
On the night of July 13, 2016, three spot nosed guenons were attacked by two outside dogs. This incident
happened after hours of operation. Two of the guenons were discovered dead and one was euthanized the
following morning. A small terrier type dog was captured on surveillance video and a beagle was trapped and
removed from inside the facility the following night. After the incident, staff at the facility did a perimeter fence check
and found one spot where ground had sunk, providing a six inch gap and a route of possible entry for the dogs. Part
of the perimeter gate that is used to allow train access was noted to have some damage that resulted in an opening
through which the dogs could have also gained access. Personnel stated at the time of inspection that these gates
are open during business hours and the dogs could have possibly entered during this time and then shut inside the
facility at night. The perimeter fencing encompasses 148 acres of wooded property and gates are opened during
operative hours. Perimeter fencing must be constructed so that it protects non human primates by restricting
unauthorized humans and animals the size of dogs, skunks and raccoons from going through it or under it and
having contact with the nonhuman primates. The perimeter fencing is ineffective at restricting entry of unauthorized
animals. The facility must take measures to prevent access of unauthorized humans and animals into the facility.
Correct by:
Since the incident occurred, the facility now checks the perimeter fencing integrity monthly, traps are placed around
the perimeter fencing area, and exterior fencing at the facility’s train exit and entry point were constructed to prevent
further unauthorized access.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the general curator.
