3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The goat enclosure had a tower that the goats could walk to the top of by means of a wooden bridge. The wooden bridge
had screws sticking out of it that the goats could potentially step on which could result in injury to the goats. The wooden
bridge needs to be either repaired, replaced, or removed from the enclosure. Correct by 5/6/21.

Note: The licensee corrected this during inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Facility Representative.
