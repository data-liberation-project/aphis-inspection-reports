Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee has 10 APHIS FORM 7006's that are not accurate. These forms show puppies being picked up from the
facility by a licensed transporter, and then transported to various pet stores in Florida. The licensee stated to the
inspector that these puppies were picked up from the facility by a licensed transporter, transported to an unlicensed
individual for holding for 3-4 days, then picked up by a different licensed transporter, who then transported the puppies to
various pet stores in Florida.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information
concerning each dog which is transported or sold by that dealer.

Records that fully and correctly contain information concerning each dog transported or sold must be made, kept, and
maintained to ensure all parties listed on the forms are licensed if a license is required, and to trace and track animals in
the case of disease outbreak.

To be corrected from this day forward, August 1, 2022
