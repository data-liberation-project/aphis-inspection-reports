ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
At the beginning of the inspection, the licensee stated that he would be leaving for a "day trip" to California later
today. He stated that he and an additional driver would be driving approximately 30 hours to the temporary site,
exhibiting the animal, and then driving an additional 30 hours back. He stated that even though the trip would take
a total time of 60 hours, he would not be stopping at any designated overnight location(s), and thus it was not
required for him to submit an itinerary to Animal Care. It is important to submit an itinerary within the designated
time frame so that Animal Care is aware of regulated animal movement and exhibition within the country, and
inspections can be performed at all approved sites as efficiently as possible. Any person who is subject to the
Animal Welfare regulations and who intends to exhibit any animal at any location other than the person's approved
site, except for travel that does not extend overnight, shall submit a written itinerary to the AC Regional Director.
The itinerary shall be received by the AC Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel and shall
contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any
location other than the person's approved site. The licensee must submit an itinerary for any upcoming events that
are at a location other than the approved site and that extend overnight.
Correct by COB (8:00pm) 03/09/2020 with submission of an itinerary for the current event.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
