2.75(a) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The current inventory or dogs on hand sheets had 59 dogs recorded, but there were only 51 adult dogs counted by
the inspector. When the records and dogs at the facility do not match it shows the records to be inaccurate.
Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure each animal’s identity can be known with certainty and to
facilitate the ability to trace dogs. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all dogs at all times
in their facility.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
