INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In a sheep housing room in an active study, ewe #1545 was identified with wound clips to close the skin/incision.
The ewe had dried red discoloration extending beyond the surgical site, suggestive of dried blood. Additional red
discoloration was also present along the top and sides of the neck, in front of the incision. This method of closure
applied was not approved in the protocol (#201709691), which stated skin staples were to be used.
Compared to the use of staples, wound clips may cause increased occurrence of pressure injuries or necrosis,
which could result in delayed healing of site and subsequent infection.
Principal Investigators must submit proposed modifications to protocols involving animal activity for review and
approval by the IACUC prior to implementation of such change.
Correct by: Prior to next surgical procedure.
2.31(d)(1)(ix)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In Protocol #201709691 involving sheep, surgical sites entail full thickness incisions made along the animal’s back
to place cortisol pellets. The protocol lists this operative procedure to be performed in designated surgical suites in
the facility. Facility staff confirmed that surgical procedures were being performed in the animal housing or
procedure room. The holding pen utilized for the procedure was laden with dried fecal material. An adjacent table
had a container consistent with betadine-gauze on the bottom shelf, but the label did not specify the contents.
Additionally, used 4x4 gauze pads were sitting on top of the container. The table top had a used thermometer with
fecal staining, with feed debris scattered on the table surface. The table had rust on a significant portion of the
wheels.
Performing surgeries under these conditions greatly increase the risk of post-operative infections, which may cause
pain or distress to the animals. Activities that involve operative procedures must be performed using aseptic procedures and techniques, as
required by the IACUC-approved protocol and regulations.
Correct by: Prior to next surgical procedure.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives on the 15th and 16th of May,
2019.
