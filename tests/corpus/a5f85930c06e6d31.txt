2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In a protocol involving pigs that was approved by the IACUC, the Principal Investigator described the treatment of
40 sites with a dermal resurfacing procedure on the dorsal area (back) and included a diagram of these location of
these sites. The study was conducted on one pig with a total of 72 sites, split between left and right areas of the
back and sides. While the treatment sites were described as smaller than those originally in the protocol, the study
was not conducted according to the approved protocol.
By not following the approved protocol, a research animal may experience greater pain or distress than was justified
to or approved by the IACUC.
A Principal Investigator must submit all proposed modifications to the protocol and the IACUC must review and
approve such modifications prior to their implementation.
Correct by: This date forward.
2.31(d)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In a holding protocol involving pigs that were approved by the IACUC, the Principal Investigator indicated that there
were procedures that were classified as potentially causing pain or distress that was to be relieved. However, these
procedures were not fully described in the protocol and the Principal Investigator did not adequately assure that
there were no suitable alternatives, as the literature search did not include any of these terms in the search.
Without a full description of the procedures and an adequate consideration of alternatives for these procedures by
the Principal Investigator, neither the IACUC nor the Principal Investigator can assure that pain or distress will be
minimized.
The referenced protocol must be revised to include a full description of these procedures and include a relevant
consideration of alternatives to procedures that potentially any cause pain or distress. All other protocols that havebeen approved by the IACUC and any future protocols prior to approval must also contain this information.
Correct by: This date forward for future protocols or prior to use of any previously-approved protocols.
