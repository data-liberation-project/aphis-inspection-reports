2.38(f)(1) Critical Repeat

Miscellaneous.
-Seven different handling incidents have caused serious injuries to non-human primates when they were loose inside the
room. The cause of three incidents were improper lock placement/procedure (8/28/19, 9/19/2019,3/20/21) and four
incidents occurred in relation to use of a transport/transfer box (7/13/2020, 7/17/2020, 9/30/2020, 2/11/2021). Most
injuries were from uncontrolled interactions with other non-human primates in the room and involved partial loss of
tongues in some animals, partial digit amputations, and wounds that required suturing. One non-human primate
sustained a tail injury (7/13/2020 incident). Animals involved were provided veterinary care and monitored for full
recovery of wounds. The facility had reported these incidents to the overseeing ACUC and to OLAW (when applicable)
and has continued to take steps to prevent further occurrence of incidents.

-A marmoset sustained a foot injury when a door to its enclosure was accidently closed on its foot (2/6/2021). The injury
required multiple surgeries and digit amputations. The incident was promptly reported to veterinarian staff and it received
prompt veterinary care. The incident was also reported to the overseeing ACUC and OLAW.



Incidents that cause injuries listed above cause pain and discomfort to animals involved. Ensure that corrective
procedures are followed to prevent further occurrences.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives. This was an inspection of the non-human
primates and records maintained under the LSVC ACUC.
