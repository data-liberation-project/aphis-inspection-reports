CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Housekeeping for premises.
Within the sheltered facility there is an accumulation of dust, cobwebs and rodent droppings on the surfaces of the
enclosures. Trash, pieces of soiled newspapers and dirty bedding materials have accumulated on the floor. There is
rodent droppings mixed in with the discarded materials on the floor adjacent to the northwest wall. Along the
wooden surface between the top row and bottom row of enclosures is an accumulation of rodent droppings. The
affected area is throughout the building housing 52 dogs. This indicates a living area for rodents, pests and other
vermin. Unsanitary conditions exist if the affected areas are not kept clean and could lead to health issues. The
licensee must ensure that all buildings and surrounding grounds are kept clean to facilitate required husbandry
practices.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest control.
Within the sheltered housing facility containing 52 dogs, there is an accumulation of rodent droppings present on the
floor and the wooden surface between the top row and bottom row of the enclosures. Two mice are observed
running along the bottom of the north wall into a small hole in the northwest corner. Inside the outdoor housing
facility containing 54 dogs, there are two mice running along the north wall and into dirt holes. One mouse was seen
climbing on the outside of an enclosure occupied by three dogs. The licensee stated he has the items needed to
correct the problem and showed the inspector the materials going to be used for controlling the rodents. Failure to
provide an effective program that can control rodents can create unsanitary conditions and lead to the potential
spread of disease. No bait, bait traps or other means to control or eliminate the rodents were viewed during the
inspection. The licensee must establish an effective program of rodent control for the health and well being of the
dogs.
