that CAT flushes were used on the dogs, which is not being done, and also that the advanced cases of tartar
buildup will get a dental prophylaxis done by the vet, which is also not being done. In fact, it appears that this year
the licensee himself is "removing the plaque and brushing the teeth" on a number of dogs, without any instruction
from the AV.
