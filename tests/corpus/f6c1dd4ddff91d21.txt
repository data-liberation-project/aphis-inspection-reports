A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:20 pm on
06-APR-17.
Rang door bell and knocked at site address and received no answer. Called the phone number listed under Utah
Inspection Phone Number. Authorized person who answered was out of town and could not return today for
inspection. Called licensee phone number and she manages remotely from out of state so not available for
inspection.
