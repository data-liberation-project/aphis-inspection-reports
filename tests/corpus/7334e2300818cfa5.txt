a film over the eye and what looked like a scratch in the center. This dog also had raw spots on the bottom of the
pads on his right front foot that was oozing some blood, which caused the dog to limp slightly.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were approximately 6 water receptacles that were leaking into the primary enclosures. Two were in two
whelping enclosures, resulting in the female Burmese Mountain Dog being very wet on one side of the head and
neck when she would lie down. The other leaks prevented the indoor floor from drying so the dogs could not get
away from the wet floor.
It is important that the water devices are functioning properly in order to prevent the dogs from being continuously
wet either from the floor being water saturated not allowing them a place to lie down that is dry, or by them
constantly brushing into the dripping water causing their coats to be constantly wet.
The licensee must fix all malfunctioning water receptacles to be in proper working order.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The cement floors inside the facility and in the runs are not sealed and there are two runs that have a long cracks
running the length of both runs which results in the surfaces in contact with the dogs to not be impervious tomoisture.
Unsealed cement and cracks in the cement prevent the ability to properly clean and sanitize the surfaces that come
in contact with the regulated animals. All surfaces must be impervious to moisture which will allow the areas in
contact with the animals to be able to be sanitized according to 3.11(b)(3) of the regulations. Unsealed cement and
cracks can house excreta and bacteria that can not be washed away or sanitized, therefore allowing for
contamination of the regulated animals.
The licensee needs to seal the cement and repair the cracks in order to make them impervious to moisture and able
to be sanitized.
