INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 16083 lists only the PI under personnel carrying out procedures involving animals on the project. An email
from the PI dated 6 June 2017 clearly indicates an unnamed student was conducting imaging of the hamsters. The
email also states that this student was expected to have euthanized the animals at the end of the study. Any
person carrying out procedures on study animals must be appropriately trained and qualified. All such persons
must be listed on the protocol, along with their experience and training.
Correct from this point forward.
2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 16083 does not contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals.
- The initial protocol was a non-invasive imaging study and was categorized as a Level 1 on the facility's internal
scale. This corresponds with a Category C (non-painful) study. However, two modifications were then added which
involved the use of two compounds (DMBA and 4-NQO) designed to induce tumor growth in the hamster cheek
pouches. This modified protocol can no longer be considered a Level 1/Category C procedure, and must be
reclassified at an appropriate level.
In addition, there is not an adequate description of these two compounds and the expected effects on the animals
beyond local tumor growth. An SOP shown at the time of inspection indicates that exposed hamsters will be
marked with "hazardous agent" cage cards and that the cages must be opened only in a protected area such as a
chemical fume hood. The protocol must contain a more thorough description of these chemicals and any potentially
harmful effects on the hamsters.
- An additional problem with this protocol is that it specifies on p 6 that hamsters will be purchased from Charles
River. Records indicate that at least 6 hamsters (3 on 7 February 2017 and 3 on 7 August 2017) were actually
ordered from a company named Envigo. If the protocol specifies a source for the animals, then a modification must
be submitted and approved before ordering from a different supplier.
Correct from this point forward.
2.33(b)(3)ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Daily observation of animals is not being conducted in a sufficient manner.
- A daily observation form indicates a study of three hamsters began on 15 February 2017 and ended on 5 May
2017. There are several problems with this form.
1. The only recorded health parameter for these three animals is daily weight. This alone is not an adequate
measure of health.
2. Three hamsters are tracked on this form. However, on 8 April 2017 Hamster #1 is no longer recorded. There is
no indication of what happened to this animal, or why it's weight was no longer being measured.
3. There is no record of how these three animals were disposed at the end of the study. The record just stops on 5
May 2017. An email from the Primary Investigator on 6 June 2017 indicated that the study actually ended on May
27-28, and that the student imaging the hamsters should have euthanized them at that time. This leaves a gap from
5 May to 27 May when no daily observation was recorded.
- In a separate issue, records show a single hamster was ordered on 11 July 2016. There are no study records
associated with this animal, and nothing to indicate what happened to it.
Animals on study must be observed daily using adequate parameters to assess their health. The facility must
appropriately track all animals from acquisition to disposition.
Correct from this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
