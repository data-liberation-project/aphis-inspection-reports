2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is not maintaining accurate acquisition records of all offspring born on the premises. A total of 5 sugar
gliders have been born on the premises since October 2021 and sold. There are no records indicating the birth of the
gliders, only the disposition records of the sales. Maintaining acquisition and disposition records is important for tracking
animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, age of the animals, and humane
transportation as well as for potential disease outbreaks. Correct by 4 April 2022 by maintaining acquisition and
disposition records for all animals on the property, including any offspring born of any animal while in the possession of
the licensee.

Handling of animals.
During inspection, two sugar gliders, one male and one female, were observed unmoving in their enclosure. The female
was found passed away near the pouch while the male was cold and weak, sitting in the front corner of the enclosure.
Once it was determined that the male was still alive, he was brought immediately to the local veterinary hospital where he
was humanely euthanized. Upon inspection of the enclosure, both water bottles were empty with no signs of moisture in
the cage. The enclosure is located closest to the ground and near an electric heating unit which provides heat to the


facility. The electric unit is mounted to a shelf that is several feet off the ground. Based on Kestrel measurements, the
relative humidity at the level of the cage was 16% and the temperature was around 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
The attending veterinarian performed a post-mortem examination on both gliders and found no evidence of infectious
disease. The female glider had evidence of dehydration and anorexia while the male had no specific abnormalities.
According to the licensee, the sugar gliders were both active the evening before during their daily observation and water
was present in both water bottles.
Sugar gliders are sensitive to low temperatures and dehydration which can quickly lead to undue stress, physical harm,
discomfort, and death.
Correct by 31 March 2022 by ensuring that all animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner
that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
