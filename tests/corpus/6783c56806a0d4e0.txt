Female Shih tzu (tag #32, “Julie Ann”) has an abnormal appearance to her left eye. There is a white, circular area
located in the center of the left eye. The hair beneath the left eye is wet and a small amount of discharge is located
along the lower eyelid. The white of the eye is slightly reddened.
Female Shih tzu (tag #18, “Marilyn”) has an abnormal appearance to her right eye. There is a small, white, circular
protrusion located in the center of the eye. The hair beneath the right eye is wet and the white of the eye is
moderately reddened.
The licensee began treating these dogs on December 27, 2017 with penicillin and terramycin ointment. This
treatment plan was approved by a licensed veterinarian for a different dog. The two above mentioned Shih tzus
have not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for the condition of their eyes.
Poor eye health could cause pain and discomfort to the dogs.
These dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan.
Correction date: These dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by end of business January 11, 2018.
Male Bichon (tag #8) has a buildup of dark brown tartar covering the majority of the surface of both upper canine
teeth and covering the entire surface of the upper left and right cheek teeth. A small amount of grey material is
located along the gum line of the upper left cheek teeth. The dog was difficult to handle, therefore, the lower teeth
on both sides of the mouth could not be adequately looked at by the inspector.
This dog also has a matted hair coat. The majority of the matted hair is located along both sides of the muzzle, on
the legs, and around the neck. The matted hair around the muzzle and on the feet and legs is brown in color. The
toenails on all four feet have become excessively long and developed a severe curve. Poor dental health and matted hair coats could cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as lead to further
health issues. Overgrown toenails could cause discomfort as well as affect the dog’s natural gait.
The dental health of this dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. This dog must also receive hair coat maintenance and toenail trimming. The licensee
must establish a grooming plan that keeps the hair coats of all dogs free of matting and the toenails kept at an
acceptable length.
The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Correction date: This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian by end of business January 11, 2018. This
dog must also receive grooming of the hair coat and nail trimming by end of business January 12, 2018.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Brittney Nelson, USDA veterinary student
