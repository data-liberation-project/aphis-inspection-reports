2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A current written program of veterinary care could not be located at the time of the inspection. A complete document
must be maintained by the facility in order to verify that the animals are being provided adequate veterinary care.
The facility does have an Attending Veterinarian who makes regular visits to the facility. This issue was corrected
as the attending veterinarian completed the written program of veterinary care before the APHIS Inspector finished
the inspection.
***********Corrected at the time of the inspection
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
