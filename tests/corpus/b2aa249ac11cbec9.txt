2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of inspection, the licensee did not have access to complete records of acquisition of the sloth and the
disposition of the wallaby. The certificate of veterinary inspection for the sloth was available for review but the document
did not contain a USDA license number or a driver’s license number and vehicle license number. The licensee provided
proof of requesting disposition paperwork from receiver of the wallaby, but the actual document was not at the facility to
review. The records of acquisition of the sloth and disposition of the wallaby were provided to USDA inspectors two
business days after the inspection of the facility.

Every exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose animals purchased, or
otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased and animals that are sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Licensee.
