Housing facilities, general.
The food storage area had multiple problems.
- There was an open bag of feed in the storage room, and another open bag of feed in one of the working rooms. Open
bags of food must be stored in a leakproof container with a tight fitting lid.
- Several closed bags of feed were stored directly on the floor. All food and bedding must be stored off the floor and away
from the wall to help facilitate cleaning and pest control.
- There was spilled feed on and under a row of pallets in the storage area. This is a potential pest attractant and must be
cleaned.
Food and bedding must be stored properly to minimize the possibility of contamination. The facility must correct the
issues in an appropriate manner.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In pen 6 of the outdoor area, the dogs have dug numerous deep holes over a large area of the enclosure. The presence
of an extensive number of holes is a concern. First, there is the potential for injury to one of the animals, including a risk


of lameness from stepping into a hole. Second, any rainfall would result in multiple puddles of standing water which could
be a source of contamination and an attractant to pests. It might also limit the enclosed animals access to food and water
bowls. Finally, if holes are extended to the fence there is a possibility of the dogs digging under and escaping the
enclosure. The facility must manage the presence of holes dug by the animals to address all these concerns.
Facility corrected this at the time of inspection by moving the dogs to an open enclosure.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
