PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On 12/12/14, personnel discovered two marmosets (one male and one female) that were co-housed were outside
their enclosure and loose in the room. Both animals were recaptured and evaluated by veterinary staff. The female
who had escaped was uninjured but the male who had escaped fought with a male that was contained in another
primary enclosure. Both of the male marmosets sustained injuries of both forearms, received immediate veterinary
care and made a full recovery.
Upon being notified of the escape of the marmosets, Laboratory Animal Resources immediately conducted an
investigation. Although it could not be determined exactly how the marmosets were able to escape from their
enclosure, it was believed that it most likely happened because the Plexiglas panel door on the front of the
enclosure was not fully secured thereby leaving a gap large enough to allow the marmosets to escape.
Per this Section of the Regulations, primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they contain
the nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal.
The research facility acted to address this item by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and
USDA, and implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. Corrective actions included
but were not limited to modifying standard operating procedures (SOPs) pertaining to transfer and recapture of
marmosets and re-training of personnel on the modified SOPs, replacement of all marmoset caging at the institution
with a type of caging that has a different door panel design, and implementing new safeguards for use with the
Plexiglas panels until the new caging is delivered in summer 2015.
This item has been corrected.
NOTE - Inspection conducted 5/4/15 thru 5/5/15. Exit interview held 5/5/15 with facility personnel.Additional Inspectors
