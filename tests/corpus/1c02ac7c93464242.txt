FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Interior surfaces. There are large areas of bare wood on the floor in the guinea pig building where the paint is worn
or scratched off. The floor was last sealed with white paint in the spring of 2017. The paint on the wooden floor is
not holding up to daily activity such as cleaning, feeding, maintenance, and water spills. The interior building
surfaces such as floors must be constructed and maintained so that they are substantially impervious to moisture
and can be readily sanitized. Correct by ensuring the floor where bare wood is present is resealed or covered with
an impervious surface that can be repeatedly cleaned and disinfected, and won't retain odors. Correct by May 23,
2018.

SANITATION.
Enclosures housing 535 adults and their offspring had fecal material consolidated into a wet pad on the floor
especially near food and water receptacles. Caretaker informed the APHIS inspector that the enclosures were last
cleaned on Saturday (1/13/18). Too much feces and liquid waste is accumulating between cleaning intervals. The
accumulations of debris, feces, and wet bedding exposes the guinea pigs to potential infections with bacteria, fungi,
and parasites. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an
accumulation of excreta, wet bedding, and debris and that enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks.
Correct by January 24, 2018.
