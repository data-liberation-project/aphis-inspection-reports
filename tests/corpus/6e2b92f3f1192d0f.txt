ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection three chinchillas were observed to have the following veterinary issues:
**Chinchilla #118 - was squinting and had a watery discharge in the left eye. There was a crusty material and hair
loss below the eye.
**Chinchilla (No ID, located in an enclosure of the middle section - north) - The Chinchilla was unable to open both
eyes. There was a crusty material on both eyes. The left eye area had hair loss.
**Chinchilla BD-X-531 - was unable to open its left eye and there was a crusty material. It was squinting in the right
eye and there was a watery discharge.
**The veterinary issues were not identified by the licensee and no treatment has been initiated for these animals.

During inspection six chinchillas were observed to have the following veterinary issues:
***Chinchilla #131 - The left eye had hair loss around the eye and the eyelid was reddened and swollen shut.
***Two Chinchillas (No ID's, located in back section - south) - The right eye on both chinchillas was squinting and
had a watery discharge.
***Chinchilla ID #M 675 - was squinting and had a watery discharge in the right eye.
***A male Chinchilla ID #BD-Z-172 - The chinchilla was unable to open both eyes and both had a thick crusty
material.
***Chinchilla ID #505 - was unable to open the left eye. There was a crusty material and hair loss around the eye.
***While the facility initiated treatment for these six animals, the facility failed to follow the treatment plan from the
veterinarian for continuing treatment after 2 days or have the animals reevaluated by the veterinarian.
Failure to identify and treat veterinary issues can lead to pain, sickness, or the death of animals. Provide proper
adequate veterinary care for these 9 animals by having them evaluated by the attending veterinarian in order to
initiate and maintain treatment for the veterinary issues as required. The treatment plan must be made available for
inspectors if requested. Note: Licensee contacted the attending veterinarian and the attending veterinarian visited the facility to evaluate the
animals at the time of inspection.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection three chinchillas had eye problems that were not previously identified by the licensee:
-Chinchilla #118 (had problems in its left eye)
-Chinchilla (no ID; located in an enclosure of the middle section - north) had problems observed in both eyes.
-Chinchilla BD-X-531 had problems in its left eye.
Six chinchillas had eye problems that had previously been recognized and had treatment started, however the
animals' conditions and a two-day break in treatments suggest that daily observations were not completed for these
animals:
-Chinchilla (ID# 131, located first section -south)
-Two Chinchillas (No ID's, located in back section - south)
-Chinchilla #M 675
-A male Chinchilla ID #BD-Z-172
-Chinchilla ID #505
Lack of close daily observations of animals can lead to health issues that are not treated appropriately in a timely
manner. Establish and maintain a routine of observing each animal on a daily basis so that health issues can be
observed, communicated to the attending veterinarian, and corrected in a timely matter to ensure the health and
wellbeing of the animals.
3.125(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility is continuing to house 211 chinchillas on 1 inch by 1 inch metal wire flooring. The large holes do not
provide an acceptable flooring surface for the chinchillas. The wire spacing can increase the risk of injury to
chinchillas' legs and/or feet as the holes are much larger than the feet of the chinchillas. Enclosures must protect
the animals from injury. Provide enclosures with flooring surfaces that do not have gaps large enough for the
chinchilla's feet to pass through.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL. Waste disposal
The facility's equipment to eliminate the excreta, waste, and used bedding was not working properly at the time of
inspection. There was a large buildup of excreta, waste, used bedding and water under the enclosures of animals
located throughout the facility. This buildup of material created a high ammonia smell and foul order within the
facility. This buildup of material also creates a biological hazard that may promote disease and can attract vermin
and pests to the facility. Eliminate the excessive buildup of excreta, waste, used bedding and water from the facility
as often as necessary to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards. Correct by: 8 April 2015
Note: The licensee initiated correction by beginning the repair of the equipment used to eliminate the excreta,
waste, and used bedding prior to and at the time of inspection by the repairman that was on site.
3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation.
There were strong odors including ammonia odors in the building. Both inspectors noted that their eyes and throat
had a burning sensation throughout the inspection which indicates that the ammonia levels were higher than
acceptable levels. Excessive ammonia levels can cause animals discomfort and can also cause them to get sick.
Adequate means of fresh air-flow must be put in place to minimize odors, drafts, and moisture condensation.
Correct by: 10 April 2015
3.126(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There are several areas throughout the facility housing where the lighting units were not working. Several of the
units did not have light bulbs in them. This situation has caused inadequate lighting throughout the facility. A
flashlight had to be used to properly inspect numerous animals and enclosures. Lack of adequate lighting
diminishes the facility's ability to conduct daily observations of the animals and enclosures and to clean the facility
as needed. This was substantiated by the observation of 3 animals identified during the inspection with eyes issues
that were not previously observed by the facility. Provide adequate lighting through out the facility by repairing or
replacing lights or lighting equipment.
Note: The licensee initiated correction by beginning the repair of the lighting prior to and at the time of inspection by
the repairman that was on site.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING. The water lines that provides water for the majority of the animals have sections where the tubing has a greenish
appearance. The outside of the watering line continues to have some areas where an excessive buildup of hair,
cobwebs, and excreta is present. Several of the spouts from the water line are leaking and contributing to a buildup
of excreta and debris in at least 15 enclosures of the animals. Unclean water receptacles may contaminate the
water supply resulting in illness of many animals. Replace and/or clean and maintain the water line and spouts in a
sanitary manner, performing as often as necessary in order to assure a wholesome supply of water to the animals.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures.
There were 15 animals housed in primary enclosures where there was a build-up of soiled material (excreta)
underneath the watering ports. This build-up does not allow the affected animals to access their watering port
without walking in the excreta. Build up of excreta in the animal enclosures can increase odors, increase disease
hazards, and may not provide for the comfort of the animals. To promote the health and wellbeing of the animals,
enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent excess accumulations of excreta.
