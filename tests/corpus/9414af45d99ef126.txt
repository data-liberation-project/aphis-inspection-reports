2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On May 6, 2017 a kangaroo reached through the fence and scratched and bite a small child that was standing next
to the enclosure fence. There was no public barrier present to prevent an animal from reaching out of the enclosure
or to prevent someone from reaching into the enclosure. There must be some type of barrier to provide a sufficient
distance between the animal and the viewing public so as to assure the safety of the public. Correct immediately.
This focused inspection of the kangaroo enclosure and exit interview were conducted with owner.
