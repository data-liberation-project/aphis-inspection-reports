3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The rabbit hutch is divided into 4 sections. The two sections that are facing the pot bellied pig enclosure, have a
coated wire that divides the two enclosures. This wire is no longer secured at the base.
The enclosure housing one rabbit, facing the chicken coop, has broken and protruding wires on the dividing wall as
well as on the floor. These broken and protruding wires could harm the rabbit's feet. Broken and damaged wiring
must be replaced to protect the rabbits from injury.

3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility still has a singly housed Bush Baby. The environment has been enriched and the animal is receiving
human interaction. However, a written program for environmental enhancement has still not been documented or
reviewed by the attending veterinarian. The facility must document and follow a plan for environmental
enhancement to ensure that the Bush Baby is receiving appropriate enrichment for his health and well-being.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength.
THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ARE STILL IN NEED OF REMOVAL, REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR:
CHAIN-LINK PERIMETER FENCEA section of the perimeter fence, directly behind the two pot bellied pigs, is severely damaged due to a large, fallen
tree. The fence fabric is down and the top rail is bent. The other end of the top rail is lifted upward and no longer
attached to the perimeter fence that is still intact. This fence must be repaired in order to keep unwanted animals
and persons out and to maintain structural strength.
ALPACA/DONKEY/MINI HORSE ENCLOSURE
1. Curling wire mesh on all of the enclosure fences.
2. Rotted bottom split rail.
3. Another bottom split rail is detached from its post because it is not long enough to reach the other fence post.
4. Detached top split rail, adjacent to the exterior wall of the feed room.
5. Rotted wooden top rail on the fence that divides the alpaca and empty steer enclosures.
6. Broken stockade fence panel in rear enclosure. (across from pot bellied pig)
7. The gate leading into the rear enclosure is severely deteriorated and falling apart.
8. Chicken wire around a tree has broken, protruding wires present that could harm the animals.
9. One metal garden stake is protruding from an old stump that is present inside of this enclosure. This stake is a
hazard to the donkeys, alpacas and horses housed therein.
SINGLY HOUSED POT BELLIED PIG (CHAPMAN)
1. Previous damages to the shelter have been repaired. However, on the far side of the shelter building, the base
of the wall has rotted. Additionally, the base below this damaged wall is also rotted. This damage leaves this side
wall and foundation in disrepair.
2. Sharp, protruding points of a broken wire mesh patch on the front fence.
TWO POT BELLIED PIGS1. Garden stakes with exposed points around the tree, directly behind the sheep shelter building.

WATER FAUCET ADJACENT TO THE PIG ENCLOSURE
Faucet is still leaking and leaving pooling water on the ground.
2 LARGE GOATS (NEW ENCLOSURE)
1. The base of the primary enclosure fence, adjacent to the enclosure housing two pigs, has been raised up due toa fallen tree. The root of this tree has lifted the bottom of the enclosure fence fabric thus leaving a gap large
enough to allow unwanted animals to enter the enclosure.
1. The barbed wire at the top of the enclosure is no longer secured. Additionally, the metal arms that hold up the
barbed wire have detached from fence posts and are now dangling.
2. A large section of wood is lying in this enclosure, across the raised roots of the fallen tree. The goats have
access to this area.
3. The fallen tree is still alive. However, the top of tree is at least one foot away from the top rail of the rear of this
primary fence. The tree should be addressed before further damage occurs to the enclosure fences.
Damaged items must be repaired and/or removed and miscellaneous items must be removed from all enclosure to
protect the animals from injury and to maintain the entire facility in good repair.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
2 LARGE GOATS (NEW ENCLOSURE)
The salt block is covered in grime and the mineral block has feces on the top. Both blocks are kept inside of a
rubber container. When both blocks were lifted up it appeared that both were sitting on top of some type of organic
material. These contaminated blocks must be removed and replaced. The feed container must be cleaned,
sanitized and placed in the enclosure in such a way that minimizes contamination for the health of the goats.
3.131(c) REPEAT

Several live worms were observed beneath a feed bag that was stored on the floor. Rodent droppings were also
observed on the floor around the feed bags and pallets. Rodent bait bags are present and being utilized, as
evidenced by the rodent droppings surrounding them. However, rodent droppings must be removed routinely to
prevent such accumulations around stored feed. A safe and effective program for the control of insects shall be
established and maintained.
3.132 REPEATEMPLOYEES.
A previous animal keeper is no longer present at this facility and a new animal keeper has been hired. Again, this
facility still only has two animal keepers currently caring for the animals. Due to the continued number of repeat
non-compliant items, it is clear that there are not enough adequately trained employees to maintain this facility. A
sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of
husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Such practices shall be under a supervisor who has a background in
animal care.
NOTES: The veterinary care issues that were documented on the August 1, 2016 report have been addressed.
The facility should have an on going maintenance program in place to ensure that structural issues are addressed in
a timely manner.
