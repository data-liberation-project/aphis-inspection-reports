2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two dogs examined during inspection are in need of veterinary care. The first dog, a 4 year old brown male Poodle
named "Indian Summer" (microchip # 003634262), had a heavy amount of tartar build up on both sides of its mouth.
The licensee had not observed this prior to inspection and upon observation admitted the dog was in need of a
dental. The second dog, a 3 year old brown female Poodle named "Milk Chin", had hair loss on both of its ears.
The right ear also had what appeared to be an old sore that was healing and was slightly scabbed over. The
licensee had not observed this prior to inspection.
In addition, two medications were found to have been expired. Phycox expired 08/15 and New Skin Liquid Bandage
expired 07/17.
Dental issues can worsen and cause systemic infection possibly leading to death. Hair loss on the ears can be
irritating to the dog and may indicate there is a problems with the ears. It can be caused by a variety of other
factors, some of which may be contagious to other dogs or even people. Expired medications can become
ineffective and sometimes even become toxic.
Both dogs need to be examined by the Attending Veterinarian and treated per his/her instructions. All expired
products need to be discarded.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Rust was observed in a number of the outdoor enclosures. The back wall one one row of enclosures is all rust. In
addition two enclosures have rust near the bottom fencing on the front of the enclosures. The rust is actually
starting to eat through the bottom posts on these two enclosures. Rust doesn't allow for the enclosures to be
properly sanitized. In addition if the rust eats through the bottoms posts on those two enclosures any further, it may
weaken the fencing or provide a gap for the dogs in those enclosure to be able to escape. The rusted surfaces on
these outdoor enclosures need to be repaired or replaced so the surfaces can be easily cleaned and sanitized and
to ensure that no dogs escape from their enclosures. Correct by 1/19/17.3.6(c)(1)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At least two primary enclosures were too small for the dogs they contained. The first dog was a black and white
female Shih Tzu named "Dixie" (microchip #956000008820555). She measured 20'' and required 676 square
inches of space. Her enclosure measured 29.5'' X 21.5'' and provided 634.25 square inches of space. Her
enclosure was too small by 41.75 square inches.
The second dog was a cream colored female Golden Doodle named "Molly" (microchip #00120154688). She
measured 30'' and required 1,296 square inches of space. Her enclosure measured 22'' X 35.5'' and provided 781
square inches of space. Her enclosure was too small by 515 square inches.
Cage space requirements ensure that the dogs have enough room to move about freely within their cages. It
minimizes the dogs from stepping or sitting in their feces or urine and also minimizes the spread of disease. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet the
minimum floor space requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that enclosure. Correct
immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
