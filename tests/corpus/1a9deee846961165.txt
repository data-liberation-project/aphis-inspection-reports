FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The rabbit enclosures have been moved out of the stall they were in and are adjacent to the corrals. The rabbits
are now being housed in outdoor enclosures that do not have a fence to keep predators from having contact with
the rabbits. Coyotes have been seen on the premises of the outdoor housing facility. Rabbits housed outdoors are
vulnerable to attacks by predators; therefore outdoor housing facilities for rabbits are required to be fenced, or
otherwise enclosed, to prevent the entrance of predators. Failure to provide this fencing in a manner that excludes
predators can lead to severe injury and / or the death of animals. In addition, as rabbits are prey species, presence
of predators can cause stress even if they are not physically harmed. The licensee must ensure that the rabbit
enclosures are fenced or are otherwise enclosed to minimize escape, to prevent entrance of predators.
