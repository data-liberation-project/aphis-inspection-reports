ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The red fox in the enclosure at the top of the hill has a thick yellowish green discharge in it's right eye. The red
fox in the enclosure at the bottom of the park has similar discharge from both eyes. The foxes appear thin with
scruffy hair coats indicting they may have an illness. The foxes had previously been treated for having a discharge
from the eyes but there is no documentation to indicate the foxes current conditions have been observed by
employees or that the veterinarian has been notified. There are several conditions that can cause an animal to
develop a discharge from the eyes (allergies, injury, respiratory diseases,etc). These conditions left untreated my
result in more severe illness or possibly death. The foxes shall be examined by the veterinarian and appropriate
treatment provided. Documentation of the examination and treatment shall be retained for review by APHIS
Officials.

***There are PVC feeding tubes provided to allow the public to drop food into the bear enclosures. The white PVC
pipe provided for the enclosure housing the 3 bears has become scratched or scored on the inside surface and
there is a grey discoloration and particulate matter building up in it. This substance may contaminate the food being
provided to the bears through the tubes. Food shall be provided in a manner that will minimize contamination.
These tubes cannot be adequately cleaned or sanitized and shall be removed and/or replaced to prevent food
contamination. Correct by July 24, 2017.
