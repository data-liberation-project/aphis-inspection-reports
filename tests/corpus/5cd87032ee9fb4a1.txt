REGISTRATION.
It appears that the registrant has relocated or the business is closed. The building has a realtor lock on the door with
a sign advertising sale of the building. The building appears to be empty, the parking lot was empty and no person
was able to reached by phone. The facility has not notified the Animal Care Office of their apparent change in
operations affecting its status as a research facility. This situation does not allow APHIS Officials to perform
inspections for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations and standards. Update the Animal Care Office
with the status of this research facility. Correct immediately.
No exit interview was able to be conducted.
