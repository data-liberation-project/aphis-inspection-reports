PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Although there is a written Program for Environmental Enhancement, it is outdated as the primates described on it
are not here, and the spider monkeys and one macaque that are here are not described. It is also signed off on by
their former attending veterinarian. A new enrichment plan needs to be written and approved by the current
attending veterinarian. This plan needs to address how the social needs of the primates are being met, especially
for the one singly housed macaque. The plan is to also address the environments of the primates and what
enrichment items are supplied to promote species typical behaviors. To be corrected by 10-3-16.

FEEDING.
The white plastic baskets being used for food receptacles for the macaque and three of the spider monkey cages
have black speckled mildew on them. These need to be cleaned more often so the presented food does not come
in contact with dirty surfaces. To be corrected by 9-3-16.
3.84(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Five spider monkeys are housed together in an outdoor enclosure with access to a shelter building. There are
resting boards just under the viewing windows and the concrete floor is covered with shavings. Along one wall the
shavings are entirely wet soaked and at the end near the door is a pile of fresh and older feces. The wet straw and
feces is attracting flies. This area needs to be cleaned more frequently to decrease disease hazards, insects,
pests, and odors. To be corrected by 9-3-16.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with owners.
