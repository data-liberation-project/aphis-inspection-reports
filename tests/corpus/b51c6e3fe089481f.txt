2.31(d)(1)(iv)(A)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
IACUC-approved Category D protocols 247, 248, 284,295, 296, 297, 315 and 322 do not adequately describe the use or
type of analgesia indicated for the potentially painful procedures outlined in these protocols. The Attending Veterinarian
(AV) verified that appropriate analgesics are/were administered as appropriate. The inspector’s evaluation of multiple
medical records corroborated the AV’s verification. Not describing appropriate analgesics to be utilized in painful
procedures can lead to unmitigated pain and/or distress for the animals. Per the regulation, the IACUC shall determine
that the proposed activities meet the following requirements: procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight
pain or distress to the animals will be performed with appropriate sedatives, analgesics, or anesthetics. Correct by
October 1, 2021.
2.31(d)(4)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
For IACUC-approved Category D protocols 247, 248, 295 and 322, no delivery of written notice of protocol approval by
the IACUC to the principal investigator could be documented. If a proposed activity involving the use of animals begins
without IACUC approval, the animals may be subjected to inappropriate levels of pain and/or distress. Per the regulation,


the IACUC shall notify principal investigators in writing of its decision to approve or withhold approval of those activities
related to the care and use of animals. Correct by October 1, 2021.
2.31(e)(3) Repeat

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
IACUC-approved Category D protocols 247, 248, 256, 284, 295, 296 and 317 do not adequately describe significant
procedures proposed to be conducted on the animals. The protocols were approved by the IACUC, despite these
procedures’ descriptions being inadequate or missing. Approval of protocols lacking complete animal procedure
descriptions can lead to serious pain, distress or injury to the animals to be utilized on those protocols. Per the regulation,
a proposal to conduct activities involving animals must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals.
