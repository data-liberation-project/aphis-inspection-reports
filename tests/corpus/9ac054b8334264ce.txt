3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning
There are three enclosures in a sheltered facility, affecting 2 adult dogs, that have an accumulation of bedding, fecal
material and other organic material on the inside floor, and wall area. An unoccupied enclosure, adjacent to an
occupied enclosure, has a carpet remnant with old feces on it. These areas can become a disease hazard to the
animals and need to be cleaned. The licensee must clean and sanitize the affected enclosures and ensure that all
hard surfaces with which the dogs come into contact with are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every
two weeks or more often if necessary and all other areas of the housing facility are cleaned as often as necessary to
satisfy generally accepted husbandry practices.

3.4(b)(2)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Shade
In an outdoor enclosure, housing 1 adult dog, there is insufficient shade area provided. Exposure to the direct rays
of the sun can cause discomfort to the dog and may lead to heat related illnesses. The licensee must provide this
dog with a shade structure so that he can escape the direct rays of the sun. The licensee must ensure that all dogs
are provided with a shade structure to protect them from the direct rays of the sun at all times.
