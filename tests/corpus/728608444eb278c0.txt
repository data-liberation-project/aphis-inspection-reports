OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
One enclosure containing five approximately five month old Mastiff puppies has a shelter that is not large enough to
contain all the puppies comfortably at one time. The puppies were measured to be between approximately 33
inches to 35 inches in length and the shelter is only 50 inches long by 50 inches wide. A shelter that is not large
enough to contain all the puppies at once may result in the puppies subjected to the outdoor elements.
Outdoor housing facilities must contain one or more shelter structures that are accessible to the animals and are
large enough to allow each animal in the shelter to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely.
The licensee must add more shelter structures or alter the current shelter structure in a manner that allows all the
puppies within to sit, stand, lie in a normal manner, and turn about freely.

WATERING.
At the time of the inspection the outdoor temperature is 7 degrees according to the weather channel internet site
(weather.com) and the water in the majority of the outdoor water receptacles was completely frozen solid. In one
outdoor enclosure, one Great Dane was observed licking the snow and the other Great Dane was observed licking
the ice in the water receptacle. The facility representative was asked to provide the dogs with water and the dogs
drank enthusiastically for approximately 1 minute and 12 seconds. In another outdoor enclosure, two Great Danes
and one Mastiff were licking the ice in the water receptacle and the facility representative provided them with water.
All three dogs drank enthusiastically and one dog drank for approximately 1 minute and 43 seconds. The facility
representative watered the dogs at 7:00 am that morning and will water them again later in the afternoon.
The extended amount of time that the dogs drank once water was provided indicates that the animals are extremely
thirsty. Failure to provide the dogs with enough water to meet their needs could have a negative impact on their
health and well-being.If potable water is not continually available to the dogs, it must be offered to the dogs as often as necessary to
ensure their health and well-being, but not less than twice a day for at least one hour each time.
Although the dogs are receiving water twice daily, the licensee must provide the dogs with enough water to meet
their needs in order to support their health and well-being.
Correction date: The dogs were provided with water at the time of the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Autumn Unck, VMO, and the facility
representative.(cid:9)
