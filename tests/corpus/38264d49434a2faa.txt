Facilities, general.
Heavy gage wire, at the bottom left corner of the door leading into the bear enclosure, was bent inward producing several
sharp, jagged edges.

Protruding sharp, jagged edges may cause injury to the bears as they pass by or try to manipulate the opening created by
the bent wire.

Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury. The door was repaired, and a metal plate welded across the area to prevent reoccurrence, at the time of
inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
