PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the indoor section of enclosure #38 housing 3 adult dogs paint has peeled off along the wall next to the dog door.
The area where the paint has peeled does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitizing. Surfaces that cannot be
cleaned and sanitized can play a role in disease transmission. Ensure that all surfaces in contact with the animals
can be readily cleaned and sanitized or replaced when worn or soiled.
