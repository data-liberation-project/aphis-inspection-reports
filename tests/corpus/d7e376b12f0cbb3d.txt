2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two adult, female pigs, Petunia and Daisy, had generalized, hair loss including on the sides of their chest and
abdomen, neck, and all four limbs. Some areas of their underlying skin appeared mildly thickened and reddened.
No open wounds, lacerations, or infected areas were noticed. The inspector did observe an occasional episode of
mild to moderate itchiness in which the pigs would scratch with their back feet or rub against objects within the
enclosure. These pigs were recently examined by the attending veterinarian on 05/11/2016; however there is no
documentation of any skin condition noted on record review. Hair loss may indicate an underlying health issue and
may be a source of irritation and discomfort to these animals. These pigs should be examined by a veterinarian to
ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The
licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Guinea Pig trailer: An overhead light fixture did not have protective coverings over the bulbs. This fixture was
located in an area of the ceiling directly above the guinea pig enclosures. Uncovered, light bulbs could potentially
cause injury to the animals in the event of accidental breakage.
Housing facilities for guinea pigs must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair in order to protect the
animals from injury and to contain them. A system of timely identification, facility repair and maintenance must be in
place.

3.31(b)SANITATION.
Guinea Pig trailer: The two rooms in this trailer had a heavy accumulation of old, animal bedding material and dust
on the floor and on shelving units. There was a wooden shelving rack system containing a large amount of old,
unsealed, pelleted rodent diet which may attract unwanted vermin or pests. Also, a utility sink had a heavy buildup
of dirt, grass and debris including discarded plastic bottles within the basin.

Premises (buildings and grounds) including all animal areas must be kept clean, free of clutter or discarded
materials and in good repair in order to protect the health and well-being of the animals, to prevent the harborage of
vermin and pests, and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. A system of maintaining effective cleaning
and housekeeping practices must be in place.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Hoofstock pen: Several areas of the wire fencing in this enclosure were in disrepair with gaps, loose wiring and
sharp, protruding points within contact of the animals which could cause injury. At time of inspection, APHIS
personnel observed that a baby goat was able to escape this pen and an adult goat with horns was able to put his
entire head through the wire gaps in one corner.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp, protruding points and gaps/openings in order to protect
the animals from injury or entrapment and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility
repair and maintenance must be in place.
