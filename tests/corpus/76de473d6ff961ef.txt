HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning
The inside walls of 7 of the outdoor shelters are dirty with a build up of dirt, affecting 10 dogs. When questioned as
to when was the last time they had been cleaned the licensee stated that it was "Last Fall". The buildup of dirt on
the walls of the shelters could pose a health risk to the dogs. The licensee must clean and sanitize the inside of the
these shelters and ensure that all hard surfaces with which the dogs come into contact with are spot cleaned daily
and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if necessary.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Bedding
Inside 7 of the outdoor shelters, affecting 10 dogs, there is need for more bedding. There was some bedding in the
shelters but patches of bare floor were visible. The temperature at the time of inspection was measured to be 39.7
degrees Fahrenheit. Exposure to the cold could cause health issues and may be uncomfortable for the dogs.
When the temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit the dogs must have enough bedding provided to stay
warm and protect them from the cold weather.
