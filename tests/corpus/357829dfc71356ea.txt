2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a white female goat with brown markings on its head that has a prominent swelling on the right side of its
head near the corner of its mouth. The swelling is about three inches in diameter. The goat is leaning its head
towards the right side and is consistently and vigorously shaking its head throughout the duration of the inspection.
The facility representative says they noticed the swelling several days ago, however the attending veterinarian had
not been contacted about the issue and no treatment had been provided for the animal. The swelling on the face
may be a sign of infection, injury, or other disease process. The shaking and leaning of the head by the animal are
abnormal behaviors which likely indicate the animal is experiencing pain or discomfort.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian that can give an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan for the problem cited above. The
licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care. The program for
providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
