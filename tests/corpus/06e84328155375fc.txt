REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This is a search inspection.

The facility is currently conducting regulated activity without a valid USDA license. The facility's website advertises
the shipment of puppies from the facility to the buyer of a puppy. APHIS officials obtained Air Waybill
#016-48051555 that supports the websites advertisement of the shipment of puppies. This documentation confirms
that the facility shipped a 10 week old, white female maltase on May 14, 2015 from Columbus, OH to Kansas City,
MO. APHIS officials made contact with a facility representative at today's inspection. The representative confirmed
that the facility purchases puppies from breeders and resells the puppies using their online website. He was also
able to confirm that the facility ships puppies sight unseen on a regular basis. A valid USDA license is necessary to
protect the health and well-being of the animals and to comply with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations. This
facility must obtain a USDA license or discontinue regulated activities.

This must be corrected prior to any additional covered activity.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative and Animal Care Inspector Shannon Sebera.
