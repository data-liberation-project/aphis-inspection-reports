FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
This facility has recently moved a chipmunk and opossum into new enclosures. However, these new enclosures are
outdoors. Therefore, a 6' perimeter fence is needed around these two enclosures. This fencing is needed to keep
unwanted animals and people out of the animal enclosures. It will also work as a second containment system
should either of these animals escape from their primary enclosure.
