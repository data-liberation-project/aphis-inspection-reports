3.1(a) CRITICAL
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* An adult female Italian Greyhound “Eclipse” fell out of the primary enclosure approximately three feet onto the
ground because the enclosure gate was left open and unattended. Due to the fall, the dog broke both front legs.
The dog was taken to a veterinarian on April 20, 2019 and had both legs splinted and surgery was performed to
repair the broken limbs two days later. Aftercare was provided in clinic for post-surgical complications. The potential
for injury exists when security measures are not in place to prevent dogs from falling out of their enclosures.
Therefore, the ability to contain the animals securely is necessary to prevent injury to the animals. The licensee
must ensure that housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound,
kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals securely. To be corrected from this day
forward.
* Facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 5/8/19 were conducted with the licensee.
* Facility inspection report and exit briefing done on 5/30/19 were conducted with the licensee.
