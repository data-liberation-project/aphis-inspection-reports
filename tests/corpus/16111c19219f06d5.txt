Records review indicated that on study IL1221g the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved ten
animals for the protocol, and eleven animals were utilized on the protocol without an approved IACUC amendment. A
study amendment was approved by a member of the IACUC involved in the activity, and was not sent to the IACUC for
approval. The IACUC shall review proposed activities involving the care and use of animals and any member can call for
a full Committee review. If not, the chairman can designate a member to review and have the authority to approve,
modify or request full Committee review of any of those activities. No member may participate in IACUC review or

Indoor housing facilities.
In room 3, which was housing dogs at the time of inspection, the floor had several small areas of exposed concrete.
Exposed concrete is no longer impervious to moisture and the floors of indoor housing facilities must be impervious to
moisture. Impervious surfaces facilitate the prescribed sanitation practices in order to protect the welfare of the animals.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The program of veterinary care for dogs was not developed, documented in writing, signed by the attending veterinarian
and available for APHIS inspection at the beginning of inspection. Records review indicated that regularly scheduled
visits, complete physical examinations, vaccinations and preventive care and treatment are being completed for the
canines at the facility. The facility must develop, document and maintain the written program of veterinary care for dogs
and make it available for APHIS inspection in order to assure the welfare of the dogs.

Corrected during inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian and employee.
