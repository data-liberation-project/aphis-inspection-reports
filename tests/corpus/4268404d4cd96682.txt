2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:40 pm and
2:30 pm on 02-AUG-18.
At 1:40 pm, the licensees' adult daughter said that the licensees were not home, but she expected them back after
about 20 minutes. I returned at 2:30 pm, but no one answered the door. I honked my car horn without a response.
I called the cell phone, but the mailbox was full and I could not leave a message. At 2:45 pm, I left a "Sorry we
missed you" flier on the door and left.
