ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:35 pm on
18-JAN-17.
Arrived at the facility, called the licensee and left a message. Waited at the facility for 30 minutes. The licensee did
return my call later that afternoon, and stated that the animal facility had been moved. The procedure to change the
site with the Western Regional Office was explained during the phone discussion.
