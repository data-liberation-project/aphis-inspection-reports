FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The goat and sheep petting zoo pen allowed goats to slip out as customers entered and exited, and no longer
contained the animals. During inspection, three out of four goats momentarily escaped and were returned to the
pen by facility personnel. All enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from potential hazards and injury and properly contain the animals
