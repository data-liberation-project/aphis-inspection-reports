HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces. (2) Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
***In the English Bulldog sheltered facility, there were two primary enclosures containing two adults and four
puppies. Around the interior surface of the doorways, the edges of the covering of the walls had been chewed away
leaving the wooden studs exposed. Chew edges cannot be properly sanitized and increases the risk of disease to
the animals by having raw wood exposed to the elements. The licensee must repair these surfaces and assure that
all surfaces are replaced as required.

3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
***In the outdoor facility, the housing units are contained inside a pole barn with wind breaks, the housing units had
pieces of straw in them. The facility representative stated that the housing units had contained straw for bedding but
had recently been taken out. According to Accuweather the last four days and nights temperatures have ranged
from 1 degree F to 45 degrees F. The temperature at the beginning of the inspection was 48 degrees F via Kestrel
3000. Lack of appropriate bedding in cold environments increases the risks of illness and hypothermic situations to
the animals. The licensee must provide clean and dry bedding material to these housing units and assure that
bedding to all outdoor housing units is provided as required.
