2.40(b)(4) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility is utilizing a method of euthanasia that is listed on the Program of Veterinary Care only for emergency
situations for at least 3 rabbits that were deemed to be un-needed by the facility or were used as food items for the bald
eagle. These rabbits are exhibited outdoors during the warm months of the year. Euthanasia is defined by the Animal
Welfare Act as “the humane destruction of an animal accomplished by a method that produces rapid unconsciousness
and subsequent death without the evidence of pain or distress, or a method that utilizes anesthesia produced by an agent
that causes painless loss of consciousness and subsequent death”.

The Program of Veterinary Care states euthanasia can be carried out by the veterinarian or the licensee by gunshot or
lethal injection but does not provide any further guidance. When speaking to the Attending Veterinarian, gunshot should
only be done by the park rangers and only to the bison or coyote in an emergency or any other animal that escapes and
poses a risk to public safety. When reading through animal records, the inspector found a note under the bald eagle’s
record stating that “two rabbits were shot and fed to the bald eagle because only 2 rabbits were wanted for the winter.”
When the inspector interviewed the facility representative that performed this euthanasia, the gunshot (.22 caliber rifle) to
the head did render the rabbits unconscious immediately. The attending veterinarian did not know that this euthanasia

took place, and it was not an approved method of euthanasia for rabbits. Euthanasia shall be overseen by the attending
veterinarian to provide adequate guidance to personnel involved to reduce the pain and suffering of the animals cared for.

When talking to a facility representative, he stated that the facility fed a live adult rabbit to the bald eagle sometime during
the summer months of 2021. This took place because the eagle was evaluated by a veterinarian and the facility was
instructed to provide more calories and calcium to the eagle. This event did not result in rapid unconsciousness and
subsequent death with evidence of pain or distress.

The facility must use euthanasia guidelines provided by the attending veterinarian and make sure that method complies
with the Animal Welfare Act.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility keeps records of the animals on a spreadsheet that is missing acquisition information for several animals. The
spreadsheet is missing the date of acquisition, name, and address of the individual 2 domestic rabbits were purchased
from. The spreadsheet is missing the birth date for 4 juvenile rabbits born at the facility. The spreadsheet is missing the
individual’s address that turned over a male juvenile raccoon to the facility after the raccoon’s mother was hit by a car.
Record of acquisition information is necessary for APHIS officials to identify animals and to trace their movements.

The facility shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose acquisition information
concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his

or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that
dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his
or her control. The facility must record the acquisition information for 2 adult domestic rabbits, 4 juvenile rabbits and male
raccoon. The facility must ensure all required information is properly and accurately documented at all times.

Facilities, general.
The facility currently houses 1 female rabbit, 4 juvenile rabbits and 1 male in a metal enclosure indoors. There is a metal
bar divider separating the male from the female with offspring. The facility has added hardware cloth to the divider to
prohibit the young rabbits from going into the male’s enclosure. The hardware cloth stops approximately 3 inches from the
back of the enclosure creating a gap in the divider large enough for the juvenile rabbits to fit through. The inspector
observed one of the juvenile rabbits going into the male rabbit’s enclosure. Enclosures that do not safely contain the
animals may cause injury from moving between the enclosures or injuries from incompatibility with neighboring rabbits.

The hardware cloth that is attached to the enclosure divider is fastened using pieces of wire. The wire is twisted and has
created numerous sharp points approximately ¼- ½ inch long in both sides of the enclosures. Sharp points may cause
lacerations or eye injuries.

Housing facilities for rabbits must contain the animals and protect the animals from injury. The facility must ensure that the
enclosures safely contain the animals and are safe for the animals at all times.

3.56(b)(1)

Sanitation.
The enclosure that houses the male rabbit has a buildup of organic material from urine in the rear right corner. The
collection trough under the enclosure also has a large amount of buildup that is dark red to brown in color. When asked
about the cleaning schedule, the facility representative said they hose the enclosure and trough with cold water as
needed. A buildup of organic material within the primary enclosure and troughs could increase the risk of disease hazards
towards the rabbit.

Used primary enclosures and troughs or pans for rabbits must be sanitized at least once every 30 days by washing with
hot water (at least 180° F) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, or washing all soiled surfaces with a
detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam or flame.
The facility must ensure that all aspects of the enclosure are maintained in a clean and sanitized condition in order to
support the health of the rabbits.
