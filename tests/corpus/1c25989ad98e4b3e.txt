ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Employees noticed the old female leopard repeatedly rubbing her ear on the cage fencing in January. The
veterinarian was called and the leopard was put on oral antibiotics on 1-22-14. The veterinarian requested
caretakers get an ear swab if possible, but no diagnosis could be made from the one sample obtained. During this
inspection, the leopard has both ear pinnae completely swollen and when she shakes her head, fluid sounds can be
heard. She is still rubbing her ears on the cage and has rubbed a slightly bloodly raw area under the left ear.
Because the ears did not get better after several weeks of antibiotic treatment, the veterinarian should have been
called out to see this animal. This animal needs to be seen by the veterinarian so a further diagnosis can be made
and treatment given. The veterinarian was called during this inspection.
One speckled gray pygmy goat has a definite wheezing breath sound. The same goat has a very slight clear
discharge in the right eye. The owner states this young goat developed the breathing sound when it was a few
months old and antibiotic treatment was tried at that time. The goat did not appear to get any worse or better, so
no further treatment was done. This goat should be seen by the attending veterinarian to determine if any further
treatment is needed. To be corrected by 2-22-14.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the enclosure containing 8 zebra, there is a storage building to which the enclosure fence is attached at the road
side of the enclosure. Because this building is off the ground at least two feet, it is underpinned by wide boards.
Several of these boards are missing and nail heads are protruding in spots where the boards were. The nails need
removal and the gap repaired to prevent potential injury to the zebras.
There are three broken boards in one side of the bear enclosure in the primate area. These boards are a visual
barrier, not part of the structural integrity, but still need to be removed or replaced as the broken ends are rough and
could cause potential injury. Above items to be corrected by 3-28-14.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
