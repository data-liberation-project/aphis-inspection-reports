had not been consulted concerning the hair loss. Hair loss can be the sign of an underlying health issue. The

****There is an adult male Yorkshire Terrier (MC#0A02006835) and a red Poodle "Wendy" (3 months old) both
have excessive matting of the fur with several larger sized matts noted along the dogs backs, bellies and rear legs.
Excessive matting causes pain and discomfort to the animal. In addition, matting can foster skin infections and can
hinder the animals ability to move or defecate normally. The licensee needs to remove the matted fur on these
dogs. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must establish and follow a program of regular
coat maintenance for all the dogs to prevent the development of excessive matting. The licensee must ensure that
all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.3.1(f) REPEAT

DRAINAGE AND WASTE DISPOSAL
**** Along the back edge of three pens housing 11 dogs' excessive feces has collected at the enclosure fence line.
This is the area that the licensee washes feces and animal waste out of the enclosurers. The feces have
accumulated to a depth of two to three inches, the licensee stated "it was a week ago that the drainage area was
cleaned", the licensee is not removing and disposing of animal waste on a regular and frequent basis. Housing
facilities must be equipped with disposal facilities and drainage systems that are constructed and operated so that
animal waste and water are rapidly eliminated. Large amounts of collected feces, urine and wash water can attract
rodents and pests, can harbor diseases, and can cause odor. The licensee must provide for regular and frequent
collection, removal and disposal of animal waste that minimizes contamination and disease risks.
