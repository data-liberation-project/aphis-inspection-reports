ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care indicates that "Sikozu" & "Siren" will be vaccinated against feline distemper and
rabies. The last vaccinations were performed on these two cats in December 2014.
Vaccinations are an effective method to prevent disease, and should be performed according to the veterinarian's
recommendations.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The cat enclosures contain articles of plastic (ie: balls, jugs, toys) and/or rubber tires. These articles are now
excessively chewed &/or clawed leaving many loosely attached pieces of plastic &/or rubber flakes. These flakes
can easily be pulled off, or chewed by these animals. The present condition of these articles now poses a risk of
ingestion which can potentially cause blockages or other types of internal injuries.
All enclosures shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
