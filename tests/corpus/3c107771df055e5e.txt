3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The adult dog room has two enclosures in disrepair. Row three, pen one, has wire flooring that is sagging and not
properly fastened to the frame along the rear-right braces. This enclosure contains an adult Chihuahua and
Maltese. The enclosure directly behind this one contains an adult English bulldog. This enclosure is also affected by
the sagging wire floor. The gaps in the flooring are becoming large enough to where the dogs' feet could pass
through.
Failure to properly maintain the flooring can lead to foot and leg injuries.
The licensee shall ensure the floors are constructed and maintained in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and
legs from injury.

3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
All of primary enclosures being used in the adult dog room have an excessive accumulation of fur and organic
material on the surfaces underneath. The heaviest buildup is located on the wooden braces that the enclosure
flooring is attached to. Fifty-seven adult dogs are present in the affected enclosures. The facility representative
stated that it has been a while since they were cleaned.
Failure to properly clean and sanitize surfaces of the primary enclosures can lead to disease hazards which can
affect the health and well-being of the dogs.
The licensee must ensure used primary enclosures are properly cleaned and sanitized at least once every two
weeks or more often if needed.
