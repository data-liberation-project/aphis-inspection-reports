2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has changed attending veterinarians and does not have a written Program of Veterinary Care from this
veterinarian. Nor does the licensee have adequate written guidance from the attending veterinarian to provide
preventative care or treatment for routine and common veterinary problems beyond deworming protocols for some
species present at the facility. In order to ensure problems of animal health are addressed adequately, a written
program of veterinary care should include the species used in regulated activities, what common health problems
they may have and how these will be addressed by the licensee and the Attending Veterinarian.
The formal arrangements with the Attending Veterinarian shall include a detailed written program of veterinarian
care.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a bottle of injectable Telazol in the medication area of the storage building. The licensee stated this
medication is used to sedate the animals but had no documentation showing written instructions from the attending
veterinarian on its directions for appropriate use, the indications for its use, or precautions needed to be taken
during its use. The licensee must ensure that all medications are used in a manner consistent with the provision of
adequate veterinary care to protect the health of the animals and ensure drugs are used in an appropriate manner.
The licensee must obtain written approval from their attending or prescribing veterinarian if they wish to continue to
use Telazol to sedate animals. This documentation must minimally contain information regarding exact indications
and situations for use, dosing instructions (route, concentration, dose, etc.), and guidance regarding appropriate
monitoring and recovery of animals. All medications must be labeled and administered properly as part of the
facility'(cid:25)s programs of adequate veterinary care.
There is a bottle of expired Naxcel (1/2015) in the medication area of the storage building. In addition, this
medication (Naxcel) and a bottle of Corid solution did not have written directions for use from the attending
veterinarian. The usage of expired medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or sutures on regulated animals is not
considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The
effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated to animals could bedrastically changed or may not work as anticipated. Lack of directions for use of a medication can result in
unintended side effects and ineffective treatments. The applicant must ensure that all medications used are not
expired and are labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices.
There were some drugs observed by the inspectors that are being used off labeled for the species involved. There
was no written approval for use by the attending veterinarian or any dosage instructions for the proper use of these
drugs. Using drugs in an extra label manner may be harmful to the animals if not administered appropriately and
under the direction of a veterinarian.
Ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, are labeled properly in accordance with standard
veterinary practices and are approved for use in the animals present in the facility by the attending veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Licensee did not have available for review most of the required records that fully and correctly disclose the required
information on the acquisition and disposition of the animals. The record of one sale of animals did not include the
name and address of where these animals were sold. Licensee could not locate the complete acquisition records of
the animals that are housed at the facility. The record of acquisition must include the name, address and USDA
license number and date of acquisition of all animals at the facility, including any offspring born on the premises.
Maintaining current records of animals on hand, including those acquired and disposed of, is required in order to be
able to accurately track the animals. Licensee must make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly
disclose the required information regarding acquisition and disposition of animals.
3.75(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outside enclosure fence of one of the spider monkeys enclosures in the long primate building has come loose
from the top fence. This has resulted in several gaps between this fence and the top. These areas may not
securely contain the animals or may cause injury to the animals. All surfaces must be kept in good repair to protect
the animals from injury and securely contain the animals.
3.75(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are rusted surfaces in the shift tunnels of 2 capuchin enclosures and in the shift tunnel of one colobus
enclosure. There is also rust showing through the painted metal areas near the floor in the long primate building.
There are rusted pipes in the lion-tailed macaque enclosure. There is also a rusted through hole in the metal near
the floor of the ring-tailed lemur enclosure in the long primate building. Surfaces that are rusted cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized and can result in an increase of disease transmission. All surfaces must be free of rust thatprevents the required cleaning or affects the structural strength.
3.75(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two nail heads protruding up from a wood climbing structure in the outdoor portion of a capuchin
enclosure. There is also a corner of chain link divider wall pulled into a capuchin enclosure in the indoor section of a
long sheltered building. The chin link has exposed metal points. There are wire points from the chain-link fence on
the gate of the Pata's monkey outdoor enclosure. Jagged edges or sharp points can cause injury to the nonhuman
primates. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in housing facilities in contact with nonhuman primates be free
of jagged edges or sharp points. Correct by 26 August 2015.
3.75(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A covered bin of (cid:28)monkey biscuits(cid:29) had ants crawling in the interior of the container and in contact with the food.
Food contaminated with pests could lead to a decrease in the animals(cid:25) appetite and decreased nutrition. The
license must ensure that all supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from
spoilage, contamination and vermin infestation. Correct by 14 August 2015.
3.77(a)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The tall, four enclosure, nonhuman primate building had insufficient lighting in the sheltered part of the building
during this inspection to adequately conduct an inspection or to permit routine inspection and cleaning of the facility,
and observation of the animals. The building had large ceiling lights that were not operational in addition to the
smaller lights that were present and lit in this building. Insufficient light in sheltered portions of buildings prevents
animal caretakers from adequately observing the animals and from maintaining and cleaning the facility. The
licensee must ensure that the sheltered part of sheltered housing facilities are lighted well enough to permit routine
inspection and cleaning of the facility, and observation of the nonhuman primates. Correct by 19 August 2015
3.81(c)(4)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There is an individually housed colobus nonhuman primate in sheltered housing at the facility. The environmental
enhancement plan written by the licensee (but as of now unapproved by the attending veterinarian) states that the
colobus nonhuman primates will be housed in pairs. There are no special considerations in the environmental
enhancement plan to address the needs of an individually housed animal. The licensee must ensure that the
environmental enhancement plan outlines the special attention regarding the enhancement of the environment of
individually housed nonhuman primates that are unable to see and hear nonhuman primate species of their own orcompatible species. Correct by 12 Sept. 2015.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The licensee has developed a plan for the environmental enhancement to promote the psychological well-being of
the nonhuman primates. The plan and all environmental enrichment items must be approved by the attending
veterinarian (AV) and documented when provided to the animals on the environmental enhancement plan.
Nonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs that need to be addressed when in captivity. A
written plan that is directed by the AV, guided by current professional standards, and available for review by APHIS
officials is required to ensure that the psychological well-being of these animals is being appropriately addressed.
The licensee must have this plan approved by the attending veterinarian.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several places throughout the facility where the animals' enclosure fences are in need of repair:
-There is a nail point and a leaning fence board in the enclosure of the single addax.
-The camels in one of the north enclosures have leaned over the top of their enclosure fence in several places.
This has resulted in that fence being been pushed down from its original height to now being only a few feet tall.
-There are some broken wooden rails that are a part of the zebra enclosure fence.
-There are metal pipe gates leaning over in the zebra shelter building between the hay bales and the zebra space.
The metal surfaces around the egress door of the African porcupine enclosure has been chewed to the point that
has resulted in jagged edges.
The capybaras are currently housed in the area around the pond. The primary enclosure fence for these animals
does not completely surround this area.
Enclosure fences and housing facilities that are not kept in good repair can result in injury to the animals or may not
securely contain the animals. All building materials must be constructed of materials that are structurally
appropriate for the animals and must be maintained and kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
securely contain the animals.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The front portion of the single-housed camel enclosure has mud and standing water. This camel is spending a lot of
time in this area as well as this is where it's food and salt block is located. This camel had dried mud on the length
of all four legs. Standing water and mud can attack pest and can lead to an increase in disease transmission. Asuitable method must be established to rapidly eliminate excess water. Correct by 15 August 2015.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
Due to the recent rain there is standing water in many of the rubber receptacles holding salt blocks. This can lead
to contamination and deterioration of these salt blocks. Food and supplements must be wholesome, palatable, and
free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.
The routine inspection and exit interview were conducted on 12 August 2015 with a facility representative, Dr.
Margaret Shaver, VMO and Kendall Lundy, ACI.
