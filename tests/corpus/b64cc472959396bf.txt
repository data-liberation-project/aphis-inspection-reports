2.38(f)(1)

Miscellaneous.
On November 4th, 2021 two animal technicians performed euthanasia of study rabbits. On the following day, one rabbit
was found alive by facility representatives. According to the facility representative, the rabbit appeared to alert and
responsive, but the marginal ear vein used to administer the euthanasia solution was blown. This rabbit was humanely
euthanized as prescribed by the Program of Veterinary Care on November 5th, 2021.

According to the IACUC, the technician that performed the euthanasia did not confirm the rabbit was euthanized.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

Corrected at the time of inspection through a corrective action plan that included IACUC approved updates to Rabbit
Euthanasia SOP, increased oversight of technicians performing euthanasia on animals at the facility, and the suspension
of the animal technician.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
