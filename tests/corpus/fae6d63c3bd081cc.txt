ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:30 pm on
25-OCT-18. Upon arrival, the inspector observed an empty building where the business had been located. I called
the licensee's contact number on file. There was no answer so I left a message requesting that he contact me.
A responsible person shall be available to accompany inspection during business hours.
