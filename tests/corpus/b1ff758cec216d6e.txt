2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female albino hedgehog was found deceased in her enclosure during this inspection. The facility representative
reported that she was observed yesterday evening and appeared to be moving around at that time. Looking in her
enclosure however, it was noted that there were three distinct areas of food remaining on the bottom of the
enclosure. The facility representative states that food is typically placed on top of the bedding in the corners or
along the sides of the enclosures each evening. During the inspection this morning none of the other enclosures
had food remaining from last night's feeding. The daily observation for this hedgehog did not include the
identification of poor/decreased appetite for this hedgehog. All animals must be observed daily and the facility must
establish a mechanism of direct and timely communication with the attending veterinarian so that all problems of
animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. Correct by

SANITATION.
Numerous hedgehog enclosures were noted to have wet and dirty shavings in them. There was a distinct ammonia
odor in the hedgehog room despite the new Power fan system and the timer on the exhaust fan added since the last
inspection. The shavings in about five enclosures were wet/soiled to the extent that clean and dry shavings were not
available for the hedgehogs to move around on. All feeding is done on the shavings so in these enclosures the feed
is contaminated by the wet/soiled shavings. Excreta including urine and fecal contaminated shavings must be
removed from the enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination, minimize disease hazards and
reduce odors. Correct by 11/1/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.
