2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Three animals are in need of evaluation by a veterinarian:
*One 12-13 year old blind lame male pig is extremely thin with extensive muscle loss. The pig’s ribs, spine and hip bones
are prominent. The pig’s skin appears dry with loss of elasticity suggesting possible dehydration. The facility owner stated
that the pig was seen about two months ago by their veterinarian for weight loss and said that he recommended
euthanasia once he started to worsen. No medical workup was done at that time. The owner states he does look like he
has continued to lose more weight since that visit two weeks ago. Continued weight loss can be a sign of a serious
medical condition and needs to be medically evaluated.
*Two growing capybara that lost their toes due to frostbite earlier this year were inspected. The wounds are closed/have
healed and the capybara are currently not on any medication. The facility owner reports they are eating well and getting
around inside the gift shop and the small outdoor exercise area they have access to during the day. During the inspection
it was noted that the capybara were reluctant/slow to put weight on their front limbs. When sitting they would often sit on
their haunches with their front feet in the air in an apparent attempt to keep their weight off their front feet. The owner
stated that they were not currently on any medications and that their vet stated that the animals needed to develop some
calluses. A conversation with the vet stated that she hasn’t seen them for a couple of months/seen them ambulating. The


capybaras’ current condition needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian regarding discomfort and possible pain especially
when ambulating. This is especially critical as the capybara are still growing/gaining weight and that additional weight will
need to be distributed on all four limbs.
All animals with ongoing conditions must be regularly evaluated by a veterinarian especially as conditions
change/progress to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. The facility shall contact their veterinarian to have the
pig and the capybara examined and all conditions diagnosed and treated appropriately. Correct by 10/7/21.
2.131(e) Critical

Handling of animals.
The facility contacted me in early March of 2021 to notify me that two young capybara had sustained major frostbite of the
toes of all four feet after a severe freeze/cold weather snap that occurred at the end of February 2021. The capybara were
treated by their attending veterinarian and the facility obtained additional treatment guidance from a veterinarian that
works with a Capybara Foundation. The capybara had been housed in a small unheated shed/barn with access to an
outside pen at the time of incident. The capybara were moved into the gift shop building (heated). The combination of
weather conditions and the lack of access to a heated shelter structure led to climatic conditions that presented a threat to
the capybara’s health and well-being in the short term with frostbite and sloughing of the toes of all four feet and in the
long term due to the loss of their feet. When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal’s health or well-being,
appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal must never be subjected to
any combination of temperature, humidity and time that is detrimental to the animal’s health or well-being taking into
consideration such factors as the animal’s age, species, breed, overall health and acclimation. Corrected by housing the
capybara in a heated building.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.


*The two capybara are currently living in the gift shop during the evenings/bad weather days and have access to a small
outside pen during the day on nice weather days. The animals have free run of the gift shop with access to all the items
(shelves go down to floor level) and other animal enclosures (set on the ground) in the gift shop. Unprotected electrical
outlets are at animal height. The smooth hard floor is not conducive to normal movement especially with the capybara’s
feet issues. The gift shop is not a facility appropriate to house capybara. Plans are in the works to build them a new
appropriate enclosure but still has a lot of work that needs to be done.
*The enclosure housing the goats/sheep/pigs needs repairs. There is a broken picnic table and broken wood pallet in the
enclosure (goat enrichment items) that need to be repaired or removed. The two sided shelter structure has a cracked
support beam and a loose board that needs to be repaired. There is loose wire in front of the small tan barn/shed
structure. These structural issues may lead to animal injuries if not repaired/removed.
The facility must be constructed of such materials as appropriate for the animals involved. The housing facilities must be
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals. Correct by 10/31/21.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
*The area between the cavy enclosure fence and the perimeter fence needs to be weeded. The area is overgrown with
weeds ranging from weeds 1 foot to over 4 foot high. Weeds can be a breeding ground for pests such as ticks and
rodents. Some of the weeds are growing into/through the enclosure fencing which can lead to structural integrity issues
with the fencing.
*The large barn structure is in need of cleaning. Shorn wool, wood pieces and plant materials are littering the ground.
Premises including buildings and grounds need to be kept clean and cleared to protect the animals and facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices in the Animal Welfare Act. Correct by 10/18/21.
