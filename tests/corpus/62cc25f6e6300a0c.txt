ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
1) A tri color (brown, tan, white) guinea pig in building 1, row 2, 5th enclosure from back wall has hair loss, scab,
and ½ inch X 1 inch sore on the top of its back.
2) A tan and white guinea pig on in building 1, row 3, 2nd enclosure from back wall has hair loss, scab, and ½ inch
X 2 inch sore on the top of its back.
3) A white guinea pig with a black left ear in building 1, row 4, 11th enclosure has hair loss, scab and large 2 inch
diameter circular sore on right rear leg.
4) A tan and white guinea pig in building 2, row 3, 6th enclosure has hair loss, scabs, and large sore approximately
½ inch X 4 inches in length on the top of its back.
Licensee reported that the guinea pigs attacked themselves before birthing and during nursing until the babies are
weaned and that he sees them actively scratching these wounds. Licensee also stated he discussed this problem
with the attending veterinarian generally in the past and thought the hair loss, scabs, and sores were due to stress
of maternity and that the problem clears up after the babies are weaned. There is no records of these guinea pigs
receiving any diagnoses or treatment and no written record of any previous advice by the attending veterinarian on
similar issues. There is no current guidance from the Attending Veterinarian for the treatment of wounds or hair loss
without examination by a veterinarian and the licensee stated that none of the animals listed above were currently
receiving any care for this issue.
The hair loss and wounds of this type can occur for a number of reasons including both infectious and traumatic.
Failure to properly diagnose disease delays proper treatment and can result in worsening of the condition and
unnecessary suffering of the affected animals. All licensees must establish and maintain programs of adequate
veterinary care that include the use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and
injuries. Correct by having each of these guinea pigs examined by a licensed veterinarian so that appropriate
diagnostic testing can be conducted and proper treatment can be initiated. Additionally, the licensee must maintain
records of the veterinary recommendations and the treatments provided for future evaluation by APHIS Officials.Correct by May 27, 2016.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a shelf above the dry guinea pig food in building two that contains propylene glycol, rodent bait, and fly bait.
Veterinary products and chemical deterrents should not be stored above food or on the same shelf to prevent
contamination. Licensee must ensure that all food supplies adequately protect against spoilage, deterioration, and
contamination. Correction date of May 28, 2016.
3.28(c)(1)(3) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Inadequate space was present in the following enclosures:
1) There were four enclosures in building 1, green tubs measuring 30.5 (cid:28) by 30.5 or 930.24 square inches of floor
space which had more than 15 guinea pigs in each enclosures. The maximum number of guinea pigs allowed in
these enclosures would be 15 based on the size of the enclosures and weight of the guinea pigs.
2) In building 2, row 4, the first enclosure measuring 37(cid:29) by 40(cid:29) or 1480 square inches of floor space had
approximately 40 guinea pigs. The maximum number of guinea pigs allowed in this enclosure would be 24 based on
the size of the enclosure and the weight of the guinea pigs.
Insufficient space can lead to aggression, undue stress and creates conditions in which promotes the spread of
disease. Weanlings weighing up to 360 grams require 60 square inches of floor space per animal.
Licensee must ensure that adequate space is provided for the animals. The space provided must be sufficient for
each guinea pig contained to make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Sufficient
space will decrease the likelihood of aggression, stress, and risk of disease. Correct from this day forward.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There is a heavy buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the sides and floor of the enclosures in building 1.
Licensee reported that the enclosures are cleaned weekly. Ineffective cleaning and/or infrequent sanitation exposes
the animals to disease hazards. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often
enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris. Additionally, ensure that the primary enclosures are
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by May 27, 2016.An exit interview was conducted with the owner. This inspection was conducted with the owner, Robert Markmann,
ACI, and Rachel Reineke.
