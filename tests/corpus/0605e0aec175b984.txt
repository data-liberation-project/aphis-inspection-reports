Structural Strength. The interior walls (near the ceiling) of the bear grotto have areas of broken stucco caused by
the two female cubs inside this enclosure. Pieces of broken stucco were laying on the floor underneath this area.
Appropriate repair measures are necessary to address this problem and prevent possible injury to the two animals
in this enclosure. To be corrected by: May 23, 2014.
The cinder block deer shelter has a 1/2 inch wide crack approximately 2 1/2 feet long extending doward from the
roof line. The trim boards under the metal roof of the deer shelter are splintered and cracked and need to be
replaced or repaired. There are three adult deer housed in this enclosure. To be corrected by: May 23, 2014.
