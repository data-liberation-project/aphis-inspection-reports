2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Section 2.33(a)(1) Veterinary care: The facility written program of veterinary care (PVC) could not be located for
review during this inspection. This facility has a part-time attending veterinarian so there must be a written program
of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the facility. The written PVC includes the preventive health care
instructions from the veterinarian for the facility animals and is reviewed during inspections to see if the registrant is
following the instructions for the health care of the animals. A copy of the PVC must be available at the facility for
review by APHIS officials and for use by the registrant. Correct by February 21, 2016.
Exit interview conducted with a facility instructor of veterinary technology.
