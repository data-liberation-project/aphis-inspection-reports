2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***One white female rabbit (ID number CS12) had its right leg extended out to the side. When the rabbit attempted
to move about its enclosure, both legs were splayed out to the side in an abnormal position with the right leg being
the most splayed. The fur on the rear and tail of the rabbit was discolored and dark brown in color. The tail was
positioned left of center in an abnormal manner as the rabbit attempted to move about its enclosure.
***Another white female rabbit (ID number CS14) was unable to move and was laying in a stretched out position on
its four feet with the rear legs extended slightly further back. Upon closer inspection, the fur of the rabbit's entire rear
had a wet and slimy appearance, was a deep dark brown in color and when the licensee repositioned the rabbit, a
section of this discolored fur pulled off. There was a presence of maggots on the rabbit where the discolored fur was
noted.
The licensee stated that these conditions were observed last week but no veterinary care has been provided and
the licensee has not had a conversation with the attending veterinarian regarding these serious health issues prior
to the inspection. These animals are suffering and the health conditions are adversely affecting their health and
well-being. These animals must receive immediate veterinary care and be examined by a veterinarian for diagnosis
and treatment. Documentation must be maintained on the veterinary care provided to these animals. Diagnosis is
critical to the health of all the rabbits should this involve a communicable disease. Correct by 8 PM CST on July 8,
2014.
3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General.
There is a leak on a water line for the automatic watering system in the center row of cages on the bottom right side,
which was affecting at least one enclosure occupied by one rabbit. Wood shavings are saturated in the collection
tray and water is beginning to pool up on the floor. Water receptacles that are not in good working order may fail
and lead to the rabbit not having access to water. Sharp wire clips used to secure the food receptacles were
observed on approximately one-third of the primary enclosures affecting at least 70 rabbits. The points were facingthe inside of the cages and can come into direct contact with the animals. These sharp points may cause injury or
death to the animals. Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
rabbits from injury. Correct by July 11, 2014.
3.53(c)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Space.
Two enclosures containing weaned rabbits did not provide the minimum amount of required floor space. Both
enclosures measured 2 feet by 3 feet providing a total of 6 sq. ft. of floor space for the animals housed within. One
enclosure contained three rabbits weighing 6 pounds each would require a total of 9 sq. ft and therefore were short
of floor space by 3 sq. ft. The second enclosure contained four rabbits also weighing 6 pounds each would require a
total of 12 sq. ft. and thus were short by 6 sq. ft. or 50% of their required floor space. Inadequate space may affect
the health of the rabbits by limiting their ability to move in a normal manner and could lead to compatibility issues.
Provide these rabbits with at least the required minimum of floor space to allow them to make normal postural
adjustments with adequate freedom of movement and to provide for their overall health and well-being. Correct by
July 9, 2014.
3.54(b)
FEEDING.
At least three food receptacles were observed having caked feed in them. One rabbit was affected by a food
receptacle being blocked with caked feed making it difficult for the animal to eat properly. Approximately two
enclosures not containing any animals had caked and deteriorating feed in them. Feed being left in an enclosure
with no animal can become moldy and may attract pests which can cause diseases. All food receptacles shall be
kept clean and sanitized at least once every two weeks. Caked feed must be removed and measures must be taken
to prevent molding and deterioration. Correct by July 11, 2014.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.
An excessive build up of excreta were observed in six enclosures affecting at least 8 rabbits. The licensee stated it
had been about two weeks since these enclosures were cleaned. Buildup of hair, grime, dust and cobwebs was
observed on the bottom and sides of all the enclosures. Excessive amounts of excreta and debris within the primary
enclosures can attract pests. It can also lead to diseases affecting the animals. Remove excreta from these
enclosures and clean trays underneath at least once weekly. Remove hair, grime, dust and cobweb buildup and
maintain all primary enclosures by periodic cleaning to keep them reasonably free of excreta, hair, cobwebs andother debris. Correct by July 15, 2014.
3.56(b)(1)
SANITATION.
Sanitation of primary enclosures.
The primary enclosures have not been sanitized in the last 30 days. This is evidenced by an excessive build up of
hair, dust, cobwebs and grime on virtually every surface especially the upper portions of the enclosures, ledges and
areas between the enclosures. Failure to sanitize the primary enclosures regularly could attract pests and lead to
diseases affecting the rabbits. Sanitize all primary enclosures using the methods prescribed in paragraph (b) (3) of
this section and maintain on a regular frequency but not less than once every 30 days to reduce these risks. Correct
by August 1, 2014.
3.56(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
There were a number of empty enclosures throughout the facility with excessive hair, cobwebs and dust built up on
the surfaces of the wire. At least two empty enclosures still had feed in the food receptacles that had not been
disposed of and one of these had an excessive layer of excreta, hair, shavings and dust buildup covering all
surfaces of the enclosure. The automatic water line, exhaust fan, walls and ceiling of the housing area also had a
buildup of dust, hair and cobwebs. Unused enclosures not kept in a clean and ready to use condition while in and
around occupied primary enclosures can attract pests and vermin, which could carry diseases or otherwise affect
the health of the animals. Buildup on the other surfaces of the housing area hinder prescribed husbandry practices
and buildup on the fan may affect its operation. Remove the buildup from these enclosures, walls, ceiling, fans, and
water lines and maintain all primary enclosures and housing facilities in a manner consistent with good husbandry
practices.
The waist high plastic cabinet in the corner of the room had an accumulation of clutter on top of the cabinet
including soiled rags, batteries, fly ribbon and garbage. The garbage can next to this cabinet was overflowing with
trash. The food storage area just outside the animal housing area contains numerous items not necessary for the
care of the rabbits and there was a pile of caging materials amongst vegetation overgrowth just outside the animal
facilities. Additionally, a large tub next to the animal facilities contained standing water and aluminum cans and the
vegetation along the shed was also overgrown. Accumulations of trash, unnecessary items and vegetation
overgrowth hinder the ability to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices required in this subpart and may
provide living and breeding areas for pests and vermin. Remove accumulations of trash and unnecessary items and
control vegetation to minimize living and breeding areas for pests and vermin and to facilitate good husbandrypractices.
This was a focused inspection on the animals and animal facilities.
Inspection conducted with the owners on July 7, 2014 and exit interview conducted with the owners on July 8, 2014.
