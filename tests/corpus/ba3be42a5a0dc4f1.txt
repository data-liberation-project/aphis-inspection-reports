2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
An area of the kangaroo enclosure has an area that lacks a public barrier to prevent the public from approaching the
primary fence of the kangaroos and could possibly contact kangaroos through the fence. Lack of a public barrier could
potentially allow unwanted interaction between the kangaroos and public. Ensure that the area around kangaroos has
sufficient barriers between the animals and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the
public.

Facilities, general.
There was an area of loose wire with some points that the black leopard could contact. Loose wire and points could injure
an animal. Ensure that enclosures do not have loose wire, points, and rough edges to safely contain the animals.
Note: The facility safely blocked animal access from this area and has notified personnel that the repair is needed.
