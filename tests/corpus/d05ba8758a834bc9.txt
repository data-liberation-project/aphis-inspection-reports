PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
At the time of the inspection a maroon trailer was present outside the barn. I was informed that it had been used to
haul the animals between the home base and the fairgrounds. However, the sides and doors are in need of
attention. The bottom ~4(cid:29)- 6(cid:29) of the walls and back doors are excessively rusty. There are actual holes in the metal.
There are also holes and jagged edges present. To ensure the safety of these animals this trailer will need to be
repaired.
***To Be Corrected By: September 20, 2014 or before it is used to haul animals (cid:19) whichever is first.
This inspection was conducted at the Franklin County Fair, Wisdom Way, Franklin, MA.
An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
