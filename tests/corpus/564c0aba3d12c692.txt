* Dug holes were observed under enclosure divider fencing in three enclosures. Eight dogs are in contact with the
affected areas which are located in outdoor housing. The holes were estimated to be six inches wide by four to six
inches deep. This affects the ability of enclosure fencing to contain the dog securely. It could lead to potential injury
affecting the safety and health of the dog. The licensee must keep facilities in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and contain the animals securely.

* An estimated six fiberglass frame enclosure gates have an accumulation of hair, cobwebs and dust collecting on
top of the gates. Twelve dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in indoor housing. The affected
area covers approximately 25 to 30 percent of the surface area. Sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent an
accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards. It indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead
to potential disease or health risks. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are spot-cleaned daily and sanitized

* The wooden roof top of one shelter enclosure has an accumulation of fecal waste on 25 to 30 percent of the
available surface area. Two dogs are in contact with the affected surface which is located in indoor housing.
Unsanitary living conditions exist that could lead to potential disease risks. In addition, soiling or caking of the hair
coat exists when the dogs come in contact with the affected surface area. The licensee must ensure that excreta is
removed on a daily basis to prevent an accumulation of excreta or soiling of the dogs. Correct by 12/16/14.
