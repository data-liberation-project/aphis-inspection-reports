ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1505 on
17-Nov-16. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one was home. I contacted the licensee
by phone. He informed me he was working and would not be able to come home for inspection. I informed him I
would try again in the near future.
End of report.
