CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The patas monkey shelter area had accumulations of plastic bottles, cardboard boxes that are used for produce,
and other items in one of the stalls in the building. There was dirt and cockroaches under the boxes.
Cardboard boxes used to transport produce (and other food items) may harbor pests and facilitate the transport of
these pests from the food prep area to animal areas.
Buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in order to facilitate the husbandry practices required in
this subpart, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents, pests, and vermin.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The sable antelope shelter area has a door with a glass panel that was previously cracked by the animal exhibiting
an aggressive behavior when there is somebody in the caretaker hallway. This animal has a history of aggressive
behavior and butts his head against this door when someone is in the caretaker hallway. This glass poses a risk of
injury if it should shatter upon impact with this animal.
The sugar glider den box had chewed edges with splinters which may cause injury to the animals.
Facilities must be constructed of such materials and of such strength as appropriate or the animals involved to
prevent injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wall of the freezer near the door, and the boxes of food near this area, had large buildups ice condensate on
them.
Ice condensate may contaminate the food contained in the receptacles or boxes stored in the freezer.
Flying insects were observed inside the feed stored in a plastic container in the food preparation area.
Rodent/cockroach feces were observed on the floor and on a few bags in the dry feed storage container. There
was an open bag of fish/reptile food which can attract rodents and other pests into this area. This can lead tocontamination of the food that is being fed to the regulated animals which is being stored in the same area.
Supplies of food shall be stored in facilities, and in a manner, which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration or contamination.

3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The tiger and rhino enclosures had water and mud accumulations in the moats due to a buildup of dirt and leaves
blocking the drainage system. The camel shelter area had mud and water accumulation on the floor where animals
are housed.
Maintenance of the drainage system is necessary to prevent accumulations of mud, water, & slick surfaces that may
be dangerous to the animals. Standing water also facilitates breeding of mosquitos and other insects which may
cause stress or disease to the animals. Heavy rains in the area are a major contributor to water accumulation and
erosion of land which brings mud into the moats and shelters.

FEEDING.
Raw meat was observed on wet concrete floors in the lion & tiger dens. These floors are worn & porous and can no
longer be sanitized, which does not minimize the contamination of the meat by bacteria &/or dirt embedded in the
concrete. Bacterial or dirt contamination can spoil the meat which may affect the health of these animals.
Elevated feeding platforms are available but are not being used.

WATERING.
The drinking water for the tigers and sable antelope were dirty and muddy.
Dirty water may increase the possibility of bacterial contamination and may decrease palatability.
All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary to protect the health of the animal.

3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Excessive dust, dirt, insects, discarded equipment, & a plastic water bottle were again observed on top of the
walk-in cooler. The floor in the kitchen area had accumulation of insects on the floor behind a movable shelvingstorage cabinet.
The camel barn had pallets with plastic food containers on top. When the pallets were lifted; dirt, caked feed &
cockroaches were observed around the area. Cockroaches were also observed around the hay in this area.
The areas adjacent to the hay storage container structure had long standing accumulations of hay in front of the
entry door as evidenced by the observation of plants growing within this hay. Pallets scattered on the side and
metal roofing material were located around the area of this storage container. These areas can attract & harbor
pests and vermin reproduction.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this
subpart.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Cockroaches were observed in the camel barn and rodent droppings were observed in the feed storage container
structure.
In order to prevent food contamination by vermin and rodents, a safe and effective program for the control of pests
shall be established and maintained.
A new pest control company has been hired but has not yet performed any services. Ensure that this company is
treating all animal and food preparation/storage areas with safe products to minimize pests.
