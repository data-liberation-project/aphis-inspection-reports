2.31(a)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC has not been appointed by the CEO of the research facility, and membership has historically been on a
voluntary basis; however, after Department turnover in the summer of 2015, the voluntary participation in the IACUC
has been lacking. At this time, the attending veterinarian is also serving as the IACUC Chair, and began in this
capacity in August of 2015. She had no training or experience working as an IACUC member prior to that time, and
so the facility's IACUC responsibilities have not been carried out since February of 2015. Lack of adequate IACUC
membership impedes the ability to carry out the required IACUC functions. The CEO of the research facility shall
appoint an IACUC qualified through the experience and expertise of its members to carry out the responsibilities set
forth in 9CFR 2.31. Documentation of this appointment for each member may be kept as part of the facility's
records and shall set forth the terms of the appointments of each member, ensuring their continued participation
and accountability in carrying out the responsibilities of the IACUC. Correct by having the CEO appoint members to
the IACUC based on their experience and expertise, and retain documentation of these appointments as part of the
IACUC's records. Correct by: April 8, 2016.
2.31(c)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility's program for humane care and use of animals has not been reviewed within the past six months. A
program review has not been conducted since February of 2015. A program review must be conducted at least
once every six months to ensure aspects for optimal animal welfare are reviewed, discussed, and implemented. If a
program review is not conducted, animal welfare may decline. The IACUC must review, at least once every six
months, the facility's program for humane care and use of animals. Correct by: April 8, 2016
2.31(c)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An inspection of the facility's animal facilities has not been conducted within the past six months. The most recent
inspection was conducted in February of 2015. Animal facility inspection by the IACUC ensures optimal animal
welfare by identifying, prioritizing, and making plans for correcting areas which may contribute to animal harm ordisease. The IACUC must inspect, at least once every six months, all of the facility's animal use areas including
housing and study areas. Correct by: April 8, 2016
2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Semiannual reports have not been compiled or submitted to the facility's Institutional Official. The IACUC was not
able to complete the semi-annual program review and facilities inspection due to inadequate membership, and
therefore there was no report that was compiled. It is important to involve the IO in the IACUC(cid:25)s evaluations of the
research facility so that appropriate authority can be exercised by the IO when needed to ensure the facility(cid:25)s
continued humane care and use of animals. The IACUC must prepare reports based on the facility program review
and inspection, update them every six months, submit them to the Institutional Official, and have them available for
inspection by APHIS officials. Correct by: April 8, 2016
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Department Chair by the undersigned VMO.
