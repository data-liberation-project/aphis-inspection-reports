INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol # 1381MF as approved by the IACUC includes a scoring sheet and euthanasia criteria which was not used
during the 2015 study. An alternative scoring sheet and criteria for determining humane endpoints for euthanasia
was used. Euthanasia criteria was also changed in 2015. Although , the changes were beneficial for animal care
and welfare these significant changes must be reviewed and documented in the approved protocol.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There were a total of 45 more animals used on 2 IACUC protocols ( 1407 and 1411 ) than were approved by the
IACUC. Specifically, on protocol 1407, 64 animals were approved for use by the IACUC and a total of 80 animals
were used. On protocol 1411, 144 animals were approved for use by the IACUC and a total of 173 animals were
used. The IACUC Subcommittee findings and recommendations, as written on a November 9, 2015 document,
stated that (cid:28)Both the PI and research coordinator failed to track animal numbers.(cid:29) Animal protocols must contain the
following information: identification of the species and the number of animals to be used. A method has now been
developed to accurately track the correct number of animals approved for use on a protocol. CORRECTED AT

ANNUAL REPORT.
The annual report submitted for 2015 does not include the exceptions to the standards and regulations regarding
sanitation of indoor primary enclosures and feeding of non human primates. Indoor primary enclosures must be
sanitized every 2 weeks and sanitization is extended to 28 days on 12 IACUC protocols. One approved protocol
allows for feeding 70 % of the normal diet to pregnant animals. These are exceptions to the standards and
regulations and although approved by the IACUC must also be included in the annual report. The annual report
must be amended to include these exceptions.

ANNUAL REPORT.
After review of category E studies, it appears that some animals used may have experienced unrelieved pain or
distress prior to euthanasia. These animals were reported in category D on the annual report. The facility must
review E protocol animal records and amend the 2015 annual report as needed to reflect proper pain/distress
catagories.

MISCELLANEOUS.
During 2015, two incidents were reported to the IACUC that involved injury/death to baboons when handled in the
chute system. In one incident, a female baboon suffered injuries when three male baboons gained access to her in
the chute system while being transferred. The second incident occurred when a male baboon was able to lift a
chute door and attacked a female and her infant resulting in death of the infant. The IACUC investigation
determined these incidents were a result of lack of communication between employees handling the animals.
Animals must be handled carefully and in a manner that does not cause trauma. Employees have been retrained in
handling animals in the chute system and a new SOP for Moving Alert Baboons and Macaques has been developed
but has not yet been approved by the IACUC. The SOP for moving animals must be approved and followed to
ensure animals are handled carefully and without trauma.
