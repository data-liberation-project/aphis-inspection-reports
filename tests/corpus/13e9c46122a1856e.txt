ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female lion had clearly noticeable sores on both sides of her face that appeared to be scrapes or abrasions.
There were several wounds of variable sizes. One large sore on the right side, behind the eye, was roughly one to
one and a half inches long and about an inch wide with exposed pink flesh. The facility director explained that this
lion gave birth a couple of weeks ago and she scraped her face on the door of the exhibit while trying to get back
into her den. She stated that he curator, who recently left her position there, had contacted the veterinarian but it did
not get recorded. During the inspection there were no notes or other documentation available to verify if the
attending veterinarian had been contacted, if he had examined the animal, and what if any treatment was
recommended. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
Information from the attending veterinarian was provided at the exit interview. Corrected by the exit interview.
3.75(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The island enclosure housing four ring-tailed lemurs had two shelter structures each with platforms at their entry.
Along the edge of the platforms there were exposed nails which had worked their way our of the wood. The
exposed nails could pose an injury hazard to the animals. Any surfaces that come into contact with nonhuman
primates must be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animals.
Corrected by the time of exit interview.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**In the enclosure housing two black bears a support post of one of the elevated resting platforms was damaged.
Part of the wood at the base was deteriorating creating concern regarding the structural integrity of the support post.
The post should be repaired or replaced.
**In the enclosure housing two giraffes the metal roof of the barn has an exposed sharp edge with which the
animals can potentially come into contact. A small piece of the corner was bent down but could still pose an injury
risk as a sharp snag. The sharp edge and corner of the metal roof presents a potential injury hazard to the giraffes ifthey were to accidentally run into the metal or snag themselves on the sharp objects. The roof should be repaired
so that there is no risk of injury to the animals from sharp edges or pointed objects.
The housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility director.
