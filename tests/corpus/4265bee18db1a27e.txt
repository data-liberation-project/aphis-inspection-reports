2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult black and tan Cocker Spaniel (microchip #7E10242302) had mats covering at least 80% of his body. The
mats ranged from 1/2 inch to 3 inches in size. The mats were located on the dog's feet, legs, abdomen, back, sides,
neck, and ears. Many larger mats were firmly attached to the underlying skin. No skin disease was noted. Mats may
cause discomfort or pain to the animal, limit mobility, and trap moisture leading to skin disease. Mats may also hide
underlying skin infections. Correct by regular monitoring of hair coat and grooming as necessary to prevent
development of mats. Correct by December 18th, 2019.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
7 adult dogs were housed in outdoor enclosures which contained shelter but did not contain bedding. It snowed last
night and the weather at the time of the inspection was 48.7 degrees Fahrenheit. Animals housed outdoors may
experience discomfort during cold weather if adequate clean, dry bedding is not available. Exposure to cold
temperatures without adequate means to stay warm may put animals at risk for disease. Correct by providing
adequate clean, dry bedding when the temperature is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and by providing additional
bedding when the temperature is 35 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. Correct from this day forth.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
An adult male brown and white Cocker Spaniel was housed in an outdoor enclosure with a dirt floor in the metal
barn. There was an accumulation of fecal material on the floor of the enclosure, some of which was moldy. Fecal
material may attract pests and may spread disease. Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary
enclosures daily. Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.Additional Inspectors
