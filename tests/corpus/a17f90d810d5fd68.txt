SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The premises does not have a perimeter fence that can exclude unauthorized people or animals from entering the
premises. The primates are housed in enclosures that have outside access via mesh fencing. Unauthorized people
or animals could have contact with the primates through this mesh, posing a risk of disease transmission, stress, or
injury.
At the entry there is a gate, but there is no fence attached to the gate posts, allowing easy access to people or
animals. Around the perimeter there is a hedge formed from tall plants, which looks like a fence, but does not
prevent people or animals from passing through or under the barrier.
A perimeter fence that is at least six feet tall, and keeps people and animals from passing through or under the
fence is required in order to protect the exhibit animals from potentially harmful contact.
To be corrected by 1/1/17.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
