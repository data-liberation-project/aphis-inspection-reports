ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
A male and female baboon were recently acquired by the facility and are being housed together. The female has
marked, widespread hair loss although the underlying skin shows no sign of lesions. There was no indication of
infection, scratching, or any other physical skin problem. The facility representative stated that the male is abusive
to the female, and that the hair loss was due to his aggression. The representative also stated that the female
arrived in this condition. Nonhuman primates housed together must be compatible, and these animals are clearly
not compatible at this time. These animals must be separated and housed apart as soon as possible to ensure the
safety of the female.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures housing, respectively, a single adult lion and a single adult tiger are open topped cages, with fence
heights approximately 10 feet. There are short kick-ins on both fences. Cage fences of this height may not be
sufficient to adequately contain adult lions or tigers. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures housing adult big
cats are constructed and maintained to adequately contain the animals. The licensee has made progress on
constructing a closed top for the tiger enclosure, but it still does not meet current requirements.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Multiple crates of fruits and vegetables are uncovered and being stored in the facility garage. The roof of the
garage is dirty, with debris and cobwebs over the food. The facility also has dogs which have access to the garage.
This is a source of potential contamination to the stored food. The facility must take steps to ensure food for the
animals is being stored safely, and protected from outside contamination.
Correct from this point forwardThis inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
