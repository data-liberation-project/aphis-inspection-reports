Records: Operators of auction sales and brokers.
Some records did not contain the buyer or seller's driver's license number and state, and vehicle plate number.
Complete recordkeeping is important for animal traceability in the event of a disease outbreak or animal theft.
Correct from this day forth by maintaining complete records in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The following animals were contained in transport crates that were not strong enough to withstand the normal rigors of
transportation:

In the warm room, 2 arctic foxes (#944) were contained an entirely wire cage. The door of the cage was held shut with a
twisted piece of wire. An approximately 3 inch by 3 inch area on the top of the cage was severely rusted.
In the warm room, 1 young female coati (#958) was contained in a small square wire cage, the sides and top of which
were held together primarily by small metal clips. The door, located in the top of the cage, was held closed by small metal
clips. Some of the panels of the cage were bent, creating gaps between the panels.
In the livestock sale area, 2 adult African crested porcupines (#945), and 2 adult African crested porcupines (#943) were


contained in wire cages. The top panel of cage #945 was bent inwards. The top panel of cage #943 was bent inwards
causing the top panel in that area to have no contact with the top edge of the back panel of the cage. The door and the
front half of the floor of cage #943 was rusted.
In the warm room, 2 sugar gliders (#946), and 1 other sugar glider (#947), were contained in cages constructed of thin
metal wire. Approximately 30% of the wire on the sides and bottom of the cages was rusted.
Animals in transport may be injured or killed if cages or carriers are not of adequate construction and strength to endure
the rigors of transport.
Correct by maintaining animals in enclosures that meet or exceed USDA transportation standards for the species
contained within.
3.137(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The following animals were contained in primary enclosures that did not have handles or other devices for lifting the
enclosure without tipping it and to ensure that the person handling the enclosure will not be in contact with the animal
within: 1 young female coati (#958) contained in a wire cage, and 2 adult African crested porcupines contained in a wire
cage. (#943)
Personnel handling cages or crates of animals may be injured if handles are not available, causing the personnel to come
into contact with animals during movement and handling of cages/crates.
Correct from this day forth by maintaining animals in enclosures that meet or exceed USDA transportation standards for
the species contained within.
3.137(c)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.


In the warm room, a young female coati (#958) was contained in a small square wire cage, approximately 1 foot in each
dimension, which did not allow the animal enough space to make normal postural adjustments. The animal was unable to
stand or sit normally because the cage was too small. USDA inspectors notified auction personnel about the presence of
the noncompliance, after which the animal was moved to a larger travel crate that provided adequate space for normal
postural adjustments.
Animals without adequate space to turn around and make normal postural adjustments during travel may suffer from pain,
discomfort, and stress.
Correct by from this day forth by ensuring that animals are contained in enclosures that provide them with enough space
to turn around and make normal postural adjustments.
3.137(d)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
1 young female coati (#958) and 2 adult African crested porcupines (#943) were contained in carriers that did not have
solid bottoms.
In the warm room, a young female coati (#958) was contained in a small square wire cage, that had a wire bottom with no
tray or solid surface beneath. USDA inspectors notified auction personnel about the presence of the noncompliance, after
which the animal was moved to a larger solid-bottomed travel crate.
A young female African crested porcupine contained in a plastic travel crate (#910) did not have any bedding.
Travel crates must have solid bottoms or trays to prevent the spillage of fluids, waste, or uneaten food when crates are
stacked on top of each other. Travel crates with solid bottoms must have absorbent bedding to prevent the animals within
from becoming soiled by their own waste. Animals who become soiled with fluids or waste may become cold or stressed,
or may be exposed to diseases carried by other animals above them.


Correct from this day forth by ensuring that primary enclosures have solid bottoms, and that enclosures with solid floors
have a safe and suitable absorbent bedding in sufficient quantity to absorb and cover excreta.

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The following animals were contained in enclosures that were not marked on the top and one or more sides with the
words “Live Animal” or “Wild Animal”:
1 chinchilla (#920) in a plastic pet taxi
4 prairie dogs (#922) in a wire cage
1 young female porcupine (#910) in a plastic pet taxi
2 sugar gliders (#946) in a wire cage
1 adult male sugar glider (#947) in a wire cage
2 arctic foxes (#944) in a wire cage
1 young female coati (#958) in a wire cage
3 adult Patagonia cavy’s contained individually in 3 plastic pet crates (#950, 951, 952)
2 adult African crested porcupines contained in a wire crate (#945)
2 adult African crested porcupines contained in a wire crate (#943)
“Live animal” signage, with directional arrows, protects animals in transport cages/crates by identifying the contents of the
carrier as living animals and alerting personnel to the correct upright orientation of the cage or crate.
Correct by maintaining animals in enclosures that are labelled with the words “live animal” in letters not less than 1 inch in
height, with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the container.
3.36(a)(1)

Primary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters.


The following guinea pigs were contained in the warm room in container that were not adequately constructed to
withstand the normal rigors of transportation:
*5 guinea pigs in large green plastic tote (#942). The plastic tote had a flimsy screen lid with a thin wooden frame, which
was attached to the tote at one end by a zip tie. There was no other lid for the enclosure.
*2 guinea pigs (#905) in blue plastic tote with a rusted wire top which was held to the tote with zip ties. 2 other guinea
pigs were contained in an identical blue plastic tote with a wire top (#906).
Animals in transport may be injured or killed if cages or carriers are not of adequate construction and strength to endure
the rigors of transport.
Correct from this day forth by maintaining animals in enclosures that meet or exceed USDA transportation standards for
the species contained within.
3.36(a)(5)

Primary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters.
5 guinea pigs located in the warm room were contained in a large green plastic tote (#942). The plastic tote had a flimsy
screen lid with a thin wooden frame, which was attached to the tote at one end by a zip tie. There was no other ventilation
for the enclosure. The sides of the closure were solid and did not have any ventilation openings.
Adequate ventilation on at least 2 sides of a travel enclosure is essential for maintaining animal health and wellbeing.
Correct from this day forth by maintaining guinea pigs in transport crates that meet USDA requirements.
