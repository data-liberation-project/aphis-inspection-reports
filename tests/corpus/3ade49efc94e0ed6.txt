INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Several Yorkshire pigs were observed to be slipping on the linoleum/epoxy type flooring, with shavings as bedding.
During the inspection one pig was observed to have both hind legs slip in opposite directions while trying to stand
up, and another pig was repeatedly pawing with a back leg trying to find traction. Slippery floors can cause distress,
and create the potential for injury to these animals. The facility added plastic crate flooring to the enclosures of the
Yorkshire Pigs to prevent slipping during inspection.
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee must assure that the living conditions of all animals will be
appropriate for their species and contribute to their health and comfort.
Corrected during inspection.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Three older dogs (1222989, 1317645, 1329970) were observed to have severe calculi and gingivitis, with additional
debris and fur caught between the cheek teeth and gumline on dog 1329970. The normal tooth structure cannot be
identified under the calculi and tartar. Dental issues can be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally
and negatively impact the overall health of the animal. Animals with health concerns should receive prompt
veterinary care that is appropriate for their circumstances. In these cases, the facility had noted mild to moderate
tartar and gingivitis on the previous exam in Oct 2015, but these animals have not received any treatment. Although
the facility recently started a program of dental treatment, with another dog receiving a dental treatment earlier this
month, the three dogs cited here have not received appropriate care.
Several pigs had bandages to protect indwelling catheters that were soiled or loose, resulting in the catheter itself or
the site where the catheter exited the skin being exposed to contamination. The catheter sites or catheters should
be maintained to prevent contamination and infection. The bandages or jackets are not being changed or
maintained to prevent contamination.During a surgical procedure for a covered species, the emergency drug box included lidocaine, calcium gluconate
and dopamine that were past their expiration dates. In a drug cabinet located adjacent to a surgical suite, expired
drugs were observed to be stored intermingled with in-date drugs. These drugs were removed at time of inspection.
Expired drugs should be labeled and separated from in-date drugs and or medical material to minimize the potential
for misuse, which could be detrimental to the well-being of the animals.
Several pigs had excessively long hooves that needed to be trimmed. Overgrown hooves can cause discomfort and
lameness.
The failure to use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases or injuries may negatively
impact the well-being and quality of life of the animals. The facility should ensure that all animals receive
appropriate veterinary care.
3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In room B2, the fluorescent light fixture directly over the open topped pen enclosure for the dogs had separated
from the ceiling. The light fixture could fall in to the enclosure and cause injury to the animals. The light fixture is no
longer in good repair and must be repaired or replaced.
Correction date 10 October 2016.
3.6(a)(2)(x) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The floors of 2 dog enclosures in room B14 are of slatted construction. The gaps between each individual slat is
approximately 6/8 of an inch and is wide enough for the breed of dog housed in this enclosure to get their feet
caught. It was observed the dogs were spreading digits to keep from going through the openings in the floor. This
may lead to injury of their limbs and/or discomfort for the animals. The two dogs were moved out of these
enclosures at the time of inspection.
Primary dog enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that the floors protects the dogs' feet and legs from
injury, and that, if constructed of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow the dogs' feet or digits to pass through
any openings in the floor.
3.53(c)(2)PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two rabbits, weighing 5.8 Kg and 6.08 Kg were housed in an enclosure providing 4 square feet of space (2 ft x 2 ft).
Rabbits weighing more than 5.4 Kg require 5.0 square feet of space.
Enclosures with insufficient space may have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals being
maintained within them. A sufficient amount of floor space for rabbits is necessary in order to ensure that they have
enough space to make normal postural adjustments and adequate freedom of movement. The facility should ensure
that the cages housing their rabbits meet the required minimum floor space set forth in the regulations.
Corrected during inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
