2.131(d)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the show, performance animals are now allowed to run across a horizontal wood log located at the rear of
the show stage. This log is behind a waterfall and over the surface of pool of water; and is subjected to the water
from these structures. The log has become waterlogged, very soft, & flaking/splintering on the right side.
The condition of this structure does not assure the animals well-being during the exhibition. Animals shall be
exhibited only under conditions consistent with their health and well-being.
This structure shall be repaired or replaced to assure the well-being of the animals involved during the show
performances.
