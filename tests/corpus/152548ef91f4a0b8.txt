(2) The galvanized wire on the inside of the gate is bent and detached along the bottom.
All animals must have enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to prevent escape. Facilities must establish a maintenance program to keep enclosures in good
repair. Correct by April 9, 2016.
