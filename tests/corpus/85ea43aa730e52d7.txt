FEEDING.
In the "Female Building" there are plastic feeders used to provide dog food to the dogs. In at least three of these
feeders insects are found in and under the dog food. The insects consist of live maggots, live beetle larva, skins of
larva that had pupated, and at least one live adult beetle. There are at least three dogs with access to these
feeders. Insect infestation could cause contamination of the dog food and the health of the dogs could suffer.
Food receptacles used for dogs must be located so as to minimize contamination by pests and must be kept clean
and sanitized. The licensee must remove the insects and any contaminated dog food from the feeders and ensure
that all dog food remains free of insects in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
To be corrected by: The licensee removed the contaminated feeders and replaced them with clean feeders at the
time of the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Corbin Ranslem, ACI and the facility
