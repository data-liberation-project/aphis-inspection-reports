2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
Stalls containing 2 zebra, 2 dromedary camels, 2 Watusi, 2 bison, and 1 water buffalo did not have barriers or set-backs
in place to prevent contact with members of the public. The back side of each stall consisted of a 8 foot tall barrier
composed of metal bars approximately 8 inches apart. Members of the public frequently climbed on the metal bars,
reached through the bars, and touched the animals. Members of the public picked up hay and tried to feed the animals.
There were no readily identifiably employees in the area. Paper signs hung on each stall read “Stay back”. Midday, a few
pieces of brightly colored tape/ribbon was hung to keep the public back from some of the stalls, but members of the public
climbed under the ribbon and after 1-2 hours the ribbon fell down. One bison and one Watusi were observed to
occasionally lunge at people who tried to touch them. Adults were observed touching the bison on their heads and faces.
Many people were observed petting and touching the two dromedary camels.
Members of the public who have unsupervised access to exotic animals may be injured by animals that lunge, charge,
bite, or kick. Animals may be injured or stressed when members of the public touch or feed them without the supervision
of a qualified attendant.
Correct by March 12, 2021 by handling animals in a manner that poses minimal risk to animals and the public, with
sufficient distance or barriers between the animals and the public as to assure the safety of animals and the public.


3.137(a)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
In the warm room, multiple animals were contained in enclosures which were not structurally sound, did not have
adequate ventilation, and lacked handles.
*7 juvenile and adult hedgehogs (Tag #278, 280, and others) were individually contained in plastic containers that had
ventilation openings only on the top of the containers. There were no openings on the sides of the containers.
*1 adult flying squirrel was contained in a large metal wire cage that was on wheels, but two of the four wheels were
missing, causing the cage to lean to one side. The cage lacked a handle.
*2 ferrets were contained in a large metal cage that lacked handles.
Animals in transport may be injured or killed if cages or carriers are not of adequate construction and strength to endure
the rigors of transport. Animals may suffocate if carriers are not adequately ventilated or ventilation openings become
obstructed. Personnel handling cages or crates of animals may be injured if handles are not available, causing the
personnel to come into contact with animals during movement and handling of cages/crates. Correct by March 12, 2021,
by maintaining animals in enclosures that meet or exceed USDA transportation standards for the species contained
within.
3.137(e)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
In the warm room, multiple animals were contained in enclosures which were not labelled as containing “live animals” or
“wild animals” and did not have directional arrows:
*5 juvenile and adult hedgehogs (Tag #278, 280, and others) were individually contained in plastic containers that lacked
a “live animal” label and directional arrows.
*1 adult ferret (Tag #980) was contained in a plastic pet taxi which lacked a “live animal” label and directional arrows.


*1 adult flying squirrel was contained in a large metal wire cage that lacked a “live animal” label and directional arrows.
*2 adult sugar gliders were contained in a metal cage that lacked a “live animal” label and directional arrows.
*2 adult ferrets were contained in a large metal cage that lacked a “live animal” label and directional arrows.
“Live animal” signage, with directional arrows, protects animals in transport cages/crates by identifying the contents of the
carrier as living animals and alerting personnel to the correct upright orientation of the cage or crate.
Correct by March 12, 2021, by maintaining animals in enclosures that are labelled with the words “live animal” or “wild
animal” (whichever is appropriate) in letters not less than 1 inch in height, with arrows or other markings to indicate the
correct upright position of the container.
