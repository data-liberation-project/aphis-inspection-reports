ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A male Great Dane (#48) had a bright red area at the base of the toenail on the right front paw. The outer
middle toe on the right front paw had a bright red area on the toenail next to the toe. Although this dog was not
showing any signs of lameness, there was some redness on the skin of the same toe as the bad toenail. The
licensee was not aware of this dog's problem until it was pointed out by the inspector. The condition of this dog
could indicate an injury, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may be uncomfortable. The licensee
must consult a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and Chad Proctor ACI.
