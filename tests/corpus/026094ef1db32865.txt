2.75(a)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Disposition records are missing for three Bengal kittens (two females and one male) that were sold on July 16 and July
22, 2022. The two female Bengal kittens were sold on July 16, 2022 and the male Bengal kitten was sold on July 22, 2022
as indicated on their acquisition paperwork, but no accompanying disposition paperwork was available for review at the
time of inspection.
Record keeping is essential for tracing the movement of animals in and out of a facility as well as identification of animals
currently being housed at the facility.
Correct by keeping and maintaining records (including APHIS Form 7005 and APHIS Form 7006) that fully and correctly
disclose all information concerning each cat that has been purchased, or otherwise acquired, owned, held or otherwise
disposed of, in her possession or under her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed.
3.1(c)(3) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The indoor facility housing cats has accumulations of dust and cat hair along the walls, cobwebs in the corners of the
ceiling, and dirt and debris on the windowsills and blinds. There is also a large volume of spilled litter, food, and debris
covering the entire floor both under and around the enclosures. Outside, in one cat enclosure there is an accumulation of


trash and debris inside the enclosure including pieces of paper and plastic material.
Having excessive dirt and debris, especially in a room with kittens who are still developing an immune system, can lead to
increased risks of disease or illness. Trash and debris inside an enclosure can attract unwanted pests and/or cause
potential illness from ingestion and/or increased disease risk.
Correct by cleaning and sanitizing all surfaces of housing facilities to maintain generally accepted husbandry standards
and in accordance with 3.11(c) to protect all animals’ health and well-being.
3.2(d)

Indoor housing facilities.
The indoor facility housing cats has areas of the wall that are not impervious to moisture. Large areas of paint have been
peeled off the walls, removing the protective and impermeable outer layer and exposing absorbent material below.
Absorbent materials do not allow for adequate cleaning and sanitation of the room.
Maintaining impervious surfaces to moisture allows them to be cleaned and sanitized, which is critical for eliminating
disease risks, especially in young kittens that are still establishing a strong immune system.
Correct by October 8, 2022 by ensuring all floors, walls, and ceilings of indoor housing facilities are impervious to
moisture.
3.4(c) Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two of the three outdoor enclosures are constructed with wood permeable to moisture and cannot be properly cleaned or
sanitized. One of the enclosures is constructed and framed with unsealed wood. The enclosed shelter box and wooden
ramp are also constructed out of unsealed wood. Within the back left corner of the shelter box there is an area of
discolored wood that is darker in color, indicating chronic moisture that has been absorbed. The second enclosure with a
corresponding shelter box and resting platform is constructed with a mixture of painted and unsealed wood. Surfaces


permeable to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and/or sanitized as contaminated material can penetrate into the
surfaces. In addition, these structures and items are not designed or constructed in a way that they can be easily
removed or replaced once they become worn or soiled.
Having surfaces in contact with the animals that are not impervious to moisture and cannot be properly cleaned and
sanitized can expose the cats to unnecessary disease hazards.
Correct by ensuring that all enclosures, den boxes and furniture type fixtures are designed and constructed of materials
that are impervious to moisture and able to be properly cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced once they become
worn or soiled.
3.9(b)

Feeding
The receptacles holding dry food being offered to the outdoor cats are not located in a manner to minimize contamination
by pests. All dry food is offered in metal buckets that are clipped onto the side of the enclosures an inch or two above the
ground. At one of the enclosures there is a trail of ants leading to and away from the metal food pail as well as numerous
ants crawling throughout the kibble.
Contamination of food with pests such as ants can lead to unwholesome and unpalatable food as well as faster
deterioration.
Correct by September 12, 2022 by placing food receptacles in an area that is readily accessible to all cats but is located
to minimized contamination by excreta and pests.
3.11(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Excreta is not being removed from the cat primary enclosures daily. According to the licensee, none of the male cats use
the litter boxes provided and occasionally the females use them. In one enclosure the litter box had been knocked over on


its side, blocking the entrance, and preventing the cats from entering. All three outdoor enclosures, housing a total of 6
adult cats, have accumulations of excreta mixed in with the mulch and dirt floor. Inside, there are four enclosures, each
housing one adult cat and a variable number of kittens. All litter boxes had accumulations of urine and feces. According to
the licensee, all litter boxes had been completely dumped two days prior, but they are not consistently cleaned out daily.
Excreta and food waste accumulation inside primary enclosures can lead to increased disease hazards for the animals,
odors, and/or attract unwanted pests.
Correct by removing excreta and food waste daily from primary enclosures and from underneath the primary enclosures
as often as necessary to prevent the excessive accumulation of feces and food waste.
3.11(b) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Enclosures for domestic cats are not being sanitized once every two weeks. The two, wooden, outdoor cat enclosures
have multiple surfaces such as the ladder ramps, surrounding wood of the hide box, walls, and shelves that are
discolored yellowish-brown and have accumulation of brown debris. The ceilings in the shelter boxes and enclosures
have collections of dust, fur and cobwebs. The plastic carriers and furniture within all three outdoor enclosures are
covered in dirt and discolored. The four indoor enclosures have dirt and debris covering the wire walls. One enclosure
made from plastic has dark brown material adhered to the white plastic walls. The three enclosures made from coated
metal have support bars coated in dirt, debris, and litter dust.
Infrequent and improper sanitation of primary enclosures exposes the animals to unnecessary disease hazards, odors,
insects and pests. Adequate cleaning and sanitization are critical for eliminating disease risks, especially in young kittens
that are still establishing a strong immune system.
Correct by properly cleaning, and sanitizing all primary enclosures at least once every 2 weeks or as often as necessary


to prevent accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease hazards using one of the approved methods
listed in 3.11(b)(3).
3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There is not an effective pest program in place to control insects in the outdoor housing area. Ants have contaminated
food buckets and are visible in trails leading to and from the food. According to the licensee, last year she attempted to
use some stakes that go into the ground around the enclosures and release a chemical agent to control ants but her pet
dogs got into them and chewed them up. Since then, no other pest program has been put into place to try and control
insects and reduce contamination of pests in animal areas.
Pests located in animal areas can easily spread disease, bring in new diseases, or cause deterioration and contamination
of food in primary enclosures.
Correct by September 16, 2022 by creating and implementing an effective program for the control of insects and other
pests to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination of pests in animal areas.
3.125(d)

Facilities, general.
Food waste, trash, and debris are present in multiple outdoor enclosures. One fennec fox enclosure has wet, deteriorated
food waste sitting on the ground directly underneath the food pail which is clipped to the side of the enclosure. The food
pail has trails of ants to and from the food, within the food, and surrounding the deteriorated food on the ground. Large
amounts of trash and debris are present in two red fox enclosures and the potbellied pig enclosure. One of the red fox
enclosures has pieces of tarp which have been ripped off of the tarps surrounding the enclosure and dragged inside and
shredded. The other red fox enclosure has lots of shredded paper and plastic pieces spread across the floor and under a
tunnel. The potbellied pig enclosure has cracked plastic take-out containers, wood, and other plastic debris in the back by


the shelter.
Trash and debris inside primary enclosures can lead to increased disease risk, illness from potential ingestion, and attract
pests and vermin.
Correct by September 16, 2022 by ensuring food wastes, bedding, trash and debris are removed and disposed of from
primary enclosures to minimize vermin infestation and disease hazards.
3.129(b) Repeat

Feeding.
The receptacles of dry food being offered to the foxes are not located in a manner to minimize contamination by pests. All
dry food is offered in metal buckets that are clipped onto the side of the enclosures an inch or two above the ground. In
two different enclosures there is a trail of ants leading to and away from the metal food pail as well as numerous ants
crawling throughout the kibble.
Contamination of food with pests such as ants can lead to unwholesome and unpalatable food as well as faster
deterioration.
Correct by placing food receptacles in an area that is readily accessible to all animals but is located to minimized
contamination by excreta and pests.
3.131(a) Direct Repeat

Sanitation.
The Patagonian cavy enclosure and Kinkajou enclosure have large accumulations of feces and waste that covers a large
portion of their enclosures and is difficult for them to avoid encountering. The Patagonian cavy enclosure has fecal pellets
that cover approximately 2/3 of the enclosure floor area. The plastic food bucket is frequently placed on top of these
pellets and is easily contaminated due to the large volume of feces in the surrounding area. Additionally, the cavy is
required to come into contact with his own fecal matter to access the food. The Kinkajou’s bottom shelf with bedding is


completely soaked in urine and has a large pile of feces in one central area that is 4-5 inches high. The top of the pile of
feces has some white/green discoloration and that appears to be mold. The bottom shelf provides no free area for the
Kinkajou to move around so she is limited to the upper two shelves.
Large volumes of fecal matter and waste that animals cannot avoid in their primary enclosure can lead to soiling of the
animal and act as source of odor and serious disease hazards which are detrimental to the animal’s health.
Correct by removing excreta from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained within and to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
