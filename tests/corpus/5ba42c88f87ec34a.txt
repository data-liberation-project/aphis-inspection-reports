Primary enclosures.
There has been no change in the condition of the structural supports for the rabbit enclosures since the last inspection.
The metal pipes that make up the vertical supports for the rabbit enclosures are severely rusted. There are two pipes that
have disintegrated at the bottom, and are held up by blocks of wood.

Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury, to contain
them, and to keep predators out.

The structural supports for these enclosures must be maintained in good repair to ensure the stability of the stacked rabbit
enclosures and protect the rabbits from injury by the stacked enclosures falling.
3.56(b)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
There has been little change in the rabbit enclosures since the last inspection. An estimated 40 percent of the
approximately 50 rabbit enclosures have rusted areas on the urine guards, access doors, and/or an accumulation of urine
scale.

Primary enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized at least once every 30 days in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(3) of
this section.

Remove, replace, or repair the rusted urine guards, and doors so that they can be properly sanitized to prevent odor and
disease hazards. The urine scale must be removed prior to sanitizing these enclosures as it is a porous surface and

cannot be sanitized properly. Three rabbits are currently being treated for runny eyes, and sneezing. The inability to
clean and sanitize these enclosures may contribute to further contagious animal disease.

Facilities, general.
-One of the goat platforms has 3 exposed nail heads sticking up 1/4 - 3/4 of an inch.
-The 3 production pigs have a hole in one area of fence panel that has been cut leaving sharp points.
-The primary enclosure housing the Boer goats has a section of fence covering a hole in the fence. The section of fence
used to repair the hole in the fence has sharp points.
-The 3 young, male goats have a shade cloth that is tattered and torn with long strand of fiber hanging into the enclosure.
The same enclosure has a shelter in disrepair. The enclosure has an approximately 10" by 10" hole in the front, and a
board and a half missing on the side.
-There are two male sheep in the barn that houses the male goats and sheep that have a tattered and torn shade cloth
with long strands of fiber hanging in the enclosure. This enclosure also has sharp points on the outside of the shelter
where the metal siding is pulled away from the wall.
-One singly housed male sheep has a metal piece of siding on the outside of its shelter that is bent away from the wall
and has sharp points.
-Approximately 10 goats housed next to the 3 adult Jersey cows have a shelter that is in disrepair. Approximately 1/3 of
the back wall of the shelter is missing.

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor
and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.


The animal facilities must be maintained in good repair to prevent injury, or entanglement in the fence or shade cloth that
may cause injury to the animals contained. The fiber strands hanging within reach of the animals could also be ingested
causing a veterinary issue with these animals.
3.125(d) Repeat

Facilities, general.

debris. Disposal facilities shall be so provided and operated as to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease
hazards.

hazards, reduce pest infestation, and reduce odors.
3.132 Repeat

Employees.
The number of basic husbandry citations such as cleaning, and disrepair of facilities shows that there is a lack of
employees/volunteers.

A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of
husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
