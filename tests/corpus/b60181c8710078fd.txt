2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is missing acquisition paperwork for both red foxes on the property. Two red foxes currently on the property
do not have acquisition paperwork.
Failure to maintain required records prevents trace back of animals during a disease outbreak and does not allow for
proper accountability or identification of the animals during inspection.
Correct by 27 April 2022 by ensuring that records are maintained which fully and correctly disclose all information
concerning each animal for which has been purchased, or otherwise acquired, owned, held or otherwise disposed of, in
your possession or under your control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The red fox enclosure is not being maintained in good repair. The bottom metal bar of the chain link door into the red fox
enclosure has rusted and has two separate cracks in the metal surface. One crack is approximately 1" long while the
second crack is approximately 2.5" long. Metal that has rusted to the point of cracking has lost its structural integrity and
may fail to contain the animals or lead to sharp points that can injure the animals within the enclosure. Correct by 6 May


2022 by ensuring all outdoor housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and contain the animals.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility does not have continuous perimeter fence that is 6' tall surrounding the red fox enclosure or coatimundi
outdoor enclosure. The red fox enclosure is comprised of chain-link metal on all four sides and roof. The enclosure is set
on concrete. Outside of the enclosure is a standard 4' fence to separate the area from the neighboring personal pets.
There is an additional perimeter fence placed outside the secondary fence which is 6' in some areas and only 4-5' in other
areas. About half of the perimeter fence around the coatimundi enclosure is 6' in height with the remaining fence line the
standard 4-5" height. The perimeter fence is located 3' from the primary enclosure. Perimeter fences are necessary to
protect the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and
having contact with the animals in the facility. It should also serve as a secondary containment system for the animals
housed within.
Correct by 11 May 2022 by ensuring a 6' perimeter fence surrounds both the red fox and coatimundi enclosures and is
located at least 3' from the primary enclosure or by obtaining Administrator approval for a variance in the 6' height of the
fencing.
