2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
Two handling incidents occurred resulting in animal death or euthanasia:
- On February 10th 2021, a weanling spiny mouse was found dead, positioned behind the feeder against the wall, in a
cage that had been changed earlier in the day involving removal and re-attachment of the feeder. Internal investigations
determined that trauma sustained during re-attachment of the feeder was likely the cause of death.
- On April 27th 2021, 3 out of 24 individually housed hamsters were found without food in their enclosures and having
endured approximately 30% weight loss in 7 days. The hamsters were euthanized due to the severe weight loss.
Inappropriate handling, mainly cage change and feeding, resulted in the death/euthanasia of the animals in these two
incidents. Handling shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma or physical harm. At
the time of inspection, corrective actions and preventive measures had been implemented in both cases.
3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
On July 9th 2021, a spiny mouse was found dead entrapped in the feeder of a rat shoebox cage. The facility’s internal
investigation found a defect in the feeder presenting as a slightly wider gap between the wires with the damage likely
occurring in cage wash. The investigation concluded that the defective feeder allowing the spiny mouse to become


entrapped was the cause of death. This enclosure with the damaged feeder did not safely contain the spiny mouse.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound to contain and protect the animals from injury. At the time of inspection,
corrective actions and preventative measures had been implemented.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
