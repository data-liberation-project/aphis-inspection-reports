3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
There is 1 outdoor enclosure containing 5 adult dogs, which contains a shelter that has a plywood floor. The plywood
floor is buried beneath a thick layer of dirt and gravel.

In the enclosure, rodents have dug holes beneath the shelter and up through the plywood floor indicating that the plywood
floor has most likely rotted away. The areas of plywood flooring that could be seen, appear to be worn and have been
damaged by the dogs or have developed holes in the surface and is no longer impervious to moisture.

Shelter floors buried beneath layers of dirt and wood that is damaged or rotted cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized,
which could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities - including houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility - that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when
worn or soiled. The facility must remove the layers of dirt from the shelter floors and alter the damaged wooden surfaces
in a manner that allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized. The facility must ensure that all surfaces of housing
facilities are properly maintained at all times.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The facility is not removing the dog feces from the enclosures on a daily basis. There is 1 outdoor enclosure, housing 5
adult dogs, that has a heavy buildup of old and new feces. Piles of feces are scattered across the ground in the
enclosure and they consist of a mix of fresh and old feces which appear dry and white in color. The facility representative
stated that the enclosures are not cleaned daily and during the warm months the rain is expected to wash away or
breakdown the feces.

Failure to remove feces on a daily basis could increase the risk of disease as well as cause the dogs to become soiled.

Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures daily. The facility must remove the feces from the enclosures daily in
order to support the health and well-being of the animals.

To be corrected by: From this day forward feces must be removed daily.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The self-feeder in the 1 outdoor enclosure housing 5 adult dogs needs to be cleaned and sanitized. The self-feeder has a
buildup of dirt and organic material coating the exterior of the feeder.

A buildup of dirt and organic material on and within the self-feeders could increase the risk of disease hazards towards

the dog.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and
more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The
facility must clean and sanitize the self-feeder and ensure that all aspects of the enclosure are maintained in a clean and
sanitized condition in order to support the health of the dogs.

3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility is missing information on the routine for heartworm testing and fecal sampling. There is no guidance currently
provided in their Program of Veterinary Care for the percentage or total number of dogs to be sampled and the frequency
of which they should be tested for heartworm and intestinal parasites.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests. Sampling of dogs
for parasites is necessary to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

The facility must add the number or percentage of dogs to be sampled for heartworms and intestinal parasites to the
Program of Veterinary Care and have that schedule approved by the attending veterinarian.

To be corrected by: 11-March-2022.

3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility's Program of Veterinary Care does not contain preventative care and treatment plans to maintain healthy and
un-matted hair coats, properly trimmed toe nails, and clean and healthy skin.

Plans to maintain healthy skin, un-matted hair coats, and properly trimmed toenails are necessary to ensure the dogs are
receiving adequate veterinary care and are maintained in a healthy state.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care that is developed, documented in writing, and signed
by the attending veterinarian and includes preventative care plans to ensure healthy and un-matted hair coats, healthy
skin, and properly trimmed nails. The facility must add these plans to the Program of Veterinary Care and ensure that the
plans are effective at maintaining the dogs in a healthy condition.

3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility is not maintaining medical records for the dogs. The facility had the dogs physically examined by the
attending veterinarian, but there are no records containing the dogs' identities, date of the exam, or the results of the
examination. The facility representative also stated that the dogs have received the rabies vaccine but has no records or
access to records containing the identity of the dogs that received the vaccine or the date the vaccine was given.

Medical records are necessary for APHIS officials to ensure that the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.


Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. The facility
must ensure that a medical record is created for all aspects of veterinary care provided to the dogs, including vaccinations
and examinations.

To be corrected by: From this day forward the facility must create medical records.

This inspection and exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
