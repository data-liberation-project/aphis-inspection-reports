the wire floors continue to have holes up to 4 inches wide. Wire mesh on walls and tops have broken ends
extending into enclosures, and holes and gaps. Solid walls have holes, are chewed, and have peeling paint. Failure
to maintain primary enclosures in good repair can lead to injury to rabbits, including falling through floors, puncture
wounds from wires, and trapping limbs in holes and gaps. A system of maintenance and repair must be in place.
