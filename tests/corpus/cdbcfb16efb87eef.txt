HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public is allowed to enter two sheep and goat pens and have direct contact with the animals. At the time of this
inspection there was no readily identifiable attendant in either pen. Attendants are necessary for the safety of both
the people and the animals. An attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence on top of the storage container in the sheep and goat climbing yard does not appear strong enough to
contain some of the larger animals in the yard. This fence needs to be reinforced or rebuilt to be more structurally
sound in order to adequately contain the animals and protect them from injury.
The fence separating the goat climbing yard from the birthing yard consists of a variety of materials. Some of these
materials have sharp points exposed. This fence needs to be repaired or replaced and maintained in good repair to
adequately contain the animals and protect them from injury.
