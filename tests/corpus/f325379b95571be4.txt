ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:55pm on
23-Jul-18.
I arrived at the facility at 12:55pm on 7/23/2018. I knocked on the front door and called out in the barn area with no
answer. I then called the contact information provided and was told by the wife of the licensee that the family had
left for an event and would not be back for several days. I thanked her for her time and left the facility.
