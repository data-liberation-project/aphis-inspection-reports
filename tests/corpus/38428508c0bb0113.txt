2.50(a)(2) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Puppies less than 16 weeks old, from multiple litters, and without individual identification were combined in
enclosures. In one enclosure were 11 mixed breed, weaned puppies at 8-9 weeks old. In another enclosure was a
Beagle dam with 4 3- week old puppies with no identification. Proper and accurate identification is required in order
to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements for
inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The owner must identify all live regulated animals
and assure that records are kept at all times.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The floor and corners of 2 enclosures have excessive grime and mud. In the enclosure with 6 small Poodles, the
floor and corners have dried mud and other brown material over almost the entire surface. In an enclosure with 11
weaned puppies, the floor and corners have a heavy layer of dried mud and other material. It is also on the frame
for the dog door and several inches along the walls. Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta
and reduce disease hazards.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
