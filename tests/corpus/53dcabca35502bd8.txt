ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was last reviewed by the Attending Veterinarian (AV) on 9/2/2013.
The PVC must be regularly reviewed to ensure that it is still relevant to the animals held at the facility. The PVC
must specifically cover routine veterinary care, parasite control, emergency care, etc., as well as document the
required regularly-scheduled facility visits by the AV. Although there are no new species, the needs of the animals
change as they age, and changes in routine care may be necessary to ensure that the animals are happy and
healthy. A new PVC is also required if there is a new AV.
Correct within 90 days, by 5/4/2016.
