3.3(b) REPEAT
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
***Although air conditioning and two ceiling fans were operating appropriately in the whelping facility, there was a
strong odor of ammonia. This odor was observed by the inspectors by sensations of stinging and burning to their
eyes and nose and causing coughing during the entire inspection of this building. These symptoms lasted
approximately thirty minutes after the inspectors left the facility. This building was equipped with an exhaust fan, yet
the timer was broken and the fan had to be turned on manually. Windows were opened during the inspection to
release the air in the building. High levels of ammonia can cause serious medical conditions in the dogs. The
licensee must ventilate this building for appropriate air exchange to minimize conditions that can harm the animals
and assure that all buildings are ventilated as required.
