2.27(a)
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.
The registrant no longer resides at the address provided to APHIS Animal Care. The current occupant of the
address stated that he had been returning mail addressed to the registrant and that the registrant had moved some
time prior to January 1, 2017.
The registrant must notify the Regional Office within 10 days of any changes in address in order that APHIS
inspectors may perform animal welfare inspections.
Correct from this time forward.
