3.1(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are areas of rusted and sharp wire flooring in an enclosure in the Back Building. The enclosure (S-10),
contains two adult Wheaten Terriers that can come in contact with the broken and rusted wire. The affected area is
located in the outdoor run near the front of the enclosure. The plastic coating on the wire has been damaged and is
now exposing bare metal that is rusty and sharp. There are eight sharp points protruding upward from the floor. The
sharp points are between approximately one to two inches in length.
The licensee moved the dogs from the enclosure at the time of inspection.
Surfaces that are not free of excessive rust cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Excessive rust and pitting can
also affect the structural strength of the surfaces. Sharp points that the dogs can come in contact with could
potentially cause injuries. The licensee must repair or replace the rusted wire flooring and ensure all surfaces of the
housing facility are maintained on a regular basis.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
