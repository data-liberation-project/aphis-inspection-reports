FORM OF OFFICIAL TAG.
Currently there are ID tags on all of the regulated dogs, however the format of the tags is incorrect as there is no
USDA number on the tag or the letters (cid:24)USDA(cid:25).
Proper identification must be on all regulated animals for proper management and traceability of all regulated
animals.
The tags on regulated animals must be in the correct format with the proper USDA license number, the letters
(cid:28)USDA(cid:29) and the animal ID number on the tag in accordance with regulation 2.51 of the AWA.
To be corrected by: July 30, 2014
