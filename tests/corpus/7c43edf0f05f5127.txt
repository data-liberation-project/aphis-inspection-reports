ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection two animals were identified as needing veterinary care. A pygmy goat female with tag #0388
has a golf ball-sized hardened lump in front of her right shoulder. This could be the result of many possible disease
processes, including but not limited to inflammation, infection, immune disease, or cancer. A female mini Hereford
has an opaque white spot on the cornea of the right eye. Eye conditions can be extremely painful and can result in
blindness or loss of the eye if left untreated. The licensee had no documentation that these conditions had been
noticed or treated previously; however, health certificates dated 19 July 2017 showed no abnormal conditions
documented by the examining veterinarian.
These animals must be examined by and treated in accordance with a licensed veterinarian's instructions. Prior to
the delivery of the report, the licensee had documentation from the site veterinarian who had examined both of
these animals and provided instructions for treatment.
Corrected at the time of exit.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee at the Ohio State Fair in Columbus, OH. The
camel rides, petting zoo area, and pig race show were observed at this inspection.
