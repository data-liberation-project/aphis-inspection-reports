3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The wallabies have been moved to an outdoor enclosure. The outdoor enclosure does not have a perimeter fence.
All outdoor housing facilities or non-dangerous animals must have a 6 foot perimeter fence. The fence must be
constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary
enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the
perimeter fence.
A perimeter fence must be erected or a perimeter fence variance requested.
To be corrected by June 24, 2018.
