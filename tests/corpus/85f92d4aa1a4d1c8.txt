3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The "big dog(cid:29)" building had eight enclosures housing eight dogs that had an accumulation of wet and dried feces
and soiled straw bedding. The feces covered approximately half of the outdoor floor space and was thick and
packed. The bedding from the sheltered areas was collecting outside and compressed into the feces, wet, and
contaminated. The bedding was placed into the enclosures about a week previous, according to the licensee.
Accumulation of feces can harbor disease, soil the animals, and attract pests. The licensee must spot-clean daily
and sanitize in accordance with 3.11(b). Absorbent bedding must be spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to
ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the "big dog" building there are eighteen enclosures with metal and or plastic food receptacles that had a thick
brown to black greasy, wet, buildup of debris on the inside edge surfaces. The licensee stated that she cleans
them about once a week and that with the big dogs their saliva creates more need for cleaning.
The soiled food receptacles can cause disease and attract pests. The licensee must sanitize used food receptacles
at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often
if necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
