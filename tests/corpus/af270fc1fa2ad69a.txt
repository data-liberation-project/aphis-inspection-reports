Housing facilities, general.
There is flaking, pitted rust on wire areas of some enclosures in the puppy building and in the grooming building.

soiled.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The written program of veterinary care (PVC) lacks a schedule for testing or sampling for heartworm or intestinal
parasites. The PVC does include a comprehensive treatment schedule for heartworm and intestinal parasites. The PVC
does not address preventive care to ensure healthy eyes, ears, skin, and teeth. Testing for parasites like heartworm and
intestinal worms is important to ensure that current treatment methods are effective. Written guidance on preventive care
for the maintained of healthy eyes, ears, skin, and teeth is important for making sure the these areas are monitored and
maintained in good condition. Correct by 8/6/22 by consulting with the attending veterinarian to update the PVC to include
a schedule for sampling or testing for heartworm and intestinal parasites, and to address maintenance of healthy eyes,
ears, skin, and teeth.
3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
Medical records for dogs and puppies are not complete. Many medical records lack information about current medical
conditions and treatments, as well as lacking information about routine preventive care such as heartworm treatment and


deworming. Medical recordkeeping is important for ensuring that dogs receive timely and appropriate medical care.
Correct by 8/6/22 by ensuring that medical records for dogs and puppies are maintained in accordance with the Animal
Welfare Act.
