FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The barn and paddock areas have a thin layer of fecal material on the ground. The facility has been spreading out
the fecal material rather than removing it. Animal areas should be cleaned often enough to prevent animals from
becoming soiled by the feces.
A system should be in place and maintained to ensure animal and food wastes are removed from animal areas, to
minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Around the two watering troughs, a muddy area of water extends out about two to three feet. The owner stated that
this is due to overfilling. This has been an on-going problem and an attempt to absorb this extra water has been
made by putting bedding down. The animals have to stand in this muddy area to get to the water troughs. This
situation can potentially cause leg and feet problems for the animals.
A system to monitor the filling of the troughs, or a suitable method to eliminate the excess water, should be in
place.

SANITATION.
The grass around the paddock and barn area is overgrown. The grass (about 12-18 inches high) is drying and iscomprised mostly of foxtails, which can become trapped in the skin, nose, ears, or eyes, and can be hazardous to
the health of the animals. The tall grass and weeds may attract rodents and other pests to animal areas.
A system should be in place to ensure premises, including grounds, are cleared as necessary to protect the health
of the animals.
