FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength:
A 9 week old piglet (DOB 1/31/18) was housed in a raised enclosure with a panel placed on top. The panel was
placed in a haphazard manner. It had openings on each end that left the potential for the piglet to get out. When
the panel was aligned so that there were no openings it was observed that the panel could fall into the enclosure. A
tight fitting top was put on the enclosure which then allowed the panel to fit more securely. Not securing enclosure
tops could cause piglet injury. The facility must ensure that enclosure tops are safely secured.
Correction: Ensure that enclosure tops are secured from this date forward.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
