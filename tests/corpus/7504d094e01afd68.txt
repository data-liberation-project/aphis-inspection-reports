2.131(c)(1) DIRECT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On February 24, 2018, an employee of this facility brought a 9 year old boy to feed a raccoon at its enclosure
behind the barrier. While the raccoon was being fed the raccoon bit the boy around the finger area causing
puncture wounds. It was stated the boy was taken for medical treatment but did not require sutures. The raccoon
was required to be euthanized.
This raccoon was not being exhibited so there was minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public. There was
not sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and this child so as to assure their safety. This injured
child should not have been brought behind the chain-link barrier and allowed to hand feed this raccoon.
The Curator stated that this facilities employees have been instructed not to take any members of the public /
employee's friends and relatives behind animal barriers including no hand feeding. Also during this inspection there
was no public exhibiting or feeding behind any animal barriers therefore this non compliance appears to be
corrected.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the curator.
