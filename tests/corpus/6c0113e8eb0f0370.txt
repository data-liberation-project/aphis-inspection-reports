2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
The facility failed to handle a newborn llama as expeditiously and carefully as possible to prevent trauma and physical
harm, resulting in the death of the animal. Facility death records indicate that in July, 2022 a two month old llama was
found in the “front safari” pen deceased with damage consistent from vehicular trauma. According to facility
representatives, a contracted employee who was fertilizing the fields reported the death of a baby llama. Upon further
investigation by facility management, it was determined that the baby llama had been resting on the far side of a hill near
the contractor’s truck and was not spotted by the driver as they crested the hill during fertilization, leading to the death of
the animal.

Animals that are not handled carefully and protected from contractors and other people unfamiliar with the terrain of the
park can lead to serious injury and death.

Correct by February 10, 2023 by ensuring that all animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a
manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary
discomfort.


2.131(e) Critical

Handling of animals.
An adult giraffe with known health issues died soon after being subjected to cold weather. A 14-year-old female giraffe
was under veterinary treatment for a heavy parasite load and poor body condition while also nursing a 2 month-old calf.
According to facility representatives, when the baby suddenly became ill, an employee was asked to move the mother to
another stall while the baby was being treated by veterinary staff. The employee then accidentally moved the mother to
the outside yard. She was outdoors for about 30-45 minutes before being found and brought back into the barn. The
facility documented outdoor temperatures that day to be between 41 and 62 degrees. Barn temperatures the same day,
and for the preceding 3 days, were documented to be as low as 63 degrees. The following day this giraffe declined rapidly
and ultimately passed away.

It is well understood that giraffe are sensitive to cold weather and are especially susceptible to impacts from cold when
they are under stress and/or debilitated by other factors, including heavy parasitism and nursing. While a healthy adult
giraffe may be able to handle lower temperatures for limited periods, young and ill animals require higher temperatures to
support their health and metabolism. Subjecting animals to temperatures that are detrimental to their health or well-being
can lead to serious consequences such as illness and death.

The facility states that corrective personnel action was taken following this event.
Correct by February 10, 2023 by ensuring that all animals are never subjected to any combination of temperature,
humidity, and time that is detrimental to the animal’s health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the
animal’s age, species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation.

Facilities, general.
Several areas of the facility are in disrepair, leading to sharp points/edges in primary enclosures where animals can injure
themselves.

- In the petting zoo area, the hay rack is bent on one side, causing the metal pipe to crack and expose sharp edges
directly where the animals lean against the rack to access the hay at the top.
- Multiple shelters and catch buildings in the “front” and “back” safari pastures have locations where the metal siding has
detached from the underlying wall, exposing sharp metal edges and corners that are bent and protruding into animal
areas.
- The walls of the stalls in the rhino barn are covered in metal sheeting and guard rails. There are several locations along
the lower walls of three stalls where the animals have damaged the metal sheeting, punching approximately 3 to 5 inch
holes in the wall and exposing underlying materials. In some areas the damaged metal surface is bent outward into the
stalls presenting jagged and sharp edges in the animal space.

Sharp and jagged metal edges can cause physical injury to an animal when encountered. The facility took measures to
correct the damage at the time of inspection. Correct by ensuring the outdoor housing facilities are structurally sound and
maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
