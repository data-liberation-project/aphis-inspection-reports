facility review was conducted by the IACUC on February 13, 2014, which is greater than the required six month
interval (9 months between reviews)

activities involving animals at these facilities are being conducted in a manner to reduce pain and/or distress and
that they meet the current standards for all species.
The IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research
facility's animal facilities, including animal study areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A- Animal Welfare, as a
basis for evaluation.
