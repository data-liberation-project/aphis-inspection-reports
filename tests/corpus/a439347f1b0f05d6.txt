Facilities, general.

perimeter fence to escape the facility. Facility representatives attempted to locate her, and later that morning she was
found and safely retrieved with no injuries.

and possible stress, injury, or death of the animal, or injury to the public. Correct by ensuring facilities and enclosures are
constructed in a manner that contains the animals and protects them from injury. Enclosure was corrected prior to the
inspection.
