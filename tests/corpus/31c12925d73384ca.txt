2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The current attending veterinarian has stated that he does not have knowledge of non human primate species
housed at the facility and does not want to treat them. The facility needs to consult with an attending vet who has
experience with non human primates and is willing to see and treat the animals. This is especially important since
one lemur was identified on the October 2016 inspection to have behavioral or health issues that should have been
communicated to the vet and was not. This arrangement needs to be documented with a written program of
veterinary care for these species and regularly scheduled visits to the facility.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The licensee anesthetized his ring tail lemur for a bath and exam of her tail and anal region. The Ketamine used
was Lot # 121127A and had expired Oct 2015. Using expired drugs especially of this nature can impact the
effectiveness of the drug and is not considered an appropriate method to treat issues. All drugs used for the animals
must be used prior to the expiration date and expired drugs should be disposed of in an appropriate manner.

2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The lemur that was previously identified as urinating on herself and having a tail soaked with urine should have
had these issues communicated to an attending vet who was knowledgeable and willing to treat non human primate
species. The licensee did not communicate her condition to a vet but did anesthetized her and clean and examine
the area. Behaviorally it is abnormal for lemurs to urinate on themselves and this could be a reoccurring condition
behavioral in nature or due to an underlying condition. Once an attending vet with experience in non humanprimates is hired as a consultant this animal should be assessed by the vet to rule out an underlying health or
behavioral condition.
2.40(b)(4) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The licensee maintains and uses Ketamine to anesthetize his animals when needed to examine and treat them.
There is no documentation from the attending vet when this use is appropriate based on species, weight, condition,
age, procedure to be performed, and other anesthetics drugs on board. Although the licensee has dosage
information from on line sources, this does not constitute adequate guidance in using a drug of this nature which
can cause severe harm without adequate guidance from the attending vet. In addition there is no documentation for
guidance on adequate pre-procedural and post-procedural care when using drugs that immobilize animals. This
written documentation must be maintained at the facility for the health of the animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The winter building housing the non human primates and diet kitchen needs to be addressed. There are empty
crates and wire enclosures and bags of wool being stored along the wall across from the spider monkey enclosure.
These excess items trap hair, dust and debris contributing to an unclean area adjacent to the monkeys. This area
must be kept neat and free of clutter to facilitate good housekeeping practices.

3.81(b) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
*** The spider monkey enclosure still needs to have additional cage complexity added to the enclosure. There is
one shelf and one rope hanging for two monkeys. There is no other increased cage complexity including objects to
manipulate or food foraging opportunities other than hay on the top of the enclosure. These monkeys should have
additional complexity to promote brachiation throughout the enclosure and not just on the chain link mesh.
The licensee did build a few hanging devices for the lemurs and spider monkeys, but the device for the spider
monkeys was damaged and had been removed from the enclosure. Having additional enrichment complexity for the
animals that is enriching should be varied and changed out on a frequent basis to keep the area enriching for the
psychological health of the animals.
These enclosures need to be addressed and additional enrichment options given for the psychological health of theanimals taking into consideration the animals are housed indoors for 5-6 months of the year
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The building housing the wallaby's has water coming into the building by the door. This is causing the bedding in
the first stall to be wet and the bedding outside the stall next to the door had evidence of mold with white spots in
the bedding. The side wall by the door is made of wood and there is a concern that there is damage to the wall due
to excess water especially at the base of the wall. This building needs to be addressed to keep the area dry for the
health and comfort of the animals.
