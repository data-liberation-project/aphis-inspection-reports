2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 0845 on
10-Mar-20.
We knocked on the door of the house with no response. A message was left on the wife's cell phone. Contact was
then made calling the husbands cell. We were advised that they were traveling and would not be home until late
that night. They were unable to provide optimal hours or days available, except that they wouldn't be available until
sometime in April. They advised they would get back to me when they went over their schedule. I asked them if they
would consider allowing a responsible person to be available for future inspections if they were not home, and
asked them to advise me if they will.
