INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Reports of the semi-annual facility inspections and program reviews to the Institutional Official were submitted in
June 2015, June 2016 and November 2016, but the November 2015 report was not available at the time of
inspection. The records of the semi-annual facility inspections and program reviews were available and reviewed
during inspection.
The IACUC, with respect to activities involving animals and as an agent of the research facility, must perform the
function of preparing its semiannual evaluations and then submitting them to the Institutional Official in a timely
manner to keep the Institutional Official adequately informed and to comply with the regulatory requirements. The
IACUC report of its November, 2015 evaluations must be submitted to the Institutional Official.
Correct by 10 May, 2017 and for all future semi-annual facility inspections.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
