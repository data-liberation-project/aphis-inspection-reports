Due to an open pivot gate, 131 head of cattle were in a pasture for a maximum of 24 hours without water with an outside
temperature of 106 degrees F.
There was no water source available to the animals in this particular pasture as the animals weren’t supposed to have
access.

Some of the cattle were exhibiting signs of heat stress including drooling and increased respiration rates. The lack of
water can cause dehydration, distress, heat stress and even death, especially in extreme temperatures.

The registrant must ensure that potable water be provided as often as necessary for the heath and comfort of the animals.
This was corrected at the time of the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
