3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several areas on the ground (of various numbers & sizes) in all 3 fox enclosures where these animals
have dug exposing the 2"x4" wire mesh underneath. There are several holes beneath this exposed wire mesh
which now pose a risk of injury or entrapment.
The holes shall be filled in, and the wire mesh shall be covered to prevent injury. It is normal fox behavior to dig, so
all ground surfaces of the fox enclosures shall be maintained or reconstructed to prevent these types of
reoccurrences.
