FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A refrigerator with meat in it was dirty and had a foul odor of decay when opened, meat in another refrigerator was
turning brown, a papaya in another refrigerator had spots of mold on it, and grapes in a crate were set on the floor in
a workshop area with work tools and equipment around and above it. Unclean food storage and failure to remove
spoiled food in the refrigerators can cause other stored food in the area to become contaminated and may lead to
feeding of contaminated or spoiled foods which could cause illness in the animals. Supplies of food shall be stored
in facilities which adequately protect those supplies against deterioration, molding, or contamination.
These items were corrected by the time of the exit interview.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Vice President.
