ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) stated that visits would be made Bi-annually but the veterinarian last visited
the inspection in the spring of 2014 and no specific date was noted for this visit. Regularly scheduled visits may not
be further apart than directed in the PVC, this ensures that the veterinarian is familiar enough with the facility and
husbandry to make the best recommendation for health of the animals. Correct By 30 January 2015

according to regulations to prevent the spread of disease. Correct from this point forward.
