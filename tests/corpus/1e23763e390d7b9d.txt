2.50(a)(1) Repeat

Time and method of identification.
The facility uses a metal tag attached to a collar and placed around the dog’s neck as the official form of identification. At
least 9 dogs over 16 weeks of age (Theo #115, Rustin #114, Carmel #116, Lexie #119, 2 black and tan dogs and 3 black
poodles) are currently not wearing a collar with an attached metal tag.
Official identification is necessary for APHIS officials to positively identify animals for inspection or under treatment and to
properly trace their movements.
All live dogs shall be identified by an official tag affixed to a collar around the animal’s neck, by a legible tattoo marking
approved by the Administrator, or by a microchip placed under the dog’s skin. The licensee must place a collar with an
attached metal tag around the neck of the 9 dogs listed above or apply one of the other forms of identification. The
licensee must ensure that all dogs have an official form of identification at all times.
2.75(a)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is missing 2 adult black and tan dogs on their Dogs on Hand (APHIS form 7005). These two dogs are out of
dam "Taylor #77" and are approximately 5 months old.
Acquisition information is necessary for APHIS officials to make positive identification of animals during inspection or that
are under treatment and to properly trace their movements.

The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain an approved method of documentation which fully and correctly disclose all
information concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or
under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records
shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. The licensee must
record the acquisition information on an approved document for all dogs. The licensee must ensure all required
information is properly and accurately documented at all times.
2.75(a)(1)(ix) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005) is missing the disposition date for 8 dogs;
Crystal #18, Little Bear #20, Patsy #21, E-Clair #22, Billy #30, Adonis, Roscoe, Tsali.
Incomplete acquisition and disposition records may interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to accurately inventory the
animals, identify individual dogs and to track their movements.
Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain records or forms that fully and correctly disclose the date each dog was
disposed. The licensee must add the disposition dates to APHIS Form 7005 and always maintain all required information
at all times.
3.1(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The facility houses dogs in wire crates and two enclosures each containing one adult dog, has clutter on top of the
enclosure. The clutter consists of books, papers, remote controls, a plush toy and a scale.
Clutter stored on top of the enclosures could impact the movement of air, as well as become too heavy and cause the top
of the enclosure to collapse potentially injuring an animal.

The licensee must remove the clutter from the top of the enclosure and ensure that all housing areas remain free from
clutter at all times.
3.6(c)(1)(i) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
The facility has one enclosure containing two female adult dogs, “Patsy #57” and “Ashley Wilkes #79”, with inadequate
space. When “Patsy” was measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail, she measured 17” and would require a
minimum amount of 3.67 sq feet of floor space. When “Ashley Wilkes” was measured from the tip of the nose to the base
of the tail, she measured 17” and would require a minimum amount of 3.67 sq feet of floor space. For these animals to be
compatibly group housed in one enclosure, they would require a minimum of 7.34 sq ft of floor space. When the enclosure
was measured, the enclosure measured 31”Lx18.5”W and was currently only providing the two dogs with 3.9 sq ft of floor
space.
Grouped housed dogs with an insufficient amount of space can easily become stressed and/or cause erratic or
aggressive behaviors towards one another.
The Licensee must ensure that all singly housed as well as grouped housed dogs are provided with a sufficient amount of
space in accordance with this sub part at all times. This applies to all enclosures while being used as a temporary
enclosure or an enclosure being used for long term housing.
