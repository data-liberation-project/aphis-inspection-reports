ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult male blonde colored Bichon/Shih-tzu mix identified by microchip (0A02121033) has an excessively matted
hair coat. The fur is also long enough to cover the dog's eyes preventing it from being able to see clearly. There are
clumps of matted fur in various sizes found on more than half of the dog's body. Around the tail and back legs there
are clumps of dried fecal material approximately one inch by one inch matted in the hair coat. Larger areas of
matted fur approximately three inches by three inches are visible on the abdomen and along the neck and back.
Excessive matting can cause pain and discomfort to the animal. In addition, matting can foster skin infections and
can hinder the animal's ability to move of defecate normally.
The licensee needs to remove the matted fur on the dog. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the
licensee must establish and follow a program of regular coat maintenance for all of the dogs to prevent the
development of excess matting.
