2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
There were two incidents in which rabbits sustained injuries while restrained for microchipping or applying a tattoo. In
both cases, the rabbits broke free from the technician’s grip and fractured a leg. The rabbits were euthanized per the
attending veterinarian’s recommendation.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. All rabbits must be handled in a manner that prevents injury
when restrained for procedures.

Prior to the inspection, an appropriate corrective plan was implemented that included re-training and amending the SOP
to add statements that requires microchip and tattoo procedures be performed as a two-person team.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
