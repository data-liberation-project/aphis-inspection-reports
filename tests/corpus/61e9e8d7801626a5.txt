2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility has a program of veterinary care (PVC) in place, however the written PVC document could not be
located by the facility. Also, the record of animals on hand could not be located. Records need to be available for
inspection so that APHIS officials can ensure that appropriate veterinary care is available and that animals on hand
have records for animal health tracking purposes. Ensure that the records are located and that records are
maintained available for future inspections.
