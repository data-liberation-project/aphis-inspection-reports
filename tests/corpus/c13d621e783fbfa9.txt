3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There is a build-up of brown scale and debris on the bottom and lower sides of the clear plastic containers. The
cleaning process (method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this accumulation of scale and debris
inside the enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and sanitiation exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as
bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation
of scale,debris, excreta and soiled beddding and must be sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by
ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean to prevent and accumulation of scale and debris and that
enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks.
