ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:50 pm on
16-Oct-17.
At approximately 2:50 pm I left a voice message for the licensee. He called back right away. He was away from the
facility having a truck repaired and there was no other authorized person available. The licensee was surprised that
I was arriving so late in the day because historically inspectors have always arrived in the mornings or by early
afternoon so he tends to do errands later in the day. Optimal hours were discussed.
