2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On June 24th, 2021, a flying squirrel was caught in a secondary door after an interaction with a customer. The secondary
door allows animal care staff and members of the public to enter the primary enclosure of the flying squirrels. According
to a facility representative, the team member assisting the customer during the interaction, opened the secondary door
into a vestibule. Once the customer was in the vestibule, the flying squirrel attempted to leave the primary enclosure.
The employee closed the secondary door on the flying squirrel. The team member contacted the manager, who secured
the flying squirrel. The flying squirrel died at the time of the incident.

Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

This was corrected at the time of inspection by adding plastic freezer straps in front of the secondary door, changing the
secondary door to a mosquito mesh sliding door with magnetic closure, retraining staff, and increased checks by team
members before exiting the enclosure.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

This inspection was conducted 11/30/2021 to 12/01/2021,
