Veterinary care for dogs.
The current written program of veterinary care on file (APHIS form 7002A) is not complete. The program of veterinary
care does not address the sampling and treatment for parasites and other pests such as fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia,
or heartworm with a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian. A sampling and treatment program needs to be
added to the program of veterinary care to ensure adequate veterinary care is provided to the two dogs. Correct by May
