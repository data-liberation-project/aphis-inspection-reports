ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A dog # 138, "Breezy" has a growth underneath her tail next to her anus. This growth was not noticed by the
licensee and therefore has not been communicated to the attending veterinarian. This dog needs to be seen by the
vet and have the growth assessed to determine possible treatment options. Daily observation needs to be done on
all animals and if multiple people are caring for the animals a method of documenting and sharing this info to the
owner needs to be addressed.

3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The majority of feeders in the kennel are rusted along the lip of the feeder. Once rust develops the feeders can
no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. These feeders need to be replaced to facilitate cleaning of the
feeders for the health of the dogs.
*** Several areas of wood inside the shelter boxes are chewed and the area is no longer impervious to moisture.
These areas of wood need to be sanded and resealed to keep the area impervious to moisture to facilitate cleaning
and sanitizing.
*** There are a few nails protruding into the shelter box from the top wood beam. These nails need to be seared off
or covered to protect the animals from potential injury.
