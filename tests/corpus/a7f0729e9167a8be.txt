ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:54pm on
09-Mar-17.
A telephone message was left at the facility number but as of 7:24 pm I have not received a call back. This is the
third attempted inspection. Please contact this inspector with reasonable hours that an animal welfare inspection
can be conducted.
