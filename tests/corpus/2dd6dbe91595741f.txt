ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:00 pm on
05-JAN-17.
**I arrived at the facility at 4:00 pm. The gate was closed so I called the owner and left a message. I waited until
4:45 pm and called again to let the owner know I was leaving the premises.
