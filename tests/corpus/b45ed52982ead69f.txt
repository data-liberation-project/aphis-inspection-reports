ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1740 on
16-Oct-17. I went to the licensee's house and saw a facility representative leaving the property. I pulled over and
asked if he was available to do an inspection. He was busy and said it was a bad time. I asked if the licensee was
available and he said he was not. I told him I would try back another time.
End of report.
