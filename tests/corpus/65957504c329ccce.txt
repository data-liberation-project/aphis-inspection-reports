Miscellaneous.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:45 PM on 23-
MAR-22.

The inspector arrived at 1:45 PM on 3/23/22 to conduct an inspection. Due to building entry restrictions for campus
visitors, the inspector called the facility contact’s office number/left a voice message and also sent him/her an email. The
inspector waited 45 minutes to hear back from the contact then left the premises. An AWA compliance inspection could
not be conducted because there was no other authorized facility representative available to accompany the inspector.

Unannounced inspections are used to evaluate compliance with the AWA Regulations and Standards. This is the FIRST
attempted inspection of the Registrant.
