ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An arctic fox had an area behind its right ear that was missing some hair and was slightly raised and crusted. This
was something that the facility reports that it wasn't aware of prior to inspection. The crusted area looks like a scab
and could be due to numerous causes. A close up evaluation of this area is needed by the facility and attending
veterinarian and the attending veterinarian's prescribed treatment plan must be followed.
A wolf "Tatonka" was seen to have an open wound on the area over her right triceps with a scabbed wound by her
right elbow behind the open wound. The licensee said that in the past couple weeks she was bit by another wolf
and that they were putting topical Vitaderm on it. The attending veterinarian's last documented visit to the facility
was to prescribe fly medication for wolves and evaluate some pigs on 8/2/17. The facility did not have written
instructions from the veterinarian to apply Vitaderm or topical medications. During inspection, the topical Vitaderm
on hand was expired and didn't appear to have been used. Another topical product the facility said they use on the
wound was also expired and a third topical spray was shown to us that the licensee said is applied to the wound (no
expiration date was found on the spray). The facility must have the attending veterinarian evaluate Tatonka's
wounds and follow the veterinarian's prescribed treatment plan and ensure expired medications are not used and
are properly disposed of.
Untreated veterinary care problems in animals can cause them prolonged discomfort and if not treated conditions
could worsen. Ensure that animals with veterinary care problems are seen by the veterinarian and treated as
prescribed.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Two wolves were sold or given away to another individual, but the name and address of that individual was not
documented. Not properly keeping disposition records does not allow for proper tracking of the animals by an
APHIS official. All disposition records must be kept for one year after the animal leaves the facility. Correct from thisday forward.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
One wolf was separated from the pack for health observations but its didn't have adequate shelter. The shelter was
a shade cloth over half of the enclosure. The wolf's only shade available was in a completely muddy area under the
shade cloth. Lack of a dry area out of direct sunlight could cause an animal unnecessary stress. The shelter also
would not adequately protect the wolf from the inclement weather such as wind or rain. Natural or artificial shelter
must be available to protect the animal from inclement weather.
