2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was 1 guinea pig observed with a health condition requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of Veterinary
Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A tri-color adult guinea pig in Pen 50 was observed with mild
swelling of the foot pad on the right front foot. The guinea pig was not limping and appeared bright and alert. The
licensee had not observed the condition in this animal and had not contacted the attending veterinarian. The licensee
was administering an antibiotic to the herd but the Program of Veterinary Care on file also specified treatment with
soaking of the foot in an antiseptic solution.
Swollen feet can cause discomfort and worsen if not treated.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the Attending Veterinarian to
determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
