3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the building housing the large breed dogs, some of the enclosures have sides constructed of metal bars that are
showing excessive rusting. The rust causes flaking and pitting of the metal and cannot be properly cleaned and
sanitized. All rusty metal needs to be replaced or altered in a manner that allows for it to be properly cleaned and
sanitized every two weeks.
3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Throughout the building housing English bulldogs, the enclosures are constructed of wire floors and sides. Seven
enclosures, housing a total of seven bulldogs, have wires on their sides that are broken and twisted inward toward
the dogs. In two enclosures, housing a total of two bulldogs, the floor has broken wires that are twisted upwards
toward the dogs. These sharp points pose an injury risk to the dogs. All sharp points must be removed or altered in
a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the dogs and the licensee must establish a maintenance plan for the
enclosures to ensure they remain safe for the dogs.
3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
Throughout the building housing English bulldogs, the feeders have a buildup of dirt and grime on them. Food
receptacles must be kept clean in order to prevent food contamination and protect the health of the animals.
Licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are cleaned and sanitized every two weeks or as often as necessary
to prevent the buildup of dirt and other contaminates.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the building housing large breed dogs, the plastic water buckets have been excessively chewed by the dogs. The plastic frames around the access doors have also been chewed by the dogs. This damage allows dirt and
food debris to penetrate the surface of the plastic causing the buckets and door frames to no longer be properly
cleaned and sanitized. All chewed plastic buckets and plastic door frames must be replaced or altered in a manner
that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization every two weeks.
