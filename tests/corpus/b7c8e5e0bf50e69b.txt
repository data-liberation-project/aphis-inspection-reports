OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At time of inspection there were no wind or rain breaks at the entrance to two outdoor shelter structure housing five
dogs. Lack of adequate wind and rain breaks at the entrance provide the dogs with little to no protection from the
wind, snow or rain. In addition, the dogs could experience difficulty conserving body heat and maintaining normal
body temperatures. The licensee must ensure all outdoor shelter structures have adequate wind and rain breaks
for the health and well-being of the dogs. To be corrected by 10-10-15.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At time of inspection broken, protruding wires with sharp points were observed in one enclosure. The points have
broken away from the flooring of the enclosure frame. Two dogs are in contact with the affected wiring. Sharp points
could injure the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosure wires are maintained in good repair at all times
for the safety of the dogs. To be corrected by 10-01-15.
An exit interview was conducted with Cathy Niebruegge, ACI and facility representative.
