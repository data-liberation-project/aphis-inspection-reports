ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has a Program of Veterinary Care but it is not complete and does not accurately represent the practices
of the facility.
The licensee is using their broker’s vaccination schedule for the puppies, but this schedule is not documented on
the Program of Veterinary Care and has not been approved by the attending veterinarian.
The licensee does not have the puppy deworming schedule listed on the Program of Veterinary Care.
Failure to have a complete and accurate written program of veterinary care does not ensure that the dogs are
receiving veterinary care consistent with currently accepted veterinary medical practices. The program must be
amended to reflect the practices of the facility. It shall include the puppy vaccination schedule and the puppy
deworming schedule. The attending veterinarian must approve both the vaccination plan and the deworming plan.

“Kandy” a female Sheltie (Tag #035 - DOB 3/06) has severe matting and a cloudy left eye. The matting is mainly
located under her collar. The collar was tightly adhered to and embedded in the mats around the neck which made
it difficult for the licensee to remove the collar. The licensee was able to remove the collar by tugging hard. When he
tugged on the collar to remove it, some hair was pulled out and stayed attached to the collar. The hair under where
the collar was severely matted. Some of the mats were very large (several inches in diameter) and several were
tightly adhered to the skin with black/brown dirt and/or debris embedded in them. In several areas the skin under the
mats was bright pink to red in color. The left eye was severely cloudy and there was clear to cloudy white discharge
present on the surface of the eye and on the hair below the eye. The surface of the eye was uneven with a circular
defect in the center of the eye that was about ¼ of an inch in diameter. The white of the eye was severely reddenedand the dog was squinting slightly. There was also a very large (engorged) tick tightly adhered to the skin on the left
side of the dog’s body behind the left shoulder blade. The skin surrounding where the tick was attached was bright

framing and wire floors and sides. One of these enclosures, containing one dog, has a large gap between the wood
door and the door frame. The gap is large enough for the dog to place it’s foot through, which could result in injury
to the dog.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor housing area there are three enclosures that sit up off the ground and are constructed of wood
framing and wire floors and sides. Within two of these enclosures, containing a total of two dogs, the wood around
the openings to the shelters has been excessively chewed and damaged by the dogs.
Chewed wood cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which could increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned
and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace, repair or alter the damaged wood
in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitizing of the surface. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces
of housing facilities are kept in good repair at all times.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The flooring of the whelping enclosures are constructed of wire. In two enclosures, containing a total of 2 adult
female dogs and nine puppies, the feet and legs of the puppies were observed passing through the openings in the
flooring. Openings in flooring that are large enough to allow the feet and legs to pass through could cause injuries
to the puppies, as well as create difficulty for the puppies to move about in the enclosure.
Primary enclosures must have flooring that is constructed in a manner that protects the dogs’ feet and legs from
injury and does not allow the dogs’ feet to pass through any openings. The licensee must alter the flooring in the
whelping enclosures in a manner that does not allow the puppies’ feet and legs to pass through the openings.

3.11(b)(2)CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the outdoor housing area there are three enclosures that sit up off the ground and are constructed of wood
framing and wire floors and sides. In the last enclosure, containing one dog, there is a metal self-feeder lying on the
floor. There is a thick buildup of dirt, grime, and old straw on the inside of the feeder. Buildup of dirt, grime and
debris on the feeder could increase the risk of disease towards the dog.
Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles must be sanitized once every two weeks or more often to
prevent the accumulation of dirt, grime and other disease hazards. The licensee must clean and sanitize this feeder
and ensure that all feeders remain free of a buildup of dirt, grime and other disease hazards.
To be corrected by: The licensee removed this feeder from the enclosure at the time of the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with ACI, Kelly Maxwell, SACS, Heather Cole, ARD, Elizabeth Meek
and the facility representative.
