SANITATION.
Surgery suite: There was an accumulation of dust on screen monitors and other equipment items in this room. The
base of an intravenous fluid stand had a moderate buildup of dust and mineralized debris. An area of the ceiling
adjacent to a light fixture had evidence of flaking and peeling paint. Surfaces in animal areas should be kept clean,
sanitized and maintained in good repair to reduce the potential for contamination and to protect the health and
well-being of the animals. A system must be in place that adequately facilitates the prescribed husbandry practices.
