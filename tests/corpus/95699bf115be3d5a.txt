2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On April 19, 2019 a child was injured when interacting with a wolf hybrid on exhibit, as reported to the County
Health Department. The wolf hybrid was sleeping but was startled when the child was placed next to it by a family
member. The wolf hybrid caused an abrasion on the right side of the child’s face and on top of its head according to
documents obtained from the Health Department. Additionally, it was reported that the child’s grandmother was
injured. Neither of the attendants had direct control of the wolf hybrid, nor saw exactly what happened.
On April 20, 2019 a coatimundi injured a guest, as reported to the County Health Department. The public enters a
room and interacts freely with the animals housed there. An attendant is present, but does not have direct control of
the animals, as they are loose to roam about, jump and have direct contact with the public.
All animals during public exhibition must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public,
with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety
of the animals and the public.
