ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are 2 yorkies (#30, #32) and 2 Shihtzus' (#844, D28) that have a multiple matts on their heads, over their
eyes or on their body that need to be trimmed. The shihtzu #D28 has several matts with dirt clumped up under the
tail. The eyes are covered on all of the shihtzus' (4). The yorkie M (#32) has multiple matts on his head and flanks
that stick out, he also has an injury to his left eye that appears to be a small tear on the top eyelid, that had bled in
the recent past, with a buildup of green mucus in the corner. The left rear leg appears swollen and discolored
looking like it has been bruised or injured in some way. This male also has excessively dry skin, with white flakes all
over the body. There is a yorkie M (#6449) that has a white, ulcer like spot on his right eye near the pupil area
approx 1/8", with a tiny white spot starting on the pupil area of his left eye, the eyes are watery in appearance. This
yorkie also has a large buildup of brown tarter on his teeth, with red, receding gums with gray spongy material
between the gumline and teeth in some areas. There are several dogs that need their nails trimmed on the Corgi
side of the kennel.
Matted hair coats can cause discomfort to the regulated animals, and covered eyes can cause irritation and mask
eye problems if left unchecked. Untreated eye injuries or ulcers can cause pain and possible chronic issues if left
untreated. Untreated teeth with a large buildup of tarter and receding gums can cause serious health issues if left
untreated and managed.
The licensee must keep all hair coats and nails trimmed on a regular basis to prevent the regulated animals from
developing mats that can cause discomfort, or blind the animal by covering their eyes. All eye issues must be
identified and treated in a timely manner. There needs to be a dental program provided for all dogs in the facility to
insure that all dogs are treated that have a large buildup of tarter and receding gums under the supervision of the
attending veterinarian.
