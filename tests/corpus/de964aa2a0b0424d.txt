3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The room for the hedgehogs has accumulated fecal material and bedding present on the floor. Clutter, dust and
debris are present throughout the room, and cobwebs and debris are present on the walls. Several of the floor tiles
are loose and could allow fecal material and pests underneath. Excess equipment and supplies are filling one side
of the animal room.
In addition, a large accumulation of animal cages and other equipment awaiting cleaning or disposal are present on
the ground in front of the animal building. There is no organization of these materials, and the majority are being
kept in unsanitary conditions and could potentially contribute to disease hazards within the facility.
Accumulated bedding and fecal material on the floor and loose flooring tiles contribute to odor and make it difficult to
maintain adequate pest control. Excess equipment and clutter make the animal room difficult to clean and sanitize,
and accumulated caging and other equipment preclude adequate pest control on the premises.
The floors and walls of the animal housing room must be cleaned, and clutter and debris removed from the room.
Loose flooring tiles must be removed or repaired. The licensee must also ensure that all unwanted items are
properly discarded and removed from the property, and that the premises are kept clean in order to minimize odor
and pests. Additionally, useful items must be properly cleaned, organized and stored so that all areas of the facility,especially the animal housing room, are kept clean and free of accumulation of materials in order to facilitate proper
husbandry practices.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 7/18/16, 9/11/17, 12/11/17, 3/14/18 and 2/19/19.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
