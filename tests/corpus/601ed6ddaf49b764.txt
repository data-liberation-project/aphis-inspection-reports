2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
The individual has been conducting regulated activities without a license. I contacted the individual by phone as he
was not home during a search for regulated activities. He stated that he currently posses four foxes and four
marmosets that he has used for breeding purposes. He also stated that he sold the offspring of the foxes and
marmosets approximately two years ago. The individual indicated that he understood the licensing requirements
after a thorough discussion about them. He also requested and was given the phone number to the Animal Care
Operations Office in Raleigh, NC, so he could obtain an application packet.
Conducting regulated activities without a license doesn't assure that the animals, facilities, care, etc. are meeting
the regulations and standards of the Animal Welfare Act.
No regulated activities may be conducted until a USDA license is obtained.
Note: This inspection was the result of a search.
The exit interview was conducted with the individual by phone.
