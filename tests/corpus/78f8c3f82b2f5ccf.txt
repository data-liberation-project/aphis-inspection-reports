2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
It was noted during the inspection that a male tiger was missing 3/4 of his tail. The injury occurred in Jan 2015.
The remaining portion of the tail appeared to be inflamed and reddened during the time of inspection. Although the
attending veterinarian had previously treated the injury, the tiger's tail stump has been reinjured. The facility has not
contacted the attending veterinarian regarding the current injury. Failure to provide adequate veterinary care for
animal injures can result in further injury and veterinary complications.
This animal needs to be reevaluated by the facility's veterinarian to determine an appropriate course of treatment for
the injury.
