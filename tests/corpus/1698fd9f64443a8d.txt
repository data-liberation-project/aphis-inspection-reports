ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-A female brown Poodle, "Tiana" (#0A02232648), was observed with significant generalized matting of the hair coat.
The matting was noted around the dog's face, around the eyes, along the legs, under the tail and over the dog's
back and abdomen. A facility representative stated that the dog had been that way since they had acquired the dog
about three years ago. A firm large mat was noted over the dog's right shoulder. Upon closer observation, there
was an approximately 1.5 inch long lesion noted in the region under the firmly matted hair. The skin under the mat
appeared smooth, and hairless with the lesion located in the middle. The lesion appeared moist and red and a wet
mucous yellow-like material was located around the edges of the lesion. The edges of the lesion also appeared to
be folded inward. According to a facility representative, this dog's lesion had not been identified prior to the
inspection and a veterinarian had not been contacted. The dog was not currently receiving any treatment. The dog's
matted hair could cause discomfort and can increase the risk of skin sores. The lesion on the skin over the dog's
right shoulder could be due to injury or other veterinary condition, including matted hair, and could increase the risk
of infection and/or discomfort.
-A male chocolate and tan party Pomeranian, "Rico" (0A02171112), which was housed with three other dogs was
consistently holding up its left front leg when sitting and when walking. Upon closer observation of the dog's left
front carpal region, the skin under the hair appeared to be a darker red than compared to the dog's skin on the right
carpal region. The dog also pulled back when the area was touched with a gloved hand. The dog also had small
specks of black material throughout the hair coat on the abdomen and a few mats noted in some strands of the hair
on the abdomen. According to the licensee, the dog's limping had not been notice prior to an inspector pointing out
the dog's condition. The dog was not currently receiving any treatment for the lameness condition. The dog was
also observed to have a dental condition. The teeth had a large accumulation of yellow to dark tan/brown to black
build up covering the majority of the teeth. This build up appeared heavier on both sides of the back teeth. The
dog's gums were reddened and a greyish material was noted along the gumline along a couple of the right side of
the upper cheek teeth.The gums had receded along some of the teeth as well. According to a facility representative,
this dog's dental condition had not been identified prior to the inspection and a veterinarian had not been contacted.
The dog was not currently receiving any treatment. The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause
damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This condition could be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to
eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal. The licensee must remove the matted hair and communicate with a veterinarian regarding treatment for the skin
lesion, lameness and dental condition in order to obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for
these dogs' conditions. The licensee must ensure that the treatment plans are followed and that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times. To be corrected by: September 6, 2019
