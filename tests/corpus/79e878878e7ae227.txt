3.1(a) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The rotted interior wooden support post, just inside of the shelter door opening, has not been repaired. This post could still
injure the wolf hybrids upon entering or exiting the shelter building. The rotted wooden support post should be replaced to
keep the building in good repair and to prevent injury.
3.6(a)(2)(i) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
Dig guards are still exposed in most of the wolf hybrid enclosures. Some of these exposed, metal dig guards still have
protruding, sharp points that may cause injury. Exposed points on the dig guards should be repaired and/or removed and
the exposed dig guards significantly covered to protect the wolf hybrids from injury.
3.9(a)

Feeding
According to monthly diet/feeding charts, dated from June 2021 to July 2021, all the wolf hybrids and 2 coydogs, are only
fed every other day. None of the wolf hybrids or coydogs are under veterinary care that would warrant not feeding them.
Wolf hybrids and coydogs must be fed at least once each day for their health and well-being.
