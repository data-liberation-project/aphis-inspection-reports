Feeding.
Bedding, debris, fines, and/or feces were present in the majority of the self-feeders. Food receptacles must be located in
a manner that minimizes contamination by excreta. In addition, food receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized at least
once every 2 weeks. The self-feeders are fastened too low so that the troughs are being buried under hay, bedding, and
feces. Licensee must ensure that self-feeders are placed in a manner that minimizes contamination and that self-feeders
are kept clean. Correct by August 13, 2022.
3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
There are accumulations of wet/soiled bedding underneath a layer of fresh hay covering the floors of enclosures
especially the area by the water nipples. Inadequate cleaning and sanitization of enclosures can expose the guinea pigs
to potential disease hazards, uncomfortable living conditions, and health risks. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often
enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta, wet/soiled bedding, and other debris. Correct by ensuring that all primary
enclosures are cleaned often enough to prevent this accumulation. Correct by August 3, 2022.
