2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On Friday April 15, 2018, the licensee publicly exhibited a male Ring Tailed lemur, "Dirk" inside the store. The
animal bit a customer who required immediate medical attention. The lemur was wearing a harness and leash but
was not under the direct control of the licensee at the time the bite occurred. There was insufficient distance and/or
barriers between the animal and the public to assure the safety of the public. Any animal must be handled so there
is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public.
3.82(a)
FEEDING.
A seven to eight month old female Patas monkey, "Scarlet" is currently on exhibit in the store. This animal is fed soy
infant formula via bottle five to six times daily and supplemented only with fruits and vegetables between bottle
feedings. This diet is considered nutritionally inadequate and incomplete and could result in physical or metabolic
deficiences. The diet for non-human primates must be appropriate for the species and age of the animal according
to generally accepted professional and husbandry practices and nutritional standards.
The attending veterinarian should be consulted regarding the nutritional needs of this animal and an appropriate diet
plan designed and implemented. Correct by: close of business April 23, 2018.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the manager.
