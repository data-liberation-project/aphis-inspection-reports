2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One orange and white adult female hamster had dried matter covering its face. In addition, this hamster was
observed limping and placing limited weight on its right front leg when trying to walk. Once the licensee had
removed the dried matter from the hamster’s face, a cloudy left eye was revealed. Also revealed were skin lesions,
the largest being about ¼ inch located under the left eye exposing moist pink tissue. After the hamster had been
cleaned, the limping was not observed.
The licensee stated that they first noticed the limping and face condition at the time of inspection and the attending
veterinarian had not been consulted prior to the time of inspection. The attending veterinarian sent treatment
instructions to the licensee for this animal after the inspector had left at the conclusion of the inspection.
Failure to observe and communicate medical concerns to the attending veterinarian has resulted in this hamster not
receiving care for a condition that resulted in painful/altered mobility and skin lesions. Inadequate daily observation
of medical concerns, whether they appears mild or serious, can lead to failure to seek professional veterinary care
in a timely manner or provision of care that may not be appropriate for the animal's condition.
The licensee must observe all animals daily to assess their health and well-being. Daily observation of the animals
may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian provided that a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. Correct by 1/4/20.
* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 1/2/20 and the exit briefing done on 1/3/20 were
conducted with the licensee.
