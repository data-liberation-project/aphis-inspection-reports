One chinchilla exercise wheel had an excessive build-up of feces. An inappropriate cleaning frequency can lead to animal
contamination, disease hazards, and odors. Excreta shall be removed from the primary enclosures as often as necessary
to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. The
issue was corrected at the time of inspection.

Employees.
On October 1st, 2022, one grey male chinchilla escaped its primary enclosure and was killed by another animal within the

staff can lead to poor husbandry practices and animal welfare concerns. A sufficient number of adequately trained
employees shall be utilized to maintain a professionally acceptable level of husbandry. Employees have been retrained on
husbandry practices.
