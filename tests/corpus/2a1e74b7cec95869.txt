ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1140 on
18-Dec-18.
I arrived at the facility at 11:40am. I called the licensee. She gave me the phone number for an authorized person. I
called the provided phone number. He was out of town and would not be back until much later. I called the licensee
again and she stated she was at work and could not leave.
