3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Various enclosures were in need of maintenance:
-A wall between the camels and an area housing a sitatunga, an alpaca, a mini zebu, and 2 kangaroos had a large
hole in it.
-A pasture on the northwest corner of the property with large hoofstock (zebu, yaks, water buffalo, bison, and a
scottish highlander) had an area where animals could access a large amount of scrap metal and miscellaneous
items that could pose a hazard to the large hoofstock.
-The corner of a holding area for the serval enclosure had corners of wire panel points sticking into the serval
housing area.
Lack of enclosure maintenance can possibly allow animals to get injured. Animal enclosures must be maintained in
good repair to protect animals from injury and to contain the animals.
