2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Inside the facility with the medications currently in use, there was a Baytril inj and Oxytocin bottle with a needle and
syringe in each. When the inspector asked the licensee if they were reusing the syringes/needles, licensee stated
would use the same syringe for the same product for all of the animals, but both products are giving orally. The
licensee does have a medication list from their attending veterinarian with both of these products listed, with the
dosage, based off the manufactures label. According to the manufacture label, Baytril should be administered
intramuscularly (IM) and Oxytocin should be administered subcutaneously (SQ), intramuscularly (IM), or
intravenously (IV). Administering medications the wrong way may harm the animals and medications may not work
as anticipated. Licensee must administer medications properly, and must use a new needle and syringe for each
dog or puppy for injections and must not reuse the same needle and syringe for different medication or vaccines.
To be corrected from this day forward.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
