2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the sheltered facility there was a female English Bulldog identified as #48382F259 that had thick yellowish
matter in her right eye. The facility representative stated that the dog gets the matter in her eye periodically and that
medication is placed in the eye. When asked to see the medication, the facility representative stated that it had all
been used and that the dog had not been evaluated by a veterinarian. Eye discharge can occur due to infection,
allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful. The licensee must have this animal
examined by a licensed veterinarian to obtain a diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The treatment plan must
be followed.
***There was a male brindle French Bulldog identified as #1505 "Stewie" that had long tonails. When pressure was
placed on the feet, the toenails would turn the digits of the toes. There was also a seal/white female Boston Terrier
identified as #4833267C58 "Patty" that had long tonails. Long tonails can cause discomfort, pain, displacement of
digits and lameness if left unattended. The licensee must have the toenails trimmed on these dogs and ensure that
all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
***In the sheltered facility, there were two enclosures that contained at least seven puppies. None of these
unweaned puppies had any form of identification.
***There were two puppies, a Boston Terrier and a Dachshund in the weaned area that were in the same enclosure.
Neither of these puppies had identification attached to them. Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to meet
recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee must
identify all puppies that are less than 16 weeks old. Acceptable forms of identification include a microchip, a collar
and tag, a plastic-type collar with the required information legibly written, or a cage card as long as all the puppies in
the enclosure are from the same litter.

(e) Storage.
***In both of the sheltered facilities the opened food supply was in a container, yet one lid was laying on a shelf. The
other food container had a lid, yet it was not securely on the container leaving approximately a 1" gap. There was
an open sack of shredded paper used for bedding on top of this food container. Food that is left open and is stored
on the floor creates opportunity for pests and contamination. The licensee must assure that opened food and
bedding are stored in containers with tight fitting lids.
To be corrected from November 5, 2015 forward.
3.6(a)(2)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***In the outdoor portion of the sheltered facility, there was one enclosure containing a French Bulldog that had
sharp points. There were two long screws used to attach the lower hinge to the gate that were protruding into the
enclosure. There was also a wire on the fence that was protruding into the enclosure. All of these sharp points were
at the level of the dog. Sharp points and edges create a potential injury for the animals within the enclosure.The
licensee must assure that there are no sharp points or edges in the primary enclosures as required.
This was corrected during the inspection.
This inspection began at 1151.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative, Konnie Plumlee, VMO and
Beverly Hicks, ACI.
