2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Inside of the whelping facility there was an uncapped needle attached to a syringe, and a capped needle and
syringe laying on top of a metal file cabinet ready for use. When the inspector asked the licensee what they were
for, he said that they were for giving vaccines and medications to the dogs and puppies. When asked if he was
using a new needle and syringe for each dog or puppy the licensee said (cid:28)"No" that he would use the same needle
and syringe for the same product for all of the dogs/puppies but would clean the syringes/needles out with water in
between uses of a different product. Using the same needle and syringe on different dogs and puppies and/or with
different products could spread disease from one animal to another, may cause infection at the puncture site, and
may contaminate the medication or vaccine. The licensee must use a new needle and syringe for each dog or
puppy for injections and must NOT reuse the same needle and syringe for different medication or vaccines. The
licensee must ensure for the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and
injuries at all times.

3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces- (3) Cleaning.
***The sheltered building, along most of the underside of the east and west run of enclosures on the outside,
effecting approximately 47 dogs there is a buildup of hair, feces, and grime. On the inside of the building there is a
build up of dust, dirt, cobwebs and fly spat on all of the walls and ceilings. When questioned by the inspectors as to
when the last time he had performed a good cleaning of the interior of the building the licensee replied "Last Fall".
The floors of the sheltered facility are mostly covered in a layer of dust and dirt. The accumulation of the dirt and
grime can cause diseases and attract pests. Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the
animals.The licensee must ensure that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact with are spot-cleaned
daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks (or more often if necessary). All other surfaces of housing
facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and
practices.Additional Inspectors
