2.31(e)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
---USDA inspectors and the Attending Veterinarian (AV) observed a rhesus macaque in a restraint chair during an
IACUC-approved 90-minute scheduled procedure (Protocol 074). The animal was restrained in a crouched position and
could not sit. The AV ended the procedure upon observation of the positioning of the animal. The protocol states that
animals are to be seated during procedures requiring chair restraint. The protocol does not contain a complete description
of proper sizing of chairs used for the animals or chair training procedures. The AV subsequently determined that the
chair used with this animal was improperly sized (too large) and had prevented the animal from sitting, as approved in the
protocol.

---Protocol 195 described an ophthalmic surgical procedure in swine. However, it did not include a description of possible
impairments caused by these surgical manipulations. The lack of a complete description of potential impairments could
hinder the IACUC’s ability to adequately review the proposed use of the animals.



Per the regulations, a proposal to conduct an activity involving animals must contain a complete description of the
proposed use of the animals. Correct by December 10, 2021.
3.129(b)

Feeding.
Two feed receptacles for two pigs were coated in dark brown, dried grime. According to facility personnel, the pig food
receptacles were being changed out weekly. Unclean food receptacles can harbor disease-causing agents, which can
impact the health and well-being of the animals. Per the regulations, food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at
all times. The facility addressed this item during inspection by increasing the frequency in changing feed receptacles to
twice weekly or as needed to maintain appropriate sanitation. Corrected during inspection.

This inspection (02-04Nov2021) and exit interview (04Nov2021) were conducted with the facility representatives.
