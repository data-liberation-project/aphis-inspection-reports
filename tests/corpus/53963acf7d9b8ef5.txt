PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In August, 2016, one macaque escaped from its primary enclosure. That NHP and one NHP securely contained in
its own primary enclosure each sustained an injury to one finger. The clinical veterinarian immediately addressed
the injuries and provided surgical treatment. Both primates made full recoveries and no other NHPs in the room
were injured. The facility's investigation concluded that this incident was caused by a lock not being secured on the
exterior side panel of the enclosure during a cage change performed earlier the same day.
The facility promptly acted to address this incident by conducting investigations, reporting the incident to OLAW &
USDA, and implementing a multi-step corrective action plan to prevent similar incidents in the future. No further
escapes have occurred. Primary enclosures must contain the nonhuman primates securely and prevent accidental
opening of the enclosure, including opening by the animal. This incident has been appropriately addressed and is
considered corrected.
This inspection (July 15 - 16, 2017) and exit interview (July 16, 2017) were conducted with facility representatives.
