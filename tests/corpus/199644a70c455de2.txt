2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* Dry, crusted, matted hair under both eyes of one adult male, white colored Bichon Frise ( tag number 111 ) was
observed. The dog quickly pulled his head away when the area under the right eye was touched. The affected area
under both eyes was an estimated 3/4 inch in diameter. On July 25, 2016 this dog was examined and the affected
area was treated by a licensed veterinarian for ulcerated periocular dermatitis found under the matted hair. The dog
was rechecked by a licensed veterinarian one week later. The licensee was instructed to use a "NeoPolyBac"
topical on the affected area until the ulcerated regions was gone and to keep the hair trimmed from around the eyes
to prevent recurrence of the problem. The licensee was instructed to call the veterinarian within one to two weeks if
this issue was not resolved. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been called back and the
problem still remains. Dried fluid discharge in the hair coat can be painful and irritating causing discomfort and can
lead to a potential spread of infection.

The licensee must have this animal reexamined by a veterinarian and have an appropriate treatment plan
administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
* The two dogs cited under veterinary care section 2.40 b 2 as a repeat noncompliance on the July 20, 2016
inspection report. The two dogs Darla ( number 04-1 ) and Bandit ( number 507 ) were examined by a licensed
veterinarian. This was verified directly with the attending veterinarian.


This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
