2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Each dealer, other than operators of auction sales and brokers to whom animals are consigned, and each exhibitor shall
make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning each
dog or cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her
control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall
include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.

* Block A (The identification Number) of form 7005 (Dogs and Cats on Hand) is blank.

All 92 adult dogs’ identification number must be listed on the Acquisition form. Complete and accurate records must be
kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals
3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
Cleaning. Hard surfaces with which the dogs or cats come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in
accordance with § 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. All other
surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry

standards and practices. Sanitization may be done using any of the methods provided in § 3.11(b)(3) for primary
enclosure

* Four enclosures throughout the premises have a buildup of grey to brown grime on the metal doors and the plastic
walls around the metal doors. The buildup of grime indicates that daily spot cleaning is not taking place. Without daily
spot-cleaning and required sanitization the disease potential can increase for the five adult dogs in those enclosures.

For the prevention of an accumulation of waste and prevention of disease hazards, all surfaces that come into contact
with the animals must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized when necessary.
3.9(b)

Feeding
Food receptacles must be used for dogs and cats, must be readily accessible to all dogs and cats, and must be located
so as to minimize contamination by excreta and pests, and be protected from rain and snow. Self-feeders may be used
for the feeding of dry food. If self-feeders are used, they must be kept clean and must be sanitized in accordance with §
3.11(b) of this subpart. Measures must be taken to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration, and caking of feed.

* The West Kennel building has stack animal enclosures with wash-downs in-between the enclosures. The lower
enclosures have metal self-feeding receptacles with no lids covering the feed. This can allow for wash water, waste or
wastewater from the wash-down above to possibly splash over onto the feed. Thus, the potential for contaminated feed,
pests and molding feed increases affecting the health of the 19 adult dogs.

For the minimization of contamination from waste, waste wash and pests, the self-feeders must be located, or preventive

measures must be in place for all feed receptacles in order to minimize contaminated feed and pests. Therefore,
decreasing the disease hazards.
