ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
White female boxer with USDA tag #044 is too thin. Her backbone, ribs, and hip bones are prominent and easily
visible. She is in the process of weaning a litter of nine puppies. Licensee increased her food when she noticed
she was skinny, but did not see any improvement in her condition. Extreme weight loss is stressful and increases
vulnerability to disease hazards. Licensee shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries. The attending veterinarian was contacted today during inspection. Guidance was given to
the Licensee to increase the dog's protein intake when weaning was complete.
Corrected at the time of inspection
