FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Housing for camels was not constructed of such material and strength as to be appropriate for the animals.
Five camels were being housed in two enclosures composed of only electrical tape and metal T-posts. Two strands
of electrical tape encircled each enclosure, both powered by solar chargers.
Electrical fences are subject to loss of integrity when power fails, such as during periods of diminished sunlight or
failing batteries when using solar power, or by shorting out by plants or other items that might contact both the wires
and the ground, such as weeds and tree limbs. Camels could easily escape such an enclosure if power were lost in
some manner. The licensee should ensure that all animal enclosures are constructed of appropriate materials with
sufficient strength that so as to contain those animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was no shelter from inclement weather in enclosures housing five camels.
The inability to take shelter from rain, especially seasonal winter rains, could cause discomfort to the animals and
adversely impact their health.
The facility should ensure that animals housed at the facility have access to shelter that will adequately protect them
from inclement weather.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was only a partial perimeter fence in place for the camel enclosures. An approximately five foot perimeter
fence was in place along three sides of the facility, including fencing between the driveway and the enclosures.
There was no perimeter fence along the side of the property bordered by a brush covered, steep hillside.
A perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unwanted persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it
can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. The licensee should ensure that an
appropriate perimeter fence is in place in order to protect their animals.
