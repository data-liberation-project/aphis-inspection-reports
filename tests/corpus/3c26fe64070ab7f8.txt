ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The attending veterinarian has not visited the facility since July 2015. Regularly scheduled visits, at a minimum
annually, should be conducted by the attending veterinarian to ensure provisions for adequate veterinary care and
oversight are maintained as required under the Animal Welfare Act. Formal arrangements with the attending
veterinarian should include at least annual visits to the facility. Correct by: April 1. 2017.
3.56(a)(3)
SANITATION.
Underneath the wire rabbit cages, an excessive amount of feces has built up covering 100 percent of the tray
surface area and the feces are forming mounds in the trays/pans underneath each rabbit enclosure. Most of the
feces are white or gray in color. The licensee informed the inspector that the feces may not have been removed for
approximately three weeks. Animal waste can contribute to unsanitary conditions, vermin infestation, odors, and
disease hazards. Pans or troughs under enclosures with wire floors must be cleaned at least once weekly.
