Sheltered housing facilities.
The interactive room contains 4 adult lemurs (2 Red Ruffed and 2 Ring Tailed) that are allowed to have direct contact with
the public. While the licensee states that there is a handler present in the room during this time, there is no direct control
of the animals when they have contact with customers. According to the licensee, customers are allowed to sit on a bench
in the encounter room and the primates are allowed to roam free on and around the customers. Customers can be given
treats such as fruit to encourage the animals to interact with them. The licensee or one employee stands in the room to
observe this.
There is a risk of direct injury to both the public and the animals in the interaction area. Correct by ensuring that primates
are under direct control at all times during interactive sessions.

Sanitation.
The wire cage housing one juvenile mountain coati was dirty. There was food waste and fecal material on the cage floor
and in a thick layer on the tray under the wire floor of the cage. A small blanket on the floor of the cage was dirty. The
licensee stated that the cage was last cleaned around June 25th (13 days prior to the inspection). Fecal material and food


waste may attract pests or harbor harmful bacteria. Correct by 7/8/22 by cleaning this coati enclosure and maintaining
enclosures in a manner that minimizes disease hazards and reduces odors.

Sanitation.
There were a large number of flies (too numerous to count) in the food preparation room and the warm room (which
housed 1 fennec fox, 3 juvenile ring-tailed lemurs, 1 hedgehog, 1 juvenile coatimundi, and 5 guinea pigs). Fly strips in the
area were 95% covered with dead flies. There were a few dead flies in the powdered lamb milk bulk storage container.
Flies may contaminate food or spread harmful bacteria. Correct by establishing and maintaining a safe and effective
program for control of insects and other pests.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
