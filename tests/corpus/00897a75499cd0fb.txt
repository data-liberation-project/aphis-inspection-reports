3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
-There were enclosures housing dogs that contained sharp points at the level of the dogs. One enclosure housing a
young dog had an access door with metal flashing strips that were bent away from the wall on the upper corners of
both sides around the door. The corners created sharp points projecting into the enclosure. Two additional
enclosures had wire ends from the fencing pointing into the enclosures. There were at least 7 wire ends projecting
upward and into one of the enclosures along the bottom of a fence. Sharp points increase the risk of injury to the
dogs. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures housing dogs are kept in good repair and contain no sharp
points or edges that could injure the dogs at all times. To be corrected by: October 3, 2017
