2.31(c)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility failed to conduct a review of the humane care and use program when the corresponding inspection of
the facilities was conducted on both 18 September 2013 and 11 March 2014. In addition, the corresponding reports
to the Institutional Official included only the results of the animal facilities' inspections. This failure does not allow
oversight of animal use and the humane care and use program by the IACUC. Without this oversight lapses may
occur that could affect adequate husbandry of the animals and their health and wellbeing. Conduct reviews of the
humane care and use program at least once every 6 months and include the results of these reviews in the reports
sent to the Institutional Official. Correct by: 5 June 2014.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with Director of Grant and Research.
End of report.
