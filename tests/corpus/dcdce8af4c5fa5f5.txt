2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
*** Several adult female llamas, one adult male llama and two adult female sheep have overgrown hooves in need of
trimming. The two sheep have overgrown hooves that are beginning to curve inwards, primarily on the rear feet. Five
llamas also have long hooves that are beginning to curve inwards. The rear feet seem to be primarily affected. As the
nails become too long and curve inwards, there is uneven pressure put on the bones and soft tissues which can lead to
discomfort, pain, and further medical conditions. Correct by August 11, 2021 by appropriately trimming the affected
hooves and maintaining hoof care to prevent overgrowth.
*** A brown, female, adult llama was found with hair/fiber loss on the inside portion of both hind limbs. The exposed skin
appears thickened, rough, and flaky. Hair loss in animals can be attributed to different underlying conditions and should
be evaluated to ensure the comfort and well-being of the animal. Correct by August 6, 2021 by having the attending
veterinarian evaluate the animal for potential diagnosis and create an appropriate treatment plan.
