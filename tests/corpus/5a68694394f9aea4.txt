ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
(a)
***** On 5/1/14 at 10:30am Hope Knaust refused to allow an inspection of the facility and records.
Present for the inspection were APHIS, USDA, ANIMAL CARE Personnel accompanied by a TX State Trooper and
Hope Knaust facility owner.
Hope Knaust stated she was not going to allow an inspection of the facility without her having a witness present. I
asked if she was refusing an inspection her reply was if you think I am going to allow an inspection without a
witness then you are wrong.
I informed her we were considering that a refusal of inspection and we would be leaving. She continued to voice her
dislike of us as we turned and left the facility.
END OF REPORT.
