2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
2.40 (a) (1) The program of veterinary care is incomplete. There is no guidance or recommendations for several of
the species that were on hand at the time of inspection including: ferrets, swift foxes, red foxes, coyotes and
wolves. The lack of adequate veterinary guidance for prevention, control, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases and
injuries does not ensure that problems of animal health are addressed adequately for these species. The written
program of veterinary care should include detailed guidance for all species on hand or under the licensee's
possession or control that are for regulated purposes.
Establish a detailed written program of veterinary care that includes all species purchased, held, or otherwise
acquired by the licensees for regulated purpose.
