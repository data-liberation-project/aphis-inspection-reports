Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On April 27th, 2022, a study was initiated under IACUC protocol #2020-06-13 on 12 New Zealand rabbits involving the
application of an experimental contact lens device to both eyes. The humane endpoints on the IACUC approved protocol
state that if symptoms of ocular pain become so severe that the animal cannot open the eye and is reluctant to manually
manipulating the eye to open, the animal will be euthanized. Research records and research staff indicate that 4 rabbits
exhibited severe conjunctival swelling and redness. The research staff further report that the animals were so reluctant to
open their eyes that general anesthetic was employed to restrain several animals for experimental observations. Per
research staff, observations on this study are usually conducted on alert animals with brief manual restraint.

Failure of the research personnel to adhere to the humane endpoints in the IACUC approved protocol resulted in these
animals experiencing unrelieved pain and distress and constitutes a significant change that was not reviewed or approved
by the committee.

On April 27th during inspector review of an animal room containing rabbits, a research staff member was observed to
administer eye drops (buffered salt solution, or BSS) to one rabbit. On discussion with the lab member, the PI had


directed its administration to assess whether the solution was contributing to adverse reactions being observed in
experimental animals. The use of BSS is approved on the protocol for lubrication of the eye throughout the contact lens
study, but the experimental assessment of topically administered BSS in a naïve rabbit was not reviewed or approved by
the IACUC. Changes in experimental design that include the addition of animal procedures and/or increase the number of
animals used must undergo IACUC review and approval prior to being implemented.

Any proposed significant changes to ongoing activities must be reviewed by the IACUC and must be approved by the
committee before the research activity is conducted.

To be corrected by May 2nd, 2022, or prior to the use of further animals on this protocol.

A focused inspection was conducted starting on April 27, 2022. This inspection report is limited to the Direct non-
compliance identified during that inspection. An additional inspection report will be delivered with the other issues
identified during this inspection.

This inspection was conducted April 27-28, 2022 and the exit briefing was conducted with the Vivarium Manager and
IACUC Chair on April 28, 2022. A second exit briefing with additional facility representatives was conducted on May 2,
2022.
