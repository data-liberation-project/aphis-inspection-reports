FACILITIES, GENERAL.
SECTION 3.125 (a) - Structural Strength.
GOATS/SHEEP/PIGS
The following items are in need of repair:
* The side wall of the goat/sheep/pig shelter building has detached from the frame. The loose panels must be
re-secured to maintain the structural strength of the wall.
* Part of the wire mesh fence fabric is no longer secured and is protruding into the enclosure. This unsecured
section of the wire mesh must be re-secured to maintain structural strength and to protect the animals housed
therein.
* There is a gap at the base of the enclosure fence, near were the fence fabric is protruding into the enclosure, that
is large enough for kids (baby goats) to climb under. This gap must be closed off to prevent animals from escaping
from the enclosure.
Facilities must be kept in good repair in order to maintain structural strength and to protect animals from injury.
ALL OF THE ABOVE ITEMS WERE CORRECTED AT TIME OF INSPECTION.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
*The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared theoriginal inspection report, which occurred on August 19, 2016.
