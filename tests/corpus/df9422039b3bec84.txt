2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
At the hyena enclosure the barrier between the public and the animals did not prevent the possibility of contact with
the animals. The barrier on the public side allows a person to easily lean over and stick fingers through the hyena
fencing. Such contact could be potentially harmful to people and animals.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
Steps should be taken immediately to prevent such contact from occurring. In the interim, this could include closing
off the area, or providing attendants. Additional barriers, if employed, to be completed by December 27, 2015. The
facility should review all animal enclosures, and ensure that unsupervised contact between the public and the
animals cannot occur.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the primary enclosure for the giraffe and other hoofstock, the wire mesh fence had become detached from the
support post along one side, and had curled up along the bottom, creating an opening where animals could
potentially pass through, or become entangled or injured. The edges of the wire mesh fencing had stiff wires that
protrude about a half an inch, and are sharp, and exposed.
Behind the large barn there was an enclosure constructed of large wooden boards, where hoofstock were housed.
One board was broken, and had a jagged edge, which could pose a risk of injury.
In the hyena night housing, the walls are lined with metal sheeting. In one corner the sheeting has been peeled up,
and protrudes about five inches horizontally, into the enclosure. The edge of the metal poses a risk of injury, and
further chewing on the metal poses a risk for ingestion.The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. These defects should be repaired in order to protect the
animals from potential injury.
To be corrected by November 5, 2015.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
