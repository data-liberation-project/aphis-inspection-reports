Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Capuchin enclosure: Ants were seen crawling on the platform and on which the food receptacle with fruit was placed. The
food was provided earlier than usual, and the capuchin was not interested in eating at the time it was presented. The food
was attracting ants to the fruit and food receptacle. The husbandry practice allowed for the attraction of pests. Alternative
method(s) for providing fresh fruit at must be implemented to prevent the attraction of pests, such as ants, and to
minimize any risk of contamination. Correct by September 18, 2021

Sanitation.
Coatimundi enclosure: A rat was seen peeking through one of the cider blocks that supports the shelter structure at the
entrance. There was also an overgrowth of brush within the outdoor portion of the enclosure that would provide safe
harbor for rodents. The current pest control measures are not effective to prevent the attraction and harborage of the
rodents. Correct September 30, 2021.
