Annual report.
The USDA Annual Report filed for Fiscal Year 2021 incorrectly accounts for the pigs. The number of pigs used in
research/teaching was stated in column C (no pain, distress or use of pain-relieving drugs) instead of the correct column
D (accompanying pain or distress to the animals for which appropriate anesthetic, analgesic or tranquilizing drugs were
used). The pigs were used in surgical procedures.
Properly identifying animals used in research on the annual report is necessary to inform the Institutional Official and
USDA Animal Care of the scope and extent of the animal use at the facility.
The 2021 annual report needs to be amended and resubmitted to USDA Animal Care with all animal use data accurately
included. Correct by July 31, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC representative.
