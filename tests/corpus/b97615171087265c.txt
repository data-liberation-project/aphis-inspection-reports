2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
(2) The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the
availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care;
* "Maggie" #165, a Silky Terrier has knotted, matted hair pulling at the skin on her neck, legs and abdomen.
* A Pomeranian #130 has matted hair around the anal region.
* A male Chihuhua #126 has dangling, matted hair on the hindquarters and long nails.
This matted hair is pulling on the skin and can cause pain. Matted hair can promote and foster skin infections
because of the trapped debris and moisture and the lack of air circulation. The licensee must remove the matted
hair from these dogs. A program of coat maintenance must be established and adhered to, to ensure that excessive
hair matting does not occur.
Inspection and verbal exit interview conducted with facility representative.
