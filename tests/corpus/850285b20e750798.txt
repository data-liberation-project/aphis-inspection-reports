SANITATION.
Indoor food storage room: Several, small, insects were observed flying in the room as well as on the walls and on
several bags of pelleted hay products used to feed sheep. Also, a storage container of loose alfalfa hay for sheep
did not have a properly fitted lid to seal the container, and upon opening the lid inspectors observed a moth fly out of
the container. Control of insects and other pests is necessary to reduce contamination and potential disease
hazards, protect the sources of food, and to promote the health and well-being of the animals. An effective program
of pest control must be established and maintained.

Corrected during the inspection.
