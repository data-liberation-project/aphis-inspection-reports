2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The larger arctic fox cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for being thinner than its cage mate, fecal
staining on the fur of its hind quarters, and not having grown in its new winter coat has still not been evaluated by a
veterinarian. While the animal appeared to have a normal body condition and its new winter coat with no fecal
staining during this inspection, slower winter coat development and problems maintaining a normal weight as
described above may be indicative of disease. This arctic fox must be assessed by a veterinarian experienced with
the species and the recommendations followed as soon as possible.
***The bobcat cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for abnormal pacing in its enclosure and for spending
the majority of its time in the rafters has still not been evaluated by a veterinarian. During the inspection the bobcat
was actively moving about in the rafters. No pacing was observed. The bobcat still spends most of its time in the
rafters according to the licensee. Abnormal behavior patterns may be indicative of physical or psychological issues
that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modifications, and must be evaluated by the attending
veterinarian as soon as possible to receive appropriate treatment and management.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The records of animals on hand are incomplete. There is no written documentation on the disposition of one
Patagonian cavy and two brown nosed coatimundi. Records of sales, donations, transfers, and deaths must be
kept. Accurate documentation of the animal inventory ensures that all animals are accounted for and receive proper
care. Records of dispositions must be maintained to ensure animals receive proper care and to facilitate the
regulatory requirements of the Animal Welfare Act.
2.126(a)(2) CRITICAL
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***The licensee refused to disclose the disposition of one Patagonian cavy and 2 brown nosed coatimundi.Licensees are required to provide information regarding the disposition of animals to an APHIS official. Failure to
provide the information to an APHIS official is in violation of the regulations of the Animal Welfare Act. The
disposition of animals is necessary for APHIS officials to track/trace animals for health issues. The disposition of the
animals must be disclosed to an APHIS official upon request at the time of an inspection. Correct by March 7, 2017.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***The licensee could not produce a written plan for environmental enhancement. Such plans are necessary to
ensure that non-human primates receive enrichment that is effective and address their species specific and
individual needs. A written environmental enrichment plan helps ensure that the psychological needs of the lemurs
are met. The facility must develop a comprehensive written enrichment plan with the attending veterinarian for the
two lemurs.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The licensee did make some modifications to the squirrel cage but there are still has sharp points and gaps
between wire mesh and the top for a portion of the enclosure. The licensee stated that on occasion he has found
wild squirrels sharing the enclosure with the regulated animals. These issues may result in escape, injury or disease
transmission. The squirrel cage must be repaired to prevent escape or access by wild animals.
***A Jacob’s sheep enclosure containing ten sheep has a gate that the licensee has secured on one side with
hinges to the support pole, but the open end of the gate is still secured only with twine. This may predispose to
entanglement, injury or escape. The enclosure must be more effectively secured for the safety of the animals.
The tin roof on one of the shelters in the Jacob's sheep enclosure is caved in. The right side of the shelter is
leaning inward and a top support pole is detached. The shelter is not structurally sound and could cause injury to
the animals should it fall over. The shelter must be repaired or removed to prevent injury to the animals.
***In the enclosure housing 4 mouflon sheep, the gate has an 8 inch hole in which the owner has attempted to
secure with wire ties. However, there are areas of unraveled chain links and wire that have sharp points. The
bottom of the chain link fencing on the left side of the enclosure (in front of the adjacent empty enclosure) is curling
upward above the ground. The portion of fence extends into the enclosure and could cause injury to an animal
walking the fence line, if a hoof or leg passes though the fencing. The hole in the gate and the curled fencing must
be repaired or secured in a manner that will prevent injury to the animals.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION. Pest Control
Fresh rat holes were observed around the shelter portion of the outdoor lemur enclosure, adjacent food storage
area, and behind the white nosed coatimundi enclosure. Rats are known to carry various disease hazards and a
safe and effective pest control program is required for animal health. Implemented pest control measures must be
continued at an appropriate frequency to prevent harborage and recolonization of the rodent population.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses approximately 50 animals and numerous non-regulated species. Based upon the continued
maintenance and pest control issues there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the
husbandry responsibilities of the facility on a daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of trained employees to
carry out the day to day husbandry duties and maintenance on the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is
needed to ensure maintenance tasks and pest control duties are performed at professionally acceptable level for
the number of animals housed at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owners.
