2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The Program of Veterinary Care document is incomplete. It does not list the specific drugs to be used for
euthanasia. The Daily Keeper Report dated 2-22-15 indicated xylazine, a tranquilizer with mild analgesic effects,
was used to euthanize a blackbuck showing neurological signs. However, xylazine is not noted in the Program of
Veterinary Care for use as chemical euthanasia.
The Program of Veterinary Care document must indicate the specific drugs to be used for euthanasia, in
accordance with the AVMA Panel of Euthanasia, to ensure animals are euthanized in a manner that causes minimal
pain or distress. The Program of Veterinary Care form must list acceptable forms of euthanasia, per the attending
veterinarian, that includes the drug name and dose to be administered. The Program of Veterinary Care must be
updated, signed and dated by the attending veterinarian to ensure animals are humanely euthanized.
