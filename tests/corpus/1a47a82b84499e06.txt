HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In all eight outdoor enclosures, containing twenty-four dogs, the concrete flooring is broken and cracked. Thesecracked and broken areas have accumulated dirt, hair and debris in them. In two outdoor enclosures the broken
concrete has resulted in standing puddles of water. Broken and cracked concrete cannot be properly cleaned and
sanitized which can increase disease risks towards the dogs.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned
or sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The broken concrete must be repaired, replaced or altered in a
manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitizing to occur at least once every two weeks or more often if

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In four outdoor enclosures, containing eleven dogs, there is no shade or shelter for the animals. The facility
representative said that there were dog houses in the enclosures and tarps covering the enclosures that morning
but he had removed them. At the time of the inspection, approximately 2 pm, the temperature was 86 degrees
Fahrenheit and all four enclosures were covered in direct sunlight. All eleven dogs were showing signs of heat
stress such as excessive panting, standing in their water tubs and attempting to lay in small pieces of shade cast by
the self-feeders hanging on the fence. Overheating can cause discomfort and serious health hazards towards the
dogs.
Outdoor enclosures for dogs must include one or more shelter structures accessible to each dog and one or more
separate outside areas of shade large enough to contain all dogs at once and protect them from the direct rays of
the sun. The licensee must ensure that all dogs have access to shade and shelter at all times.
