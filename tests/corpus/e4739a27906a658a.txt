FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The frame of one door for an enclosure housing a short tail opossum is coated with rust. As a surface rusts, the
integrity of the metal weakens and no longer will be structurally strong. The door frame must be repaired or replaced
and all surfaces maintained to prevent rust and maintain structural strength to prevent injury to the animals .
