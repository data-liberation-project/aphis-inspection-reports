This is a focused inspection limited to the inspection, observation, telephone conversation with the attending
veterinarian , and record review of Irina. Irina was observed to be extremely thin during the last inspection on
December 1, 2016.
Irina was examined by the attending veterinarian and all of his recommendations are being implemented at this
time. During this visit she was weighed again and gained three pounds in a weeks' time (although this might not be
accurate since she was eating at the time of the inspection)
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Supervisor of the Animal Care Dept.
