2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility was not able to provide records (signature of the veterinarian on the form or invoice) of the visit to the
premises by the attending veterinarian in 2015, 2016 or to date in 2017. There were notes of veterinary directions
for treatment of the animals in a handwritten log maintained by the staff.
Lack of regularly scheduled visits by the attending veterinarian might prevent the veterinarian from observing
animals and their current housing conditions to determine proper care for the health and well-being of the animals
The facility must comply with the written program of veterinary care which stated that the veterinarian will visit the
facility annually and records of the visit must be available at the time of inspection.
2.75(b)(1)

information under 2.75 b (1) was not available at the time of inspection. A system of records shall be made, kept
and maintained which accurately discloses all the required information.
