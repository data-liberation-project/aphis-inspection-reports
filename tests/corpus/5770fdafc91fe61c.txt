2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
In March 2022 facility personnel reported a concern to the IACUC regarding some hamsters in the vivarium. The animals
were under Protocol 9161 that includes housing animals in total darkness for a specific timeframe. The IACUC
determined that the investigators substantially increased the amount of time that ten hamsters were held in total darkness
without prior IACUC approval. The substantial increase in time under total darkness conditions constitutes a significant
change to the protocol.

Per this Section, the IACUC shall review and approve proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of
animals in ongoing activities before the proposed activities are conducted. This is important to ensure that all
components of the proposed significant changes in the animal use proposal are in accordance with the requirements of
the AWA.

In response to this incident, the IACUC implemented corrective measures to prevent recurrence including but not limited
to refresher training of the laboratory on protocol requirements and enhanced monitoring of the laboratory by the IACUC
and husbandry staff. Corrected prior to the inspection.


2.31(e)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Review of Protocol 0921: The IACUC approved protocol did not include information regarding the age that litters are
separated from the dam, nor did it include information on the age when genotyping of litters takes place.

Per this Section, proposals to conduct an activity involving animals must contain a complete description of the proposed
use of the animals so the IACUC can determine during its review that all components of the animal use proposal are in
accordance with the requirements as outlined in this subchapter of the AWA. The IACUC needs to address this item that
was identified for this protocol. Correct by 8/1/22.
3.28(c)(2)

Primary enclosures.
At the time of the inspection there was one hamster enclosure measuring 16” x 18” x 8” (288 sq inches of floor space) that
housed a dam and her litter of 19 pups born on 5/17/22 (35 days of age). Laboratory personnel told the APHIS inspector
that litters are separated from the dam between 21 to 30 days of age. The following issues were noted:

*The dam weighed >100grams, 11 of the young weighed 60-80 grams, and 8 of the young weighed 80-100 grams. The
enclosure provided 288 square inches of floor space, but the minimum amount of floor space required for the number and
weights of hamsters housed in the enclosure is at least 290 square inches.
*There was an area of bedding that covered approximately 1/5 of the available floor space, moistened from liquid waste,
that was compacted into a solid mass at least 3 inches deep. The interior height of the enclosure in that area of the
enclosure was less than 6 inches.



Per this Section, primary enclosures for hamsters shall provide a minimum amount of floor space per animal based on
their weight, and the interior height of the enclosure shall be at least 6 inches. Provision of a sufficient amount of floor
space in the enclosure along with an interior height of at least 6 inches allow the animals to make normal postural
adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. This item was corrected at the time of the inspection by separating the
hamsters and placing them in enclosures that provided required minimum amount of floor space and interior height.
3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
At the time of the inspection, one hamster enclosure contained the dam and her litter of 19 pups born on 5/17/22 (35 days
of age). Although the enclosure had been changed on 6/17/22 per the room log, there was an excessive amount of solid
and liquid excreta noted in the enclosure. In addition there was an area of bedding, moistened from liquid waste, that
covered approximately 1/5 of the available floor space that was compacted into a solid mass at least 3 inches deep.

Per this Section, primary enclosures for hamsters shall be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or
debris. This item was corrected at the time of the inspection by separating the hamsters and placing them in new clean
enclosures.

This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on 6/21/22 and 6/22/22. The exit briefing was held with facility
representative on 6/23/22.
