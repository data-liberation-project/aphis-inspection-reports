FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the time of inspection, the drop door used for entry of the fox enclosure was worn down with jagged, sharp
edges. The door can pose a risk of injury to the animals upon exit and entry and must be repaired or replaced.
Indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the
animals.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the general curator and APHIS personnel, Dr. Simone
Tomlinson, VMO.
