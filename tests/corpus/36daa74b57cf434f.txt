FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The enclosure housing 3 coati mundi had sharp wire protruding from the corners of the green nest box on the
upper platform. The sharp wire poses a risk of injury to the animals.
***The chain link fencing on the west side of a gobex enclosure (13 animals) was loose with numerous sharp ends
protruding into the enclosure. The fencing material was not maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury or to contain the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The enclosure housing 23 gobex did not have adequate shade to protect all of the animals from direct sunlight.
The area of shade provided to all animals was a 5 feet by 5 feet area. This area is not large enough to allow all of
the animals within the enclosure to be protected from direct sunlight. Inadequate protection from direct sunlight may
lead to overheating or discomfort from squinting.
