ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A male Beagle (031.256.609) and female Beagle (103.576.099) had excessively long toenails. The toenails were
long enough to displace the normal configuration of the digits. Long toenails can turn the digits causing pain,
discomfort, or lameness. The licensee did trim the toenails during the inspection. The licensee must develop and
follow a toenail maintenance program.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
***In the facility's sheltered building, at least 10 dog entry doors, affecting about 20 dogs, had a blackish/brown dirt
and grime on doors and doorway walls. The doorways are approximately 50% -70% covered in grime. A build-up of
grime on the doors is a disease hazard and can attract pests. Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being
of the animals. The licensee must ensure that enclosures are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least every 2
weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt and grime and other disease hazards.
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Food Storage.
***The bulk unopened dog food storage area had a bag of dog food with two softball size holes in the bag. The
licensee stated it was probably the barn cats that opened the bag. Open bags of dog food not stored in tight fitting
containers can become spoiled or contaminated which can harm the dogs. The licensee must ensure the bulk
unopened dog food remains unopened until ready to use to prevent contamination or spoilage.

3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.Ventilation.
***Upon entering the whelping facility, a refrigerator trailer, affecting 4 dogs and 10 puppies, there was a very high
level of ammonia smell. The ammonia caused a irritation to the inspectors eyes when in front of the A/C unit. The
two ventilation fans were not functioning. There were no windows or doors opened. There was some puddled urine
in the washdown. There was an air condition unit circulating the air. High levels of ammonia can cause respiratory
issues or other health issues to the dogs and puppies. The licensee must provide and ensure that the facility is
sufficiently ventilated to minimize the odors, drafts, ammonia levels and moisture condensation at all times.
