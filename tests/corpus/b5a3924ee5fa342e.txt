2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The dealer does not have proper acquisition records for 5 degus acquired in 2021. There is a paper record for 5 degus
being bought from Pet Barn in 2021. However, the paper record has no date, address or information regarding the seller,
and no address or information regarding the buyer.
Failure to maintain required records prevents trace back of animals during a disease outbreak and does not allow for
proper accountability or identification of the animals during inspection.
Correct by 26 April 2022 by ensuring that records are maintained which fully and correctly disclose all information
concerning each animal for which has been purchased, or otherwise acquired, owned, held or otherwise disposed of, in
your possession or under your control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “B” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility
representatives.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by 25 June 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.



Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
