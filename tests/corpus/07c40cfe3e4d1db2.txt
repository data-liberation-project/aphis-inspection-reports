3.13(c)(3) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection, the following animals had just arrived at the KLM cargo office:
A shipment of two carriers, each containing two French Bulldog puppies, on waybill number 074-10101324, from
the Ukraine, on flight KL-1362 and KL-607, via Amsterdam.
Neither of the crates had instructions from the shipper regarding feeding and watering during travel, or last time the
animals had been fed and watered prior to departure. In Amsterdam a sticker had been applied noting that the
puppies were offered food and water at that stop.
Failure to ensure that the shipper provides certification in writing regarding feeding and watering instructions at the
time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment can put the animal at risk. This information should be clearly displayed
on the carrier, during transit. The airline must ensure that the owner has provided this information in writing, in order
to help ensure that animals are adequately cared for while in transit.
3.14(a)(6) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At the time of inspection, the following animals had just arrived at the KLM cargo office:
A shipment of two carriers, each containing French Bulldog puppies, on waybill number 074-10101324, from the
Ukraine, on flight KL-1362 and KL-607, via Amsterdam.
Each crate had a dangling card attached to the handle on top by a string, that on one side read "KEEP UPRIGHT"
and on the other side had an illustration depicting a dog, fish, some chicks, and a turtle. The words "LIVE
ANIMALS" also appeared on this card, but in small print - less than 1/2" in height. There were no "LIVE ANIMAL"
stickers or wording elsewhere on the crates.Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it should be clearly marked on top and on one or
more sides with the words ``LIVE ANIMALS", in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high to help ensure proper handling
by transportation personnel.
Failure to properly label crates used to ship live animals could result in mishandling by transport personnel, which
could be injurious to the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative at the cargo office for KLM.
