3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The following enclosures contained excessive amounts of feces and debris build-up and were not being spot-cleaned
daily: squirrel monkey, patas, red-handed tamarin, vervet, spider monkey. Excessive fecal matter and debris serves as a
breeding ground for flies and can harbor pathogens that can be dangerous to the animals. Hard surfaces with which
nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.84 of this subpart to
prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards. Correct by June 23, 2021.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
Two enclosures had structural defects that could yield injury to the animals contained within.
**The lynx enclosure had an exposed approximately 1-inch long nail/screw protruding vertically from a board that was
decomposing on one of the elevated ramps. The crumbling board and/or the nail/screw could cause a trip/fall hazard
and/or a penetrating wound to the animals.
**The goat/llama petting zoo area shelter had an approximately 2’ long exposed metal edge. This exposed metal was at
about shoulder height to the animals. This sharp metal edge could cause injury to the animals.



Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals. Correct by June 23, 2021.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
Excessive numbers of flies were present during inspection in the food prep/kitchen area, the baby room, and multiple
enclosures, including the giant anteater, prairie dog/African crested porcupines, cavy, paca, agouti). Four young animals
(zebra, fawn, caracal, serval) were present in the kitchen; five young animals (sloth bear, binturong, kinkajou, ferret) were
present in the baby room. Excessive flies pose significant risks to each species due to potential transmission of fecal
matter and/or pathogens between the animals. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and
avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Correct by June 23, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
