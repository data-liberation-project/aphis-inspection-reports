ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has a box of Revolution (selamectin) that is indicated for use in dogs that weigh between 85.1 lbs and
130 lbs. The prescription label written by the veterinarian indicates that the species prescribed for off label use of
this medication is “rabbit.” The instructions on the label indicate “apply as directed by veterinarian.” The licensee
explained to APHIS inspector that she uses the Revolution on her hedgehogs. She places two drops of the
medication on the back of the neck area on each hedgehog once every six months. The Revolution was prescribed
to her by a veterinarian other than her attending veterinarian. At the time of inspection, the facility could not supply
any written directions regarding medication usage from either the attending veterinarian or the veterinarian who
prescribed the Revolution, nor was this medication listed in the program of veterinary care.
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is a written agreement between the licensee and the attending
veterinarian, establishing standards of care for the animals. The licensee’s decision to give an off label medication
to the hedgehogs that was not listed on the PVC reduces the veterinarian's ability to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care.
The licensee shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.

The use of off label medications is not considered to be safe or an appropriate method to prevent, control, diagnose,
and treat diseases and injuries without proper veterinary oversight and written directions provided by the attending
veterinarian. Directions from the attending veterinarian about off label medication usage, including the species of
animal the medication will be administered to, should be documented and maintained by the facility to ensure
proper administration of the medication.
The licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by
the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care
shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

SANITATION.
On the floor, next to several enclosures containing hedgehogs, there was an accumulation of dust, bits of food, and
paper debris, as well as an exercise wheel and metal bin. The bin and exercise wheel were covered with a thick
layer of dust and some paper debris.
Accumulation of debris and trash near animal enclosures can lead to pest infestation, disease transmission,
reduced health of the animals, and may be an indication of substandard husbandry practices.(cid:9)
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed
in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals
