**** The temperature at time of inspections was 38 degrees Fahrenheit. The whelping building thermometer read 44
degrees Fahrenheit. The ouside pens dogloos have carpet sqaures in the majority of them. Inside the whelping
building only one of two pens had pine shavings for the dog and puppies to lay on. The lack of proper bedding
allows the cold weather to impact the dogs ability to maintain their body temperature when the temperature drops
below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Dry clean bedding must be provided when the temperature is below 50 degrees
Fahrenheit and additional dry clean bedding when the temperature falls below 35 degrees Fahrenheit and allows
the animal to nest in.
