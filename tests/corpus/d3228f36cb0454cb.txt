OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
* Two German Shepherds with the largest measuring 62 in. at the shoulder did not have adequate shelter structures
available for use. Two box type shelters were being used that measured 62 in. in height. These shelter structures
were not large enough to allow each animal to enter, sit, stand, lie or turn about freely in a normal manner without
causing discomfort. These shelter structures need to be replace with adequately sized shelters that will allow the
animal to enter, sit, stand, lie and turn about freely in a normal manner. Licensee must ensure that all shelter
structures are accessible and appropriately sized to provide the animals shelter from the elements.
* To be corrected by 6/13/14
3.6
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(1) Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound.
* A box-type shelter structure that was currently in use in the German Shepherd enclosure did not have a complete
floor. The flooring had become unattatched and the ground beneath could be seen. This structure is no longer
structurally sound. This shelter structure must be repaired or replaced. Licensee must ensure that all primary
enclosures are maintained on a regular basis to ensure they are structurally sound and safe for the dogs.
