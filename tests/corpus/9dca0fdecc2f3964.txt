2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care was incomplete and inaccurate pertaining to the sections on preventative care at the
facility. The section under vaccinations has juveniles listed as receiving vaccinations at 6 weeks. The licensee
stated that the puppies (juveniles) start receiving their first vaccinations at 4 weeks. This is not accurately
documented on the program of veterinary care.
The section for internal parasites states medication to be administered quarterly. The licensee stated that they have
been only been administering it twice a year. There are no records available that document when the medication for
the ectoparasites and internal parasites was administered.
The written program lists Ivormec as a product to use for blood and ectoparasite control. However, the licensee
stated that the medication is no longer being used.
The licensee, in coordination with the attending veterinarian, must provide more specific information on the types of
products being used at the facility and the frequency of use.
The licensee must ensure that the program of veterinary care is updated with current preventative practices at the
facility to ensure that the dogs are provided adequate veterinary care at all times.

Official identification is needed to ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the
inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are officially identified by collar, tattoo or microchip.
