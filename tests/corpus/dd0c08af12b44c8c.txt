Facilities, general.
The chain link fence next to the shelter in the outdoor enclosure housing 2 bison and 1 elk is in disrepair. The whole
fence is pushed outward and the middle support pole closest to the shelter is bent. Along the whole bottom of the fence it
is stretched upward away from the bottom support pole. There are some areas of the fence that the bottom is curled
inward with sharp point protruding towards the animals. Next to the shelter the bottom of the fence is only being held by
two strands of stretched fence attached to a lower support pole. Because of the stretching of the fence and not being
properly secured it has large holes and gaps along the bottom. A work order was submitted on 9/25/2020, but there has
been no repair work done. Inspector was told since the submission of the work order this area of the fence has gotten
worse. The sharp points, gaps and large holes in the fence could cause an injury to the animals and if not corrected could
potentially allow an animal to escape. Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound, in good
repair to contain and protect the animal.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Animal Curator.
