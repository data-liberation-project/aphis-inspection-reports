FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a wood table like structure in the fox exhibit. This table is now slanted due to the deterioration of the table
which has collapsed through one of the 4 supporting legs. The fox can no longer get up on the table, but does seek
shelter under it. The present condition of this structure poses a risk of injury if it should further collapse while the
animal is under it.
This structure shall be repaired, replaced, or removed so to prevent possible injury to the fox.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The strands of barbed wire on the perimeter fence opposite the entrance is loose, slack and sagging and therefore
is no longer 8 feet high in this area. The space between the stands are now sufficiently wide and loose enough to
allow unwanted animals or unauthorized persons to pass through it.
This barbed wire shall be strung across tightly to effectively make the perimeter fence 8 feet high in this area and
prevent unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from passing over or through it and entering the park.

SANITATION.
The back room roof & ceiling in the theater has been completely replaced, but there is evidence of rodent holes in
the ceiling in the animal room (which also serves to shelter the primate dens).
These holes shall be sealed to prevent rodents from entering the animal areas. Additionally, a better program of
rodent control shall be implemented.Correct by August 1. 2017
