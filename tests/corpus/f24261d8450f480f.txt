2.31(b)(3)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***The IACUC does not have an appropriate non-affiliated member on the committee. The non-affiliated member
has ties to the organization that would not allow for an unbiased view of the care and treatment of animals used for
research. The Chief Executive Officer must appoint a non-affiliated member to the IACUC that will provide
representation from the general community on the care and treatment of animals. Correct by June 30, 2014.
2.35(f)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
***Records of IACUC protocol reviews and meeting minutes were not available for review at the time of inspection.
All IACUC records should be available for review by an APHIS official at the time of inspection in accordance with
the standards of the Animal Welfare Act. A method to ensure records are available for review at the time of an
inspection must be established to ensure that the facility is providing proper oversight of activity involving the use of
animals. Correct by the next inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with the Executive Director.
