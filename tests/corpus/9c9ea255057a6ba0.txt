2.75(b)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records for animals at hand containing required information on acquisition/disposition information of these were
found to be incomplete and/or inadequate. Records of acquisition for a fennec fox and a raccoon were incomplete;
missing required contact information from the donor (address and telephone number). Also, records of disposition
for deceased animals were missing required information; dates when animals died or euthanized. The licensee
shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose information on all acquired
animals that are in her or his possession/control. The Record of Animals on Hand (APHIS Form 7019) and Record
of Acquisition, Disposition, or Transport of Animals (APHIS Form 7020) are forms which may be used by the
licensee to keep and maintain the information required by federal regulations. The licensee needs to
obtain/update/document the required missing information on all pertinent records of acquisition and disposition.
