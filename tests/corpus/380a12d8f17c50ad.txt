ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
(a)(1)
***** The licensees current Program of Veterinary Care does not adequately address all animals under the
licensees care. The current PVC addresses TB testing, some vaccinations, and some parasite control for
carnivores, hoofed stock, and primates. It is difficult to determine what test and/or vaccination is recommended for
which animal. It does not address the rodents (porcupines) or the omnivores (coati and kinkajou). Without a
complete, easily understood PVC the licensee may not provide adequate veterinary care for the animals. A PVC
addressing parasite control, vaccination recommendations, routine medical testing requirements, and nutrition for
each species along with recommendations for regularly scheduled visits to the facility by the veterinarian needs to
be available for review during USDA inspections. Since this licensee travels a large part of the year a plan for
emergency care in areas where the attending veterinarian is not available should also be available for review.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
(b)(1)
***** Several animals identified on previous inspection inventories and prior itineraries sent in by the licensee were
not present during this inspection. The employees were unaware or unwilling to disclose their locations and were
unable to find records of disposition. Records of animals on hand, acquisitions, and dispositions must be
maintained so that USDA is able to track animal movements. The licensee needs to ensure accurate records are
available during USDA inspections.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(b)(1)
***** During this inspection several animals were observed exhibiting signs consistent with excessive heat exposure
or stress. The porcupines in particular seemed extremely uncomfortable. The 2 African porcupines were observed
panting to the extent their quills were quivering. The prehensile tailed porcupine was standing in an abnormal
posture. Prehensile tailed porcupines are nocturnal and usually spend their daylight hours curled in a tree asleep.
This animal was wide awake and standing with its front feet extended forward. The ranch fox was lying in its house
panting. When these behaviors were pointed out to the employees they immediately turned on fans that appeared
to be for the purpose of cooling these animals. One of the coati immediately spread out in front of one of the fans.
The temperature for the area at the time of this inspection was approximately 83 F with 65 % relative humidity. The
animals are housed in a white circus tent with the sides down.
When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal(cid:25)s health or well-being appropriate measures must be taken
to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature,
humidity, and time that is detrimental to the animal(cid:25)s health or well-being.
Additional methods for cooling these animals need to be incorporated along with the fans or these animals need to
be relocated to an area that can be more easily cooled.

EMPLOYEES.
The licensee does not appear to have enough qualified employees to adequately maintain the prescribed
husbandry practices set forth by USDA. There were two employees at the facility during this inspection. The
condition of the facility during this inspection did not meet minimum standards. The licensee needs to hire
additional qualified personnel or reduce the number of animals the current employees have to care for.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. (c)
***** The coati and spider monkey cages had areas of standing water and mud. The ground just behind the
kangaroo cage had standing water and mud. Areas of standing water contribute to odor, disease, and pest
problems. A suitable method to rapidly eliminate excess water needs to be implemented or the animals need to be
relocated to an area that can be adequately drained.

FEEDING.
(a)
***** Diets fed to USDA covered species must be appropriate for the species. Some of the diets being fed by the
licensees(cid:25) employees were not appropriate. Porcupines are primarily herbivorous requiring green vegetation in their
diets. The employees were feeding dog food to the porcupines. The tiger and leopard were being fed chicken
quarters. When asked about supplements the employees said they were using calcium and taurine supplements
but were unable to show us as they had run out the day before. Large exotic cats on a diet of chicken should be
supplemented with calcium. Inappropriate diets can lead to illness and disease in these animals. The licensee
needs to consult with a veterinarian or nutritionist knowledgeable with the different species maintained and
implement diets appropriate for those species.

SANITATION.
(a)
***** Several of the animal enclosures did not appear to have been cleaned recently. The spider monkey enclosure
had a large pile of feces under the Rubbermaid nest box. The capuchin enclosure had old, dirty hay on the ground,
and the fox(cid:25)s food bowl had chicken feces on top of the food.
There are 27 mammals along with some birds living under a 30 x 50 ft tent. This number of animals requires daily
cleaning of excreta, old food and old bedding in order to minimize disease hazards, insect pests such as flies and
other parasites as well as odors.A schedule for daily cleaning needs to be developed and implemented.
To be corrected immediately.
This inspection was conducted by APHIS, USDA, ANIMAL CARE Personnel and the designated persons for
inspection the owners employees.
The exit interview was conducted by APHIS, USDA, ANIMAL CARE Personnel and the Owner by telephone on
7/7/14.
