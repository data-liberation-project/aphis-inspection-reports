3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
In an enclosure containing one female two-toed sloth, approximately 1.5 years old, one of the higher hanging ropes was
positioned close to two heat lamp fixtures covered by a metal grate on the ceiling. The hanging rope was tied to two
vertical wooden poles and was approximately one foot from the ceiling on each end. There is a risk to reach the heat
lamps from a high hanging rope and cause burns or other injuries.

The enclosure must be constructed in a manner to prevent the animal access to the heat lamps in order to protect the
animal from injury. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place to ensure all animal facilities are
structurally sound and in good repair to contain and protect the animal from injury.

This was corrected on February 18, 2022 by moving the hanging ropes lower and away from the heat lamps.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and licensee.
