2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC has not prepared and submitted a report of the semiannual facility program review and inspection to the
Institutional Official since September 3, 2015. Updated reports shall be created and submitted to the IO at least
once every six months at the completion of the required semi-annual evaluations.
Timely submission of required reports to the IO is necessary to ensure communication is maintained regarding the
extent of the facility's adherence to the standards and regulations under the Animal Welfare Act. Deficiencies and
departures from the AWA must be specifically identified.
