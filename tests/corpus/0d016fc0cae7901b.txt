2.33(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Three (3) rabbits with health concerns were identified during the inspection, and none of the concerns had been
previously noted by the facility. Two rabbits (B294 and M347) were observed with dull demeanor, unkempt haircoats
consistent with decreased self-grooming of several days’ duration, and abnormal hindlimb function/weakness. Rabbit
B294 also demonstrated facial features consistent with pain, including tightened eyelids and ears that were rotated and
held closely against the animal’s back. A third rabbit (B300) was observed with a significant ocular condition, including a
moderately reddened and inflamed left eye and markedly enlarged and/or displaced left eyeball. After these health
concerns were identified, all three (3) rabbits received veterinary treatment (prior to exit interview).

These animals’ conditions were not recognized by animal care staff during daily observations, and no communication with
the attending veterinarian had occurred. Failure to observe and communicate health problems in a timely manner can
result in prolonged pain and suffering, and increase the risk of developing serious medical conditions.

Each facility must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care. A system for performing and recording daily
observations must be maintained, and abnormalities in animal health, behavior, and/or well-being must be timely and


accurately conveyed to the attending veterinarian through direct and frequent communication.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
