Seven individual animals were identified by APHIS Officials in need of veterinary care at the time of inspection.
There was no documentation available during the inspection regarding their treatment and according to the wife of
the licensee (responsible for much of the daily care for animals) these animals were not receiving veterinary
treatment at the start of the inspection.
*** Direct: An adult female brown and white goat housed in the goat pasture near the road (on the northeast corner
of the main zoo facility) had multiple areas of hair loss and was observed vigorously scratching during the
inspection. She appeared intensely itchy and was consistently scratching her sides and flanks with her horns and
hind legs, rubbing her body against the fence and feeder, and chewing at her skin. Patchy areas of hair loss were
present on both the left and right sides of this goat and varied in size. The largest areas were present along the
topline of the left side just in front of the hip (approx. 3-4 x 1.5 inches) and right hip area (2 inches x 1 inch). The
underlying skin is dry, flaky, and pigmented and the skin present in haired areas is similarly flaky. When the hair
was parted and closely examined, numerous live lice were observed. Additionally, there were numerous nits (lice
eggs) observed on hair shafts along the sides of the goat. This goat is housed with seven other goats. Several of
these goats were also observed scratching, but did not appear to have obvious hair loss. The licensee stated that
his wife had recently dewormed and applied topical treatment for lice to the goats in the petting zoo area, but that
she had not treated the animals in this area. The wife of the licensee confirmed this and said that she was not
aware of the hair loss in this goat.
Left untreated, lice may result in worsening of the condition and unnecessary suffering. In addition, trauma done to
the skin from excessive scratching may lead to the development of secondary skin infections. When skin disorders
are the result of a contagious cause (such as lice), they may be transmitted to other uninfected animals in the same
enclosure or enclosures nearby. Correct by ensuring this goat and all animals exhibiting skin abnormalities are
examined by the attending veterinarian. The licensee must follow all recommendations made by the veterinarian
including those regarding diagnosis, treatment, prevention, control of this condition, and recheck examinations.
Records of these findings, treatment, and future recommendations must be kept for evaluation by APHIS Officials.
This was first identified by inspectors and reported to the licensee on March 11, 2015.
*** Direct: An adult female muntjac housed in the enclosure near the outdoor African crested porcupine was
observed walking with an abnormal gait. This animal had excessively long front hooves that curled upward and
were not touching the ground at the ends (commonly described as an elf shoe apearance). This animal was
observed for an extended period of time and it appeared that she was overextending both front legs and that she
was only partially weight bearing on her left front leg at a walk. The soft ground in this enclosure made
photographing her feet difficult. When asked the licensee stated that he was unaware of any lame animals in this
enclosure, but that the gait was most likely a normal behavior. The wife of the licensee stated that she was unaware
of any muntjac exhibiting lameness. She also stated that they often go under the shed that is in their pasture and
that they can be difficult to observe.
Lameness is a significant indicator of pain and failure to provide appropriate methods to properly diagnose and treat
the underlying cause in a timely manner may result in unnecessary pain and suffering. Correct by having this
animal evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and following all recommendations including those regarding
examination, diagnosis, treatment, hoof trimming and future recheck examinations as needed. Additionally, the
licensee must maintain record of these recommendations and hoof trimming for evaluation by APHIS Officials. This
was first identified by inspectors and reported to the licensee on March 10, 2015.

*** A female muntjac housed in a stall near the keeper barn had excessively long hooves. This animal has an
abnormal left front leg which curves outwards below the knee. The hooves were severely overgrown on all 4 legs.
Both claws on the left front leg were so severely overgrown that the claws are crisscrossed. The inner claw curves
under the outer claw such that the animal appears to be walking on the hoof wall of the inner claw. The claws on
the right front foot are also overgrown (although to a lesser extent) such that the tips of the claws appear to be
crossing. Additionally, both rear feet are long enough that the claws are similarly crisscrossing on each foot. The
licensee previously stated that the abnormal leg was the result of an old injury that had healed poorly, which is why
this animal is separated from the main herds. Neither the licensee nor his wife were aware of the overgrown
hooves and there was no documentation regarding the care or treatment of this condition.

Excessively long hooves can cause lameness, unnecessary stress and discomfort to the animal and can lead to the
development of additional medical problems such as foot rot. Animals with preexisting leg abnormalities (whether
from previous trauma or abnormal confirmation) often require increased routine hoof care to prevent the
development of hoof problems. Correct by having this animal examined by the attending veterinarian and following
all recommendations regarding appropriate treatment for this condition and any additional routine husbandry care
that may be necessary. The licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis and recommendations for evaluation
by APHIS Officials. This was first identified by inspectors and reported to the licensee on March 10, 2015.
*** A brown female camel housed in the zoo with seven other camels had a significant swelling (about the size of a
tennis ball) located on the right side at the base of the neck / front of the chest. The skin overlying this area is
hairless. Two other camels are currently being treated for abscesses by facility personnel at the direction of the
attending veterinarian; however, this camel had not been identified by facility personnel.
Abscesses are often caused by infectious agents and there are 7 additional camels located in this pasture and 1
housed in the adjoining enclosure. There were no methods currently in use to stop the spread of disease if it is
transmissible between animals. Correct by ensuring that all animals exhibiting these skin abnormalities are
examined by the attending veterinarian so that appropriate diagnostic testing can be completed and a proper
diagnosis can be made. Additionally, the licensee must seek guidance from the attending veterinarian regarding
appropriate prevention and control of this condition in camels. The licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis
and recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials. This was first identified by inspectors and reported to the
licensee on March 10, 2015.
*** A grey rabbit in an enclosure on the porch of the keeper barn had a watery discharge from its left eye. The fur
was noticeably wet on the left side of the face of the rabbit between its left eye and nose on both March 10, 2015
and March 11, 2015 during the inspection. The eye itself appeared normal and the rabbit did not appear to be
squinting or otherwise painful. The licensee and the wife of the licensee were unaware of the condition and both
stated that the rabbit appeared fine when it was brought to their attention by inspectors. The watery discharge from
the eye can be caused by numerous conditions such as an eye irritation, eye abnormality or even a tooth problem.

Correct by having this animal evaluated by the attending veterinarian and following all recommendations including
those regarding examination, diagnosis, treatment, and future recheck examinations as needed. Additionally, the
licensee must maintain record of these recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials. This was first identified
by inspectors and reported to the licensee on March 10, 2015.
*** The female Mandrill housed with the adult male Mandrill that was listed on the January 6, 2015 inspection report
still has hairloss over the top aspect of both forearms. On the right arm the hair loss still extends from the elbow
down to an area halfway between the wrist and the knuckles. On the left arm the hair loss still extends from just
below the elbow to the top of the hand. The wife of the licensee stated that this animal has been discussed with the
veterinarian, but there is no documentation of those discussions that include the diagnosis or treatment of the
condition. The wife of the licensee stated that the veterinarian verbally instructed her to increase enrichment for the
animal. There is no documentation that veterinary instructions have been followed.
*** The juvenile female Mandrill (housed with the adult female with an infant) has hairloss on the inside of both
elbows that was not present on the previous inspection. The hairloss extends slightly down the inside of both arms.
The wife of the licensee stated that she had not noticed the hairloss in this animal and therefore has not discussed it
with the veterinarian.
There is no direction in the written program of veterinary care or the Non-human Primate Enrichment plan to
address hair loss or hair plucking in primates. While hair loss in this area of primates often has an underlying
behavioral cause, guidance from the attending veterinarian must be sought to ensure an accurate diagnosis andappropriate treatment plan to prevent worsening of the condition. These animals must be evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian with knowledge about primate medicine in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and
an appropriate treatment plan is developed. All recommendations regarding the diagnosis, care, and treatment
must be followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be
documented and made available to the inspector upon request. Additionally, the enrichment plan should be
amended to address non-medical causes of hair plucking in primates if the veterinarian believes this to be an issue
at the facility. This was first identified by inspectors and reported to the licensee on March 10, 2015. Although this
is a repeat non-complaint item, the licensee was verbally instructed to have these animals examined by a licensed
veterinarian by 5 pm on March 13, 2015.

*** Direct: Seven individual animals were identified by APHIS Officials in need of veterinary care at the time of
inspection. Based on statements by the licensee, six of the seven animals had not been identified by the facility
prior to this inspection and, as a result, had not been reported to the attending veterinarian. The one remaining
animal was identified by APHIS officials on an inspection dated January 6, 2015.
*** In addition to the lack of observations above, the current design of the shelter within the muntjac enclosure near
the African porcupine exhibit prevents daily observation of all animals. On March 10, 2015 one lame muntjac was
identified in this enclosure. At that time a total of 5 animals were visible to inspectors and facility representatives
stated that they were unsure how many animals were present but that the wife of the licensee would know. When
APHIS officials attempted to re-evaluate this animal in the afternoon, they observed 7 animals in the enclosure and
were unable to locate the lame muntjac. After speaking with the wife of the licensee the following day, inspectors
were informed that there were actually 8 animals present in this enclosure. There is a large shed present in this
enclosure to provide shelter and the wife of the licensee explained that the muntjac often go underneath this shed
and are difficult to observe. The wife of the licensee stated that in fact, there were 8 animals present in that
enclosure at the last inspection, but that she had forgotten about two offspring that were born when providing
information to the inspectors about the number of animals present.
Inspectors asked the wife of the licensee to accompany them to that enclosure again on March 11, 2015 so that she
could attempt to make all animals visible. Although both the wife of the licensee and another facility representative
attempted to entice the muntjac out from underneath the shed, only a total of 6 animals could be observed that day.
When the muntjac are under the shed they cannot be adequately observed by either the facility or APHIS
personnel. The muntjac cannot be easily removed from under the shed for either observation or treatment. Accessto the area under the shed therefore poses a health risk for the animals as they cannot be observed adequately and
animals with health problems are more likely to seek quiet areas that are out of the public view. Additionally, any
physical hazards that may be present under the shed cannot be observed or assessed.
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care which includes daily
observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being. Additionally, a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian (AV) is required so that timely and accurate information on problems
of animal health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed to the AV. Correct by ensuring that adequate daily
observations are conducted and that information is conveyed to the attending veterinarian as required. Additionally,
correct by making necessary modifications to the muntjac enclosure to prevent the muntjac from going under the
shed in order to facilitate daily observations.

*** The zebu was tranquilized by facility personnel on January 30, 2015 to trim its hooves. According to the wife of
the licensee the zebu recovered from the sedation, but was found dead on January 31, 2015. The program of
veterinary care did not address tranquilizing zebu or cattle. There was no written guidance from the attending
veterinarian regarding the tranquilization of the zebu on March 30, 2015. The tranquilization of animals must be
directed by the attending veterinarian to help prevent complications that may result in the discomfort or death of the
animal.
*** The facility program of veterinary care does not list the dosages of ketamine to sedate/tranquilize the primates.
Improper dosage of ketamine may result in animal too lightly or heavily sedated and pose a health risk to both the
primate and facility personnel. The dosage of ketamine must be directed by the attending veterinarian to help
ensure a smooth and uneventful sedation and recovery for the health and comfort of the animal. There were no
records of chemical restraint or sedation of primates since the last inspection, but the facility has immobilized
primates in the past and would need to again if/when medical problems arise.
Inadequate guidance regarding tranquilization and anesthesia may result in unnecessary distress to the animal or
even death. Each exhibitor must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that includes
adequate guidance to personnel involved in the care and use of animals regarding handling, immobilization,
anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization and euthanasia. Additionally, licensees must seek guidance regarding
adequate pre-procedural and post-procedural care in accordance with established veterinary medical and nursing
procedures.
Correct by seeking specific guidance from the attending veterinarian regarding drug choices, drug dosages,anesthetic record keeping, pre-anesthesia animal preparation, and post anesthesia monitoring and recovery. This
guidance should be of sufficient detail for all species that may be sedated or anesthetized so that APHIS Officials
can evaluate compliance with the direction of the attending veterinarian. Additionally, correct by ensuring that all
future anesthesia or sedation is conducted in accordance with the standard operating procedures developed and
approved by the attending veterinarian.

*** There are two primate enclosures within the elephant building that are severely rusted. One enclosure,
containing two De Brazza's monkeys, has an enclosure door that is severely rusted. There are two areas on the
lower portion of the door frame where the rust has eroded through the metal leaving large gaps in the door frame
with sharp jagged edges. The second primate enclosure, containing three white-faced capuchin monkeys, has
several areas throughout the enclosure where the paint has worn and/or peeled off the metal frame. The metal
frame in these areas is rusted and the rust is pitted and flaking. On one bottom rail within this enclosure, there are
two small holes that have developed from rust erosion.
*** One enclosure in the mouse house building, containing three brown capuchins, is severely rusted. There are
several large areas throughout the enclosure where the paint has worn and/or peeled off the metal frame. The metal
frame in these areas is severely rusted and the rust is pitted and flaking.
Excessive rust can affect the structural strength of surfaces and prevents the required cleaning and sanitization of
enclosures. Any surface that comes in contact with the nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust that
prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface. Correct by
ensuring that these areas are repaired or replaced and that all surfaces that come in contact with the individual
animals including primary enclosures, perches, shelves, swings, etc. are constructed and maintained in a manner
that allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized and are removed or replaced as needed.

*** There are multiple sharp points present in the enclosure housing three snow macaques. There is one area
where there is a hole in the chain-link fence that has been patched using a piece of 2x4 inch welded wire affixed
over the damaged chain link. Although the patch appears secure, there is a piece of broken chain-link fence with a
sharp point protruding into the enclosure. Within the same enclosure, the chain-link fence is attached to the metalenclosure frame with small wire. In some of the areas the ends of the wires are twisted together and the twisted
metal points are protruding into the enclosure in a manner that the animals can easily access them.
Sharp points such as these present an injury hazard to the animals. Correct by ensuring that all surfaces in contact
with the non-human primates are free of jagged edges and sharp points that might injure the animals.

lower left corner. These doors cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized and must be repaired or replaced.
*** Within the gift shop there is a viewing window into the enclosure housing three Japanese macaques. The
window ledge located within the animal enclosure is warped and separating from the building wall. There is a small
gap between the wooden ledge and the building wall at the left lower edge of the window looking out into the
enclosure from the gift shop. Gaps such as these create an area that food debris and other organic material may
accumulate. This area cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized and therefore provides an optimal area for bacterial
and fungal growth.

All surfaces of housing facilities for primates must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities (cid:19)
including houses, dens, and other furniture type fixtures and objects within the facility (cid:19) that cannot be readily

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facility routinely hand raises capuchin infants. Documentation showed that two brown capuchins (one male and
one female) were removed from their mothers, bottle fed and sold on February 25, 2015. On the date of the sale,
the male was approximately 4 weeks of age and the female was approximately 2.5 weeks of age. No
documentation was available to the inspectors regarding the nutrition, care and/or enrichment provided to these two
capuchins. The facility's current enrichment plan does not specifically address the special enrichment requirements
for infants or young juveniles. Additional documentation provided to the inspectors (not included in the approvedenrichment plan) indicated that infant primates would be given additional care and that it would be documented on
an individual basis. At the time of inspection there was no documentation of the additional care or enrichment
described in that document regarding either infant primate sold in February.
Infants and young juvenile primates, particularly those that are hand reared, have special behavioral and
psychological needs. Failure to meet these needs does not ensure that these young animals will develop species
typical behaviors and can lead to the development of abnormal behaviors that may permanently compromise
welfare for these animals.
The licensee must ensure that infants and young juvenile primates are provided special attention regarding
enhancement of their environment. A special environmental enhancement plan regarding infants and young
juveniles must be developed, documented and followed. The plan must be based on the needs of the individual
species, in accordance with currently accepted professional standards and must be directed and approved by the

The following areas were found in need of repair or replacement:
1. The fence around the pasture housing 8 pygmy goats has an approximately 10 foot area where the upper portion
of the fence is pulled away from the structural supports and is now bent over outwards. The strand of barbed wire
above the woven fence was detached from the support posts. There are also several broken wires and loose sharp
wire ends from where the fence has been patched near the gate. This fence was repaired during the inspection.
2. The llama fencing for the main llama yard containing 24 llamas has areas where the lowest horizontal fence rail
is at least 21 inches from the ground. Smaller llamas may be able to get under this rail. The licensee has started
to correct this item but there are still areas that require correcting on the side near the Mandrills.
3. One large pile of brush is still present in the pasture area for the zebras at the breeding facility location ((cid:28)the
farm(cid:29)). This pile (located just to the left of the gate upon entering the pasture) also contains several wooden boards,
metal bars, and fencing. Since the January 6, 2015 inspection the licensee has removed a significant amount of
debris from other areas of this pasture and has created an additional fenced area around several rolls of fencing
material in order to keep the animals away. Removal of the remaining brush / debris pile near the gate, or
modification of this area to make it inaccessible to animals, is still required. This area houses 16 zebra.
4. A broken red plastic feeder was found in use in the zebra barn at the breeding facility location. The edge of this
feeder has been chewed and worn and it is now loose from the body of the feeder. There are also 2 strands of thick
gauge wire wrapped around a section of metal fencing in this area. These strands have sharp ends that areprotruding into the stall which the zebra can access. This area houses 16 zebra.
5. Several wire panels mounted onto the bottom of the wooden fence in the muntjac enclosure have been pulled
loose on the bottom. This is present in the muntjac enclosure nearest the African crested porcupine exhibit
(housing 8 muntjac).
6. Two enclosures housing one serval each have rusted areas on the enclosure walls. The first enclosure on the
right housing one serval has an area of rust on the left wall near the ground approximately the size of a lemon
where the rust has eroded the metal leaving a jagged hole. The second enclosure on the right housing one serval
has an area of rust on the right wall near the ground which is semi-circular approximately 4 inches long where the
rust has eroded the metal leaving a jagged hole.
All of these areas are in need of repair or replacement. They are all areas of potential injury or escape. The facility

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** Six outdoor yards housing 32 fallow deer, 18 Sitatunga, 5 zebra, 7 Kudu, 16 oryx, and 8 camel were excessively
muddy on March 10, 2015.
1. Nearly the entire fallow deer enclosure is covered in mud with small puddles created from hoof prints that
have filled in with rain water. When the animals walk around on the mud they sink in about an inch. Several of the
animals have mud covering their hooves and splattered up the lower portion of their legs.
2. Nearly the entire Sitatunga enclosure is severely muddy. The front 1/3 of the enclosure is covered by several
coalescing puddles of standing water. The remainder of the enclosure appears muddy, although there is a large
pack of straw bedding inside the shelter which appears to raise this area above the level of the pasture. All of the
animals in the enclosure were gathered inside or near one of the shelters.
3. Nearly the entire zebra enclosure is muddy with very large (pond-like) puddles in the lower end and some
medium sized puddles surrounding the shelter. The mud appears several inches thick in most places. All of the
animals in the enclosure were gathered within the shelter and the majority have discoloration past their ankles
which appears to be dried mud. The flooring in the shelter appeared dry and was covered with straw.
4. Nearly the entire kudu enclosure is severely muddy. The front 1/3 of the enclosure has several puddles of
standing water. The back left-hand corner of the enclosure (the side nearest the zebra) is completely under water.The area around the water source is also severely muddy with numerous small puddles created from hoof prints
that have filled in with water.
5. Nearly the entire front of the Oryx enclosure is covered with excessive mud (approximately 1/3 of the
enclosure). There are large areas where animals have sunken into the mud leaving deep hoof prints which have
filled with water creating numerous puddles. This is particularly noticeable in the area surrounding the automatic
watering device. Additionally, there are several vehicle tracks left in the mud which have also filled in with water
creating large puddles. Several animals have mud on their legs over their ankles and mud spatter up their hind legs
as far as their hocks.
6. Nearly the entire front half of the camel enclosure is covered with mud. The area around the automatic
watering device and feed troughs is severely muddy. In this area animals have repeatedly sunken into the mud
leaving deep hoof prints which have filled with water creating numerous puddles. The majority of the camels (even
those standing nearer to the shelter) have mud on their legs which varied from covering only their feet to covering
the entire lower portion of the legs below the knee.
Although the weather has been warming recently resulting in melting of existing snow and the weather today is
raining, the extent of mud present is excessive. The licensee must ensure the facility has proper drainage to rapidly
eliminate excess standing water. Failure to provide adequate drainage prevents animals from being able to remain
dry and can lead to the development of disease such as foot rot and dermatitis. There were 2 loads of substrate (of
two different sizes) delivered during this inspection but none had been added to these enclosures as of March 11,
2015.
*** The pasture area for 12 camels at the breeding facility is also excessively muddy near the water and food
receptacles. In this area, the animals have repeatedly sunken into the mud leaving deep hoof prints which have
filled with water creating numerous puddles. This area was muddy enough that the camels were slipping when
walking. Camels standing nearest the fence line (at the end near the watering device) were observed sunken into
the mud deeply enough to cover their entire foot up to the bottom of the ankle. These animals cannot avoid this
area as they must come there to drink.
*** The PVC drain pipe for the mouse house building (which houses primates, birds, mice, rats, and a porcupine)
empties into an area near the pasture housing 3 Blesbok. Because of the topography of the land in that area, this
drainage mixes with current runoff from rain, melting of snow and warming of the ground. This has formed a small
stream that runs through the Blesbok enclosure, past the water receptacle for the Blesbok, and into a second
pasture which the Blesbok can access. The Blesbok were observed walking through this stream to get to 2nd
pasture. This drainage from the mouse house building is a potential hazard to the Blesbok. Contact with this
drainage exposes them to unnecessary health hazards.
Proper drainage is required for all of these animals. The animal enclosures listed all require additional drainage orsubstrate to ensure the animals can remain dry in all seasons. The licensee must also ensure that the drainage
from animal areas (such as the mouse house building) does not run through and potentially affect other animals.

of material that varies in color including dark brown, dark green, and black material. In the shorter trough this
material extends nearly all the way to the top, while in the taller trough it extends approximately halfway up the
sides. The water in both troughs appears clear. Failure to keep water receptacles clean and sanitary can result in

*** The following non-compliances with cleaning of enclosures were identified on this inspection.
1) There is an area of wet bedding in the nest box within the den area for the female cougar. This area is round,
approximately 12 inches in diameter, and appears to be saturated with urine. The keeper for this animal stated that
the box is cleaned twice a week but that this animal will often (cid:28)mark(cid:29) her nest box by urinating in it as soon as it is
cleaned. The right hip of the female Cougar was observed to be wet from the point of the hip to the hock joint and
there was a strong odor of ammonia in this building (particularly near the nest box). Excreta must be removed from
primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards, and
minimize odors. Failure to remove and change bedding often enough can result in the development of skin
problems such as scalding of the skin by urine.
2) The stalls housing the Nyala at the breeding facility have a significant bird dropping concern. Bird droppingshave accumulated on every flat surface of the barn including stall walls and on top of the radiant heaters. There are
also significant accumulations of bird droppings in the bedding near stall doors, on the hay and bedding particularly
in the corners of the stalls, on the salt lick, and on the structural supports for the stall. Bird droppings can contain
bacteria and failure to remove excessive accumulations of such excreta can present a disease hazard to the
animals housed in this enclosure.
3) There is a significant amount of dirt and cob/dust webs in the enclosure for the African crested porcupine housed
in the mouse house facility. This includes the corners of the enclosure, between the left wall of the enclosure and
the bird enclosure next to it, and inside both the milk crate and barrel used in the enclosure. The excessive
accumulation of dust and cobwebs indicates that the cleaning in this area is inadequate at this time.
4) In the elephant barn, nearly the entire wall adjacent to the main animal door is covered with cob/dust webs.
Excessive accumulation of these dust and cob webs indicates that this wall has not been cleaned in quite some
time.

roll-off dumpsters (construction site sized) full of debris and excess items from the facility. There are now many
areas of the facility where all of the clutter has been removed. The area located between the walk-in freezer and
Blesbok pasture on the northeast side of the zoo still contains numerous piles of excess items including old caging
supplies, a tire, a metal barrel, and fencing materials that need to be removed. There is a dumpster in this area that
the licensee is using to discard unwanted items and it is obvious by the condition of the facility that the license is
actively working to correct this problem. The licensee must complete the process of removing the unwanted items
and properly storing items that are still needed. Clutter concerns are compounded by the fact that there previously
was evidence of a large rodent population at the facility and excessive clutter provides breeding grounds for
mammalian pests. The licensee must continue to remove all unwanted items, clean this affected area, and properly

problem in the Nyala barn at the breeding farm location. There was no evidence of a pest control program for this
barn. Large amounts of bird droppings were observed on the barn rafters, dripping down the board walls of the
stalls, on the tops of the radiant heaters, and on the salt lick block. Also, there were several rodent holes in this
barn including along the outside walls, outside of the 1st stall, and near one automatic waterer. There were no
rodent bait boxes present at this location and no control methods were in place for avian pests. The presence of
these mammalian and avian pests is a potential disease hazard to the animals as these rodents and birds can be
