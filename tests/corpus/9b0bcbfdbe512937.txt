Exercise for dogs.
A written exercise program that is approved by the attending veterinarian was not available for inspection. An exercise
plan is necessary to ensure that dogs are provided with adequate space and opportunity for exercise for their health and
well-being. Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for
exercise, and the plan must be made available to APHIS upon request.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility has an attending veterinarian; however, the written Program of Veterinary care was incomplete and not
signed. Sections which were not complete include: the plan for complete physical examinations of dogs, the plan for
vaccinations for contagious and/or deadly diseases of dogs (including rabies, parvovirus and distemper) and sampling
and treatment of parasites and other pests (including fleas, worms, coccidia, giardia, and heartworm) in accordance with a
schedule approved by the attending veterinarian, and preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and unmatted
hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin, and teeth. A complete and signed written
program of veterinary care is required and is important for the care of the animals and ensures clear and accurate
communication between the facility and the attending veterinarian. Ensure the written Program of Veterinary care is
approved and signed by the attending veterinarian and is available for all inspections.
