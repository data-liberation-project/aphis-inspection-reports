FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The enclosure fence for the 14 goats is curling up above the ground to the left
of the gate (opposite the side of the shelter). There are some broken protruding wires at the bottom edge of the
curling fence. Goats walking the fence line may get a foot or leg caught in the fencing or be injured by the broken
protruding wires at the bottom of the fence. Animal enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by repairing or replacing this section of fencing. Correct by April
12, 2017.
Note: The white llama had its hooves trimmed.
