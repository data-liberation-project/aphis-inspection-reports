FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During the inspection, the following structural defects were noted:
- The side of the pet-door entrance to the shed used by the two pot-belly pigs is missing it's plastic covering. The
exposed metal underneath is warped with jagged edges.
- In the pen housing the two domestic pigs, there are four fence posts in which the vinyl covering is cracked and/or
missing, resulting in cracked vinyl edges along the posts.
- Also in the pen housing the two domestic pigs, wire used to cover the fence railings has several areas in which
the wire is broken and/or curling up with exposed wire tips pointing inward into the enclosure.
- In the pen housing the cow and sheep, there are additional fence posts in which the vinyl covering is cracked
and/or missing, also resulting in cracked edges of vinyl.
Housing facilities must be maintained in good repair and structurally sound. Failure to do so can result in injury to
the animals . Correct by replacing and/or repairing fencing and any other structures in which protective coating is
missing as well as repairing and/or replacing any wire tips that are exposed to the animals.
