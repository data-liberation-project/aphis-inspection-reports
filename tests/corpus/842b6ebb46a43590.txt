3.17(a) CRITICAL
CARE IN TRANSIT.
A ~10 week old Bully male puppy was being transported from Mississippi to Florida. The puppy was picked up from
a person in Mississippi on 1/27/18. On 1/28/18, around 6:28pm, after being at a rest stop for approximately 45
minutes, the registrants observed the puppy in obvious physical distress (his “tummy seemed stiff”, his gums were
pale and he refused to take water, according to the registrants records). They stated they had left the air
conditioning on and had the windows open while at the rest stop. The registrants were just north of Lake City, FL at
that time, and they began trying to find an emergency veterinary clinic that was open on a Sunday night. The
nearest emergency clinic was about 65 miles (45 minutes, according to the registrant) away. Instead of heading
directly to the clinic, they tried to give various treatments (wetting the puppy down, offering water, administering
lemon juice and attempting to give Benadryl, Gatorade and Pedialyte) and stopped to check the puppy every 10 to
15 minutes. The puppy was found to be unresponsive and died at approximately 8:56pm on 1/28/18. It was
approximately 2 hours from the time they found the puppy in distress to the time that it died. As soon as an animal is
in obvious physical distress, veterinary care must be obtained at the closest available veterinary facility.
The puppy was taken to a vet for necropsy the following day. The necropsy revealed heat stroke as the likely cause
of the death. Young canines do not have body temperature control completely developed and some breeds, like this
puppy (a brachiocephalic breed), are already more susceptible to temperature changes and require more frequent
and attentive monitoring.
The registrant must provide appropriate climatic conditions for the animals being transported. When obvious
physical distress is noted, the registrant must obtain veterinary care at the closest available veterinary clinic.
Also, the registrant did not have a health certificate for this puppy. Health certificates are important because it
verifies that a licensed veterinarian has checked the animal and found that it is fit for transportation. No intermediate
handler or carrier shall transport in commerce any dog, unless the dog is accompanied by a health certificate
executed and issued by a licensed veterinarian.
