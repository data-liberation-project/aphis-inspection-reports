3.1(c)(1)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In several of the outdoor housing enclosures, affecting at least 20 dogs, the metal siding on the shelters has rusted,
broken and twisted outward creating sharp points and edges at the level of the dogs.
In (cid:28)"A(cid:29)" building, one enclosure housing four dogs has metal strips framing the access door. The metal strip along
the bottom has broken creating sharp edges and points. The dogs cannot avoid stepping on this broken strip of
metal to go through the access door.
Sharp points and edges can cause injury to the dogs. All sharp points and edges must be removed or altered in a
manner that they no longer pose an injury risk to the dogs. Licensee must establish a maintenance plan to ensure
that all enclosures remain safe for the dogs.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the (cid:28)"Whelping"(cid:29) building, affecting at least two adult dogs and six puppies, the whelping boxes are constructed of
wood and have been excessively chewed by the dogs.
In building (cid:28)"B"(cid:29), there are two enclosures housing at least seven dogs, that have a strip of wood beneath the
access door in the inside portion of the enclosure. These strips of wood have been excessively chewed and
damaged by the dogs and have become dirty and grimy.
Throughout the sheltered housing facilities referred to as "(cid:28)Whelping, W2, A, B, C and D", and affecting at least 30
dogs, several of the access doors have been excessively chewed by the dogs and these damaged areas have
become dirty.
The damage caused by the dogs(cid:25) chewing allows dirt and grime to penetrate the surface of the affected areas of the
enclosures and does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization. All chewed and damaged surfaces must bereplaced or altered in a manner to allow for proper cleaning and sanitization to occur every two weeks or as often as
necessary.
3.1(f) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside of an outdoor enclosure, housing 2 dogs, there is a large burrow that has been dug underneath a cement
slab. The burrow was measured to be greater than 3 ft. in length, and width and approximately 2 ft. in height. This
burrow does not allow for proper drainage to occur and puddles or pools of water could become contaminated
creating a disease hazard. The licensee must fill this burrow/hole and ensure that all dug holes are filled in a timely
manner to allow for proper drainage to occur.
In at least 3 of the outdoor enclosures "(cid:28)South of Barn"(cid:29), affecting 9 dogs, the drainage system is not functioning
properly. When it rains or when there is another source of water applied to the pens at the higher elevation
enclosures it all drains into lower elevation enclosures creating large pools. This water that is washed down from
the higher elevation enclosures contains waste material and other materials that could be harmful to the other dogs
in the lower elevation enclosures. The licensee must clean these affected enclosures and ensure that when
rainwater and/or waste water has settled into these enclosures that it is quickly removed or constructed in a manner
that allows the dogs to remain clean and dry.
3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The wooden clad shelters in several of the outdoor enclosures, affecting at least 20 dogs, have become worn. The
dogs have chewed and scratched areas of the wood rendering it unable to be properly cleaned and sanitized. The
licensee must repair or replace the affected shelters so that the surface may be properly cleaned and sanitized.
In the majority of the outdoor enclosures, affecting at least 76 dogs, the cement is cracked and or broken. These
cracks are spanning the length and width of several of the enclosures. The cracked and/or broken areas have large
gaps, at least 1 inch in width, that has hair, dirt and other organic material accumulated in them. These areas can
no longer be cleaned and sanitized properly and can create a disease hazard to the dogs. The licensee must repair
the cracks or broken areas of cement.
The licensee must establish and maintain a program that will allow all surfaces in contact with the animals to be
readily cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis.
To be corrected by: 25 Nov 143.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Throughout the outdoor housing enclosures, affecting at least eleven dogs, the water buckets have been
excessively chewed by the dogs and these damaged areas have become dirty. In the whelping building, affecting
one adult and one puppy, there is a food bowl that has been excessively chewed by the dogs and the damaged
areas have become dirty.
In one outdoor housing enclosure, affecting at least two Siberian Huskies, there is a metal water receptacle that has
dark colored water with a blackish green material containing white specks floating on the top. In an outdoor housing
enclosure, affecting at least two dogs, there are bird droppings on the water bucket and in the water. In one
enclosure housing two huskies, and another enclosure housing three pugs, the water receptacles have algae
growing in them and the water has algae floating in it.
In the areas of the outdoor housing facility referred to as "(cid:28)Husky Area"(cid:29) and (cid:28)"South of the Barn"(cid:29) the enclosures
have metal self-feeders. Several of these feeders, affecting at least thirty dogs, have bird droppings across the top
of them and running down their sides.
Damage to food and water receptacles caused by chewing allows dirt and food waste to penetrate the surface of
the receptacle and does not permit proper cleaning and sanitization to occur.
Food and water receptacles contaminated by bird droppings, algae, dirt and grime can pose a health risk to the
dogs.
All food and water receptacles damaged by the dogs'(cid:25) chewing must be replaced or altered in a manner that allows
for proper cleaning and sanitization every two weeks or as often as necessary in order to ensure they remain free of
bird droppings, algae, dirt and grime.
