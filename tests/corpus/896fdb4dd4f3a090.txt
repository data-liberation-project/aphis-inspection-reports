3.75(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Many metal sharp points and edges were found at several primary enclosures throughout the facility. All of the
sharp points/edges were identified on new and old hose clamps which are used in the construction of primary
enclosures. Housing facilities for nonhuman primates (NHP's) must be kept in good repair, and they must protect
the animals from injury and contain the animals securely. Primary enclosures for all NHP's at the facility must be
free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure regulated animals. The Site Director and Operations Manager
acknowledged the issue and communicated that repairs to eliminate the injury hazard would commence
immediately and be completed in approximately six months from the time of this inspection.
To be completed by: February 26, 2017
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with both, Dr. Kelly Hopper, Site Director and Mr. Greg
Parmenter, Operations Manager.
