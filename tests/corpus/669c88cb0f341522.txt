2.31(d)(1)(ii)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Consideration of Alternatives.
**Protocol #7113 includes a procedure that would be considered more than momentarily painful or distressful but
the protocol approved by the IACUC did not contain a written narrative description of the methods and sources used
to determine that alternatives were not available to that procedure.
Per this Section of the Regulations, whenever a proposal for animal use contains procedures that may cause more
than momentary pain or distress to the animals, the investigator is required to consider alternatives to those
procedures and provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that
alternatives were not available. This requirement is important to ensure that all procedures minimize the degree of
pain and distress to the animals.
The IACUC needs to address this deficiency that was identified for this protocol.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Program of Veterinary Care.
**The following outdated medications were found in an investigator’s laboratory space that were ready for use on an
AWA covered species: one tube of Lidocaine cream exp date 1/17 and one tube of Triple Antibiotic ointment exp
date 4/17.
Per this Section of the Regulations, each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate
veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent and treat diseases and injuries. All personnel
involved in animal care and use at the research facility should follow the guidelines of the institution’s Program ofVeterinary Care (PVC) that states in part that expired drugs are not approved for use in survival procedures. The
use of outdated or expired medications may not be safe or efficacious; medications that are past their expiration
date can deteriorate with time and may not result in the intended therapeutic effects in the animals.
Although the expired medications were immediately discarded at the time of the inspection, the research facility
needs to ensure that all personnel who are involved in animal care, including research staff, are familiar with the
institution’s PVC and the requirement to use in-date medications in the animals. Following the institution’s Program
of Veterinary Care ensures that appropriate methods are used by all personnel to prevent and treat diseases or
injuries in order to support the health and well-being of the animals.
Correct by 7/1/17.
NOTE - Inspection conducted 5/15/17 thru 5/17/17 with exit briefing held 5/18/17 on-site with facility
representatives.
