3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**** Broken, protruding wires with sharp points were observed around the watering system in all of the guinea pig
enclosures. The wires have corroded to the point that they have broken away from the base of the enclosure frame
leaving a one to two inch gap along the edge of the watering wire encasement. In one enclosure the base of the
wire water encasement had eroded to the extent that points were towards the five animals in that enclosure every
time they drank water. Sharp points could injure the animals. The licensee must ensure that all enclosure wires are
maintained in good repair at all times for the safety of the animals.

3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
**** There was a metal covering over the watering system in all the guinea pig enclosures, but this was rusting and
breaking apart. Hair, dust, and other excreta were becoming trapped in the jagged sections of metal. These
surfaces can no longer be readily cleaned and sanitized which can impact the health and well-being of the guinea
pigs by increasing the risk of disease, pests and odors. The licensee must repair or replace this area of the watering
system to ensure that adequate cleaning and sanitization can be accomplished and to protect the health of the
guinea pigs.
