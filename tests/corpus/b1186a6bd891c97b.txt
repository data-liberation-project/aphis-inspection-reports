ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** One large breed dog "Frisky" had matted fur underneath his belly area, behind the legs and on his ears. Once
the fur becomes matted it pulls and separates from the skin causing potential skin irritations and does not function
as an insulation against the elements. This dog needs to be brushed on a routine basis to prevent matted fur and
these mats should be removed for the comfort of the animal.
