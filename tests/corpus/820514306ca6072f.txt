ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male juvenile hedgehog housed in the "petter" enclosure with 25 other weanling hedgehogs was noted to be
lethargic and not very responsive to handling. The animal was lying partially curled on his right side while the other
juvenile hedgehogs were roaming throughout the enclosure. The licensee was directed by the AC VMO to remove
this hedgehog for closer examination. There was a clear nasal discharge noted and he appeared to have
noticeable raspy breathing noises. The hedgehog barely attempted to curl up when handled, a normal protective
behavior, and, upon being placed in an empty plastic container, remained stretched out in a sternal posture and did
not move for the remainder of the inspection (approximately 15-20 minutes). The inspection was stopped after all
animals were observed to allow the licensee to take this hedgehog to a veterinarian for examination.
Lethargy, reluctance to move, and abnormal breathing sounds with nasal discharge may indicate a severe illness
and should be identified quickly so that the animal can be separated from others in case of infectious illness and so
the animal can be evaluated by the attending veterinarian as soon as the problem is noted.
**This hedgehog needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian by 9/21/2015 to determine a diagnosis, initiate a treatment
for the diagnosed condition, and to develop a plan for follow-up to ensure the animal responds to the treatment as
expected. Records containing information on the suspected diagnosis, treatment needed, and follow-up plan need
to be made available to APHIS inspectors by 9/23/2015.
An adult female hedgehog in bin #43 was noted on the cage card on 9/19 to weigh 346 grams. This animal
appeared to be thin with a prominent backbone and appeared sunken in on both sides of the spine around the
abdomen and chest. The hedgehog's pre-pregnancy weight in June was 398 grams, her maximum weight before
birthing 5 pups on 7/28 was 533 grams. Four of the pups survived and were pulled to wean by the licensee on 9/7
and no weights had been recorded for her since 7/26 (prior to birthing, 511 grams) until 9/19.
This significant weight loss of 13% total body weight below pre-pregnancy weight along with her thin appearance
may indicate she is either not eating well enough after the pups have been weaned or there may be an underlying
problem causing the weight loss.**This hedgehog needs to be weighed by 9/23/2015 and, if there has not been any gain in weight since 9/19, must
be examined by the attending veterinarian for possible diagnosis for the weight loss, including treatment and
follow-up plans. Records containing information on the suspected diagnosis, treatment needed, and follow-up plan
need to be made available to APHIS inspectors by the next inspection.
Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of
emergency, weekend, and holiday care.
To be corrected by 9/23/2015.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were numerous open bags of chinchilla food, grass hay, and bedding in the storage cabinets under the
showcase enclosures for hedgehogs. There were live and dead insects (spiders, fruit flies, beetle-type bugs)
throughout these storage cabinets, including in a sealed container with food labeled "sugar glider food".
Live and dead insects can contaminate the food and bedding which may deteriorate the food and may spread
infectious organisms to the animals to whom the food and bedding are provided.
Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin.
To be corrected by 9/23/2015.
3.129(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
The food for 1 female sugar glider had live insect pests throughout the food in the sealed plastic container. The
licensee stated that they were not feeding this to the sugar glider in the store but there was no other food available
at the time of the inspection for inspectors to evaluate and no food receptacle in the enclosure for the animal.
Food that is infested with insect pests is contaminated, may not be wholesome or palatable for the animals, and
poses a risk to the health of the animals through possible infectious organisms as well as in the reduction of the
nutrients by the pests or because the animals will not consume the food.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health. To be corrected by 9/23/2015 with feeding of an appropriate, uncontaminated food source to begin on 9/21/2015.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
The facility has numerous areas where insects and mammalian pests are not being adequately controlled:
**Food and bedding storage cabinets under the showcase enclosures housing hedgehogs had numerous dead fruit
flies, a beetle-type bug in the cabinet as well as in the sealed container with sugar glider food, and live spiders
**The enclosures for 1 adult male and 1 adult female hedgehog on display in the storefront had cobwebs
accumulating in the wire top above the food dishes.
**The rodent breeding room had numerous areas along the north and east walls and around the water heater where
there was an accumulation of large rodent feces and shredded insulation material, indicating an active rat or other
rodent problem. A live trap was present on the northeast wall and contained a live rat which the licensee released
into one of the breeding enclosure tubs during the inspection.
**Excessive flies were present in the rodent breeding room and in the upstairs hedgehog breeding room. The
licensee has fly strips hanging in these areas, as well as a single fly trap in the hedgehog room, but all of the fly
strips were fully coated with dead flies and excessive flies were noted in many of the hedgehog enclosures as well
as in the rooms.
Insect and rodent pests are a source of bacteria, viruses, parasites, and other possible infectious organisms. Flies
can also spread disease from one enclosure to another by landing on excreta, or other possibly infectious material,
and then landing on the food and water receptacles or directly on the animals in the enclosures.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained.
An effective method to control these pests must be implemented and maintained by 9/30/2015.
Inspection conducted with licensee, PACFA inspector, veterinary student extern, and AC VMO, Tracy Thompson,
DVM on 9/21/2015. Inspection was ended before completion to allow licensee to seek veterinary care for a juvenile
male hedgehog.
Exit interview conducted with licensee on 9/23/2015.
