ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A sheep was noted to have an area of reddened inflamed skin just above the coronary band on its left rear foot.
Multiple flies were attracted to this wound. Untreated wounds of this nature can become more serious resulting in
unnecesary pain and suffering. This sheep requires examination by the attending veterinarian. Follow the
attending veterinarian's recommendations. Keep records of the diagnosis and treatment records for APHIS
inspection.

animals in the enclosure.
