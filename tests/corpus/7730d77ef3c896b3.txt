ANNUAL REPORT.
The 2019 annual report listed 48 rabbits in category C. The protocol in which these animals were used, Protocol
18-029, states that the experiment "may result in some distress and pain but every effort is made to minimize this".
The protocol involves intra-ocular injections and the use of analgesics.
Animals used in research procedures where pain and distress may occur, and where methods to alleviate pain are
used, must be reported on the annual report in Category D. The animals from this protocol should have been
reported in Category D. Accurate reporting of animals used in research is required to ensure proper oversight and
disclosure of animal usage.
Correct on August 27th, 2020, by reporting animals in the correct animal use category on future annual reports.
