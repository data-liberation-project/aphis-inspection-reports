ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* An adult, female, black leopard named Pandora has had a chronic issue of licking/sucking the end of her tail
resulting in a wound that is often hairless and reddened. The facility worked with the Attending Veterinarian for
years to manage the problem which tends to heal and then be present again. It has been treated with several
different systemic medications including anti-depressants and antibiotics as well as multiple different topical
treatments.
On 17 March 2015, a caretaker noticed the end of Pandora's tail was reddened, irritated, and had a small, thin,
white piece of hardened material sticking out approximately 4mm. Photos were taken and the Attending
Veterinarian was immediately consulted. After viewing the photos, the Attending Veterinarian believed the animal's
bone was exposed and determined the tail should be amputated before it became infected. Pain medication
(Meloxicam) and systemic antibiotics (Cephalexin) were prescribed and arrangements were made for the Attending
Veterinarian to visit the facility to amputate the tail within a few days. The licensee had grave concerns about the
nearly 20 year old animal undergoing anesthesia and having its tail amputated. The licensee communicated with
and actively sought out multiple other veterinarians in search of a treatment alternative. On 1 April 2015, the facility
made contact with a veterinarian who had an alternate treatment plan. That veterinarian visited the facility,
examined the animal, and began a new treatment plan on 4 April 2015. The veterinarian confirmed there was a
small piece (approximately 4 mm) of exposed bone protruding through the tissue on the end of Pandora's tail.
Although the licensee was actively pursuing veterinary care and all the while providing pain meds, Pandora had part
of a bone in her tail exposed for 2.5 weeks before she was physically examined by a veterinarian. This is not
considered adequate veterinary care in a timely manner. The facility had medical records showing pain meds were
provided daily for the animal, but there were no records present at the time of inspection to demonstrate that the
animal received systemic antibiotics nor was it clear how long they were prescribed to be given. The licensee
believes the animal was given antibiotics for 7 days but there was no record of it. Accurate, comprehensive health
records are needed to convey necessary information to all people involved in an animal's care--especially when the
animal is being treated by more than one veterinarian. Additionally, 7 days of antibiotics were prescribed by the
Attending Veterinarian with the understanding that the animal's tail would be surgically amputated within a few days.
The licensee failed to maintain good contact with the Veterinarian while seeking out other treatment plans andtherefore didn't know whether or not the antibiotic regimen should have been extended. An exposed tail bone is
very susceptible to infections which could quickly ascend through the spinal cord to the brain. Typically it would be
considered inappropriate to have bone exposed for 2.5 weeks yet only have a 7 day course of antibiotics.
By the time of inspection, Pandora was under the close care of a veterinarian and on a new treatment plan. The
new treatment plan includes methods to attempt to prevent the stereotypic self-mutilating behavior. Her bone was
no longer protruding from the tissue, the wound appeared to be healing, and it did not seem painful upon palpation
by the veterinarian, who was present during the inspection. Other than her tail wound, she appeared healthy.
The licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility receive adequate veterinary care in a timely manner.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: This non-compliant item was already corrected prior to the inspection.
The inspection was conducted 24-25 April 2015. An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative on
25 April 2015 and again on 1 May 2015.
