RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Acquisition records for a red kangaroo, wallaroo, llama, alpaca, sloth, camel, 8 pot belly pigs, African crested
porcupine, wolf hybrid, 3 rabbits, and 7 goats were missing (missing required information included name and
address, USDA license number or vehicle license number and driver’s license number, the date of acquisition,
species and number of animals). Disposition records for wallaroo, red kangaroo, and 2 rabbits were missing
(missing required information included name and address of person to whom the animal was sold or given, dates
sold, euthanized or disposed of, and species and number of animals). Lack of accurate information on the
acquisition and disposition of animals can compromise a trace-back investigation during a disease outbreak.
