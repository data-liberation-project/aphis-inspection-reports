2.126(a)(4) CRITICAL
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee stated that four animals, an adult male coati named Cody, an adult hedgehog named Pickles, an adult
female Fennec fox named Foxy, and an adult female ferret named Sally, were housed in a separate area from the
other animals at the facility. The licensee refused to allow APHIS personnel to inspect these animals while in their
primary enclosures.
To ensure the health and welfare of the animals, APHIS personnel must be able to observe all regulated animals,
their primary enclosures, and the surrounding premises.
Each dealer, exhibitor, intermediate handler, or carrier, shall during business hours, allow APHIS officials to inspect
and photograph the facilities, property, and animals, as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the
provisions of the Act, the regulations and the standards in this subchapter.
A complete routine inspection was conducted on May 23, 2017. This report is limited to critical noncompliant items
identified on that inspection. A second inspection report containing indirect noncompliant items will follow.
Both the inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and facility representative on May 23, 2017.
