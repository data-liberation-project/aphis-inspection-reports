Sanitation.
The floors of the commissary building are dirty throughout, with heavy accumulation of brown-to-black dirt/debris in some
areas. The sink, as well as metal shelving used to prepare food and store food receptacles is covered in a layer of
dust/dirt, and the containers of food on the shelves are also very dusty. The chest freezer containing frozen meat has
dirty enrichment items on top of it and accumulations of loose dirt. The large, commercial refrigerator inside the
commissary has metal shelving that is rusted to the point that it is porous and cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized.
The black, standard-sized refrigerator containing fresh meat, bones and produce has thick, brownish to pink fluid that has
pooled and dried in the drawers and on the shelves, as well as other areas on the inner walls and floor of the refrigerator.
Dirty or unsanitary surfaces and equipment used for preparing and keeping food can lead to contamination of food and
illness in animals. The licensee must ensure that premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair
to protect the animals and facilitate prescribed husbandry practices in the regulations.
