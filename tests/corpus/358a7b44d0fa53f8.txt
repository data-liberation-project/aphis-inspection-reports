3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***The wire mesh composing the primary enclosures for a majority of the rabbits is very rusty. There are several
areas where corrosion has occurred leaving large holes up to approximately 2 inches wide with jagged points
protruding into the enclosure. The sharp jagged points and holes may allow the rabbits to become injured or
possibly escape. These enclosures must be made structurally sound to protect the rabbits from injury, contain them
securely within and keep predators out.

SANITATION.
***The rubber/plastic mats provided in the rabbit enclosures and the wire mesh flooring are soiled with dried and
moist excreta . There is a build up of dusty and crusty material and excreta along the white PVC watering lines
running along the back of the enclosures. The primary enclosures shall be kept clean and reasonably free of
excreta to minimize disease hazards and contribute to the health and well-being of the rabbits..
