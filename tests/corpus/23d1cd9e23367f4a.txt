2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Fancy, (m/c# 991001898048816) a red & white Australian Shepherd female with 7 puppies (approximately 1 week old), is
very thin. There was an abdominal tuck and the spine and ribs were easily felt by the inspector. The owner stated that
she is fed "all she can eat". There was no consultation with a veterinarian to establish a diagnosis or treatment for this
dog. Poor body condition can be the result of parasites, inadequate nutrition, or an underlying medical condition. When
nursing puppies, a thin female may not be able to produce the needed quality of milk.
Fancy must be evaluated by a veterinarian within 3 days of this inspection, to know with certainty the problem and the
correct treatment. Documentation of the evaluation, recommended treatment and delivered treatments must be created
and must be available to APHIS officials.
2.75(a)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors
In the 3 sided shed containing the adult dogs, an enclosure houses 1 Coon Hound that is not included on the APHIS
7005. The dog is not used for breeding but is housed with the kennel dogs. Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain
records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information required in 2.75(a)(1) concerning each dog purchased
or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control. All dogs housed in
the kennel must be listed on the APHIS 7005.

3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
In the 3 sided shed was an enclosure with 2 Australian Shepherds where there was only 1 shelter that is not large enough
for each of the dogs to sit, stand and lie in a normal manner. There is space enough for only 1 of the 2 dogs in the
shelter so the other dog will not have shelter from the elements. Shelters are required to protect the animals from the
elements. Shelters must have a roof, four sides, and a floor. The owner must provide one or more shelters in each
outdoor enclosure that are large enough to contain all the animals at one time and allow them to sit, stand, lie, and turn
about freely.
3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care does not address the sampling of dogs for heartworm, coccidia or giardia. Under the
sampling for blood parasites is the statement "Clinical signs of disease are tested and treated appropriately". This does
not address the sampling of dogs and the prevention of heartworm. A preventative dewormer treatment is listed for
intestinal parasites but does not address a schedule to sample for giardia and coccidia. Sampling for parasites is
important to know with certainty that the preventative program is adequate to prevent infestation. The applicant must add
a schedule for sampling of these parasites approved by the attending veterinarian to the Program of Veterinary Care.
