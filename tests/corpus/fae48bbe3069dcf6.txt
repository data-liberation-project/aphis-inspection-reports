ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The female tiger "Thai" sustained an abrasion and laceration in the area of the right shoulder approximately
fourteen months ago. The attending veterinarian was immediately notified and the animal was appropriately treated.
Documentation indicates the wound was assessed one week later and noted to be healing well.
During today's inspection the area of the old wound appeared to be inflamed and obviously pink. Facility personnel
stated that the wound never completely healed in spite of multiple therapy attempts and the veterinarian was
notified of delayed healing. Documentation was provided by the facility indicating various treatments were
performed by personnel. However, the attending veterinarian stated that she was unaware there had been any
problem with wound healing and she had last examined the wound approximately one year ago.
Facility personnel also stated that the same animal was intermittently lame on the left front leg lasting one day in
duration with each episode. The tiger had a toe surgically removed from the left front foot many years ago. The
attending veterinarian stated she was unaware of any recent and/or recurring lameness issues with this animal.
Information regarding problems of animal health must be communicated to the veterinarian in an accurate and
timely fashion. A mechanism of direct communication must be established to keep the attending veterinarian
informed of the physical condition of the animals and allow adequate oversight of veterinary care.
Correct by: The appropriate information was provided to the veterinarian prior to the end of this inspection and
veterinary guidance was given to the facility.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The metal frame of the resting surface contained in the primary enclosure housing the tiger "Amir" was noted to
have an area of excessive rust with a resulting hole. The hole was located on a metal bar adjacent to the ground
and closest to the front of the enclosure. A tin panel constructed to be part of the shelter structure at the south end
of the enclosure was excessively rusted with a resulting hole. The hole was located at a seam approximately waisthigh as viewed from the front of the enclosure.
*A tin panel used to construct a shelter structure in the primary enclosure housing the tiger "Nischala" was
excessively rusted with a resulting hole. The damaged section of panel was at the north end of the enclosure
identifiable just above a resting surface at the seam where the metal met the platform.
Excessively rusted metal with holes may have sharp edges and if in contact with the animals could cause injury.
Housing facilities must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury. The identified areas should be
repaired or replaced. Six new large cat enclosures were under construction during this inspection. This
non-compliance could also be corrected by moving affected animals to new enclosures.
Correct by: January 5, 2014.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the director of animal care.
