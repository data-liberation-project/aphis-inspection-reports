3.6(a)(2)(ii)

Primary enclosures.
The fronts of the dog enclosures are constructed with an opening that a self-feeder normally occupies. In one enclosure,
containing three adult bichons, the feeder has been removed and the dogs were observed sticking their heads through
the opening. Openings in the enclosure that are large enough to allow a dog to place its head through could result in
injury to the animal.

Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the dogs from injury. The facility must alter
the openings in a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the dogs. The facility must ensure the enclosures are safe
for the dogs at all times.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class "A" license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by 11-September-2022 or the Applicant will forfeit the
license fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection.


Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
