3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Organic material and debris was being dumped to the rear of the large enclosure that backs up to the pond. This
has created a hazard to the animals such as (but not limited to):
Broken glass.
Sharp protruding wire points.
Areas of potential collapse.
Holes in the ground.
Aditionally, baling twine is not being removed from the animal area.
There is a potential for the animals to be injured in the dump area and by the baling twine strewn throughout the
animal area. The animals need to be precluded from entering the dump area,moved to another area, or the areas
they have access to need to be cleaned up. The non-dump area of the pasture needs to be cleared of baling twine
and other potentially hazardous materials.
An exit interview was conducted with the manager on site and with the owner by phone.
