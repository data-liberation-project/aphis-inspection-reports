ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:26 PM on
01-AUG-17.
I arrived at the site, called all the known contact numbers provided in the database, and left voice messages. After
waiting for 30 minutes near the closed gate entrance, I left the premises. The business owner returned my phone
call and stated that no one would be available to accompany me for inspection today and that she was well over an
hour away from this site.
