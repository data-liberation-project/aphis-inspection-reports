OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** Shelter from elements.***
Six outdoor dog shelters in the eastern kennel area do not have an adequate amount of bedding. These dog
houses had between 50 and 80 percent of the floor area showing through the provided bedding. Outside air
temperatures were approximately 45 degrees F with overnight temperatures to be expected in the 30 degree F
range. Adequate bedding must be provided to allow the dogs to conserve body heat during these lower
temperatures. To be corrected by: 12/17/14
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
