2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1210 on
18-Dec-19. We knocked on the door and no one answered. I honked the car horn and no one responded. I
contacted the licensee by phone. The licensee stated she was not home and would not be home for some time. I
informed her we would try again another time.
End of report.
