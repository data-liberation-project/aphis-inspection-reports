2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
The breeder sold and shipped (sight unseen) 4 to 5 puppies out of the state of Illinois in the past year using Delta
and American airlines. A transporter was hired to transport puppies sight unseen to California in July 2016, and to
bring back a returned puppy from Oregon in August 2016.
This breeder has 12 breeding females on the property with 9 other females at another location. The breeder stated
that she was made aware of the USDA regulation requiring a USDA license if conducting regulated activity, which
includes selling and transporting dogs sight unseen to the buyers if they have more than 4 breeding females. The
breeder advised she realized they could not send the animals by plane, and she admitted that she had done so
anyway.
The breeder must obtain a USDA license if they have 5 or more breeding females and want to sell them sight
unseen to the final owner/buyer. The breeder can not continue to do regulated activity without a USDA license.
