The tarp covering the shelter in the pig enclosure was in disrepair and hanging down onto the heat lamp. The tarp
coming into contact with the heat lamp is a potential fire hazard. The housing facilities shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

The regulated pig, Kevin, shares an outdoor enclosure with two other pigs. Kevin and one of the other pigs were
both shivering and huddled together towards the back of the shelter. The outside temperature during the inspection
at 2:15pm was 38 degrees Fahrenheit. During inspection, the veterinary medical officer noticed that one of the pigs
in the enclosure was not breathing and notified the facility representative, who pulled the pig out from underneath
the shelter. The animal was dead, cold to touch and there was stiffening of the limbs. The facility representative said
that he last saw the pig running around yesterday evening. This morning he fed the pigs, but was in a rush and did
not observe the pigs. A brief inspection of the dead pig by the VMO did not indicate any outward evidence of
trauma. There was a heat lamp inside the shelter, however the facility representative stated that it had not been
turned on yet this year.
The pigs are showing signs of discomfort from the cold temperatures. Inadequate protection from cold temperatures
can lead to hypothermia and potentially death. The shelter provided to regulated animals must afford them
protection, prevent discomfort, and be appropriate to the local climactic conditions.
The facility must make any necessary changes to the shelter to ensure that the pigs are provided adequate
protection from the cold temperatures by November 30, 2016.This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative and VMO Dominique Engel.
