FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There are unsealed surfaces on the floor of the trailer where the tiles are missing. Unsealed wood can become wet
providing an optimal area for the growth of bacteria and mold which can cause animals to become ill. The floor of
the guinea pig trailer must be impervious to moisture so that the floor can be repeatedly cleaned and disinfected
and will not retain odors. The floor must be repaired where the tiles are missing so that surface is impervious to
moisture so that it can be properly cleaned and sanitized.

There is an algae buidlup along the PVC water pipe and the automatic water nipples on two guinea pig racks.
Failure to clean and sanitize water receptacles may allow for excessive growth of algae and bacteria. Such
contamination potentially exposes the animals to disease. Correct by ensuring that all water receptacles are
cleaned and sanitized at least every two weeks or more frequently if necessary.
