(c) Surfaces--(1) (i)
***** At time of inspection the walls of the enclosures in Pen numbers 1 and 2 as well as the unused pen located
next to the pen labeled as pen 1 are constructed of 2"x4" galvanized horse panels which has had galvanized
welded wire added along a portion of the panel along the bottom. This welded wire has rusted as well as 8" to 12" of
the horse panel and this wire and portion of the panel is no longer structurally sound and it can not be properly
cleaned and sanitized.
The welded wire needs to be removed or replaced and the bottom portion of the horse panel needs to be removed
which will make these surfaces able to be properly sanitized and the horse panels structurally sound.
***** Along the back portion of the pens located on both sides of the kennel the horse panels along the bottom 4"
have rusted which prevents proper cleaning and sanitizing to take place as required. This area of the panels need to
be painted or covered with a material which will allow for cleaning and sanitizing of these panels which the animals
have contact with to be carried out as required to aid in disease prevention and to keep these panels structurallysound.
