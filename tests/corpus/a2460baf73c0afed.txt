3.127(d) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***On 5/14/16 a Dall lamb was found dead outside of its enclosure. Facility staff suspect a mountain lion gained
access to the sheep enclosure by going over both the perimeter fence (eight feet high) and the enclosure fence.
Failure to maintain perimeter fencing at a sufficient height may allow animals or persons to enter or exit the facility
and harm the regulated animals. All outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed
by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
A corrective plan detailing how the perimeter fence will be modified with a timeline for completion of the
modifications, must be made available to APHIS personnel when requested, by September 25, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
