2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The required written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was found to be incomplete and missing information on the
availability of emergency/after-hours care and appropriate methods to deliver adequate veterinary care. The facility's
written PVC must include in detail appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, treat diseases/injuries, and medical
disposition of animals by the Attending Veterinarian (AV). Also, detailed information on the availability of emergency,
weekend, and holiday veterinary care must be included in the PVC. Additionally, some of the PVC’s listed methods to
deliver adequate veterinary care to animals were found to be generic and unspecific. In order to provide adequate
veterinary care to regulated animals, the facility and the AV should review and update the PVC by listing specific and
detailed information on all preventive, diagnose and treatment methods for all regulated animals.
3.81

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
A environment enhancement plan to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates (NHPs) was not
available for inspection. As directed by the Attending Veterinarian, the facility must develop, maintain, and follow an
appropriate environment enhancement plan to promote the psychological well-being of NHPs at the premises. In order to
ensure adequate overall welfare for NHPs, the plan must be available at all times to APHIS personnel during inspections.
