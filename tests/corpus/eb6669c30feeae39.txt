*** The APHIS form 7005 shows 46 dogs in the facility and the physical count of dogs was 51. The discrepancy in
numbers shows the form is not being up dated on a regular basis. The 7005 form must be kept up to date to
accurately show the number of dogs in the facility, where they came from and where they have gone.

regular basis to contain all the required information.
