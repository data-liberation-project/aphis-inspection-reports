ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
This facility has 4 primates called bush babies that require enrichment. At this time the licensee is not providing any
kind of enrichment items and didn't produce an enrichment plan. The physical environment in the primary
enclosures must be enriched by providing means of expressing noninjurious species-typical activities. Species
differences should be considered when determining the type or methods of enrichment. The licensee does not know

The hedgehog breeding room has a rodent infestation. While conducting the inspection a mouse was spotted
running up the wall and into a tiny hole. There was another notable hole in the opposite corner and mouse
droppings were present on top of little plastic den boxes used for the hedgehogs to breed. The licensee had traps
