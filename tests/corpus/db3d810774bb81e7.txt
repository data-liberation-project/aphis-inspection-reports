2.31(c)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Although semiannual evaluations were conducted in January 2021 and January 2022, the documentation available for
these evaluations was incomplete. Documentation of the January 2021 semiannual evaluation did not distinguish
significant deficiencies from minor deficiencies, and there was no timely report to the Institutional Official upon completion
of the evaluation. Instead, a single signature page following the July 2021 semiannual evaluation was used to record
signatures for both the January 2021 and July 2021 report to the Institutional Official. A report to the Institutional Official
was not available for the January 2022 semiannual evaluation.

The IACUC must communicate timely and accurate information to the Institutional Official. Semiannual reports to the
Institutional Official must be updated at least once every six months upon completion of the required semiannual
evaluations, and must be maintained by the research facility and made available upon request. Additionally, the reports
must distinguish significant deficiencies from minor deficiencies.

Without timely receipt of the semiannual reports, the Institutional Official may not be informed of IACUC activities and the
conditions of the animals and facilities, and animal welfare may be negatively impacted. All reports to the Institutional


Official must identify any departures from the regulations or standards, distinguish significant from minor deficiencies,
contain a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency, and be reported at least
once every six months upon completion of the required semiannual evaluations. These reports must be reviewed and
signed by a majority of the IACUC members, include any minority views, and be available for APHIS inspection.

Correct from this date forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
