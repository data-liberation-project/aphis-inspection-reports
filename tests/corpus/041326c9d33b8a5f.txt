FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The guinea pigs are housed in multiple enclosures that are stacked on top of each other. The one multi level
wire mesh enclosure on the ground is not level and stable and when the guinea pigs in the top enclosure move
around, both enclosures shake back and forth. This needs to be addressed so the set up is structurally sound for
the safety of the animals.
