3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One singly housed opossum escaped from its enclosure two days ago. The facility suspects that the latch to its
primary enclosure was not completely closed allowing the opossum to escape into the enclosed anteroom area. The
anteroom area contains at least opening in the chain link/wire on the sides/walls large enough to allow an animal
the size of an opossum to escape from the anteroom area into the backyard. A humane trap is currently being used
to try to trap the opossum. Lack of maintenance of enclosures and latches can lead to escape and consequent
injury of an animal. The facility shall ensure that all enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair
to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by 3/15/16.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
