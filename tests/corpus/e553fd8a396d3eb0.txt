Watering.
According to facility records dated 09/18/2022 through 09/19/2022, an adverse event occurred involving juvenile pigs
housed in the same pen, culminating in the necessary euthanasia of one of the pigs. These records and IACUC minutes
dated September 28, 2022, indicate that four animals in "Pen 1" did not eat overnight and appeared thin; three of the
animals were less active. It was discovered that a water hose became disconnected from a Lixit. Records indicate that,
"Pigs went unknown period of time w/o water." Treatment was initiated immediately, and three of the four pigs did not
develop further symptoms. One pig, #131, began to display neurologic signs of salt toxicity and seizures that ultimately
failed to respond to therapy, necessitating euthanasia. The cause of the disconnected hose was not determined and could
not be reproduced. Corrective actions were implemented, to include retraining of the caretaker and care staff for checking
hose connections, normal pig behavior and disease states, and adding a second health check later in the evening, which
is performed by a different caretaker on alternating days.
Failure to ensure access to drinking water impacted the well-being of three pigs and resulted in the development of salt
toxicity and subsequent euthanasia of one pig. The facility must ensure that potable water is accessible to the animals at
all times or at least provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals; frequency of watering shall


consider age, species, condition, size and type of animal.
