Facilities, indoor.
Interior surfaces. The wooden floor of the guinea pig building and a 5.5 foot by 8 foot section of the front wall are still not
sealed or covered with an impervious surface(s). Indoor surfaces that are not impervious can absorb moisture and liquids,
retain odors, and do not allow adequate cleaning and sanitization of the room surfaces. Building surfaces must be
constructed and maintained so that the indoor surfaces of animal rooms are impervious to moisture. Correct by sealing or
covering wooden surfaces with an impervious surface so that walls and floor can be cleaned and sanitized when dirty.

Remains uncorrected.
3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
There is a buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the floor and the solid portion of the sides of enclosures. The
enclosures also have accumulations of excreta and soiled bedding. The buildup of organic material such as this makes
disinfectants ineffective. Inadequate cleaning and sanitization exposes the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards such
as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Correct by ensuring that primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often
enough to prevent a buildup of organic material, excreta, and soiled bedding. Additionally, enclosures must be sanitized
at least once every 2 weeks.


Remains uncorrected.
