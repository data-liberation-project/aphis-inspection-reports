ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The available written Program of Veterinary Care has not been updated since last reviewed. The plan has almost
no detail, not describing what animals are covered, not telling which of the hoof stock receive rabies vaccines.
There is no description of what ectoparasite control is done. The program states ivermectin is given for intestinal
parasites, but does not say if this is given to all of the animals or just some, nor does it provide dosages or
schedule of deworming.
To be corrected by 9-15-17.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records of acquisition are not available for all of the animals. Although records are available for some of the hoof
stock, the records do not show the date those animals were acquired. Other animals recently obtained are not
recorded such as a group of goats. The owner states the records are in another vehicle which is not on the
premises and not readily available.
Records need to be kept of all animals obtained either through birth, purchase, or donation. Acquisition records are
to include a description of the animal, the date obtained, the name, address, USDA number or driver's license
number and license plate number of the person from whom animals were obtained.
