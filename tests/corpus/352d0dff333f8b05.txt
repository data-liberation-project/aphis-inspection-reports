FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***There is an ongoing occurrence of standing water in the storage rm B-55. Supplies of caging, enrichment
materials, water bottles, etc. are kept in the room. The water is coming in from the outside of the building and
entering through the wall during inclement weather. Most of the supplies have been placed on racks or platforms to
minimize exposure to contamination but without knowing where the water is coming in there is still potential for
contamination. The leakage shall be repaired and/or items shall not be stored at this location to protect them from
contamination.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director of Operations.
