There are multiple deviations from the procedures described in Protocols 1 and 2.
- On 2 June 2020 the primary investigator for Protocol 1 injected a guinea pig with a solution containing a “Cremophor®
EL-based vehicle”. The protocol was approved for a solution using a DMSO base. The Primary Investigator chose to use
a different base and felt that it would be safe for the animals. The guinea pig subsequently had an allergic response to
the injection and died soon after. On 15 June 2020 the IACUC chose to permanently suspend the protocol in question.
The suspension was reported to USDA on 17 June 2020.
Protocol 2 describes an experimental design starting with “Objective 1” in Year 1 and progressing to “Objective 2” in year
2 of the study.
- Two dogs, “Richie – ID OOV-9” and “Milo – ID KQB-0” had the chemical procedure performed on 13 March 2020 under
Objective 2 procedures. This was three months before the actual Objective 1 dose optimization study was conducted
(between 20 May 2020 and 1 June 2020) on a group of 10 dogs. The primary investigator chose to ignore this schedule
and initiate the project with a long-term study involving Richie and Milo. This was a significant deviation that impacted
these dogs and should have been submitted to the IACUC as a protocol amendment prior to conducting the procedure.
- Ten dogs were utilized under Objective 1 of the protocol between 20 May 2020 and 19 June 2020. According to this


protocol, the dogs would be surgically castrated 1-3 hours after chemical injection. They would be monitored over the
next 24 hours for a variety of pain factors such as panting, vocalization, and antisocial behavior. Pain evaluation would be
recorded using a 0-3 scale. The dogs would also be “monitored for the development of fever post CTA”. Study records
provided did not show any of these monitoring procedures for the ten dogs used in the study.
- Four dogs “Milo – KQB-0”, “Richie – OOV-9”, “Lyle – LY80” and a dog with ID “HCB-0” were utilized under the Objective
2 section of this protocol. The protocol states dogs in this objective would be evaluated for “stress markers in blood” over
a 2-week period post injection. The protocol further states that a CBC and serum testosterone levels would be checked
on each dog at “0 min, 30 min, 60 min, 180 mins, 24 h and 72 h and once each month”. Study records did not
demonstrate that any of this monitoring was conducted on the four dogs.
Animal Care and Use Protocols must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC. Any amendments or significant changes
to a protocol must also be approved by the IACUC. Protocols 1 and 2 had significant deviations from the approved
procedures that were not presented to the IACUC for review and approval. These deviations had a dramatic impact on
the animals, including the death of a guinea pig and a significant health and welfare impact on numerous dogs. The
IACUC must approve and monitor all procedures on regulated animals to assure adherence to the allowed procedures.

- Two dogs, “Milo” and “Richie” were started on the long-term protocol prior to any dose optimization or pain scale testing
being conducted. Four days after the injection, “Milo” was surgically castrated due to the formation of scrotal ulceration.
“Richie”, per facility records, did not appear to have any effect from the injections. He was placed in a foster home for
approximately one year, then returned to the study and given a second injection on 25 April 2021. He was then surgically
castrated on 28 April 2021 due to ulceration of the scrotum.


- A dog named “Lyle – ID LY80” was utilized under Protocol 2 and subjected to 4 separate major operative procedures.
The AWA definition of a major operative procedure is any surgical intervention that penetrates and exposes a body cavity
or any procedure which produces permanent impairment in physical or physiological functions. The procedure of chemical
castration is designed to permanently impair the testicular tissue. Study records indicate that Lyle received an injection in
the left testicle on 12 June 2020, and in the right testicle on 13 June 2020. Lyle then had surgery on 16 June 2020 to
remove the right testicle due to ulceration of the scrotum. The left testicle was removed in a separate procedure on 16
October 2020.
Procedures involving animals will avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain. The Primary Investigator did not
complete Objective 1 for Protocol 2 which was designed to “determine the best dose that provides the maximum
effectiveness of the CTA method” and to monitor clinical signs that indicate pain and distress. Failing to complete this
portion of the protocol resulted in unnecessary discomfort and distress to “Milo”, “Richie”, and “Lyle”. In addition, Lyle was
subjected to multiple painful procedures including two separate surgical castrations. Primary investigators must follow
IACUC approved protocols to ensure animal pain and distress is minimized.

- On Protocol 2, ten dogs were utilized under the “Objective 1” portion of the protocol. The primary investigator failed to
fully describe the intended use of the animals. The procedures in this portion of the protocol are frequently vague and
unclear. The experiment is intended to test methods of chemical castration in dogs. The protocol describes the injection
method and dose determination but does not specify other details of this procedure. Study records indicate that 6 of the
10 dogs had one testicle injected, with the other testicle left as a control. Three of the other 4 dogs received “2X” dose in
each testicle. One received “2X” dose in the left, and “1.5X” in the right. The protocol does not make any reference to


varying the doses in this manner.
- The same section of this protocol continues by stating that “if needed, temperature sensors” will be inserted in the
testicles to confirm “core heating”. There is no explanation of this procedure, nor any indication of expected temperature
findings or baseline parameters.
Protocols must contain a complete explanation of the intended use of animals. Protocols that are vaguely worded or
lacking details do not give a clear, thorough description of the intended experimental procedures. This protocol must be
amended to give a complete and accurate description of intended animal use.
