FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The floor of the Kinkajou enclosure was in disrepair. The floor was crumbling and jagged and the layer underneath
was exposed. This condition prevents the surface from being adequately sanitized. In addition, this could cause the
animal to become ill if the floor material is ingested. The facility needs to repair this area and ensure the material
can be easily sanitized.
