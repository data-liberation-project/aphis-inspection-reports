A focused inspection was conducted with the licensee and 2 APHIS inspectors to re-evaluate two animals with
veterinary conditions cited during the inspection of 9/19/2014.

**The bull reindeer calf had been separated from the herd along with 2 other calves for weaning purposes. He did
appear to have a more normal gait and stance but did not move around much in this enclosure despite the other 2
calves being very active. Due to the severity of the animal's condition (a fractured right hind limb), continued
monitoring daily is necessary. A follow-up examination and diagnostic testing is to be performed by the attending
veterinarian before 11/30/2014, or prior to commingling with the adults if to be done sooner than 11/30/2014, to
ensure the leg is fully healed.
**The husky-malamute dog, Mikoh ID# 9, was noted to no longer have any eye discharge and the condition has
resolved.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
