2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The 2 year old ring tailed lemur has visibly gained a significant amount of weight in the last several month
bordering on obesity. The licensee states that the diet has not changed which could indicate that the weight gain is
due to a health issue. This animal should be assessed by the attending veterinarian.
*** The male paca has red tissue swelling underneath the right eye which resembles "cherry eye". This animal also
needs to be assessed by the vet to diagnose the condition and plan a method of treatment.
*** The licensee recently acquired a 6 week old red handed tamari from Fl and within 2 days the animal was used in
an educational presentation. This animal has not been examined by the attending veterinarian, diet evaluated and
there was no TB test or vaccines given. Appropriate methods of vet care include a quarantine period and evaluation
by the vet to assure the health of the animal. This needs to be addressed.
