3.84(b)(3)(iii)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The licensee stated that he only uses soap to clean his Lemur (Primate) enclosure. Just soap is not enough
sanitization for primates that require a detergent and disinfectant. Sanitization of indoor primate enclosures must be
conducted once every 2 weeks. By washing all soiled surfaces with appropriate detergent solutions or by using a
combination of detergent and disinfectant product followed by a clean water rinse. The licensee must consult with
the attending veterinarian on purchasing an effective sanitizing solution. Then thoroughly scrub the inside floors and
walls of the primate enclosure to reduce disease hazards.
