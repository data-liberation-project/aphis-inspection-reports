PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The 3 newly acquired rabbits were being housed in an enclosure that measured 3'x2' for a total of 6 sq feet.
According to the regulations, rabbits of this size (4.4 - 8.8 lbs) each require 3 sq ft of floor space. To ensure the
health and comfort of the rabbits, the required floor space must be provided.

SANITATION.
During this inspection it was noted that 3, newly acquired rabbits were being housed in the "warm room". However,
the wire slatted enclosure that they were in had an accumulation of wet, saturated bedding. To ensure the health
and comfort of these animals this enclosure will need to be cleaned at a frequency that will prevent accumulation of
wet soiled debris.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. This facility has recently constructed a new "warm room" for the primates, coatimundi's, prairie dog, cavy and
birds. However, there is an approximate 6" gap between the walls and the ceiling and under the threshold of the
main entry doorway that has exposed fiberglass insulation. All gaps need to be sealed to ensure that the animalscan not escape into that area or to keep loose insulation from falling into animal areas.

2. The brown bear enclosure is divided down the middle by a chain link fence partition. However, a section of the
chain link is not secured to the support post just below the large wooden box. This created a large gap on the right
side of the opening between the two sections of the enclosure. To ensure the safety of this bear, this fencing will
need to be repaired.
***To Be Corrected By: March 19, 2016
3. The barrier fence for the black bear enclosure was recently hit by a falling limb off the adjacent pine tree. This
broke the corner support post and caused the chain link to sag. To ensure the integrity of the fence, the post and
fence will need to be repaired.
***To Be Corrected By: April 9, 2016
4. The left side of the gate to the tiger enclosure was being held in place with a hinge on the top section and a thick
rope in the middle. It did not appear to be hinged at the bottom section. To ensure the integrity of this gate, and to
ensure the proper containment of the animals, this gate will require additional structural hardware.

5. The lower strand of hot wire in the back, right, corner of the tiger enclosure was loose and sagging. One of the
tigers was observed laying on the wire. To ensure the safety of the animals and to prevent any injury this wire
needs to be properly secured to the primary enclosure fencing.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. The food preparation area in the newly constructed "warm room" consisted of 2 wood boards on a plastic table.
There was accumulation of dirt and grime noted on the surface of the wood boards. This is an area that is used to
prepare meat, vegetable, and fruit diets. Due to the fact that these wood boards can not be properly sanitized this
situation will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: March 10, 2016
2. The two refrigerators in the newly constructed "warm room" had an accumulation of blood and grime on the doors
and bottom shelf. These refrigerators are being used to store meat, vegetable, and fruit diets for the animals. To
ensure the health and safety of the animals food items need to be stored properly.
***To Be Corrected By: March 19, 20163.131(a)
SANITATION.
The coatimundi that was being housed in the small wire enclosure had a vari kennel present. This vari kennel had
an accumulation of dirt and grime on the top surface. This kennel will need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
While conducting this inspection it was noted that there was an accumulation of baling twine in the camel and llama
enclosures. One llama had a piece of it stuck on its wool. While the balls of twine in the camel pen was observed in
their pile of hay. This could be a hazard if it is ingested by the animals or if they become entangled. The licensee
should ensure that twine is not left in the animal enclosures.

An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
