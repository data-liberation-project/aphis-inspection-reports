WATERING.
The facility provides a water barrel for the deer however, currently the water barrel is frozen over and snow covered
and not accessible to the deer. The facility representative stated that the deer have been eating snow and
occasionally he does provide them a bucket of water.
Lack of access to water does not ensure for the health, well-being, and comfort of the animals.
Water has to be made accessible on a frequent basis to ensure that all deer have adequate access to water.
