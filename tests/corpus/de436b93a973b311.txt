2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
2.40 (b)(2) The written program of veterinary care (PVC) reviewed and signed on 10/20/2014 calls for the one adult
llama to receive annual CDT vaccination, fecal testing and Ivermectin annually. The twenty-three fallow deer are to
have fecal testing annually. There were no records available at the time of the inspection showing that these
procedures had been done. The facility representative stated that they are no longer giving Ivermectin annually to
the llama. The written program of veterinary care does not reflect what is actually being provided to the animals. A
complete and accurate PVC is important to ensure there is an understanding between the licensee and the
attending veterinarian, so that all routine preventative care and treatments are accomplished to protect the health
and well-being of the animals.
Establish and maintain an accurate and complete program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, diagnosis and treat diseases and injuries.
