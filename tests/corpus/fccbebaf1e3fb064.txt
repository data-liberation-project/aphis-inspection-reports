2.33(b) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A review of institutional records showed that between 09 January 2017 and 10 May 2017, a captive colony of 22
wild-caught bats, under an active IACUC approved protocol (#A16069) and housed in an institutional facility,
experienced a 100% mortality loss. Losses on multiple dates were indicated on PI records but no records were
available to verify that the attending veterinarian had been contacted and appropriate timely diagnostic tests
conducted to determine the cause or causes of the ongoing colony mortality.
Direct and timely communication with the attending veterinarian and appropriate diagnostic testing are essential to
the well-being of all institutional animal colonies when unexpected mortality or morbidity occurs.
The facility must ensure that animal health issues are communicated to the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner and appropriate procedures are in place to diagnose, prevent and control disease or conditions negatively
impacting animal health.
Correct this date forward.

SANITATION.
A large population of flies was observed in the east farrowing room of the swine unit. Several dozen flies were
observed on some sows in the room. Feeders in the room were also observed to have a large number of flies on
their exterior surface. Eight sows and seventy-four piglets were present in the room at the time.
Flies may be a vector for transmission of animal diseases. Large numbers of flies may also cause undue stress and
discomfort to animals held in confinement. The facility needs to ensure that a safe and effective program for the
control of flies and other insect pests is established and maintained in all regulated animal housing areas.
