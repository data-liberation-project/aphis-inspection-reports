3.31(b)SANITATION.
* Spilled bedding and rodent dropping are present on the animal room floor as well as on a packing rack in front of
the mammal room.
* Four feed containers are covered in dirt and grime.
Spilled bedding and feces must be removed and the feed containers must be cleaned. A routine schedule to
maintain the cleanliness of feed containers, packing racks, tables and floors must be established and maintained to
ensure that the prescribed husbandry practices are facilitated for the health and well-being of all of the animals.
* All of the air handlers, in the mammal room, are no longer working. A portable air conditioner is present, however,
it is not cooling the entire room.
* Two floor fans are also present to aid in air circulation, however, they are both covered with grime, dust and hair.
The accumulation of grime, dust and hair blocks the fan covers thus rendering the efficiency of the flow of air.
The air handlers must be repaired and the fans must be cleaned to increase the efficiency of air flow to ensure that
the animals are provided with adequate air temperatures for their health and well-being.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure housing two rabbits has a wire floor that is secured to only one side wall. The opposite end of this
wire floor is totally detached from the other side wall, thus leaving the floor sagging into the litter tray.
A support wheel on this rack is no longer attached and lying on the floor.
All six feed hoppers have rusty edges.
The enclosure, rack and rusted feed hoppers are in disrepair thus leaving all of the rabbits subject to injury. All
damaged items must be repaired and/or replaced to maintain structural strength and to protect the rabbits from
injury.
