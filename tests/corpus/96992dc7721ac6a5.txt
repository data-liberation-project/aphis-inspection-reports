HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a build-up of dog oil, grime and dirt on the outside walls of the four soft-coated wheaten terrier enclosures
in the west kennel building. This build-up of dog oil, grime and dirt may lead to an increase of disease causing
organisms. The licensee must spot-clean and sanitize hard surfaces in contact with the dogs on a daily basis to
prevent an accumulation of grime and reduce disease hazards. Correct by 1 April 2015.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the west kennel building, there are numerous cobwebs in the unused upper row of enclosures and hanging from
the ceiling in the back half of the building. The accumulation of cobwebs create an unsanitary living condition that
could impact the health and well being of the dogs. It indicates a potential living area for pests that are housed with
the dogs. The licensee must remove the cobwebs and keep surfaces clean. Correct by 14 April 2015.
