3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on five metal entryway doors, one plastic bucket
and on the exterior metal wall of one enclosure. Twelve dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in
shelter housing. The affected area covers approximately 20 percent of the metal wall area and 75 percent of the
metal entryway doors. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease
hazards. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or health risks.
Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly or often enough, increase the risk of disease hazards for the
dogs. Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the animals. All surfaces of housing facilities must be
cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. The
licensee must ensure that all surfaces which any dog comes in contact with must be spot cleaned on a daily basis
and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b). Correct by 4/3/17.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* One outdoor enclosure run has an accumulation of dry in appearance excreta on an estimated 20 percent of the
enclosure flooring. Two dogs are in contact with the affected flooring located in sheltered housing. It indicates
unsanitary living conditions exist that could increase the risks of disease transmission, which negatively affects the
health of the dogs. Accumulations of excreta can potentially create odors, serve as an attractant for flies, insects
and other pests. In addition, an accumulation of excreta reduces the clean surface area available for the dogs to
walk on. The licensee must remove excreta from the primary enclosure daily to prevent an excessive accumulation
of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease
hazards, insects, pests and odors. Correct by 3/22/17.
* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 3/20/17 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of the inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
