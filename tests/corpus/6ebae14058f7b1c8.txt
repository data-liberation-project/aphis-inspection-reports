OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
3.4(b)(3) Wind and rain breaks
A shelter in an outdoor enclosure, housing 2 dogs, did not have a rain or wind break at its entrance. Wind/rain
breaks prevent unnecessary wetting of the bedding and help protect the dogs from the elements. The licensee
must provide a wind/rain break at the entrance of all outdoor shelters.
TO BE CORRECTED BY DECEMBER 19, 2014.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensees and with a Missouri Dept. of Agriculture
inspector.
