2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In Nov 2017 a medical emergency developed with an animal on study following the administration of a test article.
Study personnel contacted a non-veterinarian who rendered emergency care but the condition of the animal
declined and was euthanized. Although there was a qualified veterinarian available on-site, study personnel did not
contact him/her directly to provide information on the emergency condition that developed in the animal.
Per this Section of the Regulations, daily observation of animals may be accomplished by someone other than the
attending veterinarian but a mechanism of direct and frequent communication to the veterinarian is required so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health is conveyed to the veterinarian. Failure to contact a
veterinarian when problems of animal health develop can compromise animal welfare.
Correct from this date forward 3/28/18.
Inspection conducted 3/26/18 thru 3/28/18 with facility personnel. Exit briefing held 3/28/18 with facility personnel.
