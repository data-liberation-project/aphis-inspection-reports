3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The plastic surfaces within most animal enclosures at the facility were found to be in need of repair or replacement.
Many plastic shelves, swings, and boxes were observed to have areas where proper sanitation can no longer be
obtained (mostly due to wear). Also, several plastic boxes/dens had jagged edges and/or sharp points that might
injure the animals. All surfaces within animal enclosures must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of
housing facilities including houses, boxes, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects that cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or permanently soiled.
Specifically, the enrichment primate cubes in enclosures 14-B and 25-B need to be repaired/replaced by August 13,
2015.
A corrective plan detailing how the surfaces will be repaired/replaced, with an appropriate timeline for completion
needs to be in place by September 12, 2015.
3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Despite the presence of traps and bait boxes/bags in and around all enclosure quadrants, evidence of insect and
rodent infestation (feces) was observed in several animal enclosures, particularly within tunnel chutes and below
food receptacles. The facility should review and update as necessary the current pest control program. An
effective program for control of insects, external parasites affecting nonhuman primates, and birds and mammals
that are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and
reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
