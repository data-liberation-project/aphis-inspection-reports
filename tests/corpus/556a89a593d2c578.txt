ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1200 on
20-Feb-20.Upon arrival I called the phone number listed and knocked on the door. The licensee contacted me and
informed me that she could not be home for the inspection process. Future hours of operation were discussed.
This is the first attempted inspection.
