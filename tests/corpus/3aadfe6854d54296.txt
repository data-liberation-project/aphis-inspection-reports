***In the walk through, there was one primary enclosure that contained three Pot Bellied Pigs. There was damage to
the chain link fence between these pigs and the Jacob Sheep. The fence had been repaired with pieces of 2" x 4"
wire panels, yet the panels had become detached and one of these panels had sharp points on one end within the
pig enclosure. There was also a board that had been wired to the bottom of the chain link fence, but was laying flat
on the ground. Both of these areas left the sharp points at the bottom of the chain link fence exposed into the pig
enclosure and into the sheep enclosure. Sharp edges create a potential injury for the animals within the enclosures.
The licensee must repair this fence, remove the sharp points from protruding into the enclosures and assure that all
enclosures are free of sharp points and edges as required.
To be corrected by November 1, 2014.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Storage.
***In the feed room there were bags of grain, scratch and pellets that had either been opened or busted and poured
onto the floor in between the pallet slats. The feed in the pallets was caked and had areas of mold. The facility
representative stated that they had stopped feeding the scratch. There was a dead mouse and numerous mouse
traps that had been tripped. Feed waste that is not removed from storage areas attracts pests that can contaminate
the feed. The licensee must clean this area and assure that all feed is adequately stored as required.
