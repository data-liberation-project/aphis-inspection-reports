2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1750 on
25-Mar-19. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I honked the car horn and
then called the licensee and left a message. I waited 30 minutes and did not receive a call back. I then left the
property.
End of report.
