Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Consideration of Alternatives: IACUC approved Protocol C did not provide a written narrative description of the methods
and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available for any of the procedures that may cause more than
momentary pain or distress to the animals that are described in the approved protocol.

Per this Section of the Regulations, whenever a proposal for animal use contains procedures that may cause more than
momentary pain or distress to the animals, the IACUC shall determine that the principal investigator has considered
alternatives to those procedures and the principal investigator has provided a written narrative description of the methods
and sources they used to determine that alternatives were not available. This requirement ensures that all procedures
contained in the protocol minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals.

Although all animal work on this protocol has been completed, the IACUC needs to ensure all protocols that are submitted
that contain any procedure(s) that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals are in
compliance with this Section from this date forward. Correct by 8/16/21.



This inspection and exit briefing were conducted 8/9/21 with facility representatives.
