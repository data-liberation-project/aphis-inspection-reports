RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records for animals at hand containing required information on acquisition/disposition information of these were
found to be incomplete and/or missing. There were no records or information on the recent acquisition/disposition
of 10 rabbits, 8 sugar gliders, 3 guinea pigs and 2 marmosets. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records
or forms which fully and correctly disclose information concerning animals that were purchased or otherwise
acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is
transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include any
offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. The Record of Animals on
Hand (APHIS Form 7019) and Record of Acquisition, Disposition, or Transport of Animals (APHIS Form 7020) are
forms which may be used by the licensee to keep and maintain the information required by federal regulations. As
required by federal regulations, the licensee needs to obtain/document the pertinent information on the missing
transactions of the regulated animals identified above.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several wire ties located throughout the capuchin monkey's primary enclosure/cage had exposed sharp points and
edges, that were within reach of the regulated animal. Housing facilities for nonhuman primates (NHP's) must be
kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury and contain the animals securely. Primary
enclosures for any NHP's must be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animals. The licensee
immediately communicated the noncompliance to the store manager so it could be fixed. All exposed wire ties at
the primary enclosure/cage must be replaced and/or fixed to prevent the potential of an injury to the capuchin
monkey.
