FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 2-9-15, the male kangaroo was found dead outside its shed shelter door with the door tarp wrapped around its
neck. This tarp was used in previous winters and covered the approximately 3 foot by 5 foot cut in the wall of the
shed leading to the kangaroos indoor area. Use of a loose tarp, and the method in which it was attached to the
door led to injury and death of the kangaroo.
Upon arrival a black pygmy goat was seen easily going though a hole in the 6" X 6" wire fence along the drive.
Later two black pygmy goats were seen going through the hole. The fence needs to be repaired to where the
animals are always contained.
All facility structures are to be structurally sound and maintained in good repair in order to protect animals from
injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by 2-19-15.

WATERING.
A large black rubber water receptacle is in the enclosure housing 7 goats, 11 sheep, and one pot belly pig. Six
geese and a duck are also occupying this same enclosure and they are using this water receptacle as a pond.
Although the water was cleaned this morning, it is already brown from animals entering and possibly defecating in
the water. If these animals are going to be housed together, then a method needs to be in place to either keep the
geese out of the water, or provide a separate clean water receptacle for the other animals. The shorter pot belly pig
needs to be able to access the clean water also and not just drink the overflow on the ground.
To be corrected by 2-27-15.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
