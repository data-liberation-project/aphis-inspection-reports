2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
****There were 3 weaned puppies (1 Rottweiler & 2 Australian Shepherds) that were less than 16 weeks of age that
did not have any form of identification on them. Proper and accurate identification is required in order to ensure that
each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements for inventory,
disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The owner must identify all live regulated animals and assure
that records are kept at all times.
Identification can be done by having a cage card with the letters "USDA", the license number and the identification
number or with a collar with the same information or by implanting a microchip.
