ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Alice, a 9 year old black, white, and brown female Bassett Hound (had two microchip #'s, microchip #'s
4B7F2B3812 & 4A4A377639) had exceptionally long nails that were curling on all four paws. The worst nail on the
four paws was the left front dew claw which had curled to the point that it was only approximately a quarter of an
inch away from penetrating the pad. I estimate that if this nail is not trimmed, it will penetrate the pad within the next
week or two. Long untrimmed nails can be uncomfortable and sometimes even painful for the dogs. If the nails
penetrate the pad, it can become infected causing further complications. The dog's nails must be trimmed and
should be done so on a regular basis from here on out so as to prevent them from curling. Correct by 1/9/18.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
