WATERING.
Section 3.130 Watering: The water receptacles for the 19 skunks housed outside had debris around the edges and
some appeared to have a slight film over the water. The owner informed the APHIS official that the water
receptacles had not yet been cleaned today. The owner started to clean the water receptacles this afternoon during
the inspection. All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary for the health of the animals. Correct from
this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
