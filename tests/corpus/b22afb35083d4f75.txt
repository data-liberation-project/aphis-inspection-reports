ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1605 on
18-DEC-18. I went to the licensee's house. She was not home. The person who answered the door contacted the
licensee by phone. I spoke to the licensee over the phone. She was not going to be home anytime soon and would
not be able to do the inspection with me. I informer her I would send out the attempted inspection report letter and
that we would try again another day.
End of report.
