2.31(d)(1)(ii)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocols #208, #209, #202, #210, and #205, involve procedures that cause more than momentary or slight pain or
distress to animals (with the provision of anesthesia and/or analgesia), but these protocols do not include a written
narrative description of the methods or sources used to determine that alternatives were not available. Facility personnel
stated that literature searches for alternatives were no longer required as part of the facility’s protocol submission process
because in the past literature or database searches had not produced useful results.
Animals who experience more than momentary or slight pain or distress may experience discomfort, stress, pain, or fear.
The IACUC must ensure that alternatives are considered for procedures that cause more than momentary or slight pain or
distress to animals.
Correct by 09/30/2021 by ensuring that the IACUC requires investigators to document the methods and sources used to
determine that alternatives to painful or distressful procedures were not available. Corrections must be made for any
currently active protocols as well as for all future proposed activities.
2.31(d)(2) Critical

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)


The IACUC routinely uses a consultant (this individual is not a voting member of the IACUC) to review and approve
protocols.
Protocols #208, #209, #191, #210, and #205 involve more than momentary pain or distress with the provision of
anesthesia or analgesia. These protocols were approved only by the consultant and were not approved by full IACUC
review or by a designated voting member of the IACUC committee.
IACUC oversight of activities using animals is essential for ensuring animal welfare and compliance with the Animal
Welfare Act.
Correct by September 30th, 2021 by ensuring that the IACUC approval process is conducted in accordance with the
Animal Welfare Act regulations including having a member of the IACUC approve all active protocols.
2.31(d)(4)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC failed to notify the principal investigators (PIs) in writing of its decision to approve protocols #208, #209, #210,
#205, and #191.
Written notification of IACUC approval for proposed activities involving animals is important to maintain records regarding
which protocols and their amendments have been approved . IACUC functions as an oversight committee to help monitor
animal welfare in research and written records confirm the IACUC is functioning as required by the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct by 09/30/21 by ensuring all IACUC decisions regarding approval of proposed activities involving animals are
provided in writing to the principal investigators and the research facility. This written notification must include the
approval, the decision to withhold approval, and/or the decision to require modifications of proposed animal activities.

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).


Protocol #208 does not include a complete description of animal use. The protocol does not include details describing
anesthesia, surgery, or wound closure. The procedure states that the surgeon will laparoscopically remove the gall
bladder and kidney, and will perform a bowel resection, but does not include any further information about how these
procedures are done such as whether the surgery will be performed aseptically or the length of bowel resected. The
protocol then states that “the abdomen will then be opened to demonstrate an open laparotomy” but the location and size
of the incision is not described, and any tissue handling or manipulations performed during the open laparotomy are not
described. The protocol does not state if or how anesthesia will be monitored. An IACUC-approved SOP exists for
anesthesia, but is not referenced in protocol #208 and was not included as part of the protocol review process.
Protocol #205 states that paralytics are needed, but does not describe specific drugs or methods used to include
paralysis. Surgical prep and anesthesia monitoring are not described.
Protocol #209 does not include a complete description of animal use. The protocol states that “animals will be
anesthetized” but does not include information about anesthetic monitoring, intubation, or intra-operative thermal support
(all of which the facility does provide for animals on the protocol). Surgical preparation is not described.
Protocol #191 and #210 do not include information about intubation, surgical preparation, surgical technique, or aseptic
technique. Facility personnel stated that intubation, surgical preparation, and aseptic technique are used.
The facility’s “MERI Veterinary Standard Operating Procedure Manual” (rev 4/9/19) states that Principal Investigator will
provide “a detailed step-by-step description of the procedure to be performed”.
None of these protocols mention the use of IV catheters or administration of IV fluids, but these procedures are described
in the MERI Veterinary Standard Operating Procedure Manual (rev 4/9/19). It is unclear if these procedures are used in
any given protocol.
A full description of proposed activities involving animals (and any proposed changes to activities involving animals) is


required for the IACUC to be able to make an informed determination whether the proposed activities ensure the humane
and judicious use of animals in research.
Correct by ensuring proposals to conduct activities involving animals contain a complete description, in lay terms and in
detail, of the proposed use of the animals. Additionally, ensure that any of the protocols listed above for which activities
are still occurring or may occur in the future are amended to add a complete description of activities and resubmitted to
the IACUC for review and approval. Correct by 09/30/2021.
2.32(a)

Personnel qualifications.
The facility does not ensure training of staff, course instructors, or investigators on the topics of humane methods of
animal maintenance and experimentation; the concept, availability and use of methods to limit the use of animals or
minimize animal distress; proper use of anesthetics, analgesics, and tranquilizers; methods for reporting deficiencies in
animal care and treatment; and utilization of services available to provide information on alternatives to the use of live
animals in research and the intent and requirements of Animal Welfare Act.
Training personnel in the use of animals in research, ways to minimize pain and distress for animals, and the intent and
requirements of the Animal Welfare Act, is essential for ensuring animal welfare and compliance with the Animal Welfare
Act regulations. Personnel who do not have adequate training may fail to care for animals properly, may fail to consider
alternatives to painful or distressful procedures, and may fail to recognize or understand programmatic shortcomings
related to compliance with the Animal Welfare act.
Correct by 09/30/2021 by ensuring all people involved in animal care or research are trained in accordance with The
Animal Welfare Act, as described in 2.32(a).
