* Five enclosures, all housing 10 adult dogs, had an accumulation of fecal waste on the plastic flooring for the
outdoor portion of the enclosures. This indicates that daily spot-cleaning is not taking place. Without daily
spot-cleaning the disease hazards for the animals can increase.
For the prevention of an accumulation of excrement and reduction of disease hazards, all enclosures must be
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized as necessary.

* There was an accumulation of fecal waste underneath the outside portion of the enclosures, all housing 15 adult
dogs, for the main shelter kennel. When asked, the owner stated, that area was cleaned in the fall in spring. This
accumulation of waste can increase disease hazards, cause odors and attract pests and vermin.
For the reduction of disease hazards, odors, insects and pests and the prevention of an accumulation of fecal and
fluid waste, the underneath area of the enclosures must be cleaned more frequently.
