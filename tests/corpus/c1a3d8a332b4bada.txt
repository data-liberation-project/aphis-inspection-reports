3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are several inserts and walls on the inside of the kennel along the wall with outside runs that have a
moderate buildup of brown dirt/grime on the surfaces. There are approximately 8 whelping pens that have a large
buildup of brown dirt/grime on the wall surfaces. While the enclosures are cleaned daily, they need to be cleaned
and sanitized more often to prevent the buildup of the brown dirt and grime on the walls, door flaps and inserts.
A buildup of dirt and grime on the surfaces that come in contact with the dogs can be a source of bacteria and
possible health issue if not cleaned thoroughly and more often.
The licensee must increase the cleaning and sanitization program of the facility to prevent the buildup of dirt/grime
on the door flaps, inserts and wall surfaces.
