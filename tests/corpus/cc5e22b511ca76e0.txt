* A bottle of Oxytocin with an expiration date of November 2021 was in the cupboard storage area. This medication was
intermingled with other pharmaceuticals that are currently being used in the facility and are therefore ready for use. The
licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired and labeled properly in accordance with
standard veterinary practices and manufacturer's recommendations.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by April 1, 2022, or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
