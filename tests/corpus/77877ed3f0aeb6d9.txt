ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-An adult female Boston Terrier (OAO2617666/OAO2057825), housed by herself, was holding her left rear leg up
and not bearing any weight on it. According to the licensee, he had noticed the dog’s condition on Monday (20 Mar
17). On closer observation, one of the middle digital pads on the dog’s left rear foot had a lesion on it. The pad
appeared to be lacerated in a linear fashion (approximately ¾ inch in length) near its edge and the affected area
was reddened. According to the licensee, the dog was under observation but the dog had not been examined by a
veterinarian nor was the dog receiving any treatment. This dog’s condition could be due to injury, infection and/or
other veterinary medical condition which could be painful.
-An adult female chocolate Labrador Retriever (4B5D1F5F16) had an approximately 1 ½ inch diameter region of
hair loss on its left side. The skin in this area appeared dry and flakey with reddened regions. According to a facility
representative, the dog’s area of hair loss had been larger and had appeared after the dog whelped which was
approximately 2 months ago. The facility representative stated that a treatment had been given to the dog when the
condition was initially identified but could not remember what the treatment was that was given. No treatment was
being given for the current skin condition. The licensee stated that the dog did receive routine monthly ivermectin.
There was no written documentation regarding this dog’s condition at the facility. The hair loss and skin condition
could be due to parasites, allergies or other veterinary medical condition which could cause discomfort.
-An adult female chocolate Labrador Retriever (4B613887116) had an abnormal eye condition. The dog’s left eye
appeared slightly larger than the right eye. The left eye appeared mostly dilated with very little of the iris visible. A
line of clear discharge was observed in the corner of the dog’s left eye extending down the dog’s nose toward the
mouth. The part of the eye that is normally white was slightly reddened with several vessels compared to the right
eye. There appeared to be a portion of a large spherical-like object (possibly a displaced lens) within the eye and a
small section of a bright reflection visible from within the top portion of the eye. According to the licensee, a
veterinarian had last examined the dog around November 2016. There was no written documentation of the dog’s
current eye condition. This dog’s eye condition could be due to injury, mass and/or other veterinary medical
condition which could be painful and/or lead to blindness.
The licensee must have the female Boston Terrier (OAO2617666/OAO2057825) and the female chocolate Labrador
Retriever (4B613887116) examined by a veterinarian. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian
regarding the condition of the female chocolate Labrador Retriever (4B5D1F5F16). These veterinary examinations
and the consultation are in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are made and that appropriate treatment plansare developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and provide it to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.4(b)(4) DIRECT REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In several of the outdoor enclosures the majority of the shelters, affecting 14 dogs, did not have enough bedding
provided. In two of the outdoor shelters, which contained no bedding, a facility representative stated that he
“removed the bedding yesterday” (21 Mar 17). There was bare floor visible in the rest of the affected shelters
containing insufficient bedding. In one of the outdoor shelters the bedding provided was wet. The overnight low
temperature for the area was recorded to be 30 degrees Fahrenheit, (NOAAweather.gov). The temperature close
to the end of the inspection (2:55pm) was recorded to be 48.5 degrees Fahrenheit, measured with a Kestrel 3000.
Cold temperatures and lack of bedding or enough bedding does not provide adequate insulation properties that
allow the dogs to stay warm during cold weather and could have a negative health impact on the dog. Wet bedding
does not provide adequate insulation properties that allow the dogs to stay warm during cold weather and could
have a negative impact on their health. When the outdoor temperature drops below 50 degrees Fahrenheit the dogs
must be provided with clean, dry bedding. When the temperature drops below 35 degrees Fahrenheit the dogs
must be provided with additional clean, dry bedding, enough so that dogs can burrow down into it to stay warm. The
licensee was verbally instructed to provide clean dry bedding to all outdoor shelters by the end of the day. (22 Mar

3.9(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food in 3 of the outdoor self-feeders, affecting 6 dogs, has become contaminated with rodent droppings and/or
dog feces. In the mouth of one of these feeders there was a large, walnut sized clump of a light brown colored
material, possibly old dried caked food. The dogs in these enclosures could not eat the food without eating the
contaminated food. Contaminated food can decrease the dog's acceptance of the food and can increase the risk of
disease and health hazards. The licensee needs to remove the contaminated feed to protect the health and
well-being of the dogs. The licensee needs to establish and maintain a program to ensure that food is protected
from contamination and that measures are taken to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration and caking of feed
at all times.
3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
All of the outdoor self feeders, affecting 39 dogs, are dirty. The trough areas of the these self feeders have an
accumulation of hair, dirt, grime and other organic material. This build up of hair, dirt, grime and other organic
material comes in contact with the dogs’ food, which can contaminate the food and harm the dogs. When the
inspector removed the lid covering the used part of some of the feeders there were spiders, egg sacs, and spiderwebs present. The licensee must ensure self-feeders are cleaned and sanitized at least every two weeks or more
often if necessary.
3.11(d) DIRECT REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In all of the outdoor enclosures, affecting 36 dogs, the large converted hog feeders have a large amount of rodent
droppings, bird droppings, and spiders on and/or inside of them. A large portion of the inside area of these feeders
has been sectioned off by the licensee to reduce the overall area used as self-feeders for the dogs. The inside of
the unused sections of these feeders, which are not covered, have a significant amount of spillage of food from the
used covered sections; there is a large amount of rodent and bird droppings mixed with the spilled food inside the
unused sections. The unused trough areas of the associated sectioned off feeders are generally covered with
wooden boards and when uncovered by the inspector or facility representative there is a significant amount of
rodent droppings present. The unused trough areas are directly adjacent to the used troughs. When the inspector
removed the lid covering the used storage part of some of the feeders there were spiders, egg sacs, and spider
webs present. When questioned by the inspector as to what he was using for pest control, the licensee said that he
has placed rodent bait bars throughout the facility. Birds and bird droppings, rodent and rodent droppings can
transmit diseases and parasites to the dogs. Spiders can bite the dogs and cause pain or potential medical issues.
The licensee must establish and maintain a safe and effective pest control program to protect the health of the
dogs.
The inspection was conducted with the licensee and facility representatives. An exit interview was conducted with
the licensee on 23 Mar 17.
