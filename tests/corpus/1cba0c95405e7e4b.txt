Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
In a free-flight bat room, inspectors saw a dead bat in the folds of one of the roosting tarps. This bat appeared to be
desiccated and was readily visible without the inspector having to move the tarps.
Effective daily observations allow the facility to assess the health of the animals. Failure to observe medical problems,
including animal deaths, can result in prolonged illness and pain of individual animals and undetected colony/herd health
concerns. The facility must observe all animals daily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent communication
with the attending veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of health, behavior, and well-being are
conveyed and so that the medical conditions of the animals can be evaluated by the veterinarian.

Sanitation.
-There is an accumulation of feces in the veterinary teaching horse enclosure that covers a majority of the pasture as well
as the floor of the shelter structure.
-There is an accumulation of feces in the veterinary teaching sheep pen that covers a majority of the shelter floor and
enclosure. There is also a large pile of feces and deteriorating hay that has been raked up for collection but remains
within the enclosure.


-There is an accumulation of feces in the veterinary teaching sheep barn pasture that covers a majority of the shelter
floors and enclosure.
-There is an accumulation of feces in both ARBL sheep pens that covers the entirety of the shelter area and more than
half of the enclosure. The caretaker for this area said that the pens had not been cleaned since November.
-There is an accumulation of fresh and deteriorating feces in the teaching mare pasture at the Equine Repro Lab that
covers the floor of the shelter, the feeding area, and the rest of the enclosure. There is also a large pile of feces and
deteriorating hay that has been raked up for collection but remains within the enclosure.
Accumulations of excreta are especially of concern when they occupy an animal's shelter structure or interfere with its
access to food and water sources. These areas also attract pests and can play a role in disease transmission. The
registrant must ensure that excreta be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination
of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and odors.

This inspection was conducted from 2/15/22 to 2/17/22 and the exit interview was conducted on 2/17/22 with facility
representatives.
