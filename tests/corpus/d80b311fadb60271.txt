ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were several telephone communications between the licensee and or staff and the attending veterinarian on
this sick female St Bernard puppy. The attending veterinarian gave instructions to administer antibiotics and
nebulizer treatments. The written program of veterinary care does not state what treatments that can be provided
to its animals by the licensee and or staff. There needs to be written protocols added to the written program of
veterinary care on what treatment is allowed by this licensee and or staff, including names of who are
knowledgeable and experienced with each species to ensure adequate veterinarian care is provided in a timely
manner. There needs to be additional oversight by this licensee and his staff to ensure all animals are receiving
adequate vet care and this should be included in the written program of veterinarian care. Puppies that are newly
acquired, some with kennel cough are immediately housed in the same area with other puppies. To prevent the
spread of kennel cough and other potential illnesses and other diseases, protocols on quarantine procedures need
to be added to the written program of veterinarian care and followed.
Each dealer shall have an attending veterinarian who shall provide adequate veterinary care to its animals in
compliance with this section. Each dealer shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the
case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a
written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).During this inspection on August 19, 2015, at approximately 1 p.m, I observed a female St. Bernard laying in an
enclosure with labored breathing. This puppy was located the back room where puppies are placed under medical
care. I asked both care takers present what the health issue with this puppy was. They stated about a week ago a
few days after arriving at the pet shop she showed signs of kennel cough. That she was being treated with
antibiotics and just gave her a nebulizer treatment. I asked the care takers how long this puppy was having difficult
breathing and if she been eating and they stated a few days and was not eating much today. One of the care
takers stated that she will be OK, that she would be seen by the attending vets normal routine visit on tomorrow,
August 20, 2015. I immediately approached the licensee and he was aware of this puppy being treated, however
was unaware of the labored breathing. This puppy was immediately taken by the male licensee to a veterinary clinic
and admitted overnight for pneumonia.
On August 24, 2015, I returned to this pet shop and obtained information by both licensees and confirmed with the
attending veterinarian's by her phone message that attending she was notified by phone by the kennel manager on
several occasions and prescribed antibiotics initially then added nebuizer treatments. The female licensee stated
she was involved with the treatment and the puppy was doing well, but was unaware of this puppy heavy breathing
and health worsened. I was unable to confirm if the attending veterinarian was aware that this puppy was was
having difficulty breathing as I observed during the August 19, 2015 inspection. New puppies arriving at this pet
shop are placed near other puppies which may or may not have kennel cough. So there is minimal spread of
illness; kennel cough and other possible communicable diseases, there needs to be a quarantine protocol in place.
During the inspection on August 24, 2015, I observed the St. Bernard puppy and she appears to be recovering,
doing well and is continuing treatment.
This St. Bernard puppy was not given adequate veterinary care in a timely manner and should have been seen by a
veterinarian when the staff observed her with labored breathing. It was evident that instead of taking this sick puppy
to the veterinarian in a timely manner, it was waiting to be seen when the attending veterinarian was to visit on
August 20, 2015. The licensees stated that there will be additional oversight and their animals will be seen in a
timely manner.
Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include: The use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend,
and holiday care.
