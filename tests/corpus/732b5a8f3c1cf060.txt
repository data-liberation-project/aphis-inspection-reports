2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There were no records of the current number of guinea pigs on hand at the facility except for the number of
weanlings. Records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the number of
animals held, owned, acquired and disposed of are necessary in order to accurately track animals used in regulated
activities to ensure their humane care. Failure to keep records can make it difficult to identify animal losses from
death or disease in the facility that affects the number of offspring born. License must keep and maintain records
for animals held, owned, acquired or born to help keep track of guinea pigs. Correct by March 19, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
