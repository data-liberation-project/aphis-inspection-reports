3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some enclosures for dogs and one cat enclosure had excessive rust on the surfaces within the enclosure. In one
cat enclosure there were areas of rust measuring approximated three square inches in diameter. Significant rust
was documented in three dog runs, primarily on the bottom structural support pipe just behind the chainlink fencing
that holds the bottom edge of the dividing wall between enclosures. Two of these were rusted all the way through,
with part of the pipe missing.
Enclosures for dogs and cats must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or
that affects the structural strength of the surface.
Animals were removed from the affected enclosures at the time of inspection. To be corrected from this time
forward.
3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In several dog runs, and one cat enclosure, there were sharp metal points or jagged edges observed that could
potentially injure the animals.
- Two dog enclosures had a metal sheet covering part of the wall of the enclosure with a corner folded up creating a
sharp point.
- One social cat enclosure had a large gap in the metal covering the wall just behind their enclosure that was close
enough to the cats that they could potentially reach through the chain-link fencing and touch the jagged edges of
the bent, damaged metal.
- Two adjacent dog runs had undergone a patching repair of the floor grate, but the patch was comprised of metal
grate material that had been cut so that it had some sharp pointy edges, and this was now under the feet of the
dogs.
Primary enclosures for dogs and cats must be free of sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs and cats.Animals were removed from enclosures and issues were addressed at the time of inspection. To be corrected from
this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
