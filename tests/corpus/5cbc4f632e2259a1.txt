FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a hole with a rough, splintered edge in the wood board lining the wall of a jaguar enclosure. There is an
exposed drainage pipe on the ground of the zebra enclosure. The opening of this pipe has a broken edge. Both of
these could cause injury to the animals contained in the enclosures. The facility must be constructed of such
material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall
be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Rabbits intended for feeding are being stored uncovered in the walk-in freezer. One rabbit was under the freezer
fan. A leak from the fan system has caused a large amount of ice to accumulate on the rabbit. Contamination and
deterioration of food can cause decreased nutritive value. The licensee must ensure that supplies of food and
bedding be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding, or
contamination by vermin.
