ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Written Program of Veterinary Care.
1. The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) dated 5/5/14 available for review was incomplete. New species of
animals have been acquired by the Licensee since the PVC was prepared (skunk, sugar gliders, fennec fox, and
degu) but none of these species of animals are mentioned in the PVC. In addition, insufficient detail is provided for
the methods of routine parasite control to be used for the animals (drug, dose, route of administration).
Per this Section of the Regulations, the written PVC should include complete information about the methods to be
used to prevent and control diseases for each species of animal held by the licensee (including vaccines routinely
administered and any other recommended health practices), and should be updated whenever new species of
animals are added or whenever changes to recommended methods are made.
The written PVC needs to be updated to reflect the new species of animals and to include the additional details of
recommended medical care.
Correct by 10/31/16.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records for Animals other than Dogs and Cats.
1. The acquisition and disposition records were not current. There were at least 7 animals that have either been
acquired (2 chinchillas, 1 skunk, 1 fennec fox, and 2 hedgehogs) or have left the facility (1 ferret) since the last
inspection but there was no information recorded for these animal transactions.
Per this Section of the Regulations, exhibitors shall make and maintain complete records regarding the details of the
acquisition and disposition of animals in their possession in order to account for all animal transfers and the sourcesof the animals.
The Licensee needs to ensure that the complete acquisition or disposition information is recorded for these 7
animals as well as for all future animal transactions.
Correct by 10/1/16.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Indoor housing facilities.
***The skunk is being housed in a pen that has sides made using a flexible metal fencing for the front and
right-hand sides, and the corner walls of the animal room make up the left-hand and back sides; the floor of the pen
is the wall-to-wall carpet that covers the floor of the animal room. The carpet next to the walls inside the skunk’s
enclosure has been pulled up and and away from the wall and there are strings of carpet material present along the
edges of the carpet, and the skunk has been using the surface of the carpet to urinate and defecate on. In addition,
there is an uncovered electrical outlet on the wall inside the pen at a level that is accessible to the skunk.
Per this Section of the Regulations, indoor housing facilities should be constructed of material appropriate for the
animals and should be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
Wall-to-wall carpet is not an appropriate substrate for the floor of an enclosure for a skunk. Skunks have strong
forelegs and long nails that make them excellent diggers who dig holes in the search of food when they do not live
in captivity. The frayed edges of the carpet pose a hazard to the animal if ingested and the carpet cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized. An uncovered electrical outlet that is accessible to the animal when inside its enclosure can
lead to an electrical shock.
The Licensee needs to: (#1) modify the skunk’s enclosure to ensure the safety of the animal and to ensure that the
enclosure can be readily cleaned and sanitized until (#2) a new enclosure can be built that is more appropriate for
this species of animal.
Correct (#1) by 10/1/16 and Correct (#2) by 10/31/16.
***The fabric hammock inside the degu enclosure was noted to be excessively worn from chewing by the animal
and had some frayed edges and holes that pose a hazard to the animal from ingestion of the frayed fabric fibers or
from possible entrapment of a limb.
Per this Section of the Regulations, indoor housing facilities should be constructed of material appropriate for theanimals and should be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
The hammock needs to be removed from the enclosure and if a new hammock is provided, it should be removed or
replaced when it is worn.
Correct immediately.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures.
1. There was an excessive accumulation of fecal material present on the horizontal surfaces of the enclosure
housing 2 chinchillas as well as present on the floor of the animal room extending to an area about 12 inches wide
around the base of the chinchillas' enclosure.
Per this Section of the Regulations, excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to
minimize disease hazards, to prevent contamination of the animals, and to keep the premises clean.
The chinchilla enclosure and the floor of the animal room need to be cleaned, and excreta needs to be removed
from both the enclosure and the floor of the room on a more frequent basis for the health of the animals.
Correct immediately.
