2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following dogs are in need of veterinary care:
* One white colored adult Schnauzer ( collar number 23), one fawn and white colored adult female Italian
Greyhound ( tattoo number 135), one blue and white adult female Italian Greyhound ( tattoo number 139) and one
red colored adult male Dachshund ( No identification) have an accumulation of dark brown material coating the
entire surface of the upper cheek teeth. There was a creamy white discharge along the gum line. The gum line is
red and swollen and has receded away from the upper cheek teeth. These signs are consistent with the presence
of dental disease. The buildup of abnormal material on teeth with a discharge at the gum line can be painful. It can
impact the ability of the dog to eat, affecting the health and well-being of the dog. Dental disease can be painful,
lead to a decrease in appetite and infection in the mouth.
* The hind limbs of one blue and white adult female Italian Greyhound (tattoo number 139) appeared abnormal.
While standing and in motion, the animal did not extend its knee joint normally, if at all. The dog appeared to hop
around on its hind limbs with the knee joint at an approximate 90 degree angle. When asked, the licensee stated
that she was unaware any dogs in the enclosure had any issues. When this dog was brought to her attention by the
VMO, the licensee stated (cid:28)it(cid:25)s probably luxated patellas(cid:29). The VMO asked the licensee again if this dog has been
evaluated by a veterinarian for the condition, and she responded (cid:28)No(cid:29). Abnormal limb conformations and abnormal
mobility can be indicators of disease and often pain. These conditions can result from numerous causes including
both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and
treatment can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.
* The eyes of one blue and white adult female Italian Greyhound (tattoo number 436) appeared abnormal.
Approximately half of the iris, in both the right and left eyes, have a milky-white, thickened opaque area.
Additionally, the sclera of both eyes appeared abnormally red. When asked, the licensee stated this animal has not
been evaluated by a veterinarian. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, allergies,
injury, irritation or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing. Furthermore, not having clear vision
can cause discomfort affecting the health and well-being of the dog and has the potential for injury.* One red colored adult male Dachshund (no identification) sustained injuries to its left ear and received no
treatment. According to the licensee, approximately two weeks ago, she put this male dog into an enclosure with
another male dog. This male dog sustained several bite wounds to the left ear and the licensee separated the two
dogs. The licensee did not contact her veterinarian regarding the wounds and the animal received no treatment.
Injuries that are not treated appropriately maybe painful and can lead to prolonged suffering, infection, and other
veterinary care problems.
The licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on November 20, 2015, to obtain
accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation
must be provided to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all
diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed
along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when
the medication is administered to the animals.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each
animal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and
the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate
veterinary care, as prescribed by the attending veterinarian. The program for providing adequate veterinary care
shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
**************************************************
* One white colored adult Schnauzer ( collar number 23) has matted hair on the abdomen and both back legs,
covering approximately 30 percent of the body. The hair was heavily clumped and corded and to the point that the
skin could be visualized. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris and moisture affecting the
skin. It can foster skin infections and affect the animal's mobility. Matted hair does not maintain the same insulating
qualities of normally groomed hair. The licensee must remove all matted hair and establish an effective program for
coat maintenance for the health and welfare of the dog. The dog was groomed during the inspection.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The lower wood edge of two enclosure entryways and the interior wood wall of two sheltered structures are
showing bare and deteriorated wood that is no longer impervious to moisture. Four dogs are in contact with the
affected surfaces located in sheltered housing. Bare, deteriorated wood surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and
sanitized on a regular basis. The licensee must ensure all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis and any
surface that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. Correct by 12/17/15.3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta on two fiberglass entryway doors and on the interior walls of
two enclosures. Eight dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in indoor and sheltered housing. The
affected area covers approximately 25 to 30 percent of the interior wall area and 30 to 40 percent of the fiberglass
entryway doors. Daily cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease
hazards. Unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or health risks. The licensee must
ensure that all surfaces are spot cleaned on a daily basis and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b) to prevent
accumulations of excreta and reduce disease hazards. Correct by 11/18/19.

3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* Dust was accumulating on several metal enclosure panels and on the top of one metal lamp protector. Eighteen
dogs are in contact with the affected areas located in the west indoor building. The accumulations of dust create an
unsanitary living condition that could impact the health and welfare of the dogs. All buildings and surrounding
grounds must be kept clean to facilitate required husbandry practices and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living
areas for rodents, other pests and vermin. The licensee must ensure that the premises must be kept free of
accumulations of trash, junk, waste products and discarded matter to protect the health and well-being of the
animals.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 11/17/15 were conducted with the licensee, Dr. Aaron Rhyner
VMO and Robert Bacon ACI.
