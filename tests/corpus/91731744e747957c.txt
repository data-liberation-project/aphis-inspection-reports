Veterinary care for dogs.
A current written Program of Veterinary Care for Dogs has not been completed and made available for review at time of
inspection. The licensee stated they have been using a new attending veterinarian for the past several months for the
care of the dogs. The review of this document is necessary to ensure that the facility is addressing the requirements in
this section of the Animal Welfare Act and that the facility is following the instructions for animal care given by the
attending veterinarian. The facility must develop, keep and maintain the signed, written program of veterinary care for
dogs and make it available for APHIS inspection.
