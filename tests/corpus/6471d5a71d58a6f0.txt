RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The sale records (Record of Acquisition, Disposition or Transport of Animals APHIS form 7020) are not filled out
completely. The species of animals (such as guinea pig) were not listed on the majority of the sale forms since the
inspection report dated February 25, 2014. The transportation method was not listed on most of the sale records to
determine if the buyer or dealer transported the animals. The sale forms must include the number and species in
the shipment and the method of transport (such as buyer's truck or dealer's truck) to document changes in
ownership. Dealers must keep the required records so the information is available to track animal shipments when
necessary for health and regulatory purposes.
Correct from this day forward.

WATERING.
There were accumulations of feces, dirt and brown debris by some of the automatic water valves especially
underneath the valve along the PVC drainpipe. These accumulations around the water valves expose the guinea
pigs to potential disease infections with bacterial, fungi and parasites. Water receptacles such as automatic water
delivery lines must be cleaned and sanitized whenever dirty and at least once every two weeks. Inadequate
cleaning of the automatic water valves can result in contamination of the guinea pigs in the same enclosure and
located in lower enclosures from those above. Licensee must establish and maintain a program to keep the water
valves sanitized when dirty, and must be sanitized at least
once every two weeks.
