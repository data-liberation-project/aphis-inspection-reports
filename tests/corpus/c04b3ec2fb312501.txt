ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were dry, whitish crusts almost completely covering the insides of both ears of the brown rabbit named
Crookneck. Crusting was also present on the outside base of the rabbit's left ear. Crookneck also had a small
amount of white, thick discharge at the inside corner of his right eye. His left eye was mostly held shut with some
wet matting present around the eye. It was explained that the eye discharge had first been noticed 2 days ago but
the crusting had started 2-3 weeks ago. The owner treated with an over the counter rabbit medication but the
condition did not improve. The owner noted that Crookneck has had this problem several times in the past and it
typically improves with treatment. He has had a head tilt ever since he was acquired. A veterinarian has not yet
been consulted about his condition. Ear infestations and untreated eye infections can cause significant discomfort to
animals.
The goat named Mariah was observed to be very thin, with sternum (chest bone), ribs, spinal bones and hip bones
protruding (visible under skin and readily palpable). Her hair coat was also somewhat unkempt with some hairloss
around her lower back. It was explained that she had become thin several months ago when a companion passed
away and has failed to gain weight despite eating what is observed to be a normal amount, getting turned out to
graze more often than the other goats, and receiving probiotic medications. The owner has been working to resolve
her condition but Mariah does not seem to be improving. A veterinarian has not yet been consulted about her
condition. Weight loss can significantly weaken animals and may indicate a serious underlying condition (for
example, heavy parasitic infestation or systemic disease).
A veterinarian must be consulted when animal health problems arise, especially if the animal's condition does not
improve with home nursing care. Animals with serious health concerns including significant weight loss, eye
problems, and chronic parasite infestations should be physically evaluated by a veterniarian to ensure that the
condition does not become worse or start to cause the animal distress. Appropriate and timely diagnosis, treatment,
and control of animal health issues can also prevent the problem from recurring or affecting other animals. Affected
animals: 1 rabbit, 1 goat.

SANITATION.
There was an excessive amount of fecal material in the wire bottom primary enclosure of a white long-haired and
black long-haired rabbit (2 rabbits). Feces were covering at least 75% of the cage bottom and the rabbits were not
able to move within the cage without standing on the feces. It was explained that the enclosure had not been
cleaned in several weeks as it was suspected the rabbits might be pregnant. Though the rabbits did not turn out to
be pregnant, fur pulling by the rabbits contributed to the caking and quick buildup of feces at the bottom of the
enclosure. Excessive feces within an animal enclosure can attract and harbor pests and/or micro-organisms. This
can lead to disease and infestation (for example flies, bacteria, or foot diseases). Primary enclosures shall be kept
reasonably free of excreta, hair, and cobwebs by periodic cleaning at least once a week.
*The rabbits were moved the day after inspection 5/13/14 and the enclosure was cleaned.
3.56(c)
SANITATION.
There was an empty enclosure directly above the enclosure with the two long haired rabbits that contained an
excessive amount (2-3 inches) of dried chicken feces covering the wire bottom of the enclosure and solid tray
underneath. It was explained that chickens used to roost in this area but were not currently housed there. Poultry
feces can attract pests (flies, parasites, bacteria) which could affect the rabbits directly below, especially if the feces
were to fall into the rabbits' enclosure. Areas around the rabbit enclosures shall be kept clean in order to protect the
animals from illness and infestation. Affected animals: 2 rabbits.
Owner had corrected by 5/13/14, day after inspection.
There was an excessive amount of rabbit feces covering the ground under the wire bottom cages. Rabbit feces and
urine can attract pests (flies, parasites, bacteria) which can affect rabbits in the cages above. Areas around the
rabbit enclosures shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals from illness and infestation. Affected animals:
21 rabbits.
Owner had corrected by 5/13/14, day after inspection.3.130
WATERING.
In the pen with the lamb, all the water in the water receptacles is murky and green in color. It was explained that the
goose bathes in all the water receptacles, even if bathing troughs and multiple buckets are provided for the lamb.
The owner stated that the water is changed as often as once a day. Ingestion of contaminated water can lead to
illness including gastrointestinal disease and dehydration (if the animal does not want to drink). Animals should be
provided clean water as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal, and all water receptacles shall
be kept clean and sanitary. Affected animals: 1 sheep.
Correct by 5/14/14.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Authorized Person.
