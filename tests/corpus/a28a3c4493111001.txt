ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** An adult Dorset sheep was found with excessively long feet. All four feet on this animal are in need of trimming,
especially the right rear which was curled upward and twisted. The animal did not appear to have any
abnormalities in its gait. Excessively long feet can lead to pain while walking or abnormal gait which can lead to
joint problems in the animal. The licensee stated that she is aware of the long feet and had planned to trim the feet
at the same time as shearing the sheep but it has been delayed due to weather. Correct this by trimming and
maintaining this animal's feet.
