Personnel qualifications.
In January 2022 facility personnel reported several concerns to the IACUC regarding the care of cows at the farm
campus. The IACUC conducted an investigation and determined that there were lapses in recordkeeping and the care of
some animals, failure of the investigator to adhere to the IACUC approved protocols including performing procedures on
the animals that were not included in the IACUC approved protocol, and unfamiliarity of the investigator on the contents of
the protocols and the protocol requirements of the AWA. There were no adverse effects experienced by the animals.

Per this Section, it shall be the responsibility of a research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians,
animal technicians, and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties.
This requirement ensures that laboratory staff follow the IACUC approved protocols and that research animals receive
proper care.

In response to this incident, the IACUC conducted an investigation and implemented corrective measures to prevent
recurrence including but not limited to providing supplemental refresher training to the investigator and farm staff on:
institutional standard operating procedures, protocol requirements under the AWA, the need to follow the IACUC


approved protocols, and the institutional recordkeeping requirements. There have not been any additional incidents.
Corrected prior to the inspection.

Facilities, general.
Two of the stalls in the barn at the farm were noted to have several gaps between adjacent boards of wood in the walls at
floor level of the stalls. The gap in the goat stall was approximately 5/8” in width and the gap in the sheep stall was
approximately 1 ½” in width; these gaps were at least 12” in length. Daylight and grass were visible through these gaps
and the gaps directly communicated with the outside.

Per this Section, indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. The size
of these gaps provides a means of entry into the animal stalls for rodents as well as cold air, rain, or snow and need to be
addressed by the research facility to maintain the animal pens in good repair. Correct by 12/1/22.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
