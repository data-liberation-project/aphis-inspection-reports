2.31(d)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Review of protocol E045005-11 (VET320) and associated records showed that the protocol was approved via an
electronic polling of all IACUC members. The Assessment Coordinator (non-IACUC member) sent a copy of the
protocol to each IACUC member and asked them to respond via email whether they approved the protocol or had
any concerns. A copy of each IACUC member's email approval was documented. The use of electronic polling of all
IACUC members for protocol review is not an accepted method under the Animal Welfare Act. Protocols may only
be approved via designated member review or full committee review. Protocol E045005-11 shall be approved by the
IACUC via an approved method. Correct by Nov. 15, 2017.
2.31(d)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol E045005-11 was approved by the IACUC on 5-13-17 according to IACUC records reviewed. However,
there was no written documentation/letter on file addressed to the principal investigators notifying them that their
protocol was approved by the IACUC. This approval letter serves to notify the principal investigators that their
protocol was approved and that activities related to the care and use of animals may begin. Correct by notifying the
principal investigators in writing of the decision to approve or withhold approval of the activities or of modifications
required to secure approval. Correct by Nov. 30, 2017.
