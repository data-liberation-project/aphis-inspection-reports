3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
A male Bichon Frise jumped over the wall in the outdoor run and was observed outside the kennel not in an enclosure.
The walls are approximately 5 feet high but the overhang that prevents dogs from jumping over had blown off in a
windstorm a few days ago and not yet been repaired. The licensee replaced the dog into an outdoor run that had a
temporary repair with a strip of material across the top to deter jumping.
Failure to provide housing that contains the animals can lead to animal escape, injury, and death.
Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury, and contain the animals securely.
