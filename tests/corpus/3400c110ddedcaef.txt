ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1659 on
16-Oct-17. I went to the licensee's house. A relative informed me the licensee wasn't home and he wouldn't be
home for some time. I told her I would try back another time.
End of report.
