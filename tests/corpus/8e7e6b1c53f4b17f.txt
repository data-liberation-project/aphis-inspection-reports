2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the "Reefer" housing units, there were two dogs that had severe dental conditions that had not been addressed
by a licensed veterinarian.
***There was a male brown, long-haired Dachshund (#089*514*076) which had generalized reddened, receded and
swollen gums. Some teeth were missing on both the upper and lower jaws. On the left side of the dog's mouth,
majority of upper and lower canine teeth were covered by a hard yellowish-brown to gray substance. The lower
cheek teeth were covered in yellow greyish-black material. In the front of the mouth, the upper teeth were covered
by brownish gray film that extended from gum line to at least halfway down the tooth. Between those teeth, there
was a lump (approximately the size of a small chick pea) protruding from the gum line. The bottom front teeth had
some brownish-black staining primarily at the gum line. On the right side of the dog's mouth, there was a buildup of
gray and brownish-yellow colored hardened material on the upper and lower cheek teeth. This abnormal build-up of
material covered the majority of the bottom teeth and extended into the gum line as well as completely wrapped
around the upper cheek teeth.
***There was a male Yorkshire Terrier (#0A106D7B62) with wet fur surrounding his mouth, with what appears to be
saliva, covering the top of the nose to the bottom of the jaw. The dog's breath had a foul odor when his mouth was
opened. Within the dog's mouth, the inside of the cheeks were swollen and had a generalized grayish-black
discoloration. On the right side of the dog'(cid:25)s mouth, the upper cheek teeth were extensively covered by grayish-tan
colored material that extended from the gum line to the point of the teeth. In the front of the mouth, the upper teeth
were covered in a black material at the gum line and covered in a grayish-tan material on the body of the teeth.
There was some gray liquid (film) on the incisors (front teeth). The canine teeth appeared to be worn down.
However, the teeth on the bottom jaw were unable to be clearly seen during inspection. On the left side of the
mouth, the upper cheek teeth were wrapped completely with a grayish-tan material that extended from bottom of the
tooth to just below the receded gum line.
Chronic dental conditions could lead to more severe disease such as gingivitis and/or periodontal disease. These
conditions could be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health
of the animal. The licensee must have these animals'(cid:25) mouths and teeth examined by a licensed veterinarian inorder to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate dental treatment plan is developed and
followed. The licensee must develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the overall program
of veterinary care for the animals in the facility.

Several dogs throughout the premises had excessively long nails.
***In the "Castle", there was a female gray Weimaraner and female Golden Retriever with long nails.
***In the "Shed" enclosure, there was a female Basset Hound (#086*377*592) with long nails affecting the normal
conformation of her front paws. Excessive long nails can interfere with a dog'(cid:25)s normal gait or conformation thus
affecting the animals' health and overall well-being. The licensee must ensure that animals' nails are trimmed and
are following an appropriate nail trimming program.
