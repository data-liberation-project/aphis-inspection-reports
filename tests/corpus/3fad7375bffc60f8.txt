to the dogs. Sharp edges on metal can result in lacerations and injury to the dogs.

pests such as mice and flies which could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.

Trash containers in housing facilities must be leak-proof containers with tightly fitted lids. The licensee must add a tightly
fitted lid to the trash cans and ensure these lids remain in place at all times. The licensee removed the affected trash cans
from the buildings at the time of the inspection.
