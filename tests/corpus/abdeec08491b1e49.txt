3.25(a)

Facilities, general.
Although the side walls measured 7 inches in height, during the inspection, one guinea pig was observed to be out of its
enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times and does not allow them to escape.
Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
