SANITATION.
Rabbit enclosure closest to gate had a build up of excreta, especially in the corners. Primary enclosures shall be
kept reasonably free of excreta, hair, cobwebs, and other debris by periodic cleaning. The cleaning schedule for
this enclosure is inadequate, as evidenced by the build up present. The cleaning schedule of this rabbit enclosure
should be more effective to prevent the build up of excreta.
Corrected during the inspection.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was a plastic food bucket with a large cutout opening on the lid. This bucket contained timothy pellets used
to refill public feed dispensers and remains in the food storage area not adequately covered. Food must be stored
in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. An improved system of
food storage must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
