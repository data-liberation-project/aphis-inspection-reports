PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Within the sheltered facility there is an enclosure containing an adult female Chihuahua identified by (microchip
092-263-771) and four puppies. A black and white puppy and a red puppy have climbed out of the whelping box and
are having difficulty walking on the coated wire flooring. Their feet and legs are passing through the openings in the
flooring. The puppies were placed back in the whelping box at the time of inspection. The facility representative
stated the dogs could be moved to an enclosure with smaller openings in the flooring.
Flooring that allows the feet and legs to pass through any openings can be stressful and could lead to possible
injury to the puppies. The risk for potential injury to the feet or legs exist if the puppies cannot or has to struggle to
bring its feet or legs back through openings in the flooring. The openings in the wire flooring must be small enough
so that no feet or legs can pass through.
