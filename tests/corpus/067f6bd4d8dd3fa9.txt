3.6(c)(1)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The primary enclosure for an adult, male, apricot-colored Husky only provided about 4 inches of head space. The
exhibitor stated that the dogs had grown since he acquired them. Adequate space is necessary to provide room for
normal postural movements. The licensee must provide an enclosure that is at least 6 inches higher than the head
of the tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position.
TO BE CORRECTED BY APRIL 11, 2015.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted by Konnie Plumlee-VMO and Katy Vernon-ACI with the
exhibitor.
