Facilities, general.
Several sugar glider enclosures showed a large amount of rust on the metal wires of the enclosure floors and sides. The
rust was rough and causing pitting of the metal which indicates a loss of structural strength. In two of the cages the rust
caused breakage of the metal wires of the enclosure floor. The facility had placed a second piece of wire hardware cloth
over the broken floor wires to prevent the sugar gliders from escaping. Sharp rusty metal points were noted due to the
broken wires; these present an injury hazard to the sugar gliders in these cages.
Enclosure wires that are no longer structurally sound may lead to injury of the animals and possible escape of the animals
when the wires break.
The sugar glider enclosures must be made and maintained such that they are structurally sound. Correct by ensuring the
two enclosures with the broken wires are sound by 8/31/21 and the other enclosures with pitted wire by 10/31/21.

Sanitation.
The enclosures housing the spiny mice are in need of cleaning. The bedding in the enclosures was wet and covered with
excreta accumulation. The spiny mice had spilled their feed from their food receptacle and it was lying on top of the dirty
bedding. An ammonia odor was present. The licensee stated that the cages were due for their weekly cleaning today.


Excreta shall be removed from the spiny mice enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals,
minimize disease hazards/spread and to reduce odors. Correct by 8/3/21.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
