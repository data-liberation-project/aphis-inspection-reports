FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The room housing the hedgehogs had a very strong odor, including an ammonia smell. The air purifier was off at
the time of inspection. The window was closed due to cold outdoor temperatures. The daily cleaning had not yet
been done because it is on an evening schedule.
Odors are unpleasant for the animals, and can predispose them to respiratory infections. Two ways to decrease
odors are cleaning more frequently and increasing ventilation. This will make the room more pleasant for the
animals as well as humans.
