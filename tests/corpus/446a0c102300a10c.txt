3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
There were no dates for the administration of distemper and parvovirus vaccines for the adult dogs. Failure to keep
records on the dates and administration of vaccines to adult dogs makes it difficult to determine when vaccines and
treatments were last given. Licensee must keep and maintain records of the names and dates of all vaccines and
treatments given to adult dogs. Correct by May 26, 2022.
