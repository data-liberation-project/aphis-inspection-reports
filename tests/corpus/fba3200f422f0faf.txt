FEEDING.
*** The ring tail lemur is obese and the current diet consists of dog food, fruits, vegetables and cereal (fruit loops).
The diet documented and approved by the attending veterinarian consists of fruit, dark leafy vegetables and dry
zupreem primate biscuits and zupreem canned primate diet. For the health of the animal and to assure the diet
received is of sufficient nutritive value, primate diet should be offered per the veterinarian's diet plan.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The main building housing the non human primates and other exotics needs to be addressed. There are small
animal enclosures stacked on top of freezers, animals on top of the dry food bins, miscellaneous items stored above
animal enclosures (crates, plastic items, bags etc). Additionally there is a lot of cobwebs and dust up in the sky
lights that needs to be cleaned. This is a re occurring issue for housing during the winter months and the facility
needs to come up with a long term solution during the winter months to facilitate good housekeeping practices for
the health of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wire floor in glider enclosure is showing signs of rust and should be replaced, in addition, the moss enrichment
ball has several areas of moss that is gone exposing wire with sharp points. This moss ball could be a potential
hazard to the animals and should be replaced.
The board on the side wall of the cavy enclosure has a larger hole in it and is in disrepair. This wall is between the
cavy's and foxes and should be replaced to keep the enclosure in good repair and to reduce viability between the
prey and predator species. . There are zip ties securing the wallaby blanket to the side of the enclosure, but the zip ties have not been cut back
and are protruding into the enclosure at eye level where the animal jumps into the blanket. These zip ties should be
cut down for the safety of the animal.
The agouti is in the top section of a two tiered enclosure that is not stable. When the animal moves around the
enclosure, the whole unit moves which can cause some distress to the animal. This unit needs to be balanced so
that it is stable and can withstand movement from the animals in the enclosures.
