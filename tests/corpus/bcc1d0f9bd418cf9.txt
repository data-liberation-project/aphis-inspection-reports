2.1(b)(2)(ii)

Requirements and application
Within the last 2 weeks, the licensee purchased a 4-month-old male spider monkey. The licensee failed to notify USDA
Animal Care prior to obtaining this animal. The licensee’s current license does not include Group 6 primates.
Dangerous animals including group 6 primates require specialized housing and care. Notification of USDA Animal Care
prior to obtaining these animals is important for ensuring compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and ensuring animal
welfare.
Correct from this day forth by notifying USDA Animal Care 90 days in advance prior to obtaining new dangerous animal
groups not on the existing license, and by applying for a new license which accurately covers all regulated species.

Health certification and identification.
Within the last 2 weeks, the licensee purchased a 4-month-old male spider monkey. The licensee met the seller at a
location out of state and transported the monkey back to the licensee’s facility. A health certificate was not obtained for
this monkey prior to the licensee transporting it across state lines.
Health certificates are important for ensuring that animals are healthy and fit for travel, and that the animals meet state
health requirements.


Correct by December 10, 2021 by obtaining health certificates for nonhuman primates prior to transporting nonhuman
primates across state lines.
2.132(d)

Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
Within the last 2 weeks, the licensee purchased a 4-month-old male spider monkey from a person who does not have a
license under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). The licensee stated that they did not know that the seller was required to be
licensed under the AWA.
People who sell exotic animals are required to be licensed under the Animal Welfare Act in order to ensure that their
animals are provided with adequate care, husbandry, and welfare.

Animal Welfare Act or issued a 1-time exemption from licensing requirements under the AWA.
