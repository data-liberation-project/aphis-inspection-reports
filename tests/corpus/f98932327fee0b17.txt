3.13(c)(3) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection, the following animals had just arrived at the KLM cargo office:
A dog on waybill number 074-1772-6774, from Manchester Airport, UK, on flights KL 1080 and KL 0605, via
Amsterdam.
A dog on waybill number 074-18753103, from Amsterdam, on flight KL 0605.
The dog originating from Amsterdam did not have a shipper's certification regarding feeding and watering attached
to the crate.
The dog originating in the UK had a label stating the time the dog had last been offered food and water prior to
shipping, and stating "Please keep my water topped up", and another sticker had been applied in Amsterdam,
stating that food and water had been offered there, but there were no instructions from the shipper regarding
feeding during travel.
Failure to ensure that the shipper provides certification in writing regarding feeding and watering instructions at the
time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment can put the animal at risk. This information should be clearly displayed
on the carrier, during transit. The airline must ensure that the owner has provided this information in writing, in order
to help ensure that animals are adequately cared for while in transit.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with cargo office personnel.
