2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete. The owner information and the owner's signature are
missing from the Program of Veterinary Care. The only listed regulated animal is pigs. Sheep and rabbits are
absent from the Program of Veterinary Care. In addition, the required information for vaccinations, parasite control
program, and emergency care are either lacking information or haven't been filled out at all. An incomplete
Program of Veterinary Care doesn't ensure that the animals are receiving optimal care. The Program of Veterinary
Care must be filled out completely and signed off by the Attending Veterinarian. Correct by 9/28/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
