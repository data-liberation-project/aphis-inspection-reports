2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a written program of veterinary care but the last site visit by the veterinarian has been over a year ago on
July 24, 2013. Regular inspections by attending veterinarians are required in order to ensure adequate veterinary
care at the facility. The licensee shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements and must
schedule regular visits to the premises.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
There are plastic five-gallon buckets being used as water receptacles for the dogs in the outdoor enclosure. At least
two of them are severely chewed around the rim and the surfaces are rough and jagged.
Within the outdoor housing area there are at least two red plastic food receptacles that have been chewed and
broken off at the bottom portion of the feeder.
Chewed and worn surfaces cannot be easily sanitized which can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. Sharp points
or jagged edges could potentially injure the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained on a
regular basis or be replaced when worn.
