ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 PM on
19-MAR-19.
Spoke with the licensees roommate and she stated that the licensee was on a delivery out of state. The licensee
called and gave me her better days and hours of availability.
