INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Item IACUC 2.31 e 3
At the time of inspection protocol 2016- 9 was reviewed. It indicates an intramuscular injection of axon tracer will be
administered into the biceps or extensor carpi radialis muscle. In reviewing medical records the tracers were
injected into both forelimbs, which was not documented in the protocol.
The investigator needs to provide an amendment to the IACUC indicating that both forelimbs will be used for the
tracers and the IACUC needs to approve the amendment .
