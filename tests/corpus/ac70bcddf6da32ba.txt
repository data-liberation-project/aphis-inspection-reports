2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
The facility owner told the inspectors that he has 5 breeding female hedgehogs, and he is selling their offspring.
This is a USDA regulated activity and requires a USDA Dealers license. A courtesy visit had been conducted on
October 17, 2017, and the owner is aware of what constitutes a regulated activity and that a license is required.
Conducting regulated activity without a USDA license does not comply with the Animal Welfare Act or ensure that
APHIS officials can assess the care of the animals. The owner must either cease regulated activity or obtain a
license from the USDA to continue conducting regulated activity under the Animal Welfare Act.
The Animal Welfare Act standards and regulations were again explained to the owner. The owner stated he had an
application package and he was going to submit the application very soon.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITY CAN BE CONDUCTED, INCLUDING SELLING HEDGEHOGS UNTIL A VALID USDA
LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
