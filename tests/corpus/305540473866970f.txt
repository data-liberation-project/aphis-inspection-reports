2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(a)(1) Veterinary care: The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility lacks specific
guidance for the care of animals. Species specific dosing and route and is not included for the drugs in the parasite
control program and the vaccinations included in the PVC. Specific guidance from the attending veterinarian is
required for all drugs used by the licensee.

The written PVC requires additional guidance for the method of euthanasia to be used by the facility for small
animals, including the use of anesthesia, CO2, equipment, and the personnel trained and authorized to perform the
euthanasia for the various species. Additional guidance and training in the procedure for euthanasia by the
attending veterinarian is required to ensure animals are humanely euthanized according to the latest AVMA
Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2013 edition).

Additional specific guidance is required for the Program of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate
guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does
not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by
developing and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for all species housed at the facility.
Correct by April 17, 2016.

latest AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2013 edition). Management personnel informed the APHIS
official during this inspection that the facility will be following the written facility PVC for euthanasia in the future.Correct by ensuring the method of euthanasia used at the facility is fully described in the facility written PVC.
