Handling of animals.
Four Hedgehogs and three puppies died while in the possession of this transporter. The registrant stopped to rest during
a transport at about 6pm on 31 Aug 2021. At approximately 9pm, she checked on the animals and found the air
conditioning system was not operating correctly and warm air blowing from the air vents. She checked the animals in the
rear of the vehicle at that time and found the deceased animals. Failure to protect animals from harmful ambient
temperatures can lead to heat stress and even death. When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health or
well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions. The transporter must ensure
that all animals never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity, and time that is detrimental to the
animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age, species, breed, overall health
status, and acclimation. To be corrected by 9 Sept 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
