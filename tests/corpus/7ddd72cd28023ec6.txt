ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The carbon dioxide tank used for euthanasia of guinea pigs has a pressure reducing regulator, but there is
currently no flow meter. The 2013 edition of the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals states that an
appropriate pressure reducing regulator and flow meter or equivalent equipment with demonstrated capability for
generating the recommended displacement rates for the size container being utilized is absolutely necessary for the
humane application of CO2. A flow meter needs to be added to the CO2 tank and pressure reducing regulator to
ensure the animals are appropriately euthanized following the AVMA Guidelines. Correct by July 1, 2016.
