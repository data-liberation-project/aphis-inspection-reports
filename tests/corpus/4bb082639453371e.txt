3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In both the North and South buildings, the enclosures have a fiberglass food receptacle on the front of them.
Throughout both buildings the food receptacles have been damaged by the dogs. One enclosure in the South
building and one enclosure in the North building, affecting a total of four dogs, have food receptacles that have been
broken leaving a gap between the enclosure flooring and the food receptacle. These gaps in the floor pose an injury
risk to the dogs as they are large enough to allow the dog's feet and legs to pass through. The fiberglass food
receptacles must be replaced or altered in a manner that does not leave any gaps in the floor and a maintenance
plan for the enclosures must be established to ensure they remain safe for the dogs.
