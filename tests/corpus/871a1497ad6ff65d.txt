HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Two young sugar gliders were housed in one enclosure. Each had a "leash" around its neck. One of the sugar
gliders was lying on the floor of the enclosure in one corner with its back to the wall and its abdomen exposed. In
addition one of the front legs was extended in an abnormal posture not typical of a resting sugar glider. The facility
representative removed the sugar glider from the cage. It was obviously not used to being on a leash and was very
jumpy. It was able to walk normally on the table but when held would jump around. The facility representative
explained that she just started leash training these sugar gliders today and that by the end of the day they would act
calmly on a leash. Thirty minutes later one of the employees handed one of these sugar gliders on a leash to
member of the public on the other side of a long table from the employee. The sugar glider was agitated and
jumping around on the person. At one point, it jumped off the person and was dangling by the leash around its neck
until the member of the public could figure out how to recapture it which was accomplished by reeling it in by its
leash. This type of handling of an untrained animal by an untrained member of the public may lead to serious injury
of the animal in addition to the distress caused to the animal. All handling of all animals shall be done as
expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or
unnecessary discomfort. Correct immediately.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All four sides, the top and the bottom of the enclosure used to house two white Siberian chipmunks is composed of
wire. The openings between the wires measures approximately 1/2 in wide x4 in long. There was no solid flooring
available for the chipmunks to walk or rest on. The feet and legs of the chipmunks were noted to fall through the
open areas between the wires while the chipmunks were running around. In addition, the chipmunks had a purple
metal wire mesh running wheel in the enclosure. They made frequent use of it. The wheel fell off its hook making it
no longer operable three times during a 30 minute observation period. Staff just reattached it each time as if this
was a frequent occurrence. The openings between the wire bars and the structurally unsound wheel may lead to
injury of the animals. One of the chipmunks was noted to have an area of hairloss and slight red skin on the tip of its
nose. All enclosures used to house animals including the chipmunks must be constructed of materials as
appropriate for the animals involved and must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect theanimals from injury. Correct by 4/19/16.
