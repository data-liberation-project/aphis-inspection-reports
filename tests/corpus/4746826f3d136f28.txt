MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on13-Sep-18 at 0915.
I arrived at the facility at 0915 and knocked on the door. There was no answer. I called and left a voicemail. At 0945,
I tried calling again with no answer. I sent a text to the licensee. She called me back and stated that she was
cancelling her license and registration. No activity was being conducted and all remaining animals would be sold
this weekend. I informed of the process to cancel her license and stated it needed to be cancelled by September
30th or she would need to be inspected. I also explained that she would still need to file an annual report for this
fiscal year.
