ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female coatimundi had a crushing injury to the tip of her tail that reportedly took place a week ago. It was
reported to be treated with a topical treatment, but the injury had not been reported to the Attending Veterinarian.
Lack of communication with the attending veterinarian regarding injuries or health conditions does not ensure an
affected animal receives adequate treatment.
Correction: Contact the Attending Veterinarian to have him/her observe the affected coatimundi's tail and provide
documentation of his/her treatment suggestions. Maintain direct and frequent communication with the attending
veterinarian regarding animal health problems and injuries.

This leaves a large gap (2-3 inches) that could provide an area for a lemur to escape or cause injury to itself on.
Maintain enclosures structurally sound to prevent injury and contain non-human primates securely.
Doors on lemur enclosures must be repaired/replaced so that that it seals tightly.
