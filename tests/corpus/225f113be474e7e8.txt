CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Within the North Building, a mouse was observed running across the floor of an empty enclosure on the east side.
This enclosure is adjacent to an enclosure containing seven Bermese Mountain Dog puppies. A live mouse was
also observed running on the floor next to the food storage area. Rodent droppings are present on the floor of at
least two empty enclosures. The food storage area also has an accumulation of rodent droppings on the floor and in
empty metal food receptacles not being used. There are 20 dogs being housed in this building. The licensee has
pest control products available, however, they are not currently in use.
Lack of an effective program that controls rodents can create unsanitary conditions and lead to the potential spread
of disease. An effective program for the control of rodents must be established and maintained so as to promote the
health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
