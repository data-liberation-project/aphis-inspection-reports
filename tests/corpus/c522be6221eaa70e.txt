Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:50am - 12:10pm
on April 5, 2021.

Attempts to make contact with the licensee were done by calling the licensee, honking the GOV's horn and waiting in the
driveway for 20 minutes. During that time it was relayed by one of the licensees that no one would be available to walk the
inspector through the inspection process.
