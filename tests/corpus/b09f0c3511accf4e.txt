3.53(a)(1) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In December 2018, a rabbit was found with its head entrapped between the floor grate and the enclosure door.
Upon release it was determined the animal had expired. There have been no further incidents of this nature.
Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury and to
contain them.
The facility instituted a review of all rabbit enclosures, door and floor connections and potential solutions to prevent
future entrapments. All of the enclosures currently being used have been modified to correct the issue between the
doors and grate to prevent the rabbits from becoming entrapped.
Facility needs to continue to monitor the primary enclosures and implement engineering modifications when
deemed necessary to ensure the welfare of the animals. The facility must ensure that the primary enclosures are
suitable for the animals in order to safeguard the animals from injury.
Exit interview took place at the end of the inspection.
