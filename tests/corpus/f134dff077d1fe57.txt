ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of inspection the remaining Owl Monkey was individually housed because the elderly mate had been
euthanized within the past month. The Owl Monkey can not see or hear other compatible non-human primates in
the current enclosure. The Environmental enhancement plan to promote psychological well-being of nonhuman
primates specifies that the Owl Monkey will be pair housed, with no contingency for only one Owl Monkey and no
special considerations in the environmental enhancement plan to address the needs of this individually housed
nonhuman primate.
The environmental enhancement plan must be updated to provide special attention for individually housed
nonhuman primates that are unable to see and hear nonhuman primate species of their own or compatible species.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the cheetah enclosures, the front edge of one shelter box was worn to raw wood and the other shelter box had
two damaged sections with splintered wood exposed. Deteriorating surfaces present an ingestion risk, threaten
structural strength, and impede cleaning. A system of maintenance shall be in place to ensure enclosures are kept
in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
