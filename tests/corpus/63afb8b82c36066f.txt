Facilities, general.
Multiple areas of the facility contained items not maintained in good repair.
- In the walk through area, a pen with two sheep contained a single exposed wire at approximately head level of the
animals. This is a potential source of injury.
- In the walk through area, a pen containing two goats had a loose clump of wire on the ground near the rear fence of the
outdoor section of the run. This is a potential source of entanglement and injury for the animals.
- In the drive through area, a pen containing two cows has an old, rusted metal feed bin on the ground in the stall. The
feed bin is not being used, per facility representative. This bin should be removed or restored to a proper location.
- In the drive through area, the pen containing a single zebra has several areas of concern. In the corner of the indoor
stall, there are two exposed nail heads in a board. The wire door at the entrance to this stall has multiple loose wires, and
multiple exposed sharp points. Just outside the entrance the ground is covered with broken boards, pieces of concrete,
and exposed metal edges on the ground. In the outdoor portion of the enclosure, there is a large, tangled jumble of wire
along the fence line near the stall entrance. These are all potential injury and entrapment areas and should be repaired
as appropriate.


The facility must repair these affected areas, and must maintain them in a safe condition.
