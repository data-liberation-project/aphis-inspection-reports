ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00pm on
10-May-17.
No one was at the facility that could conduct an inspection. I reached the owner by phone when she returned my
call and she advised she would not be home until late due to errands. I asked for days and times that would be
better for inspections, and the licensee advised she was unable to provide any due to difficult schedules over the
next 2 weeks, and that I would just have to try again at any time or date and she would try to be available.
