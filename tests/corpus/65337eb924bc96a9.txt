2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
A pigtail macaque pulled a chain holding an enrichment device into the cage, entangled its jaw, and asphyxiated.
These types of enrichment devices were being modified to fit better, and the one involved had not been properly
installed.
The facility self-reported the incident to APHIS officials. The corrective actions consisted of promptly removing all of
the foraging/enrichment devices from all cages and returning to the use of puzzle balls. To prevent a similar
incident in the future, all enrichment devices will be evaluated by a committee before being used with animals.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representatives.
