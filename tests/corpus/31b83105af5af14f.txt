Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The alpaca on exhibit today at a mobile petting zoo event has long hooves. All four hooves are in need of routine trimming
but the front right leg has excessively long hooves. The outer hoof has started to curl. The alpaca appeared to move
around normally with no sign of any gait abnormalities today. The facility owner stated that the her regular farrier was not
able to work on the alpaca's feet at his last visit and that she has found someone who can trim the alpaca's hooves but
has not yet scheduled that appointment. Long hooves can lead to discomfort to the animal and over time to joint and leg
issues. The facility needs to ensure the availability of the appropriate personnel and alpaca farrier services to keep the
alpaca's hooves trimmed. Correct by 6/30/21.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
The inspection was conducted at a mobile exhibit held at the library in Lebanon, TN.
