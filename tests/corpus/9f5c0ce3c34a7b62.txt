Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
This facility remains without a record of animals on hand. In addition there are two disposition forms, dated October 31,
2022 and November 5, 2022, that do not include the vehicle license number, state, and the drivers license number and
state of buyers who are not licensed under the Act. Failure to maintain complete and accurate records of animals on
hand prevents the licensee from identifying individual animals and following their movement in and out of the facility.
Correct by ensuring that the facility maintains complete and accurate records of all animals on hand, all animal
acquisitions (including the total offspring born of any animal while in his possession or under his control) and animal
dispositions (including those which die, are euthanized, sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of). These records must
include all information required by this section, must be maintained in an accurate and timely manner, and must be made
available for inspection by APHIS officials. Remains uncorrected.
3.125(a) Direct Repeat

Facilities, general.
The Sika deer enclosure continues to have large loose sections of the fence on the back side. The post in the back of the
enclosure remains broken with the top portion hanging into the enclosure. A few sections of the far fence are crumpled. In
addition, two Sika deer fawn have escaped the primary enclosure. The licensee explained to inspectors that on November
5, 2022, two dogs had entered the property and were running around the perimeter of the enclosure, causing the fawns to

be separated from the herd and escaped the enclosure. A portion of the fence has been repaired, but other areas of the
fence remain loose, posing an injury and/or possibility of escape for the deer. Correct by ensuring that all enclosures are
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to safely contain the animals.
Remains uncorrected.
3.127(d) Critical Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility continues to not have a perimeter fence. On November 5, 2022, two dogs entered the property and were
running the fence line of the sika deer enclosure. During this time 2 fawn were separated from the rest of the herd and
escaped the enclosure. One of the fawn was recovered by the licensee. The remaining fawn has not been found or
captured. Several species are maintained outside at the facility including: Arctic fox, bobcat, grey fox, ferret, mink, red fox
and striped skunk. An Administrator approved variance has not been secured.
Animals and unauthorized persons have easy access to the animals, which may result in harm to the animals such as
undue stress, disease exposure, theft, injury, release, and/or death. Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a
perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out and from them having contact
with the animals in the facility and so that said fence can provide a secondary containment method in the event of an
escape. Remains uncorrected.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
The premises remain in disarray. Accumulations of trash and junk, including wire fencing, and unused enclosures, have
collected in piles among and around the animal enclosures, including within the center isle of the mink/ferret barn. These
accumulations of trash and unused equipment/enclosures, provide housing and protection for pests and vermin. Both
waste and the presence of pests and vermin may expose the regulated animals to disease hazards. Correct by ensuring

that premises are kept clean and in good repair to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices. Accumulations of trash shall
be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals. Remains uncorrected.
