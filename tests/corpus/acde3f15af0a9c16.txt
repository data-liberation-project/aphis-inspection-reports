No non-compliant items identified during this inspection.
This is a focused inspection on the Direct from the inspection on February 24, 2014.
The attending veterinarian came to the facility the following day to examine the deceased puppy and determined
that the animal died due to an unknown disease of the lungs and liver. The licensee is now aware that more timely
communication with the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment is necessary for any health issues that are
not obvious or showing signs of getting better within the given time set by the veterinarian. All of the remaining
regulated animals appear in good health and condition.

Inspection and Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
