2.40(b)(2) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility stated that they are no longer using the expired, November 2016, Kaolin-Pectin Solution to treat dogs for
diarrhea. However, the bottles that had previously been disposed on the last inspection, October 2021, had been placed
back into the refrigerator and is being maintained in the same area of the refrigerator with the medications that are
currently and/or actively being used on animals at the facility.
Expired medical products may lose their effectiveness and may not assist the animals in recovery from illness and injury
or could leave the animals without proper protection against serious and deadly diseases.
Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and prevent diseases and injuries. Expired
medication should be properly disposed. Licensee must ensure that all medical products being maintained for use at the
facility are current and have not expired in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
2.50(a)(1) Repeat

Time and method of identification.
The facility uses a metal tag attached to a collar and placed around the dog’s neck as the official form of identification. At
least 8 dogs over 16 weeks of age (Romi Belle #65, Tobi Mac #62, Theo #115, 2 blonde yorkies, a white toy poodle, a
black toy poodle and a black and white toy poodle are currently not wearing a collar with an attached metal tag.
Official identification is necessary for APHIS officials to positively identify animals for inspection or under treatment and to

properly trace their movements.
All live dogs shall be identified by an official tag affixed to a collar around the animal’s neck, by a legible tattoo marking
approved by the Administrator, or by a microchip placed under the dog’s skin. The licensee must place a collar with an
attached metal tag around the neck of the 8 dogs listed above or apply one of the other forms of identification. The
licensee must ensure that all dogs have an official form of identification at all times.
2.75(a)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is currently using a book to document the acquisition information for any puppies that are born on the premise.
The book the facility is using is not an approved form of documentation for the puppies and is missing information that is
required under this subpart.
Acquisition information is necessary for APHIS officials to make positive identification of animals during inspection or that
are under treatment and to properly trace their movements.
The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain an approved method of documentation which fully and correctly disclose all
information concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or
under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records
shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. The licensee must
record the acquisition information on an approved document for all puppies. The licensee must ensure all required
information is properly and accurately documented at all times.
2.75(a)(1)(ix) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005) is missing the disposition date for 8 dogs;
Crystal #18, Little Bear #20, Patsy #21, E-Clair #22, Billy #30, Adonis, Roscoe, Tsali.

Incomplete acquisition and disposition records may interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to accurately inventory the
animals, identify individual dogs and to track their movements.
Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain records or forms that fully and correctly disclose the date each dog was
disposed. The licensee must add the disposition dates to APHIS Form 7005 and always maintain all required information
at all times.
3.1(b) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The facility houses dogs in wire crates and one enclosure, containing one adult Yorkie "Patsy", has clutter on top of the
enclosure. The clutter consists of a book, paper towels, an empty plastic dish, and large plastic bag containing some sort
of cloth material.
Clutter stored on top of the enclosures could impact the movement of air, as well as become too heavy and cause the top
of the enclosure to collapse potentially injuring an animal.
The enclosed porch and food storage area are heavily cluttered. The dogs use the porch to access their outdoor area and
the clutter on the porch has left a small walkway for the dogs and people to pass through. The clutter consists of
numerous large cardboard boxes including boxes which are stacked on top of each other, golf clubs, vacuums and
attachments, plastic bins, and household items. The food storage area also consists of a large amount of household
clutter and unused items including old medical materials that are no longer being used for the dogs.
Clutter stored in animal areas could accumulate dust and dirt and could attract pests such as rodents. The clutter could
also pose a risk of injury should it topple over and land on top of a dog. Animal and food storage areas inside of housing
facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter.
The licensee must remove the clutter from the top of the enclosure and from the porch and food storage area. The
licensee must ensure that all housing areas remain free from clutter at all times.

3.1(c)(3) Direct Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The facility does not currently have an effective cleaning and sanitization protocol for the facility and has ongoing giardia
and coccidia infections within the kennel. Currently, the only areas being effectively cleaned and sanitized are the wire
crates that are used to house dams with puppies and a select number of adult dogs. All other hard surfaces for which the
dogs are able to come in contact with are not being properly cleaned and sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b) of this
subpart. The excreta piles are currently being picked up on a regular basis. However, all other surfaces are not being
cleaned and sanitized every two weeks or as often as necessary. There is a moderate to excessive accumulation of dust,
dirt, hair, urine, excreta residue, food waste and other organic debris accumulated on all other hard surfaces of the animal
housing area. In addition, at least 50% of the hard surfaces (floors, cabinets, walls, crate stands, chairs, desk and other
furniture type items) throughout the animal housing areas have a thick yellow, brown or black buildup. The only dogs
having a clean place to eat are the dogs being housed in the wire crates. All other dogs have a designated feeding area
that is currently contaminated with an excessive accumulation of dust, dirt, hair, urine, excreta residue, food waste and
other organic debris. At the time of inspection, inspectors watched a tan and white dog named Finn eating food from the
floor. The floor in this area is covered with a heavy layer of brown to black matter. The walls and surrounding surfaces of
this area is also covered with the heavy layer of yellow to brown matter. The insufficient cleaning of the animal housing
area and designated food area to not allow the dogs to walk, lay or eat without directly walking a moderate to excessive
accumulation of dust, dirt, hair, urine, excreta residue, food waste and/or other organic debris.
According to the Licensee and in communicating with the Veterinarian’s Assistant at the clinic, the facility has been
treating for Giardia for at least a year and had animals that tested positive for both Giardia and Coccidiosis on Jan 19,
2022 (Johnna’s puppies). The ineffective cleaning is directly affecting their ability to properly prevent the spread of
Giardia within their facility. In addition, improper cleaning/sanitization and the accumulation and/or buildup of excreta and

other waste materials could cause the dogs to become soiled.
All hard surfaces (to include; floors, cabinets, walls, crate stands, chairs, desk and other furniture type items) for which the
dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized every two weeks or as often as necessary in accordance
with 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent the accumulation of dust, dirt, excreta residue, urine, hair and other organic material
in order to assist in reducing disease hazards within the facility.
3.1(e) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The Licensee has replaced the plastic bin with the broken lid that had previously contained open dog food. However, the
new plastic bin did not have a cover on it during today’s inspection. The cover was hanging at the back of the bin and
was not on top of the bin at the time of inspection.
Open food could become contaminated by pests such as flies or mice which may have a negative impact on the health of
the dogs.
This was corrected by the Licensee at the time of inspection. The lid was placed on top of the food container and sealed
prior to the inspector’s departure from the facility.
3.6(c) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
The facility has one enclosure containing two female adult poodles, “Paris” and “Romi Belle”, with inadequate space. The
Licensee stated that the two females were being housed in the enclosure together on a temporary bases because they
were both in heat. When “Paris” was measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail, she measured 17” and
would require a minimum amount of 3.67 sq feet of floor space. When “Romi Belle” was measured from the tip of the nose
to the base of the tail, she measured 18” and would require a minimum amount of 4 sq feet of floor space. For these
animals to be compatibly group housed in one enclosure, they would require a minimum of 7.67 sq ft of floor space. When

the enclosure was measured, the enclosure measured 36”Lx24”W and was currently only providing the two dogs with 6
sq ft of floor space.
Grouped housed dogs with an insufficient amount of space can easily become stressed and/or cause erratic or
aggressive behaviors towards one another.
The Licensee must ensure that all singly housed as well as grouped housed dogs are provided with a sufficient amount of
space in accordance with this sub part at all times. This applies to all enclosures while being used as a temporary
enclosure or an enclosure being used for long term housing.
3.13(a)(3) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Licensee has received a new Program of Veterinary Care that provides a large portion of required information.
However, they are still missing pertinent information on the routine for heart worm testing and fecal sampling. There is no
guidance currently provided in their program of veterinary care for the percentage or total number of dogs to be sampled
and the frequency of which they should be tested for heartworm and intestinal parasites. Sampling of dogs for parasites is
necessary to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.
Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests.
The facility must add the number of dogs to be sampled for heartworms and intestinal parasites to the Program of
Veterinary Care.
3.13(b)(2) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
A brown and white dog “Tobi Mac #62” has been examined by a licensed veterinarian for an abnormal condition of the
right eye. There are no medical records documenting the examination and the veterinarian’s findings concerning the dog’s

eye condition. The inspectors were able to confirm with the facility’s veterinarian that he has seen the eye in the past, but
he would like to see the animal again for re-examination. The licensee was able to schedule an appointment for this
animal on January 31, 2022 for re-examination.
A white and light tan dog “Shelby #109” has been examined by a licensed veterinarian for an abnormal condition of the
left eye. There are no medical records documenting the examination and the veterinarian’s findings concerning the dog’s
eye condition. The inspectors were able to confirm with the facility’s veterinarian that he had seen the eye in the past, but
he would like to see the animal again for re-examination. The licensee was able to schedule an appointment for this
animal on January 31, 2022 for re-examination.
The licensee states they have had numerous cases of Giardia and Coccidiosis in several dogs spanning over about a
one year time frame. The Licensee was not able to provide any medical records or documentation for any of the animals
that have been currently or previously been diagnosed with Giardia or Coccidia. In addition, there was no written records
to indicate that any animals were currently receiving treatment for any health issues, including Giardia or Coccidiosis at
the facility. In communication with the Licensee, she was not able to verbally provide us with information on specific
animals that were receiving treatment, had previously received treatment or what treatments were currently being
provided to any individual dogs. The inspector was able to contact the licensed veterinarian and confirm that some fecal
samples had recently been completed with positive test results. On January 19, 2022, “Johnna’s” 2 puppies tested
positive for giardia and coccidia. On December20, 2021, “Caramel” tested positive for giardia. On November 30, 2021,
“Romi Belle’s” puppies tested positive for giardia and coccidia. On November 30, 2021, “Paris’s” puppies tested positive
for giardia. The veterinarian prescribed Albon to be given once a day for 10 days, as prescribed by the label. However;
the licensee was unable to provide any form of written document or verbal conformation to indicate that the treatment plan
is being followed. Several of the puppies have been sold and are no longer at the facility. There is no documentation to
indicate that these puppies received proper treatment or were Giardia or Coccidiosis free prior to their sale.

Failure to create and maintain medical records interferes with APHIS official’s ability to determine if the dogs are receiving
adequate veterinary care. The consistent need for treatment for re-occurring issues and the lack of documentation to
confirm treatments are being followed, combined with the insufficient cleaning of the overall facility are detrimental to the
health and well-being of all of the animals being housed at this facility. These animals are suffering with chronic issues as
a direct result of the facilities inability to follow their veterinarian’s guidance and treatment protocols.
Dealers must keep medical records for dogs documenting all required information including the date and identification of
animals treated, fully detailed treatment plans, and results of examinations conducted by licensed veterinarians. The
licensee must ensure medical records are created and maintained and fully document all procedures, treatments, and
examinations for each adult dog and puppy.
The licensee must have documentation for Tobi Mac’s eye condition and Shelby’s eye condition. The licensee must have
documentation of any dogs under medical treatment. In addition the licensee must demonstrate that all veterinary
guidance for all diagnosis and treatment of illness are being followed.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
