PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The enclosures facing the doorway are made of vinyl and have been excessively chewed by the dogs. This
damage allows dirt and food waste to penetrate the surface of the vinyl which can result in disease hazards towards
the dogs. The vinyl needs to be replaced or altered in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization of
the enclosure every two weeks.
