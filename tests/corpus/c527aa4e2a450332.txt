EMPLOYEES.
A juvenile Lemur escaped its enclosure at the Perry Georgia County Fair on October 9th, 2015. Upon escaping the
Lemur bit two onlookers at the exhibit. The employee in charge of the exhibit at that time, entered the exhibit with
the Lemurs while the public was in the viewing area. Failing to secure the enclosure door securely behind him, the
employee allowed the juvenile Lemur to escape creating mayhem for the public and frightening the Lemur. Two
individuals from the public were bitten while trying to help contain the animal. The enclosure door should have not
been opened with the public in the exhibit. The employees who provide husbandry practices and care, or handle
nonhuman primates, must be trained and supervised by an individual who has the knowledge, background, and
experience in proper husbandry and care of nonhuman primates to supervise others. The employer must be certain
that the supervisor can perform to these standards. The employee has been relieved of his position. Corrected at
the time of the incident.
