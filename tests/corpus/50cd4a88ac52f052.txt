2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee failed to complete two treatment plans as directed by a veterinarian. An adult Shar-pei named 'Bacardi'
was prescribed 20 amoxicillin 500mg capsules on 4/11/16. The medication was needed to treat a sore located on
the dogs back-right paw pad. The inspector counted 10 amoxicillin capsules that were still in the bottle. The
directions listed on the bottle are: give (1) capsule twice daily (every 12 hours) until gone.
An adult Shar-pei named 'Cookie' was prescribed 20 cephalexin 500mg capsules on 4/11/16. The licensee stated
the medication was used to treat an ear infection. The inspector counted 8 cephalexin capsules that were still in the
bottle. The directions listed on the bottle are: give 1 capsule twice a day for 10 days.
If the medication was used as directed, there would not be any capsules left after 4/20/16. The licensee did not
maintain a log to document when the medication was being administered. The licensee stated that she forgot to
finish giving the dogs the remaining capsules after she believed their health problems were resolved.
At the time of inspection the two dogs listed above appeared to be in good health and exhibiting normal behavior.
Failure to administer medications as directed by the veterinarian does not ensure the dogs are receiving adequate
veterinary care. The licensee must administer all medications as directed by a veterinarian.
Exit briefing conducted with the licensee.
