HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are spots of rust along the perimeter seam of the metal water tank that is in the dog's outdoor portion. This
tank is used for a swimming pool for this dog. Rusted surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. All
surfaces in contact with dogs need to be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization.

FEEDING.
There was residue of wet hay in the bottom of the food receptacle for the pronghorn. Some of the wet hay had a
white appearance to it. Contaminated food can transmit disease and may cause the animal to not eat. All food
must be protected from contamination and food receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary and measures must be
in place to prevent molding, contamination and deterioration of the food. This food receptacle was removed at the
time of this inspection.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
One pot-bellied pig was observed to have a number of flies on the margins of her ears. The ear margins are
thickened. This pig is under the care of the attending veterinarian for an ongoing skin problem which could explain
the thickened skin, however, the flies are still attracted to this area and are excessive in numbers. The pig shakes
her ears repeatedly to try to remove the flies. The bison herd was observed to have excessive numbers of flies on
and around their legs. They were observed stomping and swinging their heads in an effort to remove the flies. Flies
can transmit disease and can be irritating to the animals. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective
method of pest control. Correct by 7 July 2016.
