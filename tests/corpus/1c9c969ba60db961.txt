2.40(b)(3) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. There were 2 brown and white weanlings in Pen 12 with
circular areas of hair loss and crusty skin on the nose. The licensee was treating several other guinea pigs for this skin
condition as described in the Program of Veterinary Care but had not observed and was not treating the guinea pigs in
this pen.
Skin conditions with hair loss and crusty skin can cause discomfort, may spread to other animals, and may worsen if not
treated.
The licensee must develop and implement a plan for effective daily observations and regular communication of those
findings to the attending veterinarian. The licensee must initiate treatment of these 2 guinea pigs according to the
Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending veterinarian to develop an appropriate plan of diagnosis and
treatment.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
