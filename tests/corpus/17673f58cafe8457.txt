HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The information for "Handling Dangerous Animals" has not been completed and sent to the regional office. The
qualifications of the employees and addressing the other issues listed on the form are of utmost importance. The
drive through section of the park contains potentially dangerous animals, such as a rhinoceros and a tiger, which
were not on the original license. Individuals lacking knowledge and experience with dangerous animals might
negatively impact the health and welfare of the animal through improper husbandry. The licensee must provide the
regional office with written documentation regarding the experience and knowledge of the individuals who handle
these animals. This information must be submitted and approved by the Western Regional Office before this site
can be approved for regulated activity.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- Pepsi cups full of feed are sold at the gift shop for members of the public to give to the animals. The drive through
area of the park had members of the public driving their cars through and feeding animal feed from paper Pepsi
cups that are available for purchase at the gift shop. A vehicle was observed at the giraffe enclosure, with a park
visitor leaning out of the window and touching the head of the giraffe. There were no park employees present
during this public/animal interaction. Unsupervised contact between animals and members of the public poses a
potential risk both to the health of the animals, and the welfare of the public. A responsible, knowledgeable, and
readily identifiable park employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the first part of the drive through area of the park containing a large number of donkeys and other hoof stock,
there is a section of old fencing and pipes that are broken, partially buried, and with the pipes exposed and
protruding from the ground at a forty-five degree angle. This area is a potential source of injury and/or entrapment
for any animals that might travel through this area. This section should be cleared, and all old fencing/pipe removed
safely. All fencing in every section of the park must be maintained at all times in order to safely contain and prevent
injury and/or entrapment to the enclosed animals.
