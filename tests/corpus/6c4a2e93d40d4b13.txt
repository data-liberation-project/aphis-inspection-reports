(1) There were several bags of raw chicken being thawed outdsite out on the ground. I observed numerous ants
around the bags of this raw chicken. (2) The temperature gauge on the freezer was a 32F, and when inspecting the
freezer the temperature raises to 40F. Although the meat in the freezer is frozen, appliances need to be at the
proper temperatures to prevent spoilage. Meats should be refrigerated and thawed at temperatures at or below 40°

facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin.
