ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In enclosure #58, an adult female tiger, " Zara", was noted to have an area approximately 2 inches from the end of
her tail that had lost the hair and was reddened with dried blood. The area was approximately 3 inches long and
appeared to encircle the tail surface. No one at the facility had noted this animal's condition and no communication
with a veterinarian had been made at the time of this inspection.
In enclosure #44-45, one of the two juvenile tigers (Baxter or Maverick) was noted to have patchy hair loss covering
at least 50 % of his right side from the neck to hip and the skin appeared to be thickened where the hair was
missing. No one at the facility had noted this animal's condition and no communication with a veterinarian had been
made at the time of this inspection.
Daily observation of animals must be done to ensure that problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being may
be identified and conveyed in a timely and accurate manner to the attending veterinarian.
These animals' conditions should be evaluated by a veterinarian with appropriate diagnosis and treatment
documented by 3/5/2014.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The veterinary hospital indoor enclosure housing 2 lion cubs, Athena and Zeus, had exposed electrical wires within
reach of the cubs on the east wall. The west wall had the vinyl coated surface torn which exposed the drywall and
fiberboard outer wall. This wall is in disrepair and cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. Both of these areas
in this enclosure pose a risk to the health of these animals.
Enclosure #52 housing a binturong, Chip, had exposed wires within reach of the animal from the baseboard heater
on the west wall. There was also an accumulation of pink, fiberglass insulation material on the floor below this
heater. Both the wires and insulation pose a risk of injury to the animal if chewed or ingested.Enclosure #8 housing 2 juvenile black bears, Holly and Lolli, and 1 juvenile brown bear, Huggy, had a large hole
(approximately 7"wide by 6" high) at the bottom corner of the west wall of the wooden shelter structure, posing a
risk of injury should a limb or head get stuck or if they ingest splinters of the broken wood.
Enclosure #57 housing an adult female tiger, Stripes, had large gaps (at least 5 inches) on both sides of the keeper
gate due to the gate being askew on its hinges, posing a risk of injury or possible escape.
Enclosure #64 housing 3 adult tigers, Eva, Juanita, and Natasha, had a chicken leg dangling from a loose strand of
barbed wire near the top of the enclosure fencing. The loose barbed wire poses a risk of injury to the animals and
the food item dangling may encourage the tigers to leap for the food, posing a risk of injury or escape.
Enclosure #47 housing 2 adult tigers, Elijah and Jezebel, had an area of the chain link enclosure fencing that was
unsecured near the support post for a pass-through shift area on the west side, posing a risk of injury or escape.
Enclosure # 23 housing 2 adult tigers, Tutt and Nefertiti, the doorframe around the den (shelter) has chewed and
ripped wood leaving exposed nail heads which could cause an injury to the animals and is not in good repair.
Enclosure # 11 housing 2 adult tigers, Charlie and Chainsaw, the doorframe around the den (shelter) has chewed
and ripped wood and the chain link fencing on the east surface of the den is pulled and unsecured which could
cause an injury to the animals and is not in good repair.
Enclosure # 24 housing 3 tigers, Shenandoah, Aphrodite, and Harley, the chain link fencing on the west side of the
enclosure adjacent to the den is pulled and unsecured which could cause an injury to the animals and is not in good
repair.
Enclosure # 65 housing 3 tigers, Phoebe, Reyna, and Toni, the chain link fencing on the south side of the den is
pulled and unsecured leaving a wood screw exposed which could cause an injury to the animals and is not in good
repair.
Enclosure #13 housing 3 adult tigers, Seth, Tabitha, and Gabrielle, has several exposed nails protruding from the
bottom of the elevated resting platform that could cause injury to the animals.
Enclosure #61 housing an adult black leopard, Sinbad, the elevated resting platform has 2 of 4 posts that are
excessively shredded and chewed to a point that the structural strength to support the cement structure is at risk
and may pose a risk of injury to this animal if they should fail.
Enclosure #55 housing 1 adult male tiger, Tiger, had a loose strand of barbed wire dangling into the enclosure from
the top of the north side of the enclosure fencing, posing a risk of injury to this animal.Enclosure #5 housing 1 adult female leopard, Jade, had nails protruding from the bottom surface of the elevated
wooden resting platform, posing a risk of injury to the animal.
Enclosure #60 housing 2 adult lions, Savannah and Pharaoh, had bent chain link fencing material on the east side
of the enclosure near the keeper gate. The chain link had sharp ends protruding into the enclosure, posing a risk of
injury to the animals.

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Several outdoor enclosures housing tigers did not have adequate shade to protect them from direct sunlight:
*Enclosure # 43 housing 3 adult tigers: Lazarus, Diablo, and Twinkle
*Enclosure #44-45 housing 2 young tigers: Baxter and Maverick
*Enclosure #46 housing 2 adult tigers: Kasper and Kodiak
*Enclosure #19 housing 2 adult tigers: Sumadi and Eragon
*Enclosure #65 housing 3 adult tiger: Phoebe, Rayna, and Trini
*Enclosure #64 housing 3 adult tigers: Eva, Natasha, Juanita
*Enclosure #54 housing 2 adult tigers: Grumpy and Shirkhan
Inadequate protection from direct sunlight may lead to overheating or discomfort from squinting, especially when
there is increased reflection of sunlight due to snow.
Shelter from sunlight is required when overheating or discomfort of the animals is likely.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
In the indoor housing facility for Chip (Binturong) had an excessive number of flies. Also, there was an
accumulation of pink, fiberglass insulation material underneath the baseboard heating unit on the west side of the
indoor enclosure for this animal.
This enclosure has been infested with rodents before and the insulation material may be an indication of rodentactivity.
Flies and rodent pests may carry and transmit diseases to this animal and a more effective method of monitoring
and preventing their accumulation in primary enclosures should be implemented.
The licensee shall establish and maintain a safe and an effective pest control program.
To be corrected by 3/4/2014.
Accompanied on the inspection by the Licensee, AC Personnel, and El Paso County Sheriff's Deputy. Exit
interview conducted on site with the licensee.
