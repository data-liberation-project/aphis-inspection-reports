ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 on
23-Mar-17.The licensee indicated that he was not available for inspection due to previously scheduled
appointments. He is aware of the methods available to establish optimal hours of inspection.
Lack of availability for inspection yields the regulatory process impossible. The licensee must ensure a
knowledgeable facility representative is available to accompany the inspector. Correct from this time forward.
