2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is still no program of veterinary care available for review at either location. This was also an issue on
inspections in 2015 and 2016 . Licensees stated the veterinarian has not made a premise visit at either location in
the last year. The program of veterinary care must be available for review at time of the inspection and the
veterinarian must make regularly scheduled visits to assure that adequate veterinary care is provided. Blank copies
of the program of veterinary care form were left at each location at time of the inspection.

road location. The jagged edge of the metal is a potential area for animal injury. This area must be repaired and the
enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury .
