ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Shar-pei (“Candy”, microchip #956000005277288) has an excessive amount of wet discharge around both
eyes. The discharge is yellow/grey in color and is coating the hair beneath the eyes and around the outer corner of
the eyes. A dried, brown colored material is attached to the hair above both eyes.
Female Shar-pei (“Cutie”, microchip #956000005127525) has an excessive amount of wet discharge around both
eyes. The inspector initially observed the discharge covering the surface of both eyes and possibly blocking the
animal’s field of vision. The discharge is yellow/grey in color and is thickly coating the hair beneath the eyes and
around the outer corner of the eyes.
The licensee stated that he is treating the eyes of both dogs with Equate First Aid Antibiotic every other day. There
is no documentation from the attending veterinarian approving this treatment.
The licensee must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and
to establish an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and
available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at
all times.
Correction date: End of business March 24, 2017
In the dog building there is one bottle of Panacur that has an expiration date of December 2016. Expired medical
materials could lose their effectiveness and the health of the dogs could suffer. The licensee must dispose of the
Panacur or clearly label it expired and not to be used for the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all medical
materials used for the dogs have not expired in order to support their health and well-being.
Correction date: The licensee disposed of the expired Panacur at the time of the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
