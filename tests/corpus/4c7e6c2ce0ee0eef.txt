A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1155 on

(delivering puppies) and would not be back until late afternoon. Licensee stated that there was no other person
available to conduct inspection at this time. Discussed establishment of optimal hours with licensee.
The licensee must be available during normal business hours, and if licensee cannot be available during normal
business hours, a responsible adult (18 years or older) shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during
the inspection process. Please contact Tom Secor, VMO at 605-214-0847.
