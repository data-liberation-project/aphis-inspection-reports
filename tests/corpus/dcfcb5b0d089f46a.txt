ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
** I went to the home site of the licensee and was told that they are out on the road until January, the licensee does
not have an itinerary on file. All exhibitors must submit an itinerary when travel extends overnight and must be
received by the regional office now fewer than 2 days in advance of travel. The licensee must submit a written
itinerary to the regional office as soon as possible. To be corrected upon receipt.
End of report.
