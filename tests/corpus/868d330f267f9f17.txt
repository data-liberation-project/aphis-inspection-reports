SANITATION.
Rodent feces were observed on the floor around the opossum enclosure and on the floors and counter of the
kitchen/food preparation room during the time of inspection. A trail of rodent feces was observed adjacent to and
behind the opossum enclosure. Large amounts of rodent feces were located behind the Amana refrigerator and
along the cupboard kick plate in the kitchen. Finally, rodent feces were also observed on the kitchen counter behind
the plastic food bins. The facility has traps and other pest control methods in place, however; they are not
effectively controlling the population of rodents. Rodents can carry and spread diseases.
An effective program for rodent control must be implemented and maintained at the facility.
