2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female harlequin Great Dane named Josephine, (ID# 053 878 860) has a swelling on her right front leg at
the wrist joint. The swelling is approximately two inches wide and two inches long. In addition, there is an area of
hair missing approximately one inch wide by one inch long in this swelled area, with pink, moist-looking skin. It was
difficult to get a good look at the leg due to the nervousness and aggressiveness of the dog. The licensee stated
that this swelling is a chronic issue that comes and goes occasionally, and she treats it with a wound spray when it
flares up. She said she has not observed the dog licking the wound. She stated this issue has not been checked
by the vet in several years. I asked to see the dog walk, and the licensee turned the dog out into the exercise yard.
The dog walked and ran with a normal gait with no sign of lameness.
Swelling of a joint could be a sign of an underlying health issue.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment, and provide the
inspector the documentation of this visit upon request. The licensee must ensure all animals are given proper
veterinary care at all times.
To be corrected by April 15, 2015.
