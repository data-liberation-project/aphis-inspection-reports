ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1325 on
06-Jun-17. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one was home. I called the licensee. She
stated she was unavailable for inspection. I told her I would try again another time.
End of report.
