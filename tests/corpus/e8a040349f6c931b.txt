SANITATION.
* In the older opossum enclosure, the plastic sheets under the newspapers have been chewed, resulting in areas
that cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized. The pliable plastic is no longer in good repair and must be
removed or replaced with something that can be cleaned and sanitized.
* Primarily in the older opossum enclosure, there are areas of rust on the wire enclosure walls. Areas with rust can
no longer be cleaned, because the rust creates an uneven surface. The metal walkways appear dirty and should be
cleaned or replaced as needed.
A system of maintenance should be in place to ensure that the enclosures are maintained in good repair in order to
facilitate cleaning and sanitizing on a routine basis.
