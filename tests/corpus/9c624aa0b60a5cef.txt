ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1235 on
26-SEP-17.
Upon arrival at the facility no one was home. I called the contact number provided and spoke with the licensee. He
stated that he was away and would not be able to return for several hours.
End of report.
