2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
2.40 (b) (2) The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) reviewed and signed on 05/21/2015 calls for the 4 adult
dogs to received Drontal as an intestinal parasite preventative annually. There were no records available at the
time of inspection showing that this was being done. The licensee stated that they are no longer giving Drontal
annually, but needed to verify with the attending veterinarian. The current written PVC does not reflect what is
actually being provided to the animals at the facility. Complete and accurate PVC is important to ensure there is an
understanding between the licensee and the attending veterinarian, so that all routine preventative care and
treatments are accomplished to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
Establish and maintain an accurate and complete written Program of Veterinary Care that includes the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, diagnosis and treat disease or injuries.
