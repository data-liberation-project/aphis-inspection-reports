MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
1. On 10/2/15 a marmoset underwent a surgical procedure under general anesthesia as per the IACUC approved
protocol. Thermal support for the animal was needed during the post-operative recovery period but the heating
blanket normally used was not working properly and an alternate method was used to provide thermal support
under the direction of the attending veterinarian. The marmoset subsequently sustained thermal injuries that were
recognized by veterinary personnel during the immediate post-operative recovery period. The animal was
immediately examined by the attending veterinarian and treatment was instituted. The marmoset's condition
deteriorated despite the treatment prescribed and the animal died 72 hours later.
Per this Section of the Regulations, handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible
in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
The use of the alternate method to provide thermal support to the marmoset during post-operative recovery induced
thermal injuries that resulted in the death of the marmoset.
Upon being notified and in response to this incident, the research facility acted promptly and conducted an
investigation, reported the incident to OLAW and USDA, and swiftly implemented appropriate corrective actions to
prevent any future incidents. Additional surgical procedures have taken place since the corrective measures were
implemented, and no additional incidents have occurred.
The research facility has taken appropriate steps to address this item and it has been corrected.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength.
1. Pertaining to the outside pen for 2 adult cows: One of the horizontal boards of the wooden fence that waslocated approximately 3 feet from the ground was damaged. About one third of the length of the board was broken
off and on the ground inside the pen. The missing piece of the board created a space in the fence large enough for
a cow's head to fit through.
Per this Section of the Regulations, outdoor housing facilities should be structurally sound and maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The research facility needs to repair or replace the broken board to maintain the enclosure fence in good repair and
to ensure the structural strength of the pen.
Correct by 5/17/16.
NOTE - Inspection conducted 5/9/16 and 5/10/16. Exit interview held 5/10/16 on-site with facility representatives.
