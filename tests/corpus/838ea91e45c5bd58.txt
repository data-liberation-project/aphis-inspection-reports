SANITATION.
Three of the four pens in the weaning barn have a build up of manure and urine . Most of the pigs housed in these
enclosures have manure caked on their bodies. Licensee states the barn was cleaned yesterday ,however at time
of the inspection ( 11 am ) it had not yet been cleaned. An acccumulation of manure to this extent does not provide
a healthy environment for the pigs.Cleaning more frequently will minimize disease ,odors and prevent contamination
of the animals. Enclosures housing animals must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent a build up of manure
and contamination of the animals,
