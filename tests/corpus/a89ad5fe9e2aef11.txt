OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Section 3.4 C Impervious Surfaces:
At time of inspection the wood framing on the inside portion of each enclosure is scratched and chewed to the point
that it will not repel water or urine from the thirteen cats. Surfaces (bare wood) that are not impervious to moisture
cannot be readily cleaned & sanitized. If animal waste or urine comes in to contact with an untreated surface it
could create a disease risk & or health problems for the cats. The structural strength of an untreated surface is also
affected when the untreated surface becomes soaked with animal waste or urine on a continual basis. Surfaces that
are impervious to moisture can be readily cleaned & sanitized. To be corrected by 05-10-14.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of Primary Enclosures (3.11 A):
At time of inspection all litter boxes used in the primary enclosures housing seventeen adult cats had an
accumulation of fecal waste. The waste hasn't been cleaned recently. Animal waste collecting in litter boxes creates
an unsanitary condition & could lead to potential disease or health risks for the cats. The potential for increased
insect & pest infestation exists when animal waste is not removed in a timely manner but allowed to buildup in the
litter boxes. The potential for respiratory problems exists when the cats are subjected to the continual smell of
animal waste that is collecting. Removal of animal waste in the litter boxes in a timely manner before build up
occurs is necessary to ensure the health & well being of all cats. To be corrected by 03-12-14.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
