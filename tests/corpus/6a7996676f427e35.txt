FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was an area in the dirt flooring of the right corner of the fox pen which had a hole with exposed wire mesh
adjacent to the water receptacle. Failure to maintain primary enclosures in good repair can lead to injury to the
foxes, including trapping limbs in holes and gaps. A system of maintenance and repair must be in place.

SANITATION.
In the baboon enclosure, there were a large number of flies attracted to the vegetables placed on a wooden box and
vegetables dropped on the floor. Although fly traps were in the vicinity, a more effective program for pest control, a
more effective schedule to remove uneaten vegetables, and an improved more impermeable surface for feeding
must be implemented and maintained to reduce flies.
