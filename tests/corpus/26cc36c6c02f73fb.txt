SANITATION.
*** The Nialgi enclosure needs to be cleaned. The facility is cleaning out the shelter area every few days, however
there was a buildup of waste within the indoor and outdoor enclosure for these animals.This enclosure needs to be
cleaned often enough to remove the waste and prevent future accumulations. The waste should be removed to
promote the health of the animals and to reduce disease hazards.
*** The outdoor portion of the lion and tiger enclosures need to be cleaned. Upon inspection there was an
accumulation of carcass materials within both enclosures. When providing carcasses, after 24 hours the carcasses
should be removed to prevent disease spread and to promote the health of the animals.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee and her animal care staff with ACI- Andrea
D'Ambrosio and VMO Dr.Michael Neafsey at the time of the inspection.
