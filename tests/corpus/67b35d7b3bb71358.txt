2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A lock box containing medications was open in a room housing animals and was dirty inside with debris including
rabbit hair. Multiple medications in this lock box including Ostiox (meloxicam), sufamethoxazole and trimethoprim
suspension, and Posatex Otic Suspension were expired.
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not have a back-up veterinarian listed to cover for such times when the
AV is unavailable. Additionally, the PVC lists "Cervical dislocation" and "*See attached AVMA guidelines" as a
method of euthanasia. There were no guidelines present in the binder or at the facility. Without written instructions
that provided details including the weight range and without the attachment, there is insufficient information to
support this method as acceptable method of euthansia.
The medication supply must be monitored to ensure that expired medications are discarded so that they are not
inadvertently used for the animals. Expired medications may not have the potency necessary for treatment of a
medical condition. The lock box or other devices used to store medications should be kept closed and must be
protect medications from adulteration that can adversely impact the animals when used.
The PVC must be completed to provide instruction to facility personnel for adequate veterinary care.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015, 4/12/2016, 9/6/16.
2.126(a)(2) CRITICAL
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The Facility Manager stated that certain records, including the disposition records, were off-site about an hour away
and that access was not possible that day. The Facility Manager stated that they could be faxed the next day.
However, access to the disposition records at the time of the inspection is necessary to cross-reference to animals
in the facility, to track and reconcile all animals on the premises, and to reconcile any deceased animals with the
facility records. Maintenance of these records and access to these records for purposes of inspection is required to
confirm regulatory compliance.Correct by: This point forward,
3.52(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Due to construction on a neighboring property, a large section of the fence was removed. The fencing panels were
stored against the side of the building. Additionally, the gate was not able to be closed or latched, reportedly due to
swelling of the wood. The gate was held partially closed with a wire, but the gap created would be large enough for
a dog or other predator to enter. This wire was relatively thin and it is questionable whether it would be strong
enough to resist enough pressure to prevent entry. Additionally, there was a gap of approximately 5" under the gate
by the hinge side nearest the building.
Failing to maintain the fence and gate would allow predators access to the animals.
Correct by keeping the gate and fence in proper working order and the gate closed.
The facility was previouly cited under this regulation on 9/6/16.
3.53(a)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two primary enclosures had damage to the upper rear corners of the cages. These damaged areas had resulting
sharp points and gaps. The sharp points could cause direct injury to the rabbits. If the damage to the edge
continues, the gaps could widen resulting in escape of the rabbits or entrapment of a body part, which could lead to
injury or death of the animal.
The facility was cited under this regulation previously cited on reports dated 4/10/2015, 4/29/2015, 11/30/2015,
4/12//2016, 9/6/2016 and 12/28/16.
3.53(a)(4) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One of the cages that housed a gray rabbit had a wire floor that was corroded and broken in two places. At least
one of these was large enough for the rabbit to entrap its foot or toes. Such entrapment could result in injury or in
fractures of the foot or back of the animal. Additionally, the projecting sharp edges could directly injure the animal.
Additionally, many of the cages have floors of wire that is not supported. The floors bounce when the animals movearound, especially the larger animals. The floors of two cage holding two larger black and white rabbits was bent
with ridge-like projections causing an uneven surface. This uneven surface could cause discomfort of the animal
resting on them due to uneven distribution of body weight and pressure or cause injury of the animal. Excess
movement and slant of the floors can be hard on the animals' legs, and the movement can fatigue the metal,
causing it to break as occurred with the cage of the gray rabbit.
The broken floor bottom was corrected at the time of the inspection.
A system of evaluation, maintenance and replacement of the primary enclsoures must be in place to protect the
animals from injury or discomfort.
Correct by: This point forward.
3.53(c)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One cage contained 7 rabbits, which appear to be a doe and her litter. The Facilty Manager weighed the rabbits
using their scale. The dam weighed approximately 6 pounds and the offspring weighed approximately 3 pounds on
average. The cage was approximately 30" x 24", or 6.25 square feet of floor space. The total minimum floor space
required for these rabbits is at least 12 square feet..
Each rabbit housed in a primary enclosure shall be provided a minimum amount of floor space according to USDA
APHIS Animal Welfare Act regulations. Housing rabbits in inappropriately-sized enclosures may stress the animals.
This housing space can lead to increased susceptibility to disease, incompatibility, and fighting. Rabbits must be
housed in enclosures with the minimum required floor space for their health and well-being.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 11/30/2015, 4/12/2016, 9/6/2016 and 12/28/2016.
3.54(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The feeders of four primary enclosures had feces in them. This contamination appeared to be due to the lip of the
feeder being low and an accumulation straw and fecal material around it allowed the fecal material to enter.
Additionally one of these feeders located in the enclosure housing the mother and 6 juvenile rabbits has a
self-feeder in the cage with excessive corrosion, which makes cleaning and sanitation difficult,
The feeders in three primary enclosures had damp and caked feed on one end.One enclosure had an empty and soiled food bowl that was unattached to the enclosure and turned upside down.
Care must be taken when using self-feeders to ensure they are clean, in good repair, and that the food is not
allowed to spoil. Damp, caked feed may mold, becoming unwholesome and unsafe for the animals. Fecal
contamination may spread disease, such as from coccidia. If the feeders are subject to tipping, the facility must
assure that the rabbits are fed at least once daily and assure that the rabbits receive adequate nutrition to maintain
their health.
A system of feeding and feeder maintenance must be in place.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 4/12/2016 and 9/6/2016.
3.55 DIRECT
WATERING.
Upon arriving at the facility, two primary enclosures holding two rabbits each had empty water bottles. Additionally
multiple water bottles in the kindling area inside were empty. When filled by the Facility Manager, the rabbits
immediately started drinking and competed for access to the lixit. The four rabbits continued to drink for
approximately 10 to 12 minutes after the water bottles were refilled. These rabbits were obviously thirsty and
access to water had been limited.
A sufficient amount of potable water must be provided to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.
Corrected for these rabbits at the time of the inspection. Sufficient potable water must be provided daily from this
point forward.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Facility Manager.
