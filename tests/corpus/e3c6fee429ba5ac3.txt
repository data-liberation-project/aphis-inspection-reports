Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:10 pm on 29-SEP-
2021.

Spoke to employees (non-authorized) and left business card with them, asking for them to relay that I needed a call.
On 10/1/2021, I phoned the direct number for a listed authorized person; she told me she is no longer involved with the
business.
The main business line is 100% automated with no ability to leave a message.
