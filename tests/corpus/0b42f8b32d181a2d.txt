FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On Thursday, March 27, 2014, one bear cub was able to gain access to the roof area of its outdoor exhibit area.
The moat had been overfilled due to employee inattention raising the water level high enough that the bear cub
could swim across to the wire fence in the front of the exhibit and climb it. The bear cub was then able to pull itself
up onto the cinder block wall separating the bear and cougar enclosures, walk along the length of the wall, and gain
access to the roof area over the bear enclosure. Appropriate structural and/or procedural modifications must be
made in order to prevent injury to the bear cubs and to safely contain the animals. The facility also must develop a
system to monitor enclosure security and train employees to ensure that animals are securely contained. To be
corrected by: April 27, 2014.
