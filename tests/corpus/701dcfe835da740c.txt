2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
***All dogs must have an official tag on them for identification purposes. At the time of inspection, approximately 10
dogs were not tagged. It is essential to have identification for each dog so that records can be filled out
appropriately and the animal can be tracked as needed. Identification tags must be placed on the remainder of the
dogs.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the whelping room, there were a significant number of flies noted. The licensee is using fly bait to control the flies,
but it is not effective enough. Insects can spread disease, contaminate food supplies by landing on excreta and then
food, and may also affect the comfort of the animals. More effective measures must be taken to minimize the
presence of these insect pests.
