3.77(f)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is no perimeter fence enclosing the outdoor area of the sheltered housing facility for the ring-tailed lemurs. A
perimeter fence protects the lemurs by restricting unauthorized humans and animals from going through it or under
it and having contact with the lemurs. A perimeter fence must be constructed around the outdoor area and it must
be at least 6 feet high, 3 feet away from the primary enclosure wall, and restrict unauthorized persons and animals
from going through it or under it.
