FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Three guinea pigs were housed in a large multilevel enclosure with nesting box outside the barn. The licensee
stated that she was unaware guinea pigs could not be housed outdoors and that they provided a fan during the
summer months. The temperature had dropped below 40 degrees Fahrenheit the last two nights but the animals
were active and appeared healthy at the time of inspection. Exposing guinea pigs to extremes and fluctuations in
temperature can make them more susceptible to disease. Correct by moving the animals indoors and if planning to
house them outside in good weather in the future, obtain prior approval for such outdoor housing from the Deputy
Administrator. Correct by 13 October 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the director.
