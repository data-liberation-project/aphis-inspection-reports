2.33(b)(3) Critical Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Male marmoset (841-550-025 “Hood”) was euthanized 11/11/2020 due to intracranial abscess. This was the second
marmoset that was euthanized due to this problem in 2020. After the female marmoset died in January, the Department of
Comparative Medicine (DCM) veterinarians worked closely with the group to improve training and technique. However,
the male was noted to have scarring and abnormal bone thickness at the craniotomy site on 10/5; DCM was not
contacted to examine it until 10/9. Treatment for infection was started on 10/15 after culture results were positive for
infection.
Prompt reporting of veterinary problems is necessary to ensure proper diagnosis so treatment can be implemented in a
timely manner.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with IACUC and Department of Comparative Medicine personnel.
