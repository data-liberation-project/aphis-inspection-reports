FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The enclosure for the squirrel has a plastic base. The squirrel has been chewing on the base which could be an
ingestion hazard. This base should be replaced with a material that is made of sufficient strength to withstand
normal chewing of the animal. This needs to be addressed for the safety of the squirrel.
