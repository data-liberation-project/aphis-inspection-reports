Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
During the inspection it was discovered that two guinea pigs on the dermal sensitization protocol 17B-02 had lesions that
warranted reporting to veterinary staff. Animal #49363M had a deep wound in the skin measuring 2 inches by ½ an inch
over the shoulders, where two previous injection sites had nearly coalesced. The lesion was dry and dark in color. Animal
49397M also had a lesion measuring about two inches by ½ inch over the shoulders, where two injections sites had
completely coalesced, and this lesion was more pink and moist. The clinical veterinarian stated that these two animals
should be on a “Veterinary Service Request” (VSR), as she had not been aware of their condition. The VSRs are initiated
by the technicians during their AM and PM daily observation animal checks. The animals in this room (176) had been
observed at 7:28 AM on this day, but no VSR was requested for these animals. The Principal Investigator stated that
these two guinea pigs had just had bandages removed, that might have concealed the lesions, between 9 and 10 AM on
this day, however the technicians that removed the bandages did not initiate a VSR either.

Daily observation of all animals at the facility must be done carefully so as to identify any conditions requiring veterinary
assessment and treatment. Failure to provide adequate observation of the animals and report problems to the veterinary
staff could be detrimental to their well-being.



The VSR was initiated at the time of the inspection for these two animals, and appropriate treatment was initiated. To be
corrected from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
