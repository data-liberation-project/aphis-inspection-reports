Contingency planning.
There was no written contingency plan on file at the facility.
Failure to have a written contingency plan can result in lack of readiness for emergencies or disasters.
Facilities must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment,

Facilities, indoor.
There were ten windows in the guinea pig housing facility that required framing. The unframed windows have exposed
wood and insulation which is not impervious to moisture.
Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be cleaned and sanitized and may harbor pathogens that can cause
disease in the guinea pigs.
The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities must be constructed and maintained so they are impervious to
moisture and may be readily sanitized.
3.28(a)(1) Repeat

Primary enclosures.


The metal self feeder in Pen 16 contained 2 sharp points on the lower lip.
Sharp points can cause injury to the guinea pigs.
Primary enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.
