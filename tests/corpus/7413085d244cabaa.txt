2.31(e)(4)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Inspectors reviewed Category E Protocol # 0208. The protocol states that the criteria for euthanasia for regulated
animals in the study will be based on a Pain Assessment scoring guide. Upon inquiry by the inspectors, the
referenced guide is actually not in use at the facility. Another section of the protocol contained a statement that the
criteria for euthanasia would be based on the facility(cid:25)'s humane endpoint policy. Personnel at the facility stated this
policy was current and active and was intended to be used in the protocol for euthanasia selection criteria. The
description of the procedure is not accurate. A proposal to conduct an activity involving animals, or to make
significant changes in an ongoing activity involving animals, must contain a description of procedures designed to
assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited to that which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically
valuable research. The IACUC must review and approve that the description for procedures match the criteria that
is being implemented in the study.
