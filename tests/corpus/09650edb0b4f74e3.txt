OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The public barrier that was located on the right side of the ringtail & ruffed lemurs previously consisted of dense
vegetation which prevented the public from physical contact with these primates. Due to the cold weather that this
area had recently experienced, this vegetation died and this was replaced by one horizontal piece of wood.
This piece of wood does not prevent the public from going up to the exhibit and making physical contact with these
primates.
This exhibit shall have an effective barrier which prevents the public from making contact with these primates.
