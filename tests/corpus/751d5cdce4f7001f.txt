ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1230pm on
09-Jan-18.
I was advised by licensee the previous week that he would be in the area at the beginning of this week. When I
arrived there was a worker there who made contact with the licensee by phone. When I asked the owner when he
would be back in the area, the owner advised he would not be back on this day and would only be around next
week, as he is traveling between states several times a month.
