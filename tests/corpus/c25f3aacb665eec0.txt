SANITATION.
Housekeeping. Buildings and premises must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
facilitate husbandry practices as required under the AWA. The following areas were identified during this inspection
to be damaged or lacking adequate maintenance:
*The concrete floor adjacent to the marine mammal food storage freezer door and frame is damaged and missing
pieces on the exterior side. Continued deterioration of the floor can affect structural integrity and functionality of the
freezer. Holes in the floor prevent adequate cleaning and trap debris that could be tracked into the interior surface of
the freezer contributing to food contamination. The floor should be repaired or replaced. Correct by: March 31,
2018.
*The concrete floor on the exterior side of the marine mammal work room is painted. The paint is damaged, peeling
and chipped adjacent to the work room door. The damaged floor can inhibit appropriate cleaning and loose paint
chips can be tracked to animal areas and accidently ingested. These consequences could compromise animal
health. The floor should be repaired or replaced. Correct by: June 30, 2018.
*The metal latch on the exterior side of the main door to the animal exhibit area is obviously rusted with significant
pitting and structural compromise noted. Continued deterioration could cause the latch to fail and compromise
containment of the animals. The latch should be repaired or replaced. Correct by: January 31, 2018.
*The metal wheel casters on both stainless steel tables in the kitchen area were rusted with resulting flaking of the
metal. Excessive rust can inhibit the required level of cleaning and sanitizing in the food preparation area. The
wheel casters should be repaired or replaced. Correct by: January 31, 2018.
*The large metal brackets on the wall of holding room 3 are excessively rusted with resulting flaking of the metal.
The brackets are no longer used for any purpose and can be removed according to the facility. The large metal
gates in this room are also excessively rusted at the bottom. The metal gates are used for animal containment.
Breakage or failure of the gates could cause injury to the animal. The gates should be repaired or replaced. Correct
by: March 31, 2018.
*The bottom of the metal door on the training kennel used for the harbor seals is rusted with pitting and flaking of
the metal noted. Damage to the door could cause injury to the animal or compromise containment. The door should
be repaired or replaced. Correct by: January 31, 2018.3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
*A metal door frame on both sides of the door separating the learning center food prep area and the nursery is
excessively rusted at the bottom. The metal frame has pieces missing and resulting holes.
*Pieces of tile are missing from the wall adjacent to a second door in the learning center food prep area.
*The window ledge and frame in the learning center food prep area are damaged, missing pieces and support metal
is exposed.
Premises and buildings must be kept in good repair. Structural damage can prevent adequate cleaning and
sanitizing, retain additional moisture facilitating mold or bacterial growth and provide hiding spaces for pests. The
damaged areas should be repaired or replaced. Correct by June 30, 2018.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Pest control. The facility has a pest control program in place. In most animal areas the program is implemented and
maintained by the facility rather than a commercial vendor. Strategic location and placement of bait for vermin
control in the rain forest may allow exhibited bats direct access to the bait. Accidental ingestion or contact with a
toxic product could cause harm to the animals. Additionally, during this inspection a few live insects were noted in
an animal secondary area outside the rain forest.
The facility has not recently reviewed the pest control program in animal areas using outside resources, consultants
or pest control professionals. The current program should be reviewed and adjusted as needed for both animal
safety and effectiveness of control for insect and rodent pests. Correct by: January 31, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with APHIS personnel, the animal husbandry manager and
assistant curators.
