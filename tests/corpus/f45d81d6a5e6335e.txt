ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
(b)(2)
*A female agouti (more rust colored over the back than the other female) had a significant area of alopecia
(approximately 6(cid:29)x 3(cid:29)) near the mid-back. Obvious hair thinning was also noted on the back behind the bald spot
extending toward the rear of the animal. The skin did not appear to be inflamed. Facility staff indicated they were
unaware of the hair loss and the attending veterinarian had not been consulted.
*A female, adult pied tamarin had patchy areas of hair loss on the hindquarters and rear legs. Skin may have been
minimally inflamed or crusted along the spine and the tail was devoid of any hair. Facility staff indicated the alopecia
was a chronic problem but had improved over the years. Medical records did not contain a diagnosis or treatment
plan and the last documented entry regarding the hair loss was in 2011.
Hair loss can be an indication of external parasites, systemic disease or behavioral issues. Both animals should
receive veterinary evaluations that include diagnosis, proposed treatment plan and prognosis where applicable.

physical, hematology, blood chemistry and any other diagnostic tests deemed necessary. The manatee housed at
this facility was last examined in this context in June 2014. The attending veterinarian must perform the required

WATERING.
***** The enclosure housing a two-toed sloth and two large birds does not provide an adequate source of potable
water. The enclosure contains a pond-like structure and water fall with re-circulating water. The water in the pond
was brown, appeared dirty and contained floating debris including bird feathers. The birds are likely accessing the
pond and contaminating the water. Unsanitary water could cause illness in the sloth or may not be palatable and
contribute to dehydration. Potable water must be provided and water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.
