2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On October 3, 2016, at approximately 11:30pm, USDA was notified by the director of the sanctuary that Boomer, a
male tiger, was loose from his enclosure. The licensee stated that he had forgotten to close the guillotine door to
Boomer's enclosure when he went into the porta-storage unit to medicate Asia, a female tiger, who shared the
shelter with Boomer. The licensee was unable to get Boomer back in his enclosure safely. Local law enforcement
was notified and arrived on scene where they were able to get the licensee into their vehicle and then located the
loose tiger. Boomer attempted to leave his enclosure and was shot by local law enforcement. After being shot, the
tiger spun around and ran back into his enclosure where he died. The licensee was injured during the escape.
While loose, Boomer attacked a horned heifer and one American bison. The heifer had obvious injuries consistent
with claw marks or bite wounds on both of her rear legs and back end. The smaller bison was very stiff and reluctant
to move. These injured animals were examined by the attending veterinarian. A diagnosis was made and treatment
was administered to the animals.
The licensee must ensure that all animals are handled as expeditiously and carefully as possible to prevent trauma,
behavioral stress, unnecessary discomfort and physical harm.
Correction date: From this point forward.
