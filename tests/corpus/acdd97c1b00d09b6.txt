2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There is no record of the animals that are currently being housed and held for breeding purposes (animal inventory).
Likewise, there has been no record kept of offspring born to those animals, which were subsequently either kept for
continued breeding or sold at retail. Without this information, it is difficult to verify that the animals were obtained
appropriately by the dealer, and that all of the offspring born were sold through appropriate methods. Dealers shall keep
and maintain records disclosing the name and address of the person from whom the animals were acquired, the date of
acquisition, the number and species in the shipment, and include all offspring born while in the dealer's possession.

Sales records were complete as required by this section of the regulations.

Correct by making and maintaining records of animals on hand that are purchased, acquired, or otherwise held by the
dealer, including all offspring born to those animals while in the dealer's possession.

Sanitation.


There was excreta and waste buildup present in the pans beneath enclosures as well as scattered on the floor
surrounding the cages. According to the facility representative, the enclosures had not been cleaned in over a week.
Failure to perform sufficient cleaning in the enclosures and surrounding areas can increase the likelihood of disease
transmission and can increase odor in the area. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures and the premises
where animals are held are kept clean and in good repair in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth
in this subpart.
