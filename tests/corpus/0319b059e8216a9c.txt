Primary enclosures.
There were bent wires near the feeders in some of the guinea pig pens. In Pen 9, there was a bent wire with a sharp
point on the interior of the pen. In Pen 5 there was a bent wire with a gap approximately 2 inches in size.
Bent wires with sharp points and gaps in enclosures can cause injury to the animals or can lead to animals escaping their
enclosures.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs
from injury.

Feeding.
Approximately 25% of the enclosures had feeders with a large amount of ground up powder and caked feed in the trough
of the feeder and little to no pelleted feed available.
Failure to provide access to pelleted feed can lead to decreased feed consumption which may negatively affect the health
of the animals.
The facility must ensure measures are taken to prevent deterioration or caking of the feed in the self feeders.


3.31(a)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
Several of the guinea pig pens contained an accumulation of cobwebs hanging from the sides and ceilings of the
enclosures. There were also cobwebs around some of the feeders and water bottles. In addition, Pen 19 contained an
accumulation of soiled bedding with excess fecal material.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the enclosure,
and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material and
sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.
