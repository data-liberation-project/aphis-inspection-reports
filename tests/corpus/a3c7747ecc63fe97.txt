3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
When entering the indoor building, the inspector noted a strong odor. There is currently insufficient air movement
with the building (which is closed against the cold) to prevent the odor. Fresh air with air movement, or increasing
cleaning frequency, or maintaining a smaller population of animals within the building is needed so respiratory
problems will not develop. Strong odors are both unpleasant and potentially harmful to the animals.
