PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
At the time of the inspection the trailer that is used to transport the dogs was inspected. There is a small "people
door" in the back of the trailer that is in need of attention. The door frame had been damaged. The inner portion of
the door knob is missing and the strike plate is damaged. Therefore, the door can not be properly closed. Although
this door is a secondary door into the back of the trailer, it will need to be repaired to ensure no animals escape
once the larger, trailer doors are opened.
