2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Multiple changes, including one significant change, were made to a protocol in consultation with the attending
veterinarian, but these were never submitted to the IACUC for a designated member review as outlined in the institutional
policy regarding modifications of protocols. Protocol # 4274, involving woodchucks, was approved by the IACUC in
approximately June 2019. The PI and veterinary technician both separately stated that in the summer of 2020, they had a
discussion with the attending veterinarian which led to significant changes in the protocol. These were based on previous
experience with animals in the study and would ultimately improve animal welfare. The changes made include: 1)
switching from an injectable sedative to a strictly inhalant anesthetic for imaging and blood sampling; 2) changing the
vascular access location for obtaining blood; 3) removing intubation in favor of masking during longer procedures or
altogether for very short procedures such as imaging; and 4) discontinuing the use of an injectable medication in favor of
an oral drug. According to the PI, vet tech and animal medical records, the modified protocol was implemented soon after
the discussion. However, the current approved protocol on record with the IACUC and reviewed during this inspection
does not reflect these changes.

Making changes to a protocol without seeking IACUC review and approval does not allow the IACUC to perform adequate


oversight into the use of animals for medical research.

Correct by allowing the IACUC to review and either approve, require modifications in, or withhold approval of proposed
significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities. The institution immediately took steps to
make the appropriate modifications to the protocol and allow review by the IACUC at the time of the exit interview.

2.31(e)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocol 4274 is missing multiple required components. The IACUC approved protocol on file and reviewed during the
inspection is missing details regarding blood sampling, agent administration, and euthanasia method. Specifically, the
protocol does not include: 1) blood sampling procedures performed to determine inclusion criteria for treatment in the
study; 2) IV administration of a histopathological tracer to a group of animals who recover for a short time prior to
euthanasia; 3) specific procedures regarding the method of euthanasia. The protocol only states that the veterinary staff
will perform euthanasia. The institution’s policy on euthanasia only references generic humane methods.

Incomplete descriptions of procedures do not allow the IACUC to fully understand and review the proposed activities
involving animal use. This oversight is crucial to monitoring and enforcing animal welfare standards in research.

Correct by ensuring that all protocols submitted to the IACUC for review contain all five components listed in this
subsection, including a complete description of the proposed use of the animals and a description of any euthanasia
method to be used. The institution immediately took steps to add detail to the protocol and allow review by the IACUC at


the time of the exit interview.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian, IACUC and compliance personnel.
