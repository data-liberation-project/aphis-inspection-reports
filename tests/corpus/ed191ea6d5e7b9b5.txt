3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the squirrel monkey housing room, dried excreta was observed on the floor of some enclosures. Some
enclosures were noted to have walnut-sized amounts of dried feces, while two enclosures were noted to each have
approximately 3x3" pile of fecal material on the enclosure floor. Two hard rubber enrichment items were noted to be
covered with feces. The facility manager confirmed that the room had already been serviced that morning by animal
care staff. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot cleaned daily to prevent the
accumulation of excreta.
