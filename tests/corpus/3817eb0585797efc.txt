RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The APHIS Forms 7005 were missing information throughout most of the forms that were reviewed. At least 7 dogs
were missing the last name of the person of who they were purchased from. At least 14 dogs were missing the
address of the person/business of where they came from. One dog had no information listed as to where it came
from. The name, address, and date acquired spaces were all blank for that dog.
Not providing complete and accurate information does not allow for proper tracking of the animals by an APHIS
official. All acquisition information must be documented for all regulated animals. Correct by 11/23/18.
3.6(c)(1)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At least one primary enclosures was too small for the dogs it contained. The enclosure contained a brown female
Poodle (microchip #956 000009902957) and four nursing puppies. The enclosure measured 21.875 inches by
28.375 inches for a total space of 620.7 square inches of space. The female dog measured 19 inches long. Her
and her four puppies required 750 square inches of space. They were short by 129.3 square inches of space.
Cage space requirements ensure that the dogs have enough room to move about freely within their cages. It
minimizes the dogs from stepping or sitting in their feces or urine and also minimizes the spread of disease. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet the
minimum floor space requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that enclosure. Correct
immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
