2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the petting zoo, one Boer goat and one pig had excessive hoof growth on their hind feet. The Boer goat had a
slow gait and the pig would not stand on the hind feet.
***A mature Aoudad ram that was housed with the Rhinoceros had extremely long hooves on both of his front feet
and at least one of the hind feet (right). When exiting the barn, the ram had to kick his front feet in a high manner
which caused a gait that was not normal. Once he crossed the mud area just outside of the barn, he knelt on his
knees for a short period of time prior to regaining his balance to continue attempting to walk. Another Auodad in
this enclosure was observed with a gait that was not normal in both of the hind legs. This Auodad had high
stepping, wide, spastic, swinging gait as it attempted to walk. A third Auodad in this enclosure was thin. Hip bones
and a portion of the spinal bones were protruding. This Auodad also had a rough hair coat across the shoulders,
down the sides and to the top of the hips. The licensee stated that all of the hooves had been trimmed. The
attending veterinarian was made aware in the past of the Auodad ram that presents with long hooves, yet this
continues to be an issue for this animal. The licensee was unaware of the thin Auodad and the Auodad with the
spastic gait.
***Although the attending veterinarian was made aware of the Male Pere David's Deer that had a front left hoof that
appeared to be twisted approximately 90 degrees outward from the other three hooves and had a long hoof on the
last report, there is no proof of direction for treatment for this issue. This male maneuvers with a limp on the affect
leg.
***A female goat in the nursery area had a large severely bilaterally deformed udder. The licensee stated she had
mastitis last year when she kidded and he treated her. The inspector asked the licensee if the veterinarian had
examined this animal for the mastitis. The licensee stated the veterinarian had not examined this animal. Mastitis is
a painful and uncomfortable condition and this animal has a malformed udder likely secondary to an inappropriately
treated mastitis.
The attending veterinarian must be made aware of changes in animals health in order to adequately diagnose and
treat them. The licensee must have the above listed animals assessed by the attending veterinarian for appropriatediagnosis and treatment plan. The licensee must follow the treatment plan and assure that all of the animals are
provided with adequate veterinary care as required.
2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***According to the licensee the following animal deaths have occurred:
Twenty Axis Deer over a period of the past year. In this case, the animals died suddenly and unexpectedly.
A newborn Axis Deer was born two weeks ago. The licensee stated that the buzzards ate the deer. A newborn Gaur
calf was born about two months ago. The licensee stated that the buzzards ate the Gaur.
The attending veterinarian was not notified about any of these animal deaths, nor does the licensee know how the
animals died. Without appropriate methods to diagnose and treat injuries and illness, animal conditions may
worsen or in this case, the animals condition may become fatal. The licensee must have timely and accurate
communication with the attending veterinarian as required.
