ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) needs current documentation that it has been reviewed by the
Attending Veterinarian (AV).The most recent signature is over two years old.
The PVC must be periodically reviewed to ensure it is current and relevant to the species held. Having the AV initial
and date the PVC serves to document that this review is occurring.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The shelter for the zebras held near the house has a damaged metal panel, resulting in a large hole in the wall and
exposed metal edges. This damaged area poses a risk of injury to the animals in the enclosure.
The housing and enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

SEPARATION.
Male zebras in the enclosure furthest from the house have been fighting during breeding season and one is lame on
the right front leg. While the enclosure is large and has visual barriers to allow the two groups of zebras to coexist
for the majority of the year, breeding season increases the incidence of fighting. Additionally, zebras nearer the
house in enclosures adjacent to each other were fighting through the fence upon my arrival on-site.Fighting between the males is to be expected during breeding season. Separating the animals during this time by
moving some to different, non-adjacent enclosures, or in some other effective way, will reduce the chances for
injury.
Correct by: breeding season each year.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the farm manager.
