PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two pens located inside on the north side of the kennel building were found to have sharp points protruding into
their interior enclosures from tin repairs done on their doorways. The corners of the sheet metal were exposed from
the wall/door surface and were at level where they could make contact with animals in the enclosure. The exposed
sharp corners of tin are a potential injury risk to dogs occupying the kennels.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points which could injure the
dogs.

3.6(a)(2)(ix)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two enclosures located on the north side of the kennel building were found to have worn or chewed areas on the
doorways leading to the exterior runs. There was exposure of underlying wood in these worn areas.
Exposed and unprotected wood surfaces absorb moisture and can make it more difficult to adequately sanitize
those surfaces.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained in a manner that enables all surfaces in contact with the
dogs to be readily sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b) or replaceable when worn or soiled.

WATERING.
A blue plastic wading pool located in the outdoor yard area on the north side of the house was found to have
brown water in it with some leaf material floating on the water surface. Several dogs were observed jumping into thepool and drinking water from the pool during the USDA inspection.
Two water bowls located west and south of the pool were found to have accumulated debris in them.
Two bowls located in the fenced area immediately south of the kennel buidling were also found to have debris
accumulated in them.
Water receptacles that contain accumulated debris or unclean water may pose a health hazard to dogs drinking
from those receptacles.
Potable water must be offered to the dogs as often as necessary to ensure their health and well-being. All water
receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b).

3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Twelve interior pens located in the kennel building were found to have a significant accumulation of dirt and grime
on enclosure floors, walls and doors. Food and water receptacles within enclosures were also found to have a
buildup of grime on their surfaces. Accumulation of grime and dirt on enclosure surfaces and food and water
receptacles makes it harder to adequately sanitize enclosures and receptacles.
Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks
using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was a large amount of clutter inside the main kennel building, outside the kennel area in the fenced area
where dogs are allowed to run, and inside the kennel area of the house.
Accumulation of trash, junk or other materials not routinely used in kennel operations may make it more difficult to
adequately clean and sanitize animal areas, may pose a potential harbor for insect and animal pests , and also a
potential place for animal injury.Correct by 05-22-2018.
