3.103(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility erected an additional perimeter fence on the south side of their newly acquired property. This fence
does not extend all the way to the shoreline and persons can easily gain access to the facility from the adjacent
property. The east side of this new perimeter fence is broken & wobbly in several areas.
The old fence-line on this south side which formally served as the perimeter is in disrepair and is no longer 6 feet
high. There is heavy vegetation along to top of this fence causing the barbed wire to come down in some areas.
This condition has made the fence less than the required 6 feet.
The designated perimeter fence (either the old or new one) shall be complete, at least 6 feet high, and be in good
repair.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
At the time of the inspection the male California Sea Lion was confined to the upper housing area. Within this area
there are 2 pools of water. The larger pool is square measuring 9 feet 4 inches by 9 feet 4 inches. This gives this
pool a MHD of 9 feet 4 inches. The required MHD for a male Sea Lion is 10.95 feet (7.3 x 1.5).
During the breeding season, which last approx 4-5 months (June-Sept/Oct), the male is separated from the 2
females to prevent pregnancy. It is recognized that the male & females are rotated between the upper housing
areas and the lagoon. There are no records to document how long each pinniped sex is being housed in the upper
housing area; and neither the management (nor the trainers) know the amount of time(s) in each location for sure.
There is no SOP for these rotations and this practice has not been approved by the attending veterinarian. Without
this information a determination of compliance cannot be made.
Marine mammals that are isolated or separated for nonmedical purposes must be held in facilities that meet all of
the minimum space requirements.Correct by July 15, 2014
