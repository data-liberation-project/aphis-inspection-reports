2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care instructs the licensee to apply revolution and frontline monthly to the cats in the
summertime. I asked if the licensee if she has been doing this and she stated she has not. She does not even
have the revolution or frontline in stock to be able to give it to them. Not following the Program of Veterinary Care
doesn't ensure that the cats are receiving proper treatment or care. The Program of Veterinary Care must be
followed from here on out. Correct by 9/27/17.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female tabby colored (black, brown, and white) with no identification had nasal discharge. The licensee had not
contacted the Attending Veterinarian and was not treating the cat. The licensee stated she was watching the cat for
someone else, but the cat was in with other regulated cats and was on exhibit. Untreated veterinary care problems
in animals can cause them prolonged discomfort and if not treated conditions could worsen. It can also spread to
her other cats. Ensure that animals with veterinary care problems are seen by the veterinarian and treated as
prescribed. Correct by 9/22/17.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee did not have acquisition or inventory records for 3 deer, 9 sheep, 12 rabbits, 3 pigs, 5 llamas, and 1
cow. Lack of accurate and up-to-date inventory and acquisition records does not ensure for the proper tracking of
the animals by APHIS Officials as necessary. Update the facility inventory and acquisition records with all required
information so they accurately reflect the current inventory of animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
