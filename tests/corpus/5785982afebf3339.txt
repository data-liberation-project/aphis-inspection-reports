Facilities, general.
The river otter pond is leaking and must be refilled every two to three days as per the facility representative. The pond’s
water level was two to three feet below normal water level during the inspection. The low water level barely allows the
otters to submerge themselves into the water while swimming. The facility representative indicated the pond liner has
been repaired multiple times because of leaks. Ensure the pond is maintained in good repair.

In the outdoor hyena enclosure, there is a large hole in the ground next to the access building. The hole is filled with dirty
water. The hyena moved rocks from the area and dug the hole as per the facility representative. The facility
representative also indicated the water is the result of rain runoff from the roof. The hole and dirty water are a potential
hazard to the animal. Ensure the hyena enclosure is maintained in good repair.

Facilities, outdoor.
One section of the perimeter fence is not six feet tall. The non-public entrance into the facility comprises part of the
perimeter fence. This entrance has a livestock gate that is less than six feet tall and has spaces between the bars large
enough for unauthorized persons and animals to go through it. The gate previously had metal paneling attached that was
six feet tall and prohibited unauthorized persons and animals from gaining access to the facility. The facility
representative indicated the paneling was damaged by a lawn mower and subsequently removed, but never replaced.

Sanitation.
Excessive amounts of string algae were present in the river otter pond during the inspection. Both otters were observed
swimming through the algae. One otter had some algae on its head when it exited the water and proceeded to the exhibit
window. Excessive algae could make the animals ill. Remove the algae and maintain the otter pond to minimize disease
hazards.
