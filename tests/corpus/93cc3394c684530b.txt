3.75(a)

Housing facilities, general.
The outdoor housing enclosures for the gibbons and lemurs are supplied with heat lamps with cords that are accessible
by the animals. Electric cords are a possible shock hazard to non human primates if they are manipulated by the animals,
which could cause injury or death. The facility shall ensure that housing for the animals protects them from potential
injury.

Corrected during inspection.
3.78(d)

Outdoor housing facilities.
Seasonal outdoor housing for some of the non human primates is behind a long (>250 ft) wooden pallisade perimeter
fence that measures only 67 inches in height along the road separating the facility from the parking lot, and adjacent to
the gift shop and entry to the zoo. Outdoor housing for non human primates must be at least 6 feet in height to protect the
animals and restrict entry by humans and animals the size of dogs, skunks and raccoons. The facility must ensure the
perimeter fence meets the height requirement to protect the non human primates.
