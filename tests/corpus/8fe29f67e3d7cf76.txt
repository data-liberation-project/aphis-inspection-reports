2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Adult dogs are not officially identified. Proper identification allows for tracking of dogs into, within, and out of the
kennel. All adult dogs older than 16 weeks of age must be officially identified at all times.
2.50(a)(2) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
One weaned puppy from a separate litter is being housed together in the same primary enclosure with three
weaned puppies of another litter. Co-mingling of separate litters can complicate individual animal identification.
Puppies from separate litters housed together must be individually identified.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an excessive amount of excreta on the floor in the the large shelter housing 4 weaned puppies. Excessive
excreta can increase disease transmission as well as soil the puppies. Feces must be removed from the primary
enclosure on a daily basis.
