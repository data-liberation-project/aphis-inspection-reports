NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.
The inspector arrived at the facility to conduct an inspection and found the house completely empty of all items. Two
men were working on putting the finishing touches on a renovation of the house and yard. The contractor stated he
started fixing up the home two weeks ago for the landlord/owner after the people living there had moved out. No
forwarding address was submitted to APHIS Animal Care by the registrant as evidenced in the database. Changes
in address of a carrier are necessary to allow for inspections under the Animal Welfare Act. A registrant shall notify
Animal Care by certified mail of any change in the name, address, ownership or other change in operations
affecting its status within 10 days after making such change. Correct by 2/28/2020.

February 12, 2020. No one was at the house-it was completely empty. Left messages at both phone numbers.
Waited 30 minutes for return phone call before leaving.
An inspection and exit interview were not able to be conducted.
