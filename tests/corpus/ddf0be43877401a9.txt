FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The room holding the birds, primates, and exotic pocket pets smells strongly of ammonia. Ammonia is irritating to
the eyes and respiratory system.
Frequent cleaning (as frequent as necessary), increased ventilation, and ensuring that all of the the interior surfaces
of the room stay sealed will help maintain healthy air quality.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Due to the extreme weather overnight, a few of the animals (pig, 2 young tigers, red fox) had excess water in their
enclosures, and very little dry resting area. With more rain and wind forecast, this must be addressed immediately.
Exposure to wet and windy conditions is uncomfortable, stressful, and can predispose them to illness. Plans are
underway to remedy the situation by the end of today.
