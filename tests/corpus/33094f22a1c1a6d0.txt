* Outdoor enclosure three counting from east, housing two adult dogs, has a wire protruding into the enclosure.
This wire is at head level of the dogs in normal standing position. This protruding wire could cause injury to the
dogs. All enclosures must be free of sharp protruding points that could injure the dogs.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces(3) Cleaning.
* The outdoor enclosures, housing seven adult dogs, have an excessive accumulation of fecal waste and snow and
ice in the enclosures. This accumulation of waste and snow and ice indicates daily spot-cleaning is not taking
place. The accumulation of waste and snow and ice can increase disease hazards, and can allow for the dogs to
get wet during the winter time period for the area. The concrete flooring must be spot cleaning daily and sanitized
when necessary. Daily spot cleaning and sanitization will decrease disease hazards, and will keep the snow and
ice out of the enclosure preventing the dogs from getting wet.

accordance to Section 3.11(b) to prevent an accumulation of debris and decrease disease hazards for the dogs.
