ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45AM on
17-Jul-17.The inspector knocked on the front door of the facility and received no answer. The inspector then called
the phone number on file. There is no voicemail box set up for the number on file so no message was left. The
inspector then waited 30 minutes in-front of the driveway of the facility before exiting the area at 11:15AM.
Lack of availability for inspection prevents any oversight by APHIS Officials in enforcement of the Animal Welfare
Act. Correct by establishing optimal hours for inspection with the home inspector, and ensuring that a responsible
adult is available during those times for inspection.
