RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection records of animal births and deaths were not recorded since September 15, 2014 for
the guinea pigs. Records must be kept on animal births and deaths for animal tracking, assessment of the animal
care program, and to comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that records on animal
births and death are kept and maintained.
