2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
This is a search inspection.
The facility currently sells regulated mammals (degus, spiny mice and African Dormice) at the Birdytown Exotics pet store
in Jackson TN without a valid USDA license. The store manager removed the cages housing the degus, spiny mice and
African Dormice from the front of the pet store to the back area out of public view during the inspection. The manager
stated they will be applying for a USDA license.
A valid license is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals and to comply with the Animal Welfare Act
and Regulations. The facility needs to obtain a USDA license or discontinue regulated activities.
No regulated activities may be conducted until USDA license is obtained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the store manager.
