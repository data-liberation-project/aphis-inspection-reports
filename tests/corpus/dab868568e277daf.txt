2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Appropriate methods.
DIRECT: The licensee euthanized a couple pigs today using an unacceptable euthanasia method. The licensee is
using gun shot for their method of routine euthanasia, which is also the method listed on their written Program of
Veterinary Care (PVC). Gunshot is not considered an acceptable method of routine euthanasia. The licensee in
conjunction with their attending veterinarian must discuss and determine a more acceptable method of routine
euthanasia to ensure pain, distress and negative effects to the animal are minimized. Correct by 8 April 2015.

The PVC does not include sufficient detail to determine if appropriate methods are being used on routine care given
to the animals including vaccinations and ectoparasites. The PVC lacks the frequency and age(s) of administering
the listed vaccinations and the frequency and product names of the spray and fly bait used for controlling
ectoparasites. The lack of detail does not allow for proper evaluation on the methods being used. The licensee in
conjunction with their attending veterinarian must update the PVC to ensure it contains all pertinent information
relating to the veterinary care provided to the animals. Correct by 20 April 2015.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
Food, and food receptacles.
The pigs in the north barn are currently being fed directly on the concrete floor of their enclosures. These
enclosures currently house 215 animals. Most of these enclosures had feces present where the grain was located
on the floor. A recent routine test done by the facility showed the presence of parasites in some of the pigs tested
and the results noted it to be related to the food placement. Feeding directly on the floor allows for fecal
contamination of the food, which contaminates the food and increases risk of diseases. The licensee must place
food in a manner and location that minimizes contamination such as food receptacles. Correct by 20 April 2015.
3.131(d)SANITATION.
Pest Control.
There was a large presence of flying insects in the farrowing/lactation housing area, which currently houses 364
pigs. The licensee stated that sprays and fly bait are used to control insect populations; however, the current pest
control plan is not effective based on the huge insect population present. Additionally, there were several sparrows
caught inside the north barn housing area for 215 pigs with visual evidence that they are accessing the swine feed.
The presence of these avian species in and around food could bring disease to the pigs. Licensee must modify the
insect and avian pest control plans to better effectively minimize insects and avian pests to provide for the health
and well-being of the animals. Correct by 20 April 2015.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
