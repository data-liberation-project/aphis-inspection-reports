3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
On January 21, 2021, the inspector received a phone call from the facility stating a vole was euthanized on January 5,
2021 due to dehydration from getting its teeth caught on the airflow diffuser built into its cage. Previously there had been 2
other voles that experienced similar incidents without any adverse health effects. Construction of caging which allows for
potential injury is non-compliant with the Animal Welfare Act. Correct by ensuring the construction of animal cages is
maintained such that it protects animals from injury. The facility has already corrected this by providing a mesh cover over
the airflow diffuser.

Correct by: From this time forward. The corrective actions for this particular incident have been implemented at the time of
inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.
