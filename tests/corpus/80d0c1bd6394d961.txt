ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The licensee did not have an appropriate plan for environment enhancement for the two nonhuman primates that
were on exhibit during the time of inspection. An environment enhancement plan must be in accordance with the
currently accepted professional standards and should meet the needs of all nonhuman primates at their facility.
This plan needs to be evaluated and signed by the attending veterinarian and made available to APHIS upon
request. This plan is important for promoting the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates, and must address
social needs, environmental enrichment, and any special considerations.
To be corrected by July 29, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative at the travel location of Brockton
Fair, MA on June 29, 2017.
