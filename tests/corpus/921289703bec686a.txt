2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****An adult, female Shih Tzu named "Polly" (m/c# 072-789-380) was not receiving veterinary care for a problem
with her left eye. The entire surface of the eye was cloudy and the normally white portion of the eye had multiple
engorged blood vessels. A crusty discharge was present. Untreated eye problems can be painful, can progress
rapidly, and can result in vision loss. The same dog had a large amount of rough, brown material covering most of
her teeth, to the point that the teeth could not be visualized. Dental problems can be painful, can result in gum
disease, and can affect the overall health of the dog. The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian
and keep a record of the treatment given.
****Four medications that were in the dog buildings and ready for use were expired. A bottle of Hi-Vite drops
expired January, 2014; a bottle of Vetericyn spray expired November, 2011; a bottle of Clavamox tablets expired
April 1, 2014; and a bottle of SafeGuard dewormer expired May, 2013.
Expired medications or vaccines can lose their effectiveness and their ability to prevent or control disease and/or
pain. The licensee must ensure that all medications and vaccines are within their expiration dates at all times.

3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c)(1)(i) EXCESSIVE RUST.
Three enclosures, housing a total of 6 Eskimo dogs, had excessive rust that was affecting the structural strength of
the enclosures. One enclosure had a gate that had rusted to the point that it had broken completely through, one
enclosure had a support bar below the gate that had large holes in it due to rust, and one enclosure had a gate with
large holes due to rust. Excessive rust prevents proper cleaning and sanitization and can affect structural strength.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are free of excessive rust and must repair or replace worn and broken
surfaces.

half of the floor. Also, the majority of the outdoor pens had an excessive amount of fecal waste in them. The
