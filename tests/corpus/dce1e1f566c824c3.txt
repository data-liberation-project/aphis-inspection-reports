FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence is in disrepair in many locations:
There are several areas which were observed where there are holes under the perimeter fence that are either
caused by feral animals digging underneath and/or soil erosion. These holes are large enough to allow feral animals
to pass under the perimeter fence. Feral animals pose a risk of harm or disease to the zoo's collection and should
not gain access to the zoo grounds.
Failure to prevent wild animals from entering the facility can lead to the exposure to injures, diseases or
parasites,and this can adversely affect the health and well-being of the regulated animals.
The perimeter fence shall be in good repair, and constructed and maintained so that it prevents unauthorized
persons and animals from going through it, and also must function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the zoo.
A regular inspection and maintenance program for the perimeter fence shall be established and maintained at all
times.

Around the back of the zoo (to the golf club) close to the perimeter fence (in some cases touching the perimeter
fence) was observed different Piles of building materials (rocks, pieces of metal structures, pieces of trees, etc) that
are between 3 to 6 feet height off the ground. These materials in the current locations reduces the effective height of
the perimeter fence. and so that it can't function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
All the construction materials trash and any other type of structure that is close to the perimeter fence and can
reduce the containment effectiveness, should be removed, and a plan to keep the perimeter fence clean and in
good repair, shall be established and maintained at all times.Also was found that many trees are too close to the perimeter fence and/or had branches going in or out over the
perimeter fence, which would allow animals or persons to gain access to the zoo. This needs to be fixed in a
manner that the trees and branches can't be used to access the zoo.
The perimeter fence must function as a proper secondary containment system for the animals in the zoo.

SANITATION.
Rodents feces were found in the food storage areas and around the corners in most of the buildings,and also there
was an excessive buildup of bird droppings in some of the buildings.
Contact with birds, and their droppings and rodents feces contamination around the food storage areas are a risk for
the health and well being of the animals.
The rodents, insects and birds are known source of multiple infections diseases for mammals.
A working safe and effective pest control program shall be established and maintained on the permanent basis.
