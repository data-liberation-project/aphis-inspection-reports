ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
While Irina (goat) visually appears normal, upon palpation she is very thin. All of her ribs and spinal column can be
easily felt with very little mass over these areas.
Irina had her last physical exam by the attending veterinarian on May 31, 2016. At that time she weighed 66 lbs
and her medical record indicated that her weight was normal for her age, size, & breed. On today's inspection she
weighed 52.8 lbs.
Since the fleece/hair of animals can mask weight loss visually, the keepers should either touch the goats to
determine if they are becoming thin and/or periodically weigh them to determine if there is any weight loss. This
would then then be reported in a timely manner to management and the veterinarian so that treatment may be
instituted quickly to reduce further weight loss and suffering.
Have your veterinarian re-examine Irina and treat her accordingly based upon his examination.
