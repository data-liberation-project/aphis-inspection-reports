HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(e) Storage.
The licensee was not properly storing her unopened supply of dog food. She had one remaining bag of dog food
and it was being stored on the floor of a three-sided carport. Animals had torn two holes in the top of the bag and
one larger hole in the bottom of the bag. Over half of the contents of the bag were missing. Dog food must be
properly stored to prevent spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The licensee must ensure that all
unopened supplies of dog food are stored off of the floor and away from the walls to allow cleaning underneath and
around the supplies. The licensee must store dog food in a manner and location that prevents vermin and other
animals from entering the bags.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JULY 28, 2015.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
