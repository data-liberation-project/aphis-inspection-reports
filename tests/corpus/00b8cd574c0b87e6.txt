3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The facility was in the process of covering the chewed wood in the 35 wooden pens with a hard plastic. There were
still 11 pens in which the wooden sides of the enclosure are chewed, worn down, and have exposed unsealed
wood.
Exposed unsealed wood is not impervious to moisture and cannot be easily cleaned and sanitized which can
increase disease spread through improper sanitation.
Enclosures for guinea pigs must be kept structurally sound, maintained in good repair, and constructed of material
that is substantially impervious to moisture.
Correct by repairing the exposed wood.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
