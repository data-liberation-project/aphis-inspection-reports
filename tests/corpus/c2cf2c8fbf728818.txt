ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Records were reviewed for one young male baboon,30938. They state he died as a result of septicemia from
trauma wounds. Clinical records indicate that this animal had a clean health check and was in good body condition
approximately 3 weeks before his death. At time of the health check on 10/28/13, the animal was relocated to a new
enclosure which housed a large number of male baboons. Daily observational logs during this time period do not
document an animal with wounds. They do not indicate any behavioral observation of the newly introduced animal
for acceptance into the group. The necropsy report states the animal was emaciated at time of death and had
multiple scabs from bite wounds on the body and a large abscess on the leg and ankle. The description of the
wounds and body condition indicate that the animal had injuries for many days before its death. The animal
received no care for his injuries as it was not identified or reported to the veterinary staff.
Records were reviewed for an adult female rhesus, 29458. This animal was placed in a newly formed group of
conspecifics in building 134 in March 2013. Sometime prior to September 2013 this animal suffered a tail de gloving
injury. On October 30, 2013 the animal was involved in a second traumatic episode and sustained injuries that
included multiple lacerations to the face and body. A portion of the tail was also amputated during the altercation. A
staff veterinarian stated during this inspection that the injuries were severe enough to warrant assessment of the
group by the facility behavior team. There is no documentation that any behavior assessment of the individual or
group was performed post injury.
An adequate program of veterinary care includes daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-
being. Daily observation may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian, but there must be
direct and frequent communication so timely and accurate information on problems with animal health, behavior and
well - being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
Newly introduced animals must be observed for adjustment issues and animals with trauma wounds must be
promptly identified and the behavior and vet staff promptly notified for intervention to provide adequate veterinary
care to the animals.

2.36(b)(7) REPEATANNUAL REPORT.
The annual report submitted for 2013 does not accurately report the number of animals involved in studies that had
accompanying pain or distress that did not receive anesthetic, analgesics or tranquilizing drugs as the
administration of such would have adversely affected the results of the project. One non human primate on
protocol,1327 CJ ,was improperly reported. The annual report must be amended and resubmitted to include an
accurate count of the number of animals affected.
The inspection and exit briefing was conduced on June 2-4 2014 with the attending veterinarian and facility
employees.
