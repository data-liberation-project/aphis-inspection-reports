FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the enclosure housing sheep, goats, and zebu the shelter is in disrepair. One tin wall is detached from the frame
causing numerous sharp points to be exposed. There is a broken base board along this detached wall. Damaged
facilities and exposed sharp points pose a potential injury risk to enclosed animals. The licensee must repair or
replace these physical structures to protect the welfare of the animals.
