2.125 Critical

Information as to business; furnishing of same by dealers, exhibitors, operators of auction sales, intermediate
handlers, and carriers.
The facility failed to furnish requested records in a reasonable time. On December 9, 2022, an APHIS official requested
an itemized list of records required by the Animal Welfare Act: water quality records of the facility's pools, medical records
on certain animals, and daily logs on certain animals. The facility was given until close of business, December 13, 2022,
to comply, on which date a portion of the requested records were provided to an APHIS official. Failure to furnish all of
the required information by the Act or any information concerning the business of the exhibitor impedes our ability to
enforce the provisions and regulations of the Act. The information requested shall be furnished within a reasonable time
and as may be specified in the request for information. To be corrected from this date forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
