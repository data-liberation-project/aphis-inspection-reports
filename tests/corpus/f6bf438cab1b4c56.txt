2.40(a)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The attending veterinarian (AV) does not have appropriate authority over the veterinary care of the animals at the facility.
The facility also employs a consulting veterinarian that provides diagnostic care and treatment plans for a portion of the
animals. Currently, there is limited to no communication between the AV and consulting veterinarian over the treatment
plans for the animals at the facility.
For example, while inspecting a mini-fridge located at Toto Land an inspector pulled out a controlled substance
prescription for a male squirrel monkey “Oak”. The AV and facility director were unaware that controlled substances were
being stored in the fridge, and the AV was unaware that the consulting veterinarian had prescribed the drug. After further
discussions with the animal care staff, there was no clear guidance as to when employees should contact the AV or the
consulting veterinarian for veterinary care concerns. If the staff contacted the consulting veterinarian for guidance, there
was limited to no documentation showing that they had updated the AV with the new treatment plan.
Furthermore, discussions with the AV, consulting veterinarian and animal care staff revealed conflicting guidance as to
the administration of supplements. The AV stated that he had discontinued providing “blanket” vitamin and mineral
supplementation to the animals; however, employees were still providing calcium supplementation to the animals under
their charge.


Failure to ensure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority over the veterinary care of the animals does not
satisfy the requirement of the AWA and its regulations. This can lead to unnecessary pain and suffering of the animals.
Correct by ensuring the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority over the veterinary care of the animals.

3.75(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
Multiple connecting runs between primary enclosures and primary enclosure feeding platforms within Oz have excessive
rust on the metal caging. The metal runs have rusting on the entire bottom of the caging where the primary foot traffic of
the nonhuman primates is. Inside multiple primary enclosures, the metal caging platforms where nonhuman primates eat
their diets are rusted.
Rough, rusted metal creates a surface that cannot adequately be cleaned and sanitized. Additionally, rust affects the
integrity of the structure and its ability to properly contain the animals. The facility must ensure that all housing facility
surfaces in contact with nonhuman primates be free of excessive rust so that appropriate cleaning and sanitization can
occur.

3.82(a)

Feeding.
At the time of inspection, a freezer located in the commissary for Cotton Top City contained the wrapped body of a
deceased bird. Frozen treats for marmosets and tamarins were stored within the same freezer. Additionally, a small
refrigerator in Toto Town was infested with a large amount of small fly-like insects both dead and alive. The fridge
contained chilled bananas and medications for the animals within the area.
Food must be clean, wholesome and palatable to the animals. Food meant for nonhuman primates should be separated


from freezers meant for carcass storage and protected from contamination by pests.

3.84(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Employees are not spot cleaning outdoor enclosures as often as needed to remove excreta and uneaten food from the
enclosures. Inspectors identified the accumulation of feces and discarded food in several capuchin enclosures within
Kansas. This had attracted large swarms of insect pests. Furthermore, the severity of the vegetation growth in and around
the enclosures shows that employees had not entered the enclosures to clean in quite some time.
Enclosures with dirt floors must be spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid
contact with excreta, or as often as necessary to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
3.84(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The facility has enclosures spread out over a large property under the cover of trees and/or out in the middle of grass
pastures. Several enclosures housing cotton top marmosets, tamarins, squirrel monkeys and capuchins had overgrown
vegetation in and around the primary enclosure fencing. When the state investigator attempted to enter an enclosure, the
overgrown grass in front of the door made it difficult to open the gates and enter. Additionally, holes/tunnels created by
pest activity were difficult to identify underneath the tall grass and underbrush.
The weeds, overgrown grass and other vegetation act as living areas for pests, rodents and vermin. Additionally, they
make it difficult to perform daily husbandry practices such as cleaning. Weeds, grasses and bushes must be controlled so
as to facilitate cleaning and pest control.

3.84(d)



Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Two separate outdoor enclosures housing cotton top marmosets had evidence of pest activity adjacent to the primary
enclosure fencing. The state inspector moved aside large patches of overgrown vegetation to reveal disturbed earth
surrounding tunnels. The holes were approximately 1.5x the length of a kestrel in diameter and were observed running
under the fencing and almost entering the enclosure. Additionally, the body of a deceased rodent was found outside the
enclosure of a squirrel monkey in Toto Land. Several enclosures in Kansas had an excess build-up of uneaten food and
un-swept feces that had attracted swarms of insect pests.
The evidence of pest activity adjacent to primary enclosures offers an opportunity for escape by the animals within the
enclosure. Furthermore, rodent and insect pests can both carry parasites and various diseases that could compromise the
health and well-being of non-human primates. Licensees are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective
program for controlling pests so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by
pests in animal areas.

Employees.
The facility lacks an adequate number of personnel who are available and able to routinely maintain the enclosures,
facilities, and daily husbandry practices to meet the standards of this subpart. Current employees admitted that they were
unable to clean indoor enclosures daily as required and that records keeping was not up to date. The severity of the
vegetation overgrowth in and around the primary enclosures for a variety of species shows that the staff has fallen behind
with spot cleaning the outdoor enclosures. Additionally, the staff has not been able to adequately survey the grounds in
and around the primary enclosures to identify pest control concerns. Insufficient staffing is a concern because it affects
animal safety and well-being. The licensee must have enough employees or other reliable trained staff to carry out the


level of husbandry practices and care required in this subpart.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Facility Director, Attending Veterinarian and various facility
employees.
