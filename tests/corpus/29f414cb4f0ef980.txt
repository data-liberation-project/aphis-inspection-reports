PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During inspection three guinea pigs were identified with rear limb injuries and lameness. One was not using its leg
and was diagnosed by the attending veterinarian to have a leg fracture. The two other animals had limbs which
were mildly swollen with abrasions. The attending veterinarian determined the injuries probably occurred because
the legs had been caught in the enclosure floors.
These guinea pigs, and a majority of the guinea pigs at the facility, are group housed in bin enclosures. The bins
are made of a hard plastic like material with a mesh floor resembling a waffle. The holes are about one centimeter
square. In the corners of the enclosures, where the guinea pigs like to congregate, the holes are estimated to be
twice as long. The guinea pigs feet and legs easily fit through these holes in the enclosure flooring. This inspector
saw many guinea pigs with their feet poking through the floor holes during the inspection.
The facility reports illness and injury to guinea pigs legs at an average rate of 0.008% of the population yearly, or
roughly 20 animals per year. Modifications have been made to some of the enclosure floors by making the holes
slightly larger and rounder, especially in the enclosure corners, in an effort to reduce entrapment and make it easier
for the guinea pigs to remove their legs. To date, sufficient data has not been accumulated to determine if these
enclosure modifications have affected leg injury incidence. Leg fractures and leg injuries are painful and constitute
serious animal welfare impacts. Primary enclosure floors must be constructed such that the animals(cid:25) feet and legs
are protected from injury.
