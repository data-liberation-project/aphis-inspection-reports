up to date. The facility representative stated that their previous attending veterinarian has retired, and the facility is
currently using other veterinarians for the current care of the animals. The written program of veterinary care and regularly
scheduled visits by the attending veterinarian ensures that appropriate veterinary care for the animals is being provided.

attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary
care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.
