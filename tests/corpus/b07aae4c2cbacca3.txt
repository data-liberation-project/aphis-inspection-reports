3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two outdoor enclosures have inadequate shade for each of the dogs in the enclosures. There are 2 dogs in each
enclosure. There is a tarp over the enclosures but due to the angle of the sun at this time of day, the only shade is the
small amount provided by the shelter. Shade is important to protect the dogs from the direct rays of the sun, especially
when during times of high temperatures, such as this day. Dogs that cannot access shade to escape the direct sun have
the potential to overheat. The temperature at the time of inspection was 91 degrees F. For the health and wellbeing of
the dogs, one or more separate outside areas of shade must be provided, large enough to contain all the animals at one
time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun. Shade must be maintained at all times.

The licensee was instructed to provide shade by close of business on this day.
3.6(a)(2)(x)

Primary enclosures.
The enclosures floor is constructed of wire floors with a 1"x1" spacing. The feet of 6 young puppies (approximately 1
week old) feet were observed dangling through the spaces. Flooring that allows the feet of the puppies to pass through
affects their mobility and ability to get back to the female for nursing. It could be an area of entrapment, leading to
possible injury. To prevent injury and to allow the puppies to more easily be with their mother, the licensee must provide

for flooring that does not allow the feet of the puppies from passing through the openings. This must be maintained at all
times.

Licensee was instructed to correct by close of business on this day.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
