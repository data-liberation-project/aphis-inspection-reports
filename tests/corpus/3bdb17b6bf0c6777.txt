ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown goat had a long toe on the outside of its right rear foot. This hoof is in need of trimming. Long overgrown
hoofs can cause conformation issues and joint problems. Trim this goat's hoof.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The barrier door to the enclosure housing the tigers Lenny and Squiggy on the right and Pandora on the left would
not latch. (This was fixed at the time of inspection.) The barrier fence gates for the alleyways behind the lion
enclosure and the tiger Pandora's enclosure were not secure. The lock to the barrier door for the enclosures
housing the lion and the tiger JJ was broken. A barrier gate was not present for the alleyway to the American black
bear enclosure. The barrier gate restricting entrance between the Asian black bear enclosure and the white tiger
enclosure was not secure. The barrier gate to the enclosure housing the crab eating macaque was not locked.
Volunteer workers are considered to be members of the public. Barriers must be in place and locked when
volunteers are working in this area unless the facility president is in direct supervision of the volunteers. Volunteers
cannot have access to these dangerous animals when the president is not present. Contact with these dangerous
animals could be potentially fatal to a volunteer worker. It could lead to lethal consequences for the animals as well,
if local health officials would require rabies testing. This test requires removal of the brain. Secure and lock all
barrier gates and doors.

WATERING.
The enclosure housing two domestic cats had a water receptacle with a layer of green algae scum on its interior
surfaces. This scum came off on the finger of the inspector when he rubbed the bowl on its interior surface. This
water bowl needs to be cleaned and sanitized at least every two week or more often if needed. Dirty water
receptacles can affect water palatability. Palatability issues can lead to decreased water consumption. It is vital
that all animals have access to clean water in order to promote health and comfort. Cats are particular sensitive tokidney damage from lack of water. Clean this water receptacle.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The two domestic cats are housed in an enclosure that contains one litter box. This litter box had excessive feces
in it. Numerous flies were noted in and around this enclosure. An enclosure housing three cats in the warm room
contained no litter box. Excess feces were also present in this enclosure. Primary enclosures are to be cleaned of
fecal material daily. Excessive feces in the litter box can lead to odor problems. It can also be a potential source of
disease and pest control issues. Excessively dirty litter boxes can also be a source of discomfort to the cats as they
will hesitate to use the boxes when they are overly soiled. The cats in these enclosures were defecating outside the
box which could result in soiling of the cats and ingestion of feces as they groom themselves. This can lead to
parasite and other potential infections. Clean litter boxes daily.
3.125(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The two strands of hot wire at the top of the enclosure housing the American black bears have been off for three
days according to the facility president. These bears can climb. It would be possible for these bears to escape this
enclosure with the hot wire out. These are dangerous animals that could cause significant injury to people within
the perimeter fence or other animals located inside the perimeter fence. Repair this wire immediately.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosure containing the grizzly bear contained excessive water. The bear had to wade through this water to
gain access to its shelter and feeding areas. A method must be employed to rapidly eliminate excess water. It is
not comfortable for this animal to have to wade through muddy water to access these areas. The excess muddy
water in this enclosure would rapidly contaminate any food fed to this bear. This could lead to parasite or other
infections of the bear. Provide this animal with a dry enclosure or develop a method to dry this enclosure rapidly
after rainfall.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacle for the enclosure containing the lion had a layer of green algae scum lining its interior surface.
The water receptacle for the tiger known as JJ had a layer of green algae scum on its interior surface. The water
receptacle for the white tiger contained green water. The water receptacle in the enclosure containing two bobcats
had a layer of green algae on its interior surface. These receptacles are not being kept clean and sanitary. Dirty
water receptacles can affect water palatability. It can also lead to contamination of the water by pathogenicorganisms. Water palatability is very important with large cats as poor water palatability can lead to decreased
consumption. Decreased water consumption can lead to renal function problems. The majority of the large cats at
this facility are advanced in age, making them especially susceptible to kidney problems. Clean these water
receptacles. Clean them as often as need to keep the water clean.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The shelter box for the lion enclosure contained excessive bones and food waste. The shelter box for the tiger
known as JJ contained excessive bones and rotting food waste. The enclosure for the tiger known as JJ contained
excessive fecal material. The American black bear den box contained excessive food waste and feces. The grizzly
bear enclosure contained excessive bones. The Asian black bear den box contained excessive food waste. The
enclosure housing the white tiger contained excessive bones and fecal material. The shelter in the enclosure
housing one goat contained a large amount of fecal material. The shelter box for the cougar enclosure contained a
rotting piece of food waste. Black decaying material and maggots were noted on this food waste. The shelter box
had a rancid decaying smell to it. These enclosures need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis. The rotting
material present in these animals'(cid:25) enclosures and shelter boxes can contaminate these animals as they lay in their
enclosures. The animals can ingest this material when they groom themselves. Not removing old food waste
promptly can lead to contamination of new food. Ingesting this rotten material can lead to potential health problems.
The weather is now warm and the odor and maggot infestation in the cougar shelter box was profound. The
inspectors were able to enter the cougar enclosure to examine under the bedding material as it is easy to lock out
the cougar. It is highly likely that the warm weather will have led to similar maggot infestations in the other large cat
enclosures. Clean these enclosures more frequently to prevent a buildup of food waste to minimize odors and
prevent infestation with maggots.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The alleyway leading to the butcher area as well as the area directly outside the building housing the butcher area
and the alleyway and building next to the butcher area are filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash,
buckets, fencing and cardboard. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests and
numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. All this material must be removed to help control pests.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION. There were rodent holes located inside the shelter box for the cougar enclosure. A rodent hole was noted in the
tiger Xena's enclosure and in the tiger known as Sher Kahn's enclosure A rodent hole was in the tiger JJ's
enclosure. A rodent hole was noted going under the shelter box of the Asian black bear enclosure. There was
mouse feces on top of the refrigerator in the warm room. Rodents can be carriers of disease which may be harmful
to the animals housed in these areas. A more effective means of pest control must be established for the facility.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. The president of the facility stated to
APHIS inspectors that there was no formalized scheduling of workers at the facility. A lack of properly trained
employees can result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Animal numbers
must be reduced or more properly trained workers need to be added. Workers need to be trained in the basic
needs of the animals at the facility. Topics should include at a minimum: the importance of adequate water, the
need for adequate bedding during times of extreme weather, the importance of cleaning and good housekeeping
procedures, proper diet for different species of animals and observation of animals for abnormal conditions and
behaviors. This training should be done in conjunction with the attending veterinarian or his designee. A list of
topics covered and attendees must be documented for review by APHIS. A facility schedule needs to be developed
that allows for adequate employee coverage in order to address all animal husbandry needs. Also the facility
president is the only one authorized to work with the dangerous animals at the facility. All animal work must be
done with the dangerous animals under his direct supervision. This limits the amount of time that is available to
service the dangerous animal enclosures as the facility president is often offsite. This leads to poor sanitation in the
dangerous animal enclosures. The facility president needs to find a way to be onsite more or hire trained staff to
help run the facility.
The inspection was conducted with the facility president on 8-13-14. An exit interview was conducted at that time
and all non-compliant items were explained to the facility president. A formal exit interview was conducted with the
facility president on 8-14-14.
