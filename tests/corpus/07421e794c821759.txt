FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the enclosures for the leopard, Tshuma, and the tiger, David Allen, there were tarps on top of the enclosures that
had become so tattered and shredded due to recent winds, that they had pieces hanging down into the enclosures
that could potentially be ingested by the animals, posing a serious health risk.
Enclosures should be structurally sound, constructed of appropriate materials, and free of any hazardous items.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility has two large containers to collect water that was previously drained from the bear enclosure water
features, and possibly other animal enclosures. This water is used to water plants on the grounds. The water was
found to be very dark in color, putrid smelling, and containing aquatic insects. Although no mosquito larva were
observed at the time of inspection, there were no mosquito abatement measures in place. Also a wheel barrow was
found to have accumulated more that six inches of rainwater, which had also turned a dark color, and was
foul-smelling.
All types of waste should be disposed of in a timely manner so as to minimize odors, disease, and vermin
infestation.
The presence of standing water which is allowed to become putrid and inhabited by vermin puts the well-being of
the animals on site at risk. The facility should put measures in place to ensure that standing water is discarded or
used in a timely manner, and does not present health risks.
Personnel began emptying water containers at the time of inspection, and verified completion on 10/21/16.
3.127(d)FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Although the facility has adequate perimeter fencing in place, a recent plumbing project resulted in a gap
underneath the fence greater than six inches that had not been filled in at the time of inspection, despite the fact
that the plumbing project was not in progress at the time.
The perimeter fence should keep people and animals from passing under or through the fence, and also act as a
secondary containment, in the event that an animal should escape from its primary enclosure. A six inch gap could
allow wildlife to enter the area where the animals are, posing a risk of injury or disease transmission, and also could
pose an escape risk for some animals on exhibit, such as fennec foxes coatimundi, were they to escape their
primary enclosures. The facility should maintain the integrity of the perimeter fence at all times.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
