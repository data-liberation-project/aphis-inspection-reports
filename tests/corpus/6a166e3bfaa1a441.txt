ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A red haired, male, juvenile pig had abnormal skin on the backs of his ears. There was generalized hair loss on
the backs of the ears and the skin was reddened. The skin appeared to be dry, flaky and numerous brown crusts
covered the skin. There was a scab approximately a half inch in length at the base of the back of the right ear. The
facility staff had not identified this animal’s condition prior to APHIS personnel identifying it.
Failure to observe and properly communicate animal health issues to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner
can result in prolonged pain and suffering for the animal and potentially worsen a current medical condition.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. The facility must conduct daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns
are found in a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
This pig must be examined by a veterinarian by July 14, 2017.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The fencing around the primary enclosure containing nine cows was made up of barbed wire. Numerous strands
of the barbed wire had become unattached from the support posts and were pointing into the enclosure.

***A fence board in an enclosure containing eight sheep and one llama was in disrepair. A portion of the board was
broken, exposing four nail heads.
***A wooden beam supporting a shelter structure in an enclosure containing ten sheep and three goats was in
disrepair. A portion of the beam was hollowed out, exposing six nail tips. All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
