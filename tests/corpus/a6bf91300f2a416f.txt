3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The two outdoor dog enclosures had a large accumulation of feces on the ground. The licensee stated that the
enclosures had not been cleaned since the previous Saturday (three days ago).
Failure to clean primary enclosures on a daily basis can allow soiling of the dogs, introduce potential disease hazards,
and cause odors which can attract pests.
Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures daily to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.

3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee is not maintaining vaccination or deworming records for his puppies.
Failure to document the vaccine and dewormer name and administration dates for the dogs and puppies can make it
difficult to verify that the Program of Veterinary Care is being followed as written and that the dogs are receiving the
appropriate preventative care.
Medical records for dogs must contain the name of all vaccines and treatments administered and the dates of


administration.
