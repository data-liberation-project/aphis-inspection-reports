2.8(h)
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
I went to the theater in Branson, MO to conduct an inspection at the location where the exhibitor had last been
performing. Staff there stated that the exhibitor is no longer performing at that location and that no regulated
species of animals were present. A change of business address has not been submitted to the Regional Office.
Licensees are required to notify the Regional Office within 10 days of a change in their business address so that
inspectors know where to conduct inspections. The licensee must notify the Regional Office by certified mail of his
change in business address.
