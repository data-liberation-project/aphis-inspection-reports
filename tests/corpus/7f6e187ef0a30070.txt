Handling of animals.
Item 2.131 c 1
Twice in the past two years, a visitor to the zoo got through the front of the public barrier to the interior side of the barrier
at the lion exhibit. After the first incident, the facility changed the public barrier by adding woody shrubbery. An individual
was still able to penetrate the public barrier again in Nov 2021.
The actions by this individual jeopardizes not only themselves but also staff members, other zoo visitors, and the safety
and welfare of the animals.
The facility must reevaluate the public barrier’s sufficiency between the animals and the general viewing public to assure
the safety of the animals and the public.
As a temporary measure the facility has added a security guard by the exhibit and is looking at additional measures .

At the time of inspection, there were 2 areas of the perimeter fence along the Bronx River Parkway that had the top rail


broken and the areas of the fence were bowed thus causing a loss of strength of the fence.
The fence needs to be repaired in order to maintain the structural strength of the fence as well as to prevent outsiders
from entering the area and maintain the safety and security for the animals.
