FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a metal panel between a pig enclosure and a crested porcupine enclosure that has rusted leaving a jagged
hole approximately 6 inches long.
Also there are jagged and sharp edges around the lower section of the metal shelter in use in the nilgai enclosure.
Jagged and sharp edges could cause injury to the animals in these enclosures. All facilities must be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 28 May 2016.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO
and Kendall Lundy, ACI.
