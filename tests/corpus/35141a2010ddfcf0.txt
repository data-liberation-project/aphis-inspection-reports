2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- In building number four the left eye of an adult male, fawn-colored Pug (microchip number 941000016564067) is
cloudy and blue in appearance and the pupil is barely visible. This could be due to an infection, allergies, injury,
irritation or other medical conditions. The attending veterinarian had not been consulted nor had any treatment
been provided at the time of inspection. The licensee stated that this was the first time the eye had been noticed.
Eye problems can be painful and not having clear vision can cause discomfort which affects the health and well-
being of the dog. The potential for future injury also increases with a lack of clear vision in both eyes. The licensee
must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
