2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**While reviewing records it was noted the written program of veterinary care had not been correctly completed.
Section II (Dogs and Cats) had been completed, however, skunks, straw-colored and egyptian fruit bats are housed
at the facility. The program of veterinary care was not completed to include correct veterinary emergency contact
information and parasite program for the animals on hand. The program of veterinary care should be updated to
accurately reflect a parasite program and correct emergency veterinary contact information. Lack of a complete
program of veterinary care does not ensure that proper veterinary care is being provided in accordance with
currently accepted veterinary medical standards.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the facility representative.
