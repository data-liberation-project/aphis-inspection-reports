ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1153 on
01-Dec-16. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I honked the horn and
waited 30 minutes before leaving.
End of report.
