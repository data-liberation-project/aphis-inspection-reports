Housing facilities, general.
The dirt floors of 4 outdoor enclosures housing 8 young adult Old English Sheepdogs were 100% mud. The dogs had a
single platform next to their shelters to get out of the mud but mud had been tracked into their shelters and they had to
walk through the mud to get to their water and food. Their feet, legs, and bellies were caked in mud. Straw had been laid
down in an attempt to provide a dry area but the straw had been trampled into the mud and was soaked. Mud attracts
pests such as flies and mosquitos and can harbor disease. Dogs caked in mud can develop painful mats or skin infections
and may have difficultly keeping warm in cooler temperatures. Dogs may be reluctant to walk through mud and become
dehydrated or hungry when it is their only option for food and water. Correct by providing adequate drainage that rapidly
eliminates standing water and allows animals to stay dry. Correct by 11/10/22

Outdoor housing facilities.
Several outdoor enclosures lacked adequate shelter. One enclosure housed 4 young adult Rhodesian Ridgebacks and
contained only 1 large igloo shelter. One enclosure housed 2 juvenile Saint Bernards and did not contain any shelter. One
enclosure housed 2 young adult Saint Bernards and contained only 1 shelter. One enclosure housed a young adult Visla
with only a blue barrel as his shelter that he was unable to stand up or turn around in. When outdoor housed animals lack


adequate shelter, they do not have a place to stay warm and avoid severe weather. Correct by ensuring all outdoor
enclosures contain shelter structures that are adequate in size and number to contain all dogs at one time and allow each
animal to sit, stand, and lie down in a normal manner, and turn about freely. Correct by 11/10/22
3.4(b)(3)

Outdoor housing facilities.
17 outdoor enclosures containing 36 dogs lacked a wind/rain break at the entrance into the shelter. Without a barrier,
wind, rain, and snow can enter shelters, making them cold and damp. Shelters are important to provide warmth and
protection from wind and severe weather. Correct by providing a sufficient barrier to block wind and rain from entering the
shelters. Correct by 11/10/22.
3.7 Direct

Compatible grouping.
Three juvenile male Old English Sheep Dog littermates, housed together in a single primary enclosure are incompatible,
preventing 1 noticeably thin dog named Nagen from eating. There was an empty plastic feed container attached to the
fence and a large black rubber feed bucket in the center of the enclosure. No other food bowls were noticed. Two well-
fleshed dogs were eager for attention from the inspectors and ran over to the fence. The third dog, who had a dramatic
abdominal tuck and was so thin his ribs and spine were apparent, ran over to the food bowl and started eating nonstop for
at least 5 minutes. At one point, one of the well-fleshed dogs walked over to the food bowl and growled so that Nagen
backed away, cowering. When Nagen returned to the food bowl, he kept looking up in an anxious manner as he was
eating and even began growling and whining towards the other dogs. The licensee stated that she noticed he was thin
and had recently dewormed him. When dogs are housed in incompatible groups, they are at risk of injury, bullying, mental
distress, and reduced access to resources such as food and shelter. Correct by ensuring all dogs are housed in
compatible groups that allow them to meet their physical and mental needs. Corrected at time of inspection.


3.11(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Eight enclosures housing 14 dogs had an accumulation of moldy feces, indicating that enclosures are not being spot
cleaned daily. When feces accumulate, they attract pests and can harbor disease. Dogs that must walk through their
feces to move about their enclosure are more susceptible to skin infections and intestinal parasites. Correct by removing
excreta and other waste from primary enclosures daily. Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
