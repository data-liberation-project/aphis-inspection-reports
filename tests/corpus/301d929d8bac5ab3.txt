INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The former chair of the IACUC left the College last March and no IACUC functions have occurred since then. No
regulated animals have been in the facility this past year. The IACUC is to inspect the animal facilities and review
the facility's program for humane care and use of animals at least once every six months. This is required even if
no animals are present. These inspections and reviews need to resume. To be corrected by 2-23-18.

ANNUAL REPORT.
Because the IACUC did not meet this past year after the IACUC chair left the college last March, and because mail
from the USDA office was going to the old contact address, the USDA Annual Report for the College was not
submitted. The new IACUC chair was appointed last month and was just made aware of the need to send the
report when she was given the reminder letter after their school break period. The report still needs to be sent. To
be corrected by 1-26-18.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC chair.
