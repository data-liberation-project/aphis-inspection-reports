ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1150am on
03/19/2014.
Messages were left on both cell and home phone numbers. The horn was honked in the drive way and the inspector
waited at the site for 30 minutes to make contact in person or by phone with the licensee, however no contact was
made. Continual attempts to make contact by phone with the licensee goes ignored with no phone messages being
returned or contact made by the licensee to the inspector after repeated attempts in a 3 month period.
Please contact the inspector at 618-315-3649 to discuss days and times of the week that are best to reach the
licensee for future inspections or days to avoid.
