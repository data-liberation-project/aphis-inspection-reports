ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:46 - 3:27PM
on 10-Apr-18.
I knocked on the door upon arrival and waited in the driveway for 30 minutes, honked the horn and knocked on the
door again before leaving. I also called the phone number on file and a neighbor that had stopped by at 3:20PM
checked the back area of the property and came back and said it didn't appear anyone was around.
