** The paddock containing a horse at the bottom of the hill below the large animal clinic fencing is in disrepair. The
actual fencing is away from the fencing posts and there was a thick piece of wire with a gap between it and the
fence. This is an area where the horse could get its leg caught and potentially injure itself. To the right of this post
there is a piece of that same wire sticking away from the post. The animal could easily impel itself with this metal.
The outdoor enclosure should be in good repair to prevent injury to the animals it contains. Correct by 7/15/2017

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the stall containing feed, in the cow barn, part of the hay was scattered around the pallets on the floor and the
hay on pallets was up against the the wall not allowing air flow around it. Also there was a bag of sweet feed that
was open. The hay should be elevated and away from the walls to promote good air flow to prevent molding. Feed
should be contained properly to prevent contamination and spillage of feed and hay should be removed or cleaned
up to prevent and minimize pest.
