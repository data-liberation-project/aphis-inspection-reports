2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility's "Wolf Encounter Experience" allows direct contact between the public and hybrid wolves used during
the tour. This direct contact includes both petting the hybrid wolves, and allowing the hybrid wolves to lick the faces
of members of the public. In addition, during at least one encounter, a hybrid wolf was handled on a leash
controlled only by a member of the public.
Handling practices such as these do not minimize the risk of harm to animals and/or the public.

During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the public so as to assure the safety of the
animals and the public.
To be corrected immediately by ensuring that your handling practices minimize the risk of harm to the animals and
public during this encounter.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
