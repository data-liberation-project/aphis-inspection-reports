2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In building 1, the last enclosure in the first row had a tan and white female guinea pig with a right front foot that was
severely swollen on both the top and bottom. The swelling was about a 1/2 inch in diameter and extended above
and below the foot. The skin was very red and inflamed. The first three toes of the right front foot were visible, the
fourth toe (lateral digit) was surrounded by swollen tissue. This guinea pig was not on any treatment and had not
been evaluated by the attending veterinarian for the swollen foot. When the APHIS officials identified the condition
of this guinea pig the licensee called the attending veterinarian. During the inspection the veterinarian evaluated the
guinea pig and veterinary care was provided. Corrected during the inspection.
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
In building 1, row 1 there were 20 enclosures housing about 275 guinea pigs and their offspring that had fecal
material consolidated into a wet pad on the floor area in the back portion of the enclosures. The licensee informed
the APHIS officials that employees are replacing the bedding in the front of the enclosures by the automatic water
valves when it is wet, but are only cleaning the entire enclosure every two weeks before they are sanitized. Too
much feces and liquid waste is accumulating between the two week cleaning interval. The accumulations of debris,
feces, and wet bedding exposes the guinea pigs to potential infections with bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Correct
by ensuring that all primary enclosures are clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta,
wet bedding, and debris.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
