3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
This facility does not currently have a perimeter fence. The licensee had previously obtained a perimeter fence variance
for some of the species at the facility in 2012. However, there have been several changes to the overall facility and animal
inventory that were not covered under the previous variance approval in 2012. The facility’s request for a new variance
has been denied, and the previously approved variance has been revoked by APHIS Administration. The lack of a
perimeter fence does not allow for a secondary form of containment in the event of an escape of dangerous or exotic
species. In addition, there are no physical barriers in place that would prevent unwanted animals or people from walking
directly up to an enclosure and making contact with the animals contained therein. The licensee must ensure a perimeter
fence is properly in place or apply and receive approval for a variance from the Administrator for all species that require a
perimeter fence.
