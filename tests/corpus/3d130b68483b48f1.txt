PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
*Protocol #2015-0024 using hamsters requires observation 3 times daily after infection of the animals and start of
the study. Documentation indicates and research personnel verified that observations occurred a maximum of 2
times daily for the animals used to date.
*Under protocol #2015-0024 animals were to be assessed using a modified "Karnofsky Scale" to evaluate disease
progression and animal distress. Record reviews indicate that the numerical scoring system outlined in the protocol
was not used to assess the animals. Additionally, animals housed collectively were not individually identified in the
records. Therefore it could not be verified that sequential observations were accurately recorded.
The facility must ensure that all personnel involved in animal care and use are appropriately qualified and trained.
Animal observations, record keeping and documentation are integral parts of humane animal use and necessary for
assurance that animal distress will be minimized. The facility should review review personnel qualifications including
research technicians and scientists. Training and instruction should be provided as needed to achieve compliance
with required AWA regulations and the facility protocol.
