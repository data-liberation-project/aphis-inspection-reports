PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
3.14 (a) Construction of primary enclosures.(9)
The transport vehicle dedicated to the "New York" delivery route had an enclosure containing 4 small breed puppies
with their feet and legs falling through the openings of the coated wire flooring of the enclosure. Puppies with their
feet and legs through these openings may become entrapped or injured. When slatted or mesh flooring is used in
an enclosure, it must be designed and constructed so that the animal cannot put any part of its body between the
slats or through the holes in the mesh. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 4/16/2015

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
3.14(e) Space and placement. (1)
There were two enclosures of the transport vehicle dedicated to the "New York" route that were ovecrowded.
One of the enclsoures contained 3 large breed puppies and the other contained 4 small breed (Yorkshire Terrier)
puppies.
The enclosures did not provide adaquate space for each puppy to turn about freely or to lie in a natural position.
The puppies should be able to lie flat, separately. Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats must be
large enough to ensure that each animal contained in the primary enclosure has enough space to turn about
normally while standing, to stand and sit erect, and to lie in a natural position.
