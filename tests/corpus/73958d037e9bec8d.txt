HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Fly spray and other chemicals are being stored on a shelf adjacent to gorilla bedding storage. The bedding is being
stored uncovered on a pallet. Supplies of bedding for non-human primates must be stored in a manner that
protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor
and away from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. Only the bedding currently being
used may be kept in animal areas, and when not in actual use, open bedding supplies must be kept in leakproof
containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage and contamination.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are 4 light fixtures in the giraffe barn with bare light bulbs directly over the animal areas. In the event a bulb
breaks, it can shatter into animal areas possibly causing injury. Animal housing facilities, including barns and
fixtures located within, should be maintained in a manner that protect the animals from injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The top portions of a light fixture and bulb over the hay storage area for giraffes is covered by a moderate
accumuation of dust. This dust, if disturbed, could fall into the hay being stored below it resulting in contamination of
the feed. Food supplies should be stored in a manner that minimizes contamination to protect the health of the
animals.

SANITATION.
In the new small animal holding area, the seams between the concrete floor slabs are wide enough to allow excretaand other debris to collect within and the required cleaning may be prevented. Measures should be taken to ensure
excreta and other debris cannot get lodged between the concrete floor slabs to prevent contamination of the
animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards.
