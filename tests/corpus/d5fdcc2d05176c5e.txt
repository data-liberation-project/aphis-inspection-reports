These screws were sharp and can potentially injure these animals if they should brush up against the walls where
the screws are.The barn shall be constructed of such materials to protect the animals from injury. There shall be no sharp objects

The zoo's cheetah enclosure consists of an 8 foot high fence with a 28 inch kick in. The zoo received approval to
house the cheetahs in this enclosure. On the day of the inspection of the enclosure, the electrical wire solar panel
box was not operational as evidenced by the "OK" light not being on (and no sounds emanating for it).
This electrical wire which is strung around the upper portion of the fence serves as additional security to ensure that
these cats are contained within their enclosure.
Reliable electrical power is required to comply with the other provisions of this subpart (to contain the animals).
