2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
The facility site experienced acute hamster deaths. The deaths occurred on 7-1-2021 (1 pup), 7-2-2021 (2 pups) and 7-4-
2021 (1 pup and 3 adults). The facility site veterinarian and IACUC office were notified on 7-8-2021, however the facility
veterinarian was out of office. The facility site and IACUC office did not follow up with the back-up veterinarians and the
facility site experienced additional acute deaths of hamsters on 7-9-2021 (2 pups), 7-12-2021 (1 pup) and 7-20-2021 (1
pup) before the facility veterinarian received the information regarding the acute deaths of the hamsters on 7-21-2021.
The facility site did not convey information on the health of the hamster colony at the site in a timely manner. This does
not allow the facility veterinarian to ensure that adequate veterinary care can be provided. Develop and maintain a
mechanism of timely communication between the facility site and the facility veterinarian on problems of animal health at
the facility site. Corrected prior to the date of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Attending Veterinarian, facility veterinarian and facility staff.
End of report.
