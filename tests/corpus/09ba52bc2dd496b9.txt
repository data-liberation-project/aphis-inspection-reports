2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is only a single rope barrier in front of the kulan, and a mixed species enclosure housing blackbuck, zebra,
nilgai, and aoudad. The single rope barriers are 2-3 feet in height leaving enough space underneath for a child to
pass under or an adult to step over and come in contact with the animals. Sufficient public barriers must be in place
to protect the of the animals and for the safety of public. Barriers must be installed of a sufficient height and
designed in a manner that protects the animals by preventing the public from coming in direct contact.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Lion Enclosure:
Structural strength: Lion Enclosure: The enclosure is 80 feet x 70 feet and 12 feet in height with no overhang or
electric wire. The enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel
poles, 4 inches in diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest
upon, is located approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep
roots - no lower branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is
approximately 4 feet from the enclosure fence. There is now an 8 foot high tensile wire barrier fence approximately
20 feet from the front of the enclosure.
The enclosure currently houses a five (5) year old male lion and a four (4) year old female lion with limited mobility.
The enclosure is only 12 feet in height which is inadequate to contain a lion. Primary enclosures must be
constructed in a manner that will ensure containment of healthy big cats. Based upon known physical and
behavioral characteristics of exotic cats, the height of the enclosure must be extended at least 4 feet in height or
the top of the enclosure modified with an appropriate overhang to minimize the potential of an animal escape.
NOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014.
***Llama Enclosure:There is a large gap along the front, bottom edge of the primary fence.
***Deer Enclosure: At the rounded corner of the enclosure there is a large gap at the base of the fence. These gaps in fencing appear to be the result of run-off from water draining downhill. The primary fencing of the
enclosure (across from the camel enclosure) is bowed and bent downward at the top of the fence.
***Camel Enclosure: The section of board fencing has several boards missing leaving gaps wide enough to a camel
to stick its head through.There are also broken boards that have sharp edges. Additionally, two wooden posts that
support a section of chain link fencing (across from potbelly pigs) are leaning inward.
The structural strength of the fencing is compromised. Primary fencing in disrepair allow for the entry of unwanted
animals and the escape and potential injury of the animals contained within the enclosure. All fencing must be
repaired or modifications made to the fence to ensure the integrity of the fencing is adequate for the species
contained within to prevent escape, public contact and injury.
3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Asiatic Bear Enclosure:
***The two (2)Asiatic black bears are housed in a 20’ x 20’ x 12’ chain link enclosure with a concrete floor. Within
the enclosure there is a single tire swing and a water trough for the bears to use. The current space and structures
within the enclosure provide little stimulation for bears who typically enjoy climbing, foraging, and being active in
water. The enclosure needs to be of an adequate size to allow the bears to make all normal postural adjustments
and adequate water features for the bear to engage in species typical exercise and thermoregulation. Additional
space and elevated structures for climbing and resting; substrates to encourage digging; and an appropriate water
feature should be added to the enclosure to allow the animals to demonstrate species typical behavior and to
improve their psychological well-being.
NOTE: Progress has been made on the construction of the new bear enclosure. Upon completion the bear
enclosure will provide additional space and structures to encourage species typical behavior.
Tiger Enclosure:
***The three (3) tigers are housed in a 30’ x 40’ x 10’ closed top enclosure with a dirt and gravel and a single
elevated structure. No water feature is available for swim-like activity. No changes have been to the enclosure
since the last inspection that would increase the size of the enclosure or that would allow the tigers to demonstrate
more species typical behavior. Tigers often engage in running, climbing, jumping, and water play. Tigers should be
housed in an enclosure with adequate space and structures that allows them to engage in natural behaviors. The
current enclosure must be modified or husbandry practices adjusted in a manner that will allow the tigers to jump,
climb, run and engage in water activities to improve their level of activity and to prevent abnormal behavior patterns.
NOTE: Work on the construction of the new enclosure has not progressed since the last inspection due other high
priority projects.
***The elevated platform within the enclosure still only provides enough surface area for 2 of the 3 tigers to rest.Tigers typically use elevated surfaces for jumping, resting, and to observe their surroundings. There should be
enough elevated surfaces available within the enclosure for each animal to rest at the same time and to allow
exercise in the form of jumping an climbing. An additional elevated surface or an extension of the current platform
must be constructed that would allow for all tigers to have the opportunity to demonstrate normal species typical
behaviors.
NOTE: Materials to modify the current resting platform have been bought.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses approximately 175 regulated and non-regulated animals. There was one keeper present
performing husbandry duties during the inspection. An additional person was performing maintenance tasks. There
are now at least two staff members caring for the animals and maintaining the property six days a week. The
increase in the number of daily employees has allowed more husbandry and housekeeping tasks to be completed.
However, there are still a number of maintenance and building projects that need to be completed. There must be a
sufficient number of employees to carry out the facility husbandry duties, repairs, and projects to maintain routine
upkeep of the facility in a timely manner for the safety and well-being the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
