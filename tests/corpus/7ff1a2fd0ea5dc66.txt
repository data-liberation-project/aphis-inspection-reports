Primary enclosures.
In at least six enclosures, housing approximately twelve puppies, the inspectors observed the feet and legs of the puppies
falling through the openings in the wire flooring. Flooring that has openings that allows the feet and legs of puppies to
pass through could result in injury to the animals.

Floors must be constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and lets from injury and does not allow the dogs' feet
to pass through any openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the flooring in a manner that does not allow the
puppies' feet and legs to pass through the openings. The licensee must ensure that the flooring is safe for the dogs at all
times.
