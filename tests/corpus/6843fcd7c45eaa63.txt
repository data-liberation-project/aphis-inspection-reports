3.1(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
The wire doors of the outside enclosures for the small dogs had rust. Also the fences supports for the large dog outside
enclosures had excessive rust.

Rust will continue to deteriorate the integrity of the wire cage doors and affect the effectiveness of disinfectants and
cleaning products by providing a rough surface where bacteria can grow.

The surfaces of housing facilities - including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility -
must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed
or replaced when worn or soiled. Any surfaces that come in contact with dogs must: be free of excessive rust that
prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface.

Housing facilities, general.
There were sharp points of wire sticking into the enclosures used in the outdoor large dog runs to secure the fencing.



Sharp points can injure a dog's eyes, skin and feet and should not be present in enclosures.

Any surface that comes in contact with dogs must be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animals.

Housing facilities, general.
There was a bucket containing a sprayer that had been used with an insecticide sitting on top of the bags of dog food in
the storage building.

If any contents of the bucket were to spill or leak onto the bags of dog food it could contaminate the food.

Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and
vermin infestation. Substances that are toxic to dogs but are required for normal husbandry practices must not be stored
in food storage and preparation areas but may be stored in cabinets in the animal areas.
