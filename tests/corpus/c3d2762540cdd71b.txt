There were 10 of the adult dogs housed in outdoor facilities that were provided shelter, however the shelter did not
provided adequate space for 2 large breed dogs. Both of animals could not lie in a normal manner or turnabout
freely at the same time in the space provided. Adequate shelter is needed to protect the animals from the harsh
elements of the weather. The licensee shall provide one or more shelter structure in each enclosure that is
accessible to each animal, and that is large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie
in a normal manner, and to turn about freely.TO BE CORRECTED BY: 5/21/2015

There was an abundance of flies throughout the facility. The flies were on the uneaten food, waste material and
across the floors of the outdoor enclosure. The licensee had provided fly strips as directed by the program of
veterinary care however; the other methods of fly control were not present. Flies spread disease and can cause
serious medical conditions. The licensee shall incorporate an effective pest control program to eliminate flies from
the facility. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 5/21/2015
