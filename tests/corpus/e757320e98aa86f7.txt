SANITATION.
The surface of the winter pool for the pinnipeds has paint that is chipped, peeling and discolored. These areas could
accumulate pathogens and lead to disease transmission. Housing facilities for marine mammals must be
structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Peeling and chipped
paint cannot be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized and may harbor harmful bacteria. The pool surfaces should be
repaired or replaced to ensure the safety of the animals in the enclosures preferably with a darker paint that reduces
environmental glare to the pinnipeds.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The rhinoceros enclosures have rusting pipe and gates on the indoor portion that need to be repaired or replaced.
Previous repair work on rusted metal was done. However, there still needs to be periodic scheduled maintenance of
the enclosures to upkeep the facilities to be in compliance.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
