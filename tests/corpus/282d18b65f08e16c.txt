SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is one enclosure currently housing 3 large breed dogs on the hill side of the kennel. The interior part of the
enclosure does not allow each dog to sit, stand, lie down and turn around freely when all three dogs are in this area
at the same time. Adequate floor space is required to ensure the each dog has enough room to move around
freely. Licensee must ensure that all dogs within an enclosure has enough room to sit, stand, lie down and move
around freely at all times and within all areas of their enclosure.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There was one litter of pups housed in an enclosure without a solid area on the floor. The pups were noticed having
trouble walking on the floor of the enclosure. Their legs were noticed falling through the bottom several times as
they were moving around. Allowing the puppies legs to fall through the bottom of the enclosure expose the pups to
potential injury. Licensee must construct all enclosures in a manner that does not allow the dogs/puppies legs to go
through the bottom

EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
There are three large breed dogs housed in separate enclosures on the road side of the kennel. These dogs are
housed individual and are not housed in an enclosure that allows them two times the required floor space for
exercise. In addition, they do not have an exercise plan, in writing, for dogs that are singly housed without two
times their required floor space. Exercise is pertinent to the growth and development of the animals. Licensee
must provide all animals within the facility to have regular exercise. This plan must be addressed and approved bythe attending veterinarian.
