FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The hay for the next school year's animals has already been procured. It is stacked on the bare ground with a tarp
over the top. The sides of the stack are exposed to the weather, and the bottom bales in the stack are in contact
with moisture from the ground. The outside, sun-exposed parts of the bales are bleached out. Previous IACUC
semiannual inspection reports document finding mold in the hay stored in this manner, and that the students had to
sort through the hay to exclude moldy portions from that which was fed to the animals.
Exposure to the elements can result in deterioration of hay quality and molding due to moisture. The unhealthy
effects of the mold can extend beyond the mold that is visible, and can cause respiratory and digestive health
problems in the animals.
Correct by storing the hay off the ground and fully protected from the direct effects of sun and moisture. Correct
within 30 days, by 8/12/2016.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative.
