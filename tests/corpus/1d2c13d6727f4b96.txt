ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1540 on
03/15/2016.
I knocked on the door, honked my horn, and attempted to reach the licensee by phone. I left a message for him at
1543. I waited 30 minutes and then left.
End of report.
