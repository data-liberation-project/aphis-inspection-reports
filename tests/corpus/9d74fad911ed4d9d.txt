ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On inspection, an adult male Akita with number 991 was found to be in need of veterinary care for a cut on the
upper lip. The upper right lip directly under the nose had a 1-inch long wound. Around the edge of the injury was
pink moist skin and the center having a dry flaky appearance with varying color shades of red to brown. The
licensee said the animal had cut the lip fighting thru the chain link fence with another dog. At the time of inspection,
a fight was observed between the male Akita and another dog thru the chain link fence. The licensee said he will
separate the dogs so they do not share a fence line. The licensee did not apply any medications listed in the
Program of Veterinary Care because he thought any ointment applied to that area would be lick off immediately. No
veterinarian was notified of the injury. Wounds that are not appropriately treated not only decrease animal welfare
but also can lead to secondary infections and further illnesses. It is vital and required that all injuries be treated
according to the Program of Veterinary Care or is evaluated by a veterinarian.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the whelping building, one enclosure housing an adult female Rottweiler (#975) and her 1 week-old puppy was on
flooring which allowed the puppy(cid:25)'s legs to pass through it. The enclosure had a solid plastic flooring in the back
half and a coated wire floor with 1 inch by 1 inch spacing in the front half of the enclosure. Since there was no
barrier between the solid floor and wire floor, the puppy could easily go onto the wire floor. During inspection the
puppy was observed having its back left leg resting through the wire-floor spacing. The wire flooring is a danger to
the puppy and could cause the puppy to get stuck or injured. All flooring needs to be constructed in a manner that
does not allow any dogs(cid:25) feet to pass through any openings in the floor.

The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
