ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
These animals are in need of veterinary care:
**** A six year old male Yorkshire Terrier (chip# 0A10635067) located in the Hog House building had an
accumulation of yellowish-grey material covering the entire surface of the few teeth that he had left. The shape of
the teeth were no longer visible. This heavy coating of yellowish-grey matter was on the cheek teeth on both sides
of his mouth extending up into the gum line. The abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the
gum tissue and tooth structures, be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the
animal.
**** An adult female Maltese (chip# 0A106E155B) located in the Hog House building had a heavy coating of brown
material on the both sides of the cheek teeth, canine teeth, and incisors extending up into the gum line. The gums
have receded up and away from the teeth. These signs are consistent with the presence of dental disease, can be
painful, lead to the development of other health problems, and can inhibit the ability of the animal to eat normally.
**** An adult, red female Pomeranian with no official identification located in the Hog House building had a heavy
coating of brownish-grey material on the both sides of the cheek teeth, canine teeth, and incisor teeth extending up
into the gum line. The material completely covers the upper cheek teeth. The gums are inflamed and there is a
white colored discharge at the gum line of the canine and cheek teeth. The gums have receded at the incisors and
cheek teeth as well. The abnormal buildup of material on teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth
structures, be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal.
**These dogs all have symptoms that can be caused by dental problems. Dental disease can be painful and
eventually lead to a decrease in appetite. It can also lead to infection in the mouth as well as potential spread of
infection to other organs in the body. The licensee must have these dogs evaluated by a veterinarian to obtain an
accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The licensee must document the follow up care as directed by
the attending veterinarian and ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. **** An adult, female black and white Shih Tzu (chip# 0A106E1B3C) located in the Hog House building had a red,
blood-like liquid covering the entire sclera/white area of her left eye. This could be caused by infection, allergies,
injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful. The attending veterinarian had not been consulted
nor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection. The licensee stated that this was the first time the
eye had been noticed. Eye problems can be painful causing discomfort which affects the health and well- being of
the dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**** In the Hog Barn building in the food storage area there was an open sack of dog food located on a pallet on the
ground and an open plastic bucket full of dog food without a lid. The feed is being fed to over one hundred dogs. All
open feed supplies must be stored in a manner that protects it from spoilage, contamination, or vermin infestation.
The nutritive value of the feed could be affected if it becomes spoiled or contaminated. Spoiled or contaminated
feed is not healthy for the dogs to consume and could lead to health issues. The licensee must keep all open feed
supplies in leak proof containers with tightly fitting lids at all times.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
**** In the food storage area of the Hog Barn building there was a large amount of rodent feces on the floor and on
other surfaces inside the building and around the sacks of dog food. This indicates a living area exists for rodents,
pests and other vermin. Live traps and baits were being utilized by the licensee and were observed during the
inspection, but weren't as effective as they should be. Lack of an effective program that controls rodents can create
unsanitary conditions and lead to potential spread of disease from rodents to dogs. The licensee must ensure all
areas of the facility are kept clean to promote the health and well-being of the dogs and reduce contamination by
pests in animal areas. The licensee must establish a much more effective pest/rodent control program. To be corrected by: 2-17-2015.
