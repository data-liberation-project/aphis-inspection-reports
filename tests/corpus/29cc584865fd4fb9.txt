3.6(a)(2)(ii)

Primary enclosures.
Approximately ten enclosures, containing at least twenty-two dogs, have a hole in the floor that serves as a drain. The
drains do not have a cover and the holes are large enough for a dogs' foot or leg to fall through. Holes that are large
enough for a dog's foot or leg to pass through could cause injury to the animal.

Primary enclosures must protect the dogs from injury. The facility must alter the holes in a manner that eliminates the
ability of a dog's foot or leg to pass through. The facility must ensure that the enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.
3.7(c)

Compatible grouping.
A 9 week old Lhasa apso puppy, 8 week old Bichon puppy, and a 10 week old English bulldog puppy are housed in
enclosures with an adult that is not their dam or foster dam. Housing puppies with adults that are not their dam or foster
dam could result in injuries to the puppy due to compatibility issues.

Puppies 4 months of age or less may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs other than their dams
or foster dams. The above mentioned puppies must be either housed with adults that are their dam or foster dam or with
other puppies that are 4 months of age or less.

3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care is incomplete. The number of dogs to be sampled for heartworm and intestinal parasites
is missing. Sampling of dogs for parasites is necessary to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests. The facility must
add the number of dogs to be sampled for heartworms and intestinal parasites to the Program of Veterinary Care.
