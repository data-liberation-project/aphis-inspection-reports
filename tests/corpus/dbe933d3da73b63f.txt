WATERING.
Pens #1, 2 and 3 house various species of farm animals and deer and each pen contains a large plastic tub used as
a water receptacle. The water contained in the receptacles was green/brown and had large amounts of debris
settled at the bottom and floating on the surface. A green substance presumed to be algae, was also attached to
the sides of the tubs in many areas.
Water receptacles should be kept clean and sanitary to allow the animals to consume clean, uncontaminated water
as needed. Dirty water can harbor pathogens that could cause illness and compromise the health of the animals.
The water receptacles should be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent potential contamination of potable
drinking water provided to the animals.
