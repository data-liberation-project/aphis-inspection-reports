Facilities, general.
*** An African Crested porcupine was found dead in July 2020 in its housing enclosure underneath a log that was on top
of the animal. The licensee states that based on their assessment, the animal’s back was badly injured and it had
appeared the log had fallen on it, trapping the animal underneath. African crested porcupines are prolific diggers which
may affect the structural soundness of the substrate under any furniture type item in the enclosure. The facility must
ensure that housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

At the time of the inspection, the remaining porcupine is being housed in a different enclosure.
