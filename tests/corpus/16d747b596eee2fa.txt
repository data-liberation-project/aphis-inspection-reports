2.33 (b)(2) Attending Veterinarian and Adequate Veterinary Care
--The facility does not have an adequate program of preventative hoof care. The brown llama has a left rear lateral
claw that is curled outward and at least one other excessively long claw. Excessively long and misshapen claws
can cause strain on tendons and lead to discomfort. The facility shall establish and maintain a program of
veterinary care that includes routine preventative hoof care for the animals.
To be corrected by 6-4-14.

FEEDING.
3.129 (a) Feeding
--Contaminated feed is sometimes being fed to the animals. Hay that is contaminated with white mold is observed
being fed to the 17 sheep and 2 llamas. Mold can cause illness in animals. The facility shall ensure only feed that
is not contaminated is fed to the animals so as not to risk creating illnesses.
Corrected on site. The facility shall maintain a program of only feeding non-contaminated foods.
