TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* At least eight adult dogs had no official identification on them at the time of inspection. The licensee is currently
using collar id on the dogs. Official identification is needed to ensure that each animal s identity can be known with
certainty which helps to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all live dogs on the
premise shall be identified by an official tag, a distinctive and legible tattoo marking that is acceptable to and
approved by the Administrator or by a microchip chip number. If the licensee uses microchips then a microchip
reader must be made available to the inspector at time of facility inspection and a variance must be maintained on
file by the licensee. Correct by 2/29/16.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Broken, missing pieces of cement were observed in the cement flooring in at least five outdoor enclosures
housing seven dogs. Debris, straw and excreta were observed collecting in the affected cement flooring.
Unsanitary conditions exist from a lack of cleaning of the surface area if dirt, debris, excreta or food waste is allowed
to collect in the affected cement flooring. This could lead to a potential disease, contamination or health risks. The
licensee must ensure all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned
and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.

ensure that excreta waste is removed away from the primary enclosure as often as necessary to prevent an
excessive accumulation of feces and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. Correct by 2/5/16.
