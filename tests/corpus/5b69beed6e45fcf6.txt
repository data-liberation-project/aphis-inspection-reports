2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A brown Texas dall lamb was observed to have signs of scours, was thinner and was seen to walk in a weak and
hunched manner. The licensee said it was de-wormed a few days ago but might still have worms. Scours on a thin lamb
walking in a weak manner suggest that it is not feeling well and needs evaluation and treatment guided by the attending
veterinarian. Ensure that the attending veterinarian evaluates this lamb and that the recommended treatment is followed.
Note: The licensee called and scheduled to have the attending veterinarian see this lamb by the end of the day.

Indirect Non-compliance:
A white-wooled sheep has a lump on the left side of its face that hasn’t been closely evaluated by the facility to determine
if treatment is needed. Lumps/swollen spots can be caused by different things and some causes of lumps can be painful.
Ensure that this sheep evaluated by the attending veterinarian and the recommended treatment program is followed.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The following are in need of repair or replacement:
*The east corner of an enclosure housing a muntjac has chain link fencing that is broken with points.
*An enclosure housing 4 barbary sheep had a tree branch that had fallen on one portion of the east side of the fence. The

fence was still standing and containing the animals, but the top of the fencing is bent and damaged.
*The gate on the north side of the enclosure housing 2 fallow deer had wire mesh fencing that had become detached from
the framing. There was a large hole in the mesh fencing with loose wires.
*An enclosure housing 2 red fox had an approximately 3-inch gap between the bottom of the gate and the top of the
fencing for the enclosure, the gap ran the entire length of the gate. Also, 2 panels on the southeast side of the enclosure
have become separated from each other. The separation starts about halfway down the panel and is about 1-inch wide
and goes to the ground where it's about 4-inches wide.
Enclosures that are not properly maintained could injure the animals or allow animals to escape. Enclosures must be
maintained so that they are structurally sound and free from sharp points, loose wires, and fencing holes/gaps.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
