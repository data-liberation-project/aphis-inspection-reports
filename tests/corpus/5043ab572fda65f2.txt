Facilities, general.
Structural strength. Both doors to the guinea pig building were propped opened. There is no doorknob on the front door to
the new hamster building. Opened doors and lack of a doorknob can allow dogs, cats, other animals and pests to enter
the animal rooms which can cause disease risks, injury and deaths in the animal facility.

Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs and hamsters must be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, protect
animals from injury, contain animals, and restrict other animals from entering buildings and animal rooms. Licensee must
ensure that the doors to animals rooms and buildings restrict other animals from entering. Correct by August 24, 2021.
