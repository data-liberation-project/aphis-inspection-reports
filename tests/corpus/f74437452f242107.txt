FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The chain link perimeter fence located at the left side of the freezer had advanced, deteriorated, flaking rust. The
far end of this fenceline has completely become detached from the supporting posts making this fence easily
movable to the right side. This has created easy access into the park and the animal enclosures. The same
condition also exists at the entrance door/gate under the main pool where the left support pole for door hinge has
completely rusted away at the lower end which makes the door movable so a person (and animals) could possibly
squeeze through.
The entire perimeter fence must be constructed, and maintained, so that it restricts animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it and having possible contact with the marine mammals.

VETERINARY CARE.
The program of veterinary care indicates that all of the sea lions will have fecal exams twice a year, & a heartworm
test yearly.
The animals are not having semiannual fecal exams, A fecal exam was perform only in August 2014 on all animals
because of a medical condition (diarrhea) that existed. This test indicated that a possible bacterial infection existed
in all of the sea lions.
The sea lions are also not tested for heartworm disease every year.
You shall perform all recommended testings that your veterinarian recommends for the health and well being of the
animals as well as the public that have direct contact with them both in and out of the pools.
