MISCELLANEOUS.
** I called the facility and left a message at 11:30 am informing them that I would arrive within 30 minutes to conduct
an inspection. When I arrived there wasn't an authorized person available to conduct the inspection of the facility. A
facility representative was not available to allow access on 05/04/2016. Each research facility shall, during business
hours, allow APHIS officials to enter its place of business.
