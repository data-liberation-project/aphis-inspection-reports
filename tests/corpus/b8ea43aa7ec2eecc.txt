ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The 2 year old, male, Pomeranian dog with micro chip number 941000016475157 is having difficulty standing and
walking. When assisted to stand, this dog is reluctant to support itself and is having balance issues. When walking,
the dog has an abnormal gait, including circling and wobbling. There appears to be a neurologic problem that is
affecting the hind limbs more than the forelimbs. The dog appears to be of normal weight and hydration status. If
left untreated, this neurological problem can become more severe and might prevent the dog from eating and
drinking. This dog must be examined by a veterinarian. Documentation of the diagnosis and treatment must be
available for review by APHIS officials.
