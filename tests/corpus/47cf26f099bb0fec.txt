A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 213 adult
guinea pigs were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of adults

deaths. Correct by May 4, 2019.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Eleven of 19 enclosures housing a total of 164 adult guinea pigs and their offspring had accumulations of fecal
material and dirty bedding. There was more fecal material than bedding present. Enclosures were last cleaned 10
days ago. The accumulation of feces and dirty bedding exposes the guinea pigs to potential infections with bacteria,
fungi, and parasites. Too much feces and dirty bedding is accumulating between the cleaning interval. Correct by
ensuring that all primary enclosures are clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of feces and
dirty bedding. Correct by May 1, 2019.
