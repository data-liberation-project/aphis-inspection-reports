CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** There is an empty enclosure across from the whelping boxes. The enclosure has been empty for a month but
still has food in the feeder and and there is dust and grime on the floor of the mesh. Once empty these enclosures
should be cleaned and saitized in a timely manner to reduce any disease hazards and to promote good
housekeeping practices in the kennel.
*** Currently parasite control and other husbandry items are being stored on top of the whelping boxes, along with
paint cans and other non husbandry items. These items should be stored in a bin or cabinet and not directly on top
of the whelping boxes. This is for the safety of the animals and to keep items like cleaners and paint supplies away
from medicines.
