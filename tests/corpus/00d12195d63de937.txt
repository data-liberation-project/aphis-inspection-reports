2.1(a)(1) REPEAT
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
On April 7, 2015, a visit was made to this establishment. At that time, the facility was exhibiting regulated
mammals. During the visit the owner was made aware of the need to get licensed as an exhibitor if he is to
continue to operate as an exhibitor under the Animal Welfare Act.
Two years later, on today's visit, this establishment continues to exhibit regulated mammals (goats, pigs, cattle, as
well as some domestic cats that are allowed free access throughout the establishment) without obtaining a USDA
exhibitor license. The public is allowed to see & feed the farm animals, and touch the cats.
At this time, this establishment is now hosting a circus type dog act on an intermittent basis (usually on the
weekends). The operator of this circus act also does not appear to be USDA licensed. This type of show is also an
exhibition and requires a USDA license.
You may not exhibit any regulated mammals without a valid USDA Animal Welfare license. You must stop
exhibiting regulated mammals, or apply for a USDA license.
Correct immediately.
The owners of this establishment were not on the property during this visit and could not be contacted by telephone.
This visit and exit interview were conducted with the manager on duty who was made aware of the need to get
USDA licensed for both the farm animals on exhibit, as well, as the dog act.
This inspection report will be mailed Certified Mail-Return Receipt to the owners.
