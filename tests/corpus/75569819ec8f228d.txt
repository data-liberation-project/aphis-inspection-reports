ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:00 pm on
30-May-17.
I spoke to Licensee's father who said Daniel had called earlier and said he would be working late today. Typically
he is home around 4:45 pm, but when he works late he stays for a couple of extra hours. Mr. King said he would
ask Daniel to call me, too, when he works late.
