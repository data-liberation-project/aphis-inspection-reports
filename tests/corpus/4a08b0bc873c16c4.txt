ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Several animals were identified by APHIS personnel to have excessive hair loss:
-One black female llama had areas of hair loss over its shoulders and hips, the underlying skin had a normal
appearance.
-One female mandrill had areas of hair loss on her left forearm, extending from the elbow to her wrist and on her
right forearm just below the elbow.
-One brown capuchin housed in the elephant barn had patchy hair loss on its back extending from the neck to the
base of the tail. Additionally, this animal was observed by APHIS personnel to excessively scratch his back.
-One brown capuchin housed in the mouse-house building, had hair loss on its tail extending from the base to the
tip.
-One white-faced capuchin housed in the mouse-house building, had areas of hair loss on its back, over its
shoulders extending into the lumbar region and at the base of the tail.
From records supplied to APHIS personnel, one capuchin known as Little Girl was evaluated on 5/20/15 for patchy,
unresolved, chronic hair loss. The records show a skin scrape and CBC/Chem were performed, however the results
of those diagnostics were not supplied to APHIS personnel nor noted in the records. Additionally, there was no plan
for monitoring or treatment for that animal. There were no records indicating the above five animals have been
evaluated by a veterinarian for their condition.
Excessive scratching, hair loss and over-grooming can be potential indicators of underlying medical conditions or
psychological distress in animals.
***One female camel was observed to have an abnormal right hind foot confirmation and an abnormal gait. While
standing, the right hind foot had an abnormal angle, approximately 30 degrees to the ground, with the toes off the
ground pointing in an upward direction. While ambulating, it was observed that the right hind fetlock joint would
dip/sink further to the ground as compared to the left. Additionally, the toe nails of the right hind foot were
abnormally shaped and long, possibly due to abnormal wear. Abnormal feet gait and confirmations may be indicators of previous and/or ongoing medical conditions. Depending
on the cause, these conditions can be both progressive and painful.
The licensee must have the animals listed above examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnoses and
appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided to the
inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the
outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with the dosing
instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the medication is
administered to the animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Facility records indicate that Wally, a red-ruffed lemur, was able to get out of the sheltered part of his enclosure
into the enclosed keeper common area. Daily keeper logs from 8/11/15 until 9/23/15 state that Wally was still getting
out of his enclosure. On 9/23/15, the records state that Wally can no longer get out, as he is too big to fit between
the enclosure mesh. When asked what corrective action was taken to prevent the animal from getting out of his
enclosure, facility personnel stated nothing was done. The facility personnel stated they simply waited until he was
too big to get out. The keeper area Wally gained access to contained open electrical outlets, extension cords, facility
heater and chemicals for cleaning. This area contained hazards that pose a risk of injury to the animal when he
gained access.
The facility must ensure that housing facilities for nonhuman primates are designed and constructed so that they
protect the animals from injury and contain the animals securely.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
*** The facility's current primate enhancement plan does not address special considerations for nonhuman primates
that need special attention regarding environmental enhancement, such as nonhuman primates showing potential
signs of psychological distress through their behavior or appearance to ensure that their psychological needs are
met.
APHIS personnel observed one female mandrill which appeared to be in distress. The female was observed to pace
around her enclosure, trying to avoid the male she is housed with. APHIS personnel also noted the mandrill
enclosure contained minimal enrichment (only two bamboo shoots and one PVC toy). APHIS personnel alsoobserved one white-faced capuchin cribbing in its enclosure on a den box. Behaviors of the mandrill and capuchin,
in addition to several nonhuman primates that have excessive hair loss, may be indicators of psychological distress.

As part of the facility(cid:25)s plan for environment enhancement, the licensee must ensure that all nonhuman primates
showing signs of psychological distress through appearance or behavior are evaluated by a veterinarian and
provided special attention regarding the enhancement of their environment in addition to, taking into consideration
the needs of the individual species and in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian. The facility
must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for the environment enhancement for these animals and
any other nonhuman primates requiring special considerations.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The floor of the walk-in freezer used to store meat to feed the animals is dirty and there is ice accumulating on
the floor under the fan in the rear of the freezer. The floor has several areas of blood that has dripped onto the floor
and is now frozen. A plastic tub has been placed under the fan to collect water dripping from this fan. There is a
carcass of a calf uncovered in a bin and also the hind legs of a carcass protruding from a bag on a shelf. This
freezer requires a thorough cleaning and the leak repaired. Additionally, all frozen food must be wrapped or stored
in closed containers to protect the food supplies from deterioration, contamination, and freezer burn.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** Several areas of the perimeter fence have trees growing through the fence or areas that are impossible to
inspect because it has been overgrown by brush. This includes the southeast corner of the facility near the vehicle
gate, and behind the fallow deer, bongo, and sitatunga enclosures. The perimeter fence is not functional in its
current condition. The licensee must ensure that no trees or brush is affecting the structural strength or the ability to
inspect the fence. Failure to maintain a functional perimeter fence does not keep unwanted persons out or act as a
secondary containment for the animals. The licensee must conduct a thorough self-inspection of the entire
perimeter to ensure that all areas of perimeter fence are functional and comply with written requirements.
***The facility is currently closed for the season so APHIS personnel were unable to determine to adequacy of the
elephant enclosure barriers and the presence/absence of an attendant during periods of public exhibition.
***All animals cited under 2.40(b)(2) on the inspection report dated May 19, 2015 have been addressed by thefacility and the attending veterinarian.
*** This inspection was conducted on December 15 and 16, 2015 with the licensee and several facility
representatives as well as Animal Care staff ACI Randall Coleman, VMO Aaron Rhyner, Director Robert Gibbens,
representatives from USDA-APHIS Safety and Security, and two local sheriff deputies.
***A formal exit interview was conducted with the licensee on December 16, 2015.
