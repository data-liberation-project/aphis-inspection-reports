3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The documented Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for the dogs doesn't address the frequency the veterinarian will
complete a head to tail physical examination of the dogs. Addiotnally, the PVC doesn't address the frequency of
vaccination against rabies. The facility is currently vaccinating the dogs according to the veterinarian's recommendation
and the animals are receiving a head to tail physical exam no less than one time per year according the the medical
records. The PVC must include a frequency of head to tail exams of the dogs and frequencies the dogs will be
vaccinated against rabies to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.
Note: This was corrected between the time of inspection and the exit briefing.
3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
Four dogs are receiving medications prescribed by the veterinarian. On each of the dogs' medical records, the facility
documented the medications prescribed, the frequency, and the duration to be given. The facility was administering the
medications as prescribed by the veterinarian, but didn't document each time the medications were given to the animals.
This information is needed for APHIS inspectors to evaluate the medical care provided by the facility. Assure all dog
medical records document each time a medication is administered.
Note: This was corrected between the time of inspection and the exit briefing.
