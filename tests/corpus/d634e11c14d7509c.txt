ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a bottle of expired medication intermingled with other medications and vacinations in the refrigerator in
the kennel area. There was a bottle of Cal- Pho-Sol with a syringe and needle inserted into the bottle with an
expiration date of Feburary 2008 and no labeled dosage or directions for use. These medications were intermingled
with other pharmaceuticals that are currently being used in the sheltered facility and are therefore ready for use.
The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired and labeled properly in accordance
with standard veterinary practices and manufacturer's recommendations.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- There was an excessive accumulation of dirt, hair, and excreta on the wire mesh on the front of the gates to
numerous indoor enclosures. The wire mesh starts just off the ground and extends approximately 1 foot in height
which is at face and head level of most of the dogs present. Housing facilities must be kept clean and free of any
accumulation of waste material to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- A metal mesh is over the drain pipe in the back of most enclosures. There were at least four enclosures with wire
mesh or expanded wire flooring placed over the drain pipe that was bent or pulled up. This gap was large enough
that the 8 week old puppies housed in the kennel could get into the drain or injure a limb or foot. Also this wire had
large gaps that allow the puppies feet to fall through the openings in the wire. All enclosures must have appropriate
flooring provided such that the feet of the animals do not pass through the flooring and that the flooring over the
drain is flat and secure over the drain pipe. The puppies must be placed in enclosures where the flooring does not
allow their feet to fall through, or something must be placed on top of the wire in the current enclosure.
