ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult prairie dog was observed sitting hunched over with its head hanging down by the side of the enclosure.
This prairie dog was thin, with a dull haircoat and patchy hairloss along its sides and back. The base of its tail was
bare. The prairie dog did not move when approached by the other prairie dogs or when the keeper entered the
enclosure to pick up the prairie dog. During the inspection the veterinarian was called and the prairie dog was taken
to the veterinarian for care. Failure to promptly provide veterinary treatment to animals in need of care may prolong
the suffering of unhealthy animals. In the case of contagious disease this also may result in the spread of disease
to previously unaffected animals. The licensee must provide appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose,
and treat diseases and injuries. Correct by ensuring that procedures are implemented for clinically ill animals to
promptly receive appropriate veterinary treatment.
Correct from this day forward.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The prairie dog taken to the veterinarian during the inspection was a female whose last offspring had just died.
During the inspection an animal caretaker informed the APHIS officials that the prairie dog had not looked well on
Monday (two days ago). The head keeper told the APHIS officials that she had not been aware of this information.
APHIS officials were also informed that the female prairie dog was returned on Tuesday (yesterday) to the colony
with the other three prairie dogs. Information on animal health is not being communicated to the head keeper to
inform the attending veterinarian. The failure to communicate to the attending veterinarian the health status of the
female prairie dog and her return to the colony may have resulted in further deterioration of her health. The
attending veterinarian should have been informed about the offspring deaths and the declining health of the female
(mother) prairie dog so appropriate veterinary care could have been given. Correct by ensuring there is a
mechanism for direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal
health, behavior and well-being is conveyed to the veterinarian.
Correct from this day forward.3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The lower end of the enclosure housing the 2 alpacas and 3 goats has a large pool of water approximately 12 feet
by 24 feet. There is algae growth in the pool indicating that the water does not drain away quickly. Standing water
may provide a breeding area for insects and result in health problems for the exhibited animals. Better drainage
must be provided in this area to eliminate the pool of water. Correct by improving drainage to eliminate the standing
water.
