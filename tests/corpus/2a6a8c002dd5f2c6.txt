2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Barney was observed with large patches of hair loss around his neck, face, down both side to the right and left of
his body and has a large bald spot on his hindquarters. Barney was observed scratching for extended periods of
time around these areas of hair loss. Barney was diagnosed last March with allergy related dermatitis. His continued
scratching should be communicated to the vet so she can advise on possible options of treatment potentially
including allergy medications or changes in his environment (shavings or diet) to see if these changes can make a
different in his condition.
Andy had what appeared to be a hygroma with hair loss on his right front joint. This hygroma if untreated can
progress to local fluid accumulations, ulceration and infections. The licensee stated the vet has evaluated the
hygroma but there is no documentation indicating when this was and no method of alleviating the pressure on the
joints has been addressed.
Cindy’s pacing behavior should be communicated to the attending vet and she should be assessed for an
underlying medical condition either physical or psychological in nature. Pacing can be indicative of physical or
psychological issues that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modification.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the photo sessions, Cindy was directed to sit in a metal chair to the right of the plexi glass barrier which was
on the far side of the enclosure. She was anchored to the chair for each photo but the chair is not anchored to
anything making it immovable. The chair is approximately 30 pounds and was easily picked up by the inspector. A
few times Cindy wanted to get off the chair during the morning photo session and although her handler stopped her,
there is potential that if frustrated she could leave taking the chair with her. To minimize the risk of harm to the
animal and public, this chair should be anchored to an immovable object which can act as a sufficient barrier to
restrict contact with guests. Correct by: March 4, 2017

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
While in travel status for several months of the year, the primary enclosure for the three bears is a rectangular cattle
panel enclosure set up in a building on a concrete floor with shavings. There are no visual barriers in the enclosure
that allows the animals to avoid each other or get out of view of the guests. There are no furniture items, water tubs,
straw or bedding that allows the animals to express normal postural or social adjustments. Black bears normally
engage in postural behaviors of swimming, climbing, digging and denning and socially need to be able to have the
choice to get away from each other.
Cindy the female bear was observed pacing along the back panel for an extended period of time before and after
the show. This occurred on Friday and Saturday of the visit and inspection. She was facing the back wall away from
the public side and would seeming only break from the pacing behavior if the younger bear “Barney” would grab at
her legs repeatedly. She would then turn on him mouth open until he would submit and she would begin pacing
again. Pacing in black bears is an abnormal behavior pattern and can indicate stress, frustration or an underlying
medical condition.
Andy the older male bear laid in the center of the enclosure for the majority of the day and when he would get up,
his movements were stiff, slow and seemingly arthritic in nature. There has been no modification to the enclosure
with the addition of straw or bedding that would allow Andy to get off the concrete to be more comfortable and the
concrete can exacerbate his debility. In addition, several times “Barney” the younger bear would try and elicit a
response from the older bear and would get on top of him and Andy would tolerate it for a few moments before
opening his mouth and the younger bear would get off. Andy has no way to separate himself from the younger bear
which can cause additional stress or is potentially painful in his condition.
Barney is the youngest bear with hair loss over several parts of his body including a bald patch on his hindquarters.
Barney is the most active bear and was observed trying to elicit behaviors from the other bears, rolling on his back
and grabbing his back paws and trying to run around. Barney is scratching and rubbing his back on the concrete
which has caused a bald spot on his hindquarters. Barney was observed pacing for short periods of time. He needs
to be provided functional elements in this enclosure to promote normal behaviors as to prevent any abnormal ones
like pacing from becoming a continuous and rigid behavior.
