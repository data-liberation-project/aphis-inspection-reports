2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of vet care (PVC) is inadequate at this time.
A chart was provided by the attending veterinarian regarding the prevention of ectoparasites. The chart states that
the drugs ivermectin, fenbendazole, and albon are to be given to the hedgehogs every 2-4 weeks, every 2 weeks,
and for 7 days, respectively. The facility representative had not heard of the deworming program and was unable to
present any of these medications to the inspectors. There was no documentation indicating that the facility is
providing deworming for the hedgehogs or following the written program of veterinary care as provided by the
attending veterinarian.
The method of euthanasia and the treatment for internal parasites are not adequately described. The medications to
be used have not been provided on the written PVC.
The PVC is a written agreement between the dealer and the attending veterinarian, establishing standards of care
for the animals. Failure to have a complete PVC could jeopardize the health and well-being of the animals. The
facility should establish and maintain a PVC to include all the regulated animals at the facility and regularly
scheduled visits to the premises.
The applicant must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Any
change by the applicant to prescribed treatments should be discussed with and approved by their veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records of the hedgehogs that had been born on site was incomplete. The records reviewed during the
inspection showed that the last litter, of 3 females and 1 male, had been born on October 9, 2016 by the female
“Corina. ” Labels on the primary enclosures showed that the hedgehog “Angela” gave birth to 5 hedgehogs on
November 30, 2016 and “Sally” gave birth to 3 hedgehogs on November 18, 2016. The facility representativeexplained that the “B” and “W” at the top of the labels mean “birth” and “wean.” The letters next to the dates
corresponded to numbers, as A=1 baby, B=2 babies, C=3 babies, and so on. The inspectors also saw a litter of 3
hedgehogs that had been born in the time period after the mother "Avia" had been weighed on December 4, 2016
and before the inspection on December 6, 2016. The enclosure was not properly identified with the number of
animals inside and there was no record available that identified these offspring. The facility representative was not
aware that these hedgehogs had been born.
A record of acquisition presented to the inspectors did not contain all of the required information. There was no
name and address of the person from whom the animals were acquired, vehicle license number, nor driver’s license
number.
Accurate and complete records for the acquisition, birth, and disposition of animals other than dogs and cats are
required to ensure that legal acquisition, proper care, and humane transportation occur.
Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or
otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession
or under his or control.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
A pair of scissors was lying on top of a slatted shelf located directly above the roofless hedgehog enclosure. There
was at least one breeding female in the enclosure at the time of inspection. We did not pull out the enclosure to
identify the number of babies present. These scissors pose a risk of injury to the hedgehogs in the enclosure
beneath as they have the potential to fall through the slats into the enclosure.
On the ceilings above the primary enclosures of the hedgehogs, there was a buildup of cobwebs. On the floors and
the sinks near the enclosures there was an accumulation of bedding, dead crickets, and debris. Accumulation of
debris and trash near animal enclosures can lead to pest infestation, disease transmission, reduced health of the
animals, and may be an indication of substandard husbandry practices.
The premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury.
3.131(d) REPEATSANITATION.
During the time of inspection, there were numerous flies in the back room of the pet store, where the hedgehog
breeding operation is located. The licensee has one fly trap hanging in the room, however this does not appear to
be controlling the flies. There was also an opened crate of live crickets in the back room directly adjacent to two
hedgehog enclosures.
Insect pests are a source of bacteria, viruses, parasites, and other possible infectious organisms. Flies can also
spread disease between animals by landing on excreta or infectious material in one enclosure and then landing on
food, water receptacles, or the animals in a different enclosure.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives, ACI Cindy Rhodes, and VMO
Dominique Engel.
