3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
Paint has worn off of the wood that forms the floor and walls of the guinea pig enclosures, leaving the wood no longer
impervious to moisture. Bare wood cannot be effectively sanitized, exposing the animals to disease hazards. Guinea pig
enclosures shall be constructed of smooth material substantially impervious to liquids and moisture. The enclosures must
be repaired, replaced, or resurfaced such that they are impervious to moisture.
