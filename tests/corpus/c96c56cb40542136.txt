2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The 13 year old male lion is not in good health or body condition. He appears thin and the pelvic bones are
prominent. His coat is rough and has turned a dark brown. And, the mane has thinned as would be seen on a one
year old lion. There is also a watery discharge around the lion's eyes.
A dose of testosterone and a course of antibiotic has been administered per the veterinarian's instruction. However,
the condition of the animal is not much improved. Although the lion has been under a veterinarians's care, a
diagnosis has not been determined. An illness left undiagnosed can lead to suffering of the animal. An examination
by a veterinarian with exotic cat experience is needed to determine the cause of the lion's weight loss and
generalized unthriftiness to determine the appropriate options for treating the lion's condition.
