ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following guinea pigs were identified as needing veterinary care:
1)(cid:9)In building 1, row 1, 6th enclosure from the back had a tri-colored female guinea pig with scabbing on the top and
lower portions of the right ear.
2)(cid:9)In building 1, row 1, 5th enclosure from the back had a grayish tan and white female guinea pig with hair loss on
the top of its back approximately 2 inches long.
3)(cid:9)In building 2, row 2, 5th enclosure from the front had a white and tan female guinea pig with a charcoal head with
hair loss approximately 1 inches long and a sore on its back.
4)(cid:9)In building 2, row 3, 10th enclosure from the front had hair loss approximately 2 inches long and a bleeding sore
on its back.
These four animals were not on any treatment and had not been evaluated by the attending veterinarian. When the
APHIS officials identified these four guinea pigs the licensee treated guinea pigs described in items 3 and 4 in
accordance with the facility program of veterinary care.
The conditions described in items 1 and 2 are not covered in the current program of veterinary care. The hair loss
and ear wounds of this type can occur for a number of reasons including both infectious and traumatic. Failure to
properly diagnose and treat animal conditions can result in a worsening of the condition. These two guinea pig must
be examined by the attending veterinarian so that appropriate veterinary care can be provided. Additionally, the
licensee must maintain records of veterinary recommendations and treatment provided for future evaluation by
APHIS officials. Correct by April 15, 2017.
