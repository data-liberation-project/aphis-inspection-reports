SANITATION.
*** A three-sided storage shed has accumulations of junk and trash items that require removal or recycling. There
are bags of aluminum cans, old mattresses, building supplies, and other miscellaneous items in this shed. This
area needs a thorough cleaning and removal of unusable items. Currently, this area can harbor pests and items
such as mattresses provide bedding for these pests. Correct this by cleaning this area to include removing all
unusable items and maintain all areas of the facility neat and orderly.
