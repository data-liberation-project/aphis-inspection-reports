ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
After delivering a 21 day suspension notice to the licensee(cid:25)s representative, Dr. Ziegerer requested access to the
facility to assess the animals. The facility representative refused to provide access and called the licensee. When
Dr. Ziegerer spoke to the licensee, she again requested access to assess the animals and verbally notified the
licensee of the 21 day suspension. The licensee also refused to provide access to the animals.
Failure to provide APHIS officials with access for inspection upon request interferes with the ability of the officials to
protect the welfare of the animals and thwarts the authority of the Secretary to enforce the Animal Welfare Act
regulations and standards.
The licensee must provide access for inspection when requested by APHIS Officials.
To be corrected during all future inspections.
Additional Inspectors
Ziegerer Katheryn, Supervisory Animal Care Specialist
