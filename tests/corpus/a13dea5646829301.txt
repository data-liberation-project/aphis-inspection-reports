FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The tops of the shelter boxes are warped in the bobcat and wolf enclosures. The warping of the tops has created a
gap of 4 inches between the top and sides of the shelter boxes. This gap creates a large enough space where the
animal could reach through the gap and injure itself or potentially escape. Also the lightweight metal latches on
these enclosure tops were not adequately secured to prevent possible escape of the animals. The tops for these
two shelter boxes must be repaired or replaced and secured by an appropriate locking mechanism to prevent injury
or escape of the animals contained within them. To be corrected by: May 30, 2014.
