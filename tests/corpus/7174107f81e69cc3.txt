3.75(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are some areas on the floors in the primary enclosures for the male gorilla - trailers X and Y - where there is
chipping and missing paint, especially around the toilets.
All surfaces must be maintained and/or replaced on a regular basis in order to facilitate adequate cleaning. Failure
to maintain and/or replace surfaces can impede cleaning, which may create unsanitary conditions.
This inspection was conducted with facility representatives. An exit interview was conducted on 9/25/18 by phone,
with the licensee.
