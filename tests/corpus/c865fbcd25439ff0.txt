2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
A search for unlicensed regulated activity was conducted. The facility representative contacted stated that sales of
animals via sight unseen transaction were being conducted. This is activity for which a USDA license is required.
Conducting regulated activity without a license does not allow the regulatory process, including routine inspections,
to ensure the welfare standards are being met for those animals. This is not in compliance with the Animal Welfare
Act. Correct by either applying for a USDA "A" license to conduct regulated sales sight unseen, or cease to conduct
these types of sales without a USDA license.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
