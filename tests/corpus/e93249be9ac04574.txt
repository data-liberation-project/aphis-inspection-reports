3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Female Building" the outdoor section of the enclosures are constructed of chain-link fencing. In one
enclosure, housing at least one dog, the chain-link has broken creating sharp points at the level of the dog.
In the "Whelping Building" an indoor enclosure, containing two dogs, has flooring constructed of wire. The wire
along one wall has broken resulting in sharp points. During the inspection, the licensee covered the damaged floor
with a new, solid piece of flooring. In the outdoor section of three enclosures, containing at least three dogs, the
wire flooring has broken creating sharp points. In the outdoor section of two other enclosures, containing at least
two dogs, the wire flooring has multiple sharp points running along one edge. Sharp points could cause injury to the
dogs.
Housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges. The licensee must remove, repair or alter the
sharp points in a manner that eliminates the injury risk towards the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.
