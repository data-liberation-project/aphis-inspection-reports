ANNUAL REPORT.
The facility's 2013 Annual Report submitted to the Animal Care (AC) Regional Director did not state the common
name and numbers of animals being held for use in research but not yet used for such purposes. The facility is
holding kittens until they reach one year of age for research purposes, but did not include those animals on the
annual report. Each reporting facility shall submit an annual report with all the required information to the AC
Regional Director to cover the previous Federal fiscal year.
Corrected at time of inspection
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
