2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee was unable to locate APHIS Form 7005 (Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand), therefore,
this document could not be reviewed by the inspector. Failure to make, keep, and maintain APHIS Form 7005 does
not meet the record keeping requirements and could interfere with the ability of the APHIS inspector to properly
identify animals as well as perform trace backs of animals.
Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the relevant
information concerning each dog purchased, owned, in possession of, transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise
disposed of. The licensee must fill out and maintain APHIS Form 7005 with all required information and present it to
the APHIS inspector for review at the time of the inspection.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the small building there are three enclosures that each have a large enclosed whelping box. Each of the
whelping boxes have heat lamps attached and each box is currently being used by one adult female dog and a total
of ten puppies. The heat lamps have no guards and the adult female dogs are tall enough to come into direct
contact with the heat bulb. Direct contact with the heat bulb could cause burns or injury to the dog.
Housing facilities must be designed and constructed so that they protect the animals from injury. The applicant
must remove the heat bulbs from the enclosure or alter the heat lamps in a manner that does not allow the dogs to
come into contact with the heat bulbs. The applicant must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all
times.

3.1(c)(1)(ii)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In five enclosures, housing a total of ten adult dogs, the chain link fence has been broken or bent into sharp points
that are located at the level of the dogs. In two enclosures, housing a total of two adult dogs and six puppies, the
enclosed wooden whelping boxes have been chewed and damaged resulting in the sharp points of metal screws
being exposed. These sharp points are located at the level of the adult dogs and the puppies. Contact with sharp
points could cause injury to the dogs.
Surfaces of housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges. The licensee must remove the sharp
points or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury risk towards the animals. The licensee must ensure that
all enclosures are free of sharp points at all times in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
