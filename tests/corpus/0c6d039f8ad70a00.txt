ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dog #4243, an adult brown and white beagle housed in room 124 was observed exhibiting a continuous circling
behavior to the left. It was not possible to assess this dog in the enclosure without the dog being aware of the
observation. However, facility husbandry personnel familiar with the dog stated they were able to observe the dog
for approximately an hour each day and the circling behavior was continuous. This repetitive behavior can have
behavioral or physical origins.
The medical record of this dog documented circling behavior in April 2012 and enhanced exercise enrichment was
provided. It was documented in May 2012 that the dog stopped the circling behavior when group-housed. No
additional entries were noted in the record regarding the behavior of this animal.
The dog was individually housed during this inspection and facility personnel stated there was no reason the animal
could not be grouped housed at this time. No records were available to determine the dogs housing status between
May 2012 and the present. This dog was placed in group housing prior to the end of the inspection.
Dog #4964, an adult female brown and white hound mix, was observed to have thickened pink skin with concurrent
hair loss and small crusted lesions in both flank areas at the front of the rear legs. Multiple small red, circular raised
lesions were visible on the abdomen in an area where the hair is naturally sparse.
Medical records indicated that this dog had been diagnosed and treated for allergic dermatitis in September and
October of 2014 and resolved with treatment. Facility personnel familiar with the previous dermatitis episode stated
that the skin symptoms now are not as severe as when treatment was first initiated but are worse than when the
prior treatment was concluded.
The current behavioral and physical status of the above dogs should be communicated to and addressed
accordingly by the attending veterinarrian. Problems related to animal health and behavior as observed by facility
personnel must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian accurately and as frequently as necessary to ensure
adequate communication related to animal problems is maintained with the veterinarian. Appropriate
communication is required to ensure adequate veterinary oversight when needed.Correct by: January 23, 2015.
The inspection was conducted with management and various facility personnel. The exit interview was conducted
with management.
