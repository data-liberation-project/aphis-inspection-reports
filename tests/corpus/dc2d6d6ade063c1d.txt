ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:50 a.m. on

In addition to waiting 30 minutes, I knocked on the door, hooked my vehicle horn and called the phone number
provided and left a message.
