A bottle of Tramadol located inside a locked drug cabinet and obtained from the attending veterinarian had no
prescription label on it. No other written veterinary instructions for its use were made available during inspection.
This medication is currently being used for a covered species at the facility. Medications must be labeled with
appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that they are used safely and appropriately. As part of the
program of adequate veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all medications are labeled with the contents
(name and concentration of drug), the route of administration, duration, dosage instructions (specific for the species
of animal being treated), and expiration date. The licensee must ensure that appropriate methods of veterinary care
are used at all times.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The approved written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) did not include sugar gliders and wallabies. All covered
species should be addressed in the PVC to ensure the facility has a program to follow concerning the care of all the
animals. Failure to do so could adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals. A complete and accurate
written Program of Veterinary Care with consultation from the attending veterinarian must be in place.
