2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 on
19-Dec-17.
Attempts to contact included knocking at the door of the house and leaving a voicemail on the listed phone number.
No answer was received within 30 minutes. Without access to conduct the inspections, the regulatory process is
impossible. Licensees must ensure a knowledgeable facility representative is available for inspections during
normal business hours. Correct from this time forward.
