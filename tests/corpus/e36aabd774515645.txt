Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
At the time of inspection, only one health certificate was available for review. The rest of the records required by the
Animal Welfare Act were not available at the time of inspection for examination by APHIS officials. According to the
licensee, the records had been taken offsite recently.

Correct for all future inspections.

Sanitation.
In enclosure A10, two tigers were housed in a single enclosure with a small lockout since arrival approximately a month
ago. During the inspection, initially the white tiger was in the lockout, while the yellow tiger was in the primary enclosure.
The lockout appeared to have been heavily used and contained a damaged and dirty water container, dried out food
attracting flies and a layer of fur and puddles on the dirt floor. When the lockout door to the primary enclosure was
opened, the yellow tiger joined the white tiger in the lockout, allowing the staff to clean the primary enclosure. While in the
secondary, both tigers were unable to avoid the saturated areas of the enclosure and their paws were dirty. After
cleaning, the tigers were both moved into the primary and a stick was used to remove the leftover food items and solid


excreta by pulling it to the edge of the lockout. With animals in the primary, there is no alternate entrance to access the
lockout to safely clean it. The dirty, damaged water container, fur and standing water on the dirt floor could not be
adequately cleaned to prevent contamination and minimize disease hazards to the animals.

Employees.
A long term volunteer was not able to follow the facility protocols and professionally acceptable husbandry practices due
to the facility housing a leopard in an enclosure without a lockout. The facility cleaning procedures require the use of a
lockout to clean the enclosures, but an adult leopard was in an enclosure (C5) without a lockout. In February, an incident
occurred at the facility where a senior volunteer was injured by the leopard while in the enclosure with him and
subsequently the leopard was able to exit the primary enclosure. Following this incident, the leopard was moved to an
enclosure (A12) with a lockout.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
