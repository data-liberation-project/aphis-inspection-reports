CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the "main kennel" there were five sheltered enclosures housing eleven dogs that had a build-up of feces
underneath the wire mesh in outdoor part of the enclosures. The odor was apparent when entering the area and
the licensee state it had been three to four weeks since it was last cleaned. The build-up of feces can cause
disease hazards and attract pests and the odor can affect the lungs and breathing of the dogs.
The licensee must clean as often as necessary to prevent the accumulation of feces to reduce disease hazards,
pests, insects, and odors.
