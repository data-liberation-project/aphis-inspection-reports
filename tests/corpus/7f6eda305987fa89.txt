ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is an 80lb sow that has an injury to her left rear leg that prevents her from being able to put any weight on it,
to the point where she drags it to the side of her body when she tries to walk. The sow has been isolated in its own
pen for at least one week, however the veterinarian has not been contacted and no treatment or action has been
taken to address the obvious health issue. In the 'Grower' side of the finishing barn there is another 80lb female
that has an abscess approximately 8 inches in diameter, with a slightly purple color and tight in appearance located
on the underside of her left jaw, which was not observed until during the inspection. At this time the veterinarian
has not been contacted in regards to these two health issues, and no treatments have been given.
Any health issue that is left untreated can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort to the regulated animals. The
lack of response can cause a treatable condition to become chronic or fatal if left undiagnosed and treated for long
periods of time depending on the original condition.
The veterinarian must be contacted to properly diagnose and treat any condition that is required. The licensee must
make sure all conditions are treated according to the veterinarians directions and procedures at all facilities.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is an 80lb sow that is in the finishing barn with a leg injury that prevents her from being able to walk on her
left rear leg without dragging it beside her body. The sow was put in a pen alone at least one week ago, however
the injury was not observed and the condition has gone untreated or diagnosed, and the veterinarian has not been
contacted. There is another 80lb sow on the 'Grower' side of the finishing barn that was in a pen with multiple sows
that had an abscess (approx. 8 inches in diameter) located under the left side of her jaw. This abscess has a slightly
purple color to it and is quite large and tight in appearance. The condition of this sow had not been observed until
during the inspection, where she was then moved to an isolation pen. At this time both conditions had not been
observed until during the inspection, resulting in the veterinarian not being contacted or any treatments beingprovided.
It is important that complete daily observations be conducted of all regulated animals in order to identify any health
issues that appear, in order to prevent any unnecessary pain or discomfort.
The licensee must conduct thorough daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well being. A
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
