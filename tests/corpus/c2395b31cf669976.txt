3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Three metal hose clamps been used to secure joining sections at the cougar's primary enclosure, were observed to
be deteriorating; having sharp points/edges. Damage metal components on primary enclosures for regulated
animals could develop sharp points and edges, that might injure these. Housing facilities must be
kept in good repair and must be free of jagged edges; protecting the animals from injury, and containing the animals
securely. All damaged hose clamps at primary enclosures/cages must be replaced and/or fixed to prevent the
potential of an injury to regulated animals.
