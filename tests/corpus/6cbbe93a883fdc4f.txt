Facilities, general.
The green underground wire barrier, which extends along the entirety of the inside of the enclosure fence in the dirt, has
areas - too numerous to count - where it is exposed with sharp points. The integrity of this barrier is important as it helps
prevent the rabbits from escaping, as well as the sharp portions allowing for potential injury of the animals. Outdoor
housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury, and contain
them therein. Repair and/or replacement of this barrier is needed for this area to be brought back into compliance.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
Currently the facility does not have a written Non-Human Primate (NHP) environmental enhancement plan - although the
NHP's are receiving environmental enrichment. Lack of a written plan could lead to lack of uniformity when working with
the animals, lack of adequate environmental enhancement and consequently negatively impact the psychological well-
being of the animals. Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environmental enhancement
adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates.

Facilities, general.
The night quarters housing 6 coati's is in disrepair where the ceiling is steadily leaking drops of rain water near the center
of the room and inside one out of 3 enclosures - which is not currently housing any animals. There are beads of water
steadily building along the ceiling in these areas that are too numerous to count and dripping in intervals approximately
less than a second. There appears to be no active dripping in the two enclosures housing the coati's. The night quarters
for the 2 river otters is identical to that of the coati's, except the leaks are occurring within their enclosure. The night
quarters for the 2 older ocelots also has steady leaks of rain water into the enclosure right above closed electrical wires
that are running along the top of the enclosure.
The steady leaks from the ceiling represent the likelihood of roof damage, which could result in collapse of the roof. In
addition, the incoming water could pool and flood the enclosures. Regarding the ocelot enclosure, the aforementioned two
potential hazards exist, as well as the chance of electrocution via the wire enclosure and/or a fire should the electric wires
get wet.
The indoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair as to protect the animals from
injury. If the animals remain in their current enclosures, determining the source(s) of the leaks and repairing said cause(s),
along with eliminating the electrical hazard, must be performed to bring all night quarters back into compliance. As an
alternative, the animals can me moved to compliant enclosures.

Facilities, outdoor.
A geriatric ring-tailed cat with neurological issues (that contribute to her decrease in ambulation), does not have a dry
place, both inside and outside of her nest box, to escape the rain today at a time where we are currently experiencing
frequent seasonal rain storms. The wood on the bottom inside of the box is wet, as is she alongside her right thigh, back-
end and tail. According to the facility representative, she is not able to climb up onto the perches inside the box to stay dry
because of her medical condition. Geriatric animals are especially more sensitive to changes within their environment that
can cause discomfort and illness. Natural or artificial shelter must be appropriate to local climatic conditions for the
species concerned for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort. The representative
immediately had her moved temporarily indoors to a drier cage until her shelter can be improved.

Facilities, outdoor.
There are domesticated cats, most recently an orange tabby seen by the facility representative - on the premises - and a
grey and white tabby seen by one of the inspectors just outside of the facility, gaining entry onto the premises. Recently, 2
ring-tailed lemurs housed on the southwest side of the facility, died suddenly - one of confirmed toxoplasmosis and the
other is pending. After some research, including necropsy results and data collected by the veterinarian, the facility
suspects the source of the toxoplasmosis to potentially be from the domesticated cats; as they are known to carry the
organism. The facility has not been able to keep the cats from crossing their perimeter fence, which could negatively
impact the safety and well-being of the animals housed at the facility. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it
protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through or under it and
having contact with the animals in the facility.
