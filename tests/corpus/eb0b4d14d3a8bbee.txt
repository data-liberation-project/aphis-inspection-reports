2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Inspectors reviewed Proposals #4347 and #4356. Both proposals state that, (cid:28)"Postoperatively the animals will
receive one dose of Buprinorphine (0.03 mg/kg IM/SQ), and then as needed for pain.(cid:29)" Both proposals also state
that, "(cid:28)Topical lidocaine eye drops (0.5%) or proparicaine eye drops (0.5%) will be used to prevent any further
discomfort.(cid:29)" Finally, both proposals state that, (cid:28)"All rabbits will be treated for one week with topical Tobradex
ointment twice a day and Vigamox four times a day, to prevent infection.(cid:29)" When inspectors reviewed 8 animal
procedure/usage records pertaining to the aforementioned proposals, none of the records indicate that these
medications were administered as outlined in the proposal.
The IACUC must review and approve significant changes in proposals and ensure that the activities are conducted
as stated in the approved proposal. This approval is required in order to ensure that all activities involving animals
are conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations, and in order to protect the health and
well-being of the animals at the facility. The IACUC must ensure that significant changes to approved proposals are
reviewed and approved prior to implementation.
