ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****A male Chihuahua (m/c# 090 066 101) and a male Yorkshire terrier (m/c# 073 605 869) were excessively licking
their lips. Upon closer inspection, both dogs had a build-up of hard brown material that covered their entire cheek
teeth and most of their canine teeth. Teeth problems can be painful, can affect the animal's ability to eat, and can
result in tooth loss. The licensee must have these dogs examined and treated by a veterinarian and must establish
an effective program of dental maintenance.

****A male Chihuahua (m/c# 090 066 101) had excessively long toenails on all four feet. The toenails on the back
feet were curling backwards. Excessively long toenails can result in injury, especially in dogs housed on wire, and
can affect the normal gait of the dog. The licensee must trim these toenails to a normal length and must establish
and maintain an effective nail trimming program.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(d) Pest Control.
The licensee does not have an effective pest control program. Rodent feces and spilled dog food were present on
the floor of the food storage building between the pallet of dog food and the walls of the building. Small holes were
present in the wall coverings, which could be entry points for rodents. Rodents can harbor diseases that can affect
the health of the dogs. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective pest control program.

The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
