ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection, the program of veterinary care was outdated for July 2011 and a recent program was not
available for review by APHIS personnel. An updated program of veterinary care should be kept at the facility and
available at all times upon request during inspection. The plan should be current and reflect the agreed upon health
of the animals at the facility.
