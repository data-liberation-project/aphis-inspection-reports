Veterinary care for dogs.
The two dogs at the facility have not had a complete physical examination from head to tail in the past year. In addition,
the program of vet care only details schedule of rabies vaccination and monthly parasite control and does not contain a
vaccination schedule for other diseases including parvo and distemper. The PVC section for dogs must be updated to
reflect new guidance and the dogs must have a physical exam for their health and well being.

Facilities, general.
*** The capybara hutch is in disrepair and the lid of the hutch is worn and deteriorating. This hutch needs to be kept in
good repair for the safety of the animal. In addition, there is an extra panel of wire mesh between the capybara and goats
that is not fully connected but seeming cut in the middle, creating sharp wires along the top and mid level sections of
fence line. These wires could be a hazard and should be addressed.

*** The prehensile tail porcupine’s shelter has a heat mat that is screwed down to the base of the floor. There is a portion
of the screw that is now protruding below the box where the animal has access as he comes down on a branch. These
screws should be blunted down so nothing sharp is protruding into the area for the safety of the animal.

*** One older wood structure in the kangaroo enclosure has sections of the wood floor that are in disrepair and the sides
walls of bamboo are separated from the structure exposing rusted nails. This structure should be removed or replaced for
the safety of the animals.

*** There is a pile of unused wood and plastic building materials in the goat enclosure at the far fence line. Due to the
playful nature of goats and the haphazard way the materials are stored, this can create a safety hazard for the goats. The
materials need to be stored securely against the fence or in another area to keep the enclosure in good repair.

3.127(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
Currently the artificial structure provided for the camel and goats only provides shelter from inclement weather if the
animals are directly in the center of the structure and rain falls straight down. There are no sides to the structure and if the

rain comes in sideways, the animals are not able to stay dry. Per this regulation, an effective shelter must be provided for
all animals housed outdoors to afford protection from the elements. The facility does have adequate stalls in the main
barn and should facilitate a method for animals to access stalls during periods of inclement weather or reassess the
shelter to assure its adequate for their comfort.
