Section 2.38(b) - Access and inspection of records and property.
A facility representative was not available to allow access at 12:35-13:05 on 04/16/2014.
Upon arrival at the facility, the doors were locked and the parking lot almost empty. Telephone contact was
attempted with the Attending Veterinarian and messages left. When the IACUC Chair was successfully contacted
by phone, he stated that no responsible person was available today or the rest of the week to accompany the
inspector. The attempted inspection report exit interview was discussed with the IACUC Chair during this telephone
contact.
