3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In building W1, housing four adult dogs and nine puppies, the inspectors noticed an excessive buildup of ammonia
and odor. Upon closer inspection there was a litter box for the farm cats under the dog enclosures. This litter box
was completely full of cat feces and urine. An empty bag of dog food was also used as a litter box by the cats and
contained multiple piles of cat waste on it. A buildup of ammonia and odors can have negative effects on the health
and well-being of the dogs and puppies. The buildings must be kept clean of cat waste to reduce the buildup of
ammonia and odors and promote the health and well-being of the dogs. The licensee removed the cat waste during
the inspection.

3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Throughout the facility there are empty bags of dog food that are used as trash receptacles. In building B the empty
bag has been chewed on by mice and in building W1 the cats have used an empty bag as a litter box. These empty
food bags and bags of trash can attract pests and increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs. There are
at least twenty adult dogs and nine puppies housed in these buildings. All housing facilities must have leak-proof
trash containers with tightly fitted lids on them at all times. All empty bags of dog food must be kept inside these
trash containers to reduce the risk of pests and disease hazards.

In building B, housing six dogs, there is an excessive amount of mouse feces on the floor of the walkway between
the dog enclosures and under the enclosures. One empty bag of dog food that was sitting on the floor was observedto have a hole chewed in the bottom of it by the mice. The presence of mice in animal areas can increase the risk
of disease hazards. The facility must establish and maintain an effective program of pest control so as to maintain
the health and well-being of the dogs.
