Housekeeping.
The following item is still in need of cleaning:
1. Two air handlers have two circulating fans each. According to employees, the fans have been cleaned but these
fans again have accumulations of grime and dust on their covers. Continued accumulation of dust, grime and
debris will limit the efficiency of the fans. Additionally, there is grime and dirt present on the exterior of these same
air handlers.
Accumulations of dirt, dust and grime indicates that the air handlers are not being adequately cleaned on a regular
basis. The above item must be addressed to ensure that cleaning is routinely done to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices for the health and well-being of the animals.
The cleaning of these air handlers must be completed on a more frequent basis in order to prevent the
accumulation of dust, dirt and grime.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
