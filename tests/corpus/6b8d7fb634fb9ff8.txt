2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has been operating a site called the Cultural Park for approximately one year. At that site there are
deer, pigs, and goats. The facility has not had the Attending Veterinarian visit the site to see the animals and the
husbandry practices there, and there is no written Program of Veterinary Care that covers these species.
The facility should ensure that all animals being exhibited are under the care of the Attending Veterinarian. The
Attending Veterinarian should visit the site to inspect the animals, review husbandry practices, and, together with
the licensee, develop a written Program of Veterinary Care that addresses preventive care and other issues that will
ensure the health and well-being of the animals being exhibited.

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the Cultural Park location, where there are deer, goats, and pigs, the perimeter fence does not completely
enclose the property.
The property should have a perimeter fence that is at least six feet in height, and that prevents people and animals
from passing under of through the fence, and also as a secondary containment for the animals on exhibit, in case
they should escape their enclosures. The perimeter fence helps to ensure that the animals will be protected from
harm.
