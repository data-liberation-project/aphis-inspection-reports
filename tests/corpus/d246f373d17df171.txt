2.32(b)

Personnel qualifications.
A vial of anesthetic medication was noted on inspection to have expired at the end of April 2021. Review of the drug log
for that medication revealed that expired medication had been administered to animals on study on 5/3/2021. A non-
expired replacement vial of the medication was available on site for use in regulated species. The expired medication was
marked for disposal at the time of inspection.

Research facilities shall review the qualifications of personnel who have been trained on the proper use of anesthetics
with sufficient frequency to fulfill the facility’s responsibilities under this subpart and section 2.31.

To be corrected from this point forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
