Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Shih Tzu (tag # 674)has a thick buildup of a dark brown colored organic material on at least half the surface of the
upper right and left canine teeth. The entire surface of the upper cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth are covered in a
greyish-brown colored material. The manager stated that the dog has never been evaluated by a veterinarian.
Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues. The licensee must
have the above mentioned dog evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times
2.75(a)(1)(v)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
APHIS form 7006 is missing and the disposition date for the puppies is not listed on a cage card or litter record. According
to the site manager, 23 puppies were picked up on September 7, 2021 and moved to an unknown location. The
disposition records are necessary to complete records, identify dogs, and to trace the movements of dogs.
3.6(a)(2)

Primary enclosures.
In two enclosures, containing two adult female dogs and 9 puppies, the flooring is constructed of wire. The adult female
dog had removed the puppies from the whelping box and the inspector observed the front and hind legs of at least one


puppy passing through the openings in the wire flooring. Openings in flooring that are large enough for the puppy's feet
and legs to pass through could cause injury to the foot and leg or result in entrapment of the puppy.

Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury and
does not allow the dogs' feet/legs to pass through any openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the flooring in a
manner that does not allow the feet/legs of the puppies to pass through the openings. The licensee must ensure that the
flooring of the enclosure is safe for the dogs at all times.

In two enclosures containing 7 dogs, the plastic feeders have chewed, worn and sharp edges on the corners of the
feeders. The dogs are at risk of coming into contact with the sharp edges every time they approach the feeders, which
could result in injury. These edges are also unable to be properly cleaned and sanitized.
In one enclosure containing three dogs, there are two 2x4 wooden boards fixed to the floor and they have been chewed
on the ends creating sharp edges. The dogs are at risk of coming into contact with these sharp edges every time they sit,
lay or walk on or by the boards, which could result in injury. These chewed edges are also unable to be properly cleaned
and sanitized.
In one enclosure containing 1 adult dog and 6 puppies, the wooden floor was improperly sealed and is not impervious to
moisture and can not be properly cleaned and sanitized.
The sharp edges could potentially injure the dogs and the surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be
readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of
housing facilities are maintained in good repair at all times.
