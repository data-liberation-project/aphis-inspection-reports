HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***On June 3, 2015 the facility self-reported the following event to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW).
Three adult male dachshunds were in one run and a recently weaned litter of puppies was in the adjoining run. A
side-to side opening transfer door connects the two runs. During the night, the transfer door was somehow opened
and the male adults killed one of the puppies. The other puppies were unharmed. The facility examined all of the
transfer doors to determine if the latching mechanisms were working and adequate. The examination revealed that
while the transfer doors appeared to be working correctly, the latching of the doors required careful attention. All of
the transfer door latches were replaced with retractable spring plungers with pull rings that must be physically
engaged by personnel standing within the run when either opening or closing the transfer door. When the ring is
released, the plunger snaps down and secures the door in the desired position. To avoid incidents such as this from
happening again, the facility must ensure that housing facilities for dogs are designed and constructed so that they
protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering at all times.
This noncompliance was corrected prior to inspection.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***On March 7, 2016 the facility self-reported the following event to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare
(OLAW). Two adult boars were singly housed in adjacent pens in compliance with the facility's IACUC policy.
During early morning rounds by the veterinarian, both pigs were found in one pen. Both pigs showed signs of
fighting (scratches, abrasions, bruising) but there was very little blood in the area. One boar was dead. The
veterinarian concluded that the dead pig probably died from exhaustion/cardiac arrest. The penning between the
boars had been knocked down allowing the two boars access to each other. There was nothing broken or bent on
the penning. This penning is the same type used throughout the building and there have been no similar events in
the 6 years the facility has been open. The pen was put back together and reinforced. After this event, it was
noticed that the surviving boar appeared more aggressive and the decision was made to euthanize it. To avoid
incidents such as this from happening again, the facility must ensure that housing facilities are constructed so that
they protect the animals from injury and contain the animals securely at all times. To be corrected by: August 6,
2016.This was a focused inspection limited to the circumstances related to the non-compliances above and one
additional self-reported incident. The inspection and exit interview were conducted with Dr. Erika Leisner (VMO),
Dr. Amanda Owens (VMO) and facility personnel.
