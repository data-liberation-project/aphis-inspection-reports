2.78(a) REPEAT
HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
Representatives of the business delivered a marmoset to a customer in South Carolina on or around 12/15/17
without a valid health certificate. Lack of a valid health certificate when the licensee or their representatives are
transporting non-human primates increases risk of moving disease and does not ensure that the non-human
primate to be delivered is fit for travel. The facility must ensure that non-human primates have a valid health
certificate issued by a licensed veterinarian within 10 days prior to transporting them across state lines.
3.80(a)(2)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two enclosures (each housing a pair of marmosets) had electrical cords for heat lamps that were within reach of the
marmosets. The cords had scratches and nicks on the vinyl wire coating which suggest the marmosets may have
played with them in the past. Electrical cords within reach of marmosets creates the possibility for injury to the
marmosets.
NOTE: A facility representative hung the cords out of reach immediately during inspection in a temporary manner,
however; cleaning or moving the enclosures could cause the cords to fall back into reach. The facility must make a
permanent solution to ensure that the marmosets cannot reach electrical cords.
Maintain correct from this date forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
