RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Currently the list of Animals on Hand has not been updated and is not available during this inspection. The
information of the animals born and sold are being kept, however there needs to be some clarification of the
information to make the traceability more accurate.
Complete and accurate records are necessary for proper management and traceability of the regulated animals on
Hand and those sold.
The licensee must keep updated and accurate records of all Animals on Hand, and those that are sold with the
appropriate information required according to sections 2.75 of the AWA regulations and standards.

WATERING.
The water tank for the wallaby area has a moderate to thick buildup of dark green algae along the sides and bottom
of the tank.
A buildup of algae in the water tank can be a source of possible disease or health hazards if not cleaned and
sanitized properly.
The licensee must clean the water tank as frequently as necessary to prevent the buildup of algae and keep the
tank and drinking water clean and sanitary.

SANITATION. The goat platform has a hole in the boarded floor approximately 1ft x 2 ft that opens to the ground approximately 3
feet down that needs to be repaired. There are several nails along the edge of the platform and near the stairs that
need to be hammered in or removed that have worked their way up and are protruding 1-2 inches. There is a fence
gate lying on the ground in the camel feeding yard, and two pet carriers and some yard tools in the wallaby area
that need to be removed as they are un-necessary clutter in the animal yards.
The hole and nails on the goat platform could be a potential source of injury if an animal fell through the hole in the
floor or snagged on one of the protruding nails. The clutter in the camel and wallaby yards could cause injury if the
animals get caught up in the fence lying on the ground, or trip over the yard tools(pitchfork, shovel, old can, brush,
carriers etc).
The licensee needs to repair the goat platform and pick up and remove any clutter in the areas where the regulated
animals live.
