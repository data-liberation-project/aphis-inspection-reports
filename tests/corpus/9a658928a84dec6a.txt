2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During inspection, a sheep with a dark brown/white face and tan body with white legs was identified with an abnormal
right eye. The eye was uniformly white and moderately sunken into the eye socket. The red tissue at both corners were
protruding and covering parts of the eye. A facility representative explained that approximately 1 month ago, the sheep
was struck by another causing an eye injury. The facility treated the sheep with antibiotics but did not consult with or get
approval from the veterinarian on the course of treatment. The veterinarian was not given proper authority to oversee
adequacy of care. When the veterinarian is not given the appropriate authority, the provision of veterinary care may be
inadequate or inappropriate. The licensee must assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure
the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. To be
corrected by September 9, 2022.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The disposition information for 2 llamas, 5 kangaroos, and a camel were not documented. The acquisition information for
2 pigs, 12 goats, 1 zebra were not documented. Several of the missing acquisition and disposition information are
concerning animal deaths and births. Without records which fully disclose the animal’s acquisition/disposition information,


legal and medical information traceback is not possible. Develop and maintain records disclosing the required
acquisition/disposition information including the date, name, address, and USDA number if applicable of the person from
whom the animal was acquired from or transferred to. The records shall include any deaths and any offspring born of any
animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. To be corrected by December 2, 2022.
3.78(d)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The facility does not currently have a continuous perimeter fence around the outdoor enclosures for the Giraffe,
kangaroos, capybaras, lemur, and porcupine. There is no perimeter fence of adequate height on the creek side or on the
entrance side. The facility’s variance approval letter was issued in 2002 and referred specifically to deviation from section
3.127 which covers subpart F animals. Therefore, the facility does not have approval to deviate from the perimeter fence
requirements for non-human primates such as lemurs. Furthermore, per a facility representative, the facility’s inventory
has changed significantly in the last 20 years and thus the basis for the variance approval may no longer be valid. A
continuous perimeter fence is important to function as a secondary containment for the animals and to prevent
unauthorized people or animals to enter the facility. The facility shall construct a 6 feet tall perimeter fence at least 3 feet
away from the outdoor primary enclosures for the above listed animals or shall obtain a variance from the Regional Office.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
Two areas of deficiency were identified with the non-human primate enrichment plan:
- The plan did not describe the special attention provided to the singly housed black and white ruffed lemur, unable to
hear and see non-human primates of his own or compatible species. A complete and well documented plan regarding the
special attention provided to singly housed individuals is extremely important to ensure the psychological well-being of the


animals.
- The documented plan described providing toys, swings, ropes, and hand rings in the enclosure. At the time of
inspection, perches but no other item were present in the enclosure. The enrichment plan must be executed as written
and updated when changes occur to adequately reflect what is needed to maintain psychological health.
A well-documented and implemented enrichment plan is essential to prevent distress and maintain the psychological well-
being of the non-human primates. The enrichment plan must be developed in accordance with the currently accepted
professional standards and as directed by the attending veterinarian. To be corrected by November 2, 2022.
