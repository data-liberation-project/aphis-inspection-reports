INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC has reviewed and approved protocol #01-14-00361. This protocol is currently active and approves the
use of 20 rabbits. A biostatistical review conducted by the facility regarding the justification of animal use numbers
states: "lacks adequate statistical justification of number of animals or if this is a pilot study please indicate." The
protocol was approved as written with no further rationale provided for the numbers of animals to be used.
A proposal to conduct an activity involving the use of animals must contain rationale/justification for the numbers of
animals to be used prior to IACUC approval. An adequate rationale is necessary to help provide confirmation that
appropriate numbers of animals will be used for all animal activities.
The facility has indicated that the required justification of animal numbers will be provided immediately.
Correct by: Approval of future protocols must include appropriate justification for animal use numbers.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The following medications were identified as expired according to the labeled date on the bottles: 2 bottles of
dopram found on top of two anesthesia machines in the treatment room-Apr 2014 and 2 bottles of diphenhydramine
and 1 bottle of heparin in the emergency kit in the clinic-Apr 2014. Two boxes of expired silk suture material were
also found on a shelf in a surgery area with other boxes of unexpired suture material currently in use.
Expired medications and suture material may become contaminated and/or not provide the anticipated effect when
used. The facility must ensure that emergency drugs and surgical materials will not be expired and will retain their
effectiveness in order to meet current acceptable veterinary care standards.
The facility has indicated that an appropriate inventory management system is in place, however, personnel were
not following required procedures and will be retrained. Correct by: September 8, 2014.
The inspection was conducted with facility clinical veterinarians and the associate director of the animal facility. The
exit interview was conducted with the chair of veterinary medicine and surgery.
