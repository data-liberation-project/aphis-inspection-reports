3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several (approx 10) wire primary enclosure doors that have rust on them where the paint has worn off.
While several doors in the kennel have been painted, there are still several more that need work. There are 6
enclosures that have broken wires in them that need to be removed, or trimmed to prevent a pointed surface from
coming in contact with the animals. There are 6 primary enclosures that have a rusty portion along the bottom of the
dividing walls in the whelping room on the widow side of the building.
Rusty surfaces and broken wires can cause a weakness in the structure of the enclosure and be a possible source
of injury or health issue due to the rusty areas inability of being sanitized properly.
All pointed wires should be trimmed and made safe, with holes repaired. All rusty surfaces should be repaired or
replaced to provide a solid structure and sanitizable surface.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are 3 whelping pens, and 6 dog door flaps in the breeder building that have a buildup of brown dirt/grime on
the wall surfaces and on both sides of the door flaps and outer wall of the run area around those flaps. While the
cages are cleaned daily and sanitized every 2 weeks, there are a few dogs that require more cleaning and an
increased sanititization schedule.
The buildup of dirt and grime on the walls, doors and in the feeders can be a source of possible bacteria and health
issues.
The licensee must increase their cleaning and sanitization of the surfaces that come in contact with the dogs,
including door flaps, feeders and walls to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime. While the minimum schedule should
be at least every 2 weeks for sanitizing, it should be done more often if required to prevent the buildup on thesurfaces by those animals that make more of a mess in their enclosure.
