3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There is a heavy buildup of brown roughened scale and debris on the back walls, side supports, ventilation pipe,
and the drainage pipe of guinea pig enclosures. In addition, enclosure # 1 housing 15 adult guinea pigs and
enclosure # 13 housing 16 adult guinea pigs have accumulations of excreta and dirty bedding. The cleaning
process (method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this accumulation of scale, debris, excreta, and
dirty bedding inside the enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to potential disease
hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are clean and
sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of scale, debris, excreta, and dirty bedding. Additionally, ensure
that the primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks. Correct by December 15, 2018.
