OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
-There were four enclosures housing large breed dogs, such as Standard Poodles, that contained igloo-style shelter
units that were too small for at least one dog in each enclosure. These dogs were longer and/or taller than the
provided shelter unit. Shelters which do not allow dogs to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner can be
uncomfortable for the dogs and may decrease a dog's accessibility or use of the shelter. The licensee must ensure
that each dog has access to a shelter which is large enough to allow the dog to sit, stand, and lie in a normal
manner, and to turn about freely at all times. To be corrected by: April 27, 2018
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees.
