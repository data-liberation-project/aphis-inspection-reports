deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. Refrigeration shall be provided for supplies of perishable food.
****The area around the door inside the freezer continues to have a build up of ice chunks indicating that the seal
around the door may not be functioning adequately. An inadequate door seal can cause temperatures in the
freezer to fluctuate which can adversely affect the food stored inside. The licensee indicated that they have
attempted to have the problem fixed however they cannot completely resolve the ice buildup. If the seal on the
current freezer door cannot be adequately repaired to prevent the buildup of ice then a new freezer needs to be
acquired.
