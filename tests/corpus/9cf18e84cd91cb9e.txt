2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A nursing female white dog, "Margie" #22, has loose stool present in the outdoor portion of her enclosure. She had feces
present under her tail and on her feet. The facility representative states the nursing moms get loose stool from eating too
much puppy food and it clears up when they put the dogs back on adult food. The facility has not contacted the vet about
this dog's loose stool. Additionally, the Program of Veterinary Care lists that adult dogs will be dewormed every 6 months.
There is no record of this particular dog receiving a deworming with the other adult dogs this spring.
Loose stool could indicate an underlying health issue and if left untreated could result in severe illness and even the death
of the animal. "Margie" must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective
treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon
request. The applicant must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
The facility uses a metal tag attached to a collar and placed around the dog’s neck as the official form of identification. At
least 5 adult dogs (Chi Chi, Beverly, Margie, Susie and an adult male brown Australian Shepherd) are not wearing an
official identification tag. The facility representative states the dogs have been pulling the metal tag off the collars. Official

identification is necessary for APHIS officials to identify animals and trace their movements.
All live dogs shall be identified by an official tag affixed to a collar around the animal’s neck, by a legible tattoo marking
approved by the Administrator, or by a microchip placed under the dog’s skin. The licensee must place a collar with an
attached metal tag around the neck of the eleven dogs listed above or apply one of the other forms of identification. The
facility must ensure that all dogs have an official form of identification at all times.

Housing facilities, general.
The facility had a horse in the exercise yard sometime last week and did not pick up the horse manure. There were
approximately 5 piles of horse manure present in the enclosure. The facility representative stated another facility
representative was supposed to pick up after the horse but they did not.
The outdoor enclosure for "Margie" and her 3 puppies, had fecal material smeared along the floor covering approximately
50% of the floor. Feces was present on Margie's feet and left hip.
Failure to remove feces on a daily basis could increase the risk of disease as well as cause the dogs to become soiled.
Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures daily and sanitized in accordance with § 3.11(b) of this subpart to
prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. The facility must remove the feces from the enclosures
daily in order to support the health and well-being of the animals and sanitize enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
accumulation.
3.6(a)(2)(ix) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
There were 3 enclosures, housing a total of 5 adult dogs and 8 puppies, that had white plastic feeding trays mounted to
the enclosure that have been heavily chewed on. The facility representative stated they placed new feeders on since the

last inspection but they were chewed on by the dogs again.
Surfaces that have been chewed on cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized to prevent disease hazards to the dogs. The
surfaces must be repaired or replaced so they are able to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility is not following the approved deworming schedule for puppies. The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) states
that Marquis will be given for 3 days at a time at 2,4,6,8 weeks of age. The facility is no longer giving Marquis. The PVC
states Panacur will be given for 3 days at 5 weeks of age, the facility is giving it for 3 days at 5 and 7 weeks of age.
Pyrantel is also being given at 5 and 7 weeks of age but is not listed on the PVC for puppies.
Failure to follow the deworming schedule approved by the Attending Veterinarian may not properly protect the puppies
from parasites and may cause illness from excess doses of medication. The facility must follow the approved schedule
approved by the attending veterinarian to protect the dogs from parasites and other pests (Including fleas, worms,
coccidia, giardia and heartworm).
