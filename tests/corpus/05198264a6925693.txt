2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
An adult male bullmastiff died acutely during transport in September 2021. The transporter stated to the inspectors that
the animal was secured in a plastic crate behind the driver when she heard him gasping and struggling to breathe. The
transporter did not stop right away for unclear reasons relating to being “on a one lane road in a construction zone”. She
claims that when she did find a place to stop, she removed the dog from his crate but he died shortly thereafter. She
admits the dog was wearing a slip choke chain collar but claims that the collar was not caught on anything. She stated
that this occurred late at night and that the dog had fans and air conditioning to maintain temperature. The transporter
stated that she doesn’t know what happened, and has no explanation for the animal’s death. This description of the
events does not correspond at all to what she initially told the owner of the animal. Post-mortem veterinary findings
provided by the owner of the dog include a swollen, congested head with blood pouring from the mouth and nostrils.
Based on the inconsistencies and vague details of her story, veterinary findings, and the admission that animal was
wearing a choke type collar inside the crate it seems likely that the dog’s death was due to a handling failure involving the
collar being trapped in some manner, resulting in the strangulation of the animal. These types of collars should not be left
on an animal in a transport crate. Dogs must be handled carefully in a manner that does not cause stress, overheating, or


physical harm to the animal.
