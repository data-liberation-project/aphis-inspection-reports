Facilities, outdoor.
There is one male cougar that is approximately 6 years old housed singly in an enclosure that has two plastic tank-type
structures for shelter. This animal is currently in poor body condition with ribs and vertebrae visible. One of the shelters
has had fresh bedding placed on top of the old wet soiled bedding. The other shelter contains only the old soiled and wet
bedding. The remainder of enclosure was covered in snow which in some places was several inches deep. The one
shelter is the only clean, dry place for the cougar to walk or lay anywhere within its enclosure or the shelters provided.
The temperature in this enclosure was 26.5 to 27 degrees Fahrenheit. The shelter with the soiled bedding was 21.5
degrees Fahrenheit.

The 2 female brown bears and 1 male brown bear are co-housed in a single primary enclosure with three individual metal
barrels provided for the bears to use as shelters. The male and female black bears are currently co-housed in the same
primary enclosure with 2 metal barrels provided for the bears to use as shelter. The two juvenile brown bears have two
shelters provided – one metal barrel and one square plastic tank type shelter. The smaller juvenile brown bear has a
rough coat and is thin.



The licensee has now brushed the snow off the metal barrels and has added tarps over the blankets which were wrapped
over the barrels for insulation. This temporary fix is not appropriate for local climatic conditions. Poor weather will once
again quickly deteriorate this temporary fix. Shelters for the enclosures housing the black bears have had bedding placed
on top of the old wet soiled bedding. This is also the case for the three shelters provided for the three adult brown bears.
No fresh bedding has been provided for the shelters housing the juvenile brown bears. The snow that was present in the
black and brown bear enclosures yesterday is still easily visible mixed with the fresh bedding that has been added.

When asked if the soiled bedding had been removed the licensee stated to inspectors that this could not be done in the
few hours he had before our afternoon inspection. The licensee stated that removing the soiled bedding would require
the use of a bobcat machine and that was not even at the property currently. The new bedding placed in some of the
animal shelters will quickly become soiled by the old bedding and snow already in the shelters and the wet, wintery
weather conditions that are forecast to continue.

The local ambient temperature was 26 degrees Fahrenheit at 3:30 pm which is about the time the inspection began.
Surface temperatures were taken for each of the metal barrels in several locations using a RayTek IR Thermometer. The
inside temperatures of the barrels ranged from 21 to 37 degrees Fahrenheit with most of the barrels being in the upper
twenties to lower thirties. The expected overnight low for tonight is 12 degrees Fahrenheit and the expected low
temperature for tomorrow is 5 degrees Fahrenheit.

Failing to provide appropriate shelter from the elements particularly in the extreme cold weather currently occurring and
failing to remove soiled bedding is causing a state of unrelieved suffering for these animals.



Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all
animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.

These attempts to correct this noncompliance are temporary and cannot been maintained. Correct by ensuring that
permanent measures are implemented to prevent chronic reoccurrence of suffering due to continued deterioration of
these temporary measures which are not suitable to the weather. Ensure that there are an adequate number of
appropriate shelters which are constructed and insulated using materials suitable to the climate. Enough shelters and
shelter space must be provided so that all animals housed in the primary enclosure can access a shelter area at the same
time to allow them to escape the cold temperatures, and precipitation. These shelters must be able to be maintained in a
dry and sanitary manner.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.

The care and feeding of the bear cubs is under review.
