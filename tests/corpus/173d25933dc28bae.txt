Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On 01/27/2022, under Protocol #20087, an approximately 2-month-old female New Zealand rabbit (#22R002) was found
to have a purple bruise on its right hindlimb, at the start of a scheduled procedure. The attending veterinarian was not
consulted at this time. The procedure was completed, and upon further observation, the rabbit was non-weight bearing.
Care by the attending veterinarian was then sought, and the rabbit received veterinary medical treatment, was diagnosed
with a fracture and then euthanized on 1/28/2022.

Failure to report information of animal health in a timely fashion to the attending veterinarian can result in further harm for
the animal’s health and well-being.

A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.


On 11/10/2021, under Protocol #20182, a 6-month to 1-year-old intact female sheep (#IL6123F and ILL059) died during a
veterinary teaching class within which first-year veterinary students were practicing venipuncture. The supervising
instructor had noticed that one group of students handling the sheep in question was having trouble keeping the sheep
restrained and the students were trying another restraint procedure. According to personnel present, the instructor agreed
the students could try a different restraint for the sheep, given the sheep was observed to be rambunctious and it was the
end of the class, but the sheep continued to fidget so they did not continue the attempts at venipuncture. After the
instructor assisted with the blood draw, the sheep in question was observed not doing well and then was dead within a
minute or less. At the time of the class, the protocol had specified that animals will be marked with chalk or a paint stick
each time venipuncture is performed so that limits are not exceeded, yet no marks were made on the animal’s body,
according to personnel present.

The protocol was amended after the incident, specifying restraint requirements and venipuncture attempt limits further.
However, the handling of this particular sheep was not done in a careful manner, as necropsy findings revealed severe
hemorrhage along the right side of the neck, corresponding to the site of venipuncture, with cause of death likely due to
exsanguination from laceration of a major vessel.

Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
