WATERING.
The water bottle for the guinea pigs was green and needed to be cleaned. Water bottles for guinea pigs must be
sanitized every 2 weeks or whenever they are dirty. The green discoloration is an indication that the bottles are not
being cleaned thoroughly or frequently enough. For the animals health and as a part of a good disease control
program, water bottles must be cleaned when dirty. Correct before the end of the day, and then continuously.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are two young lions that are being housed in an enclosure without adequate shade. They have a three sided
shelter with a portion of the back wall covered by chain link and open so that there is some airflow, and there is a
narrow strip of shade material on the roof, however, their ability to separate themselves and move about in the
shade is limited. For their health and wellbeing, sufficient shade must be provided so that the animals can lie
separately, and move about freely.
An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
