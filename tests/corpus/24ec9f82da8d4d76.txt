2.38(b)
MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on 17-OCT-18 at 12:30 pm.
When I arrived at the facility at 12:30 pm, the gate was closed and no one was on the premises. I called the facility
representative at 12:30 pm and again at 12:47 pm and left a message both times. The facility representative called
me back at 2:02 pm and left me a voice message. I called the facility representative back at 2:18 pm and he
informed me that this facility is closed and is no longer doing regulated activity. He plans to cancel his license.
