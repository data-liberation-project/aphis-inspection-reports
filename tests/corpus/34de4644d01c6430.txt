FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The two sheep have a shelter which is lower than their head height so that the sheep must duck to get into the
shelter. The shelter needs to be taller to allow the animals easy access and so the animals can stand comfortably
under it. Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be
provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.
