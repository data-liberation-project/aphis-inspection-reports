FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the re-purposed chinchilla enclosure, there is an opening that has been cut in hardware wire to give the animals
more space. The hardware wire was cut in a way that left sharp points where the animals move through the
opening. The indoor housing facilities shall protect the animals from injury, and a system of maintenance must be in
place to ensure all enclosures are maintained in good repair.
Corrected during inspection.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representatives.
