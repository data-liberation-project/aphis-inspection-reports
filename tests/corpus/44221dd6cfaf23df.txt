CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
Five dogs arrived in five crates, into the customs area at SFO. The dogs had been checked as baggage on Eva
Airlines flight BR18 from Taipei, Taiwan, with baggage tags # 695-BR818657, 695-BR818688, 695-BR818688,
695-BR818683, 695-BR818700, and 695-BR818696. None of the crates had adequate certification in writing from
the consignor regarding the feeding and watering instructions during transport. There was a table with check marks
showing times that feed and water may have been offered, although it was preprinted and there were no dates. A
sticker on the side of the crate reads "Rescued Live Animal - feed water frequently, one cup dry food am and one
cup dry food pm”. There is, however, nothing in writing that shows when the consignor last offered food and water
prior to travel, and there is no dated consignor’s signature certifying this information.
At the time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment the carrier must ensure that the consignor provides certification in
writing regarding feeding and watering instructions, and the last time food and water was offered. Failure to provide
this information could put the animal at risk. This information should be clearly displayed on the carrier, during
transit. The airline must ensure that the owner has provided this information in writing, in order to help ensure that
animals are adequately cared for while in transit.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
Five dogs arrived in five crates, into the customs area at SFO. The dogs had been checked as baggage on Eva
Airlines flight BR18 from Taipei, Taiwan, with baggage tags # 695-BR818657, 695-BR818688, 695-BR818688,
695-BR818683, 695-BR818700, and 695-BR818696. Although there was a sticker on one side of the crate that said
"Rescued Live Animal…” none of the crates had the words "LIVE ANMALS" on the top side in letters at least one
inch in height.
Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it should be clearly marked on top and on one or
more sides with the words ``LIVE ANIMALS", in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high to help ensure proper handling
by transportation personnel. Failure to properly label crates used to ship live animals could result in mishandling by
transport personnel, which could be injurious to the animals.3.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
Five dogs arrived in five crates, into the customs area at SFO. The dogs had been checked as baggage on Eva
Airlines flight BR18 from Taipei, Taiwan, with baggage tags # 695-BR818657, 695-BR818688, 695-BR818688,
695-BR818683, 695-BR818700, and 695-BR818696.
Each crate contained only one receptacle that holds water; there was no receptacle for food in the crates. Food and
water receptacles must be securely attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that the receptacles can
be filled from outside the enclosure without opening the door. Failure to provide a food and a water receptacle could
result in inadequate feeding and/or watering, which could be detrimental to the animal.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Eva Airlines personnel in the customs arrival area.
