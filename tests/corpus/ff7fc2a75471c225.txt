Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The disposition record for one wolf-hybrid dog was not completed on an official APHIS 7006 form. While the licensee had
the information documented on a note card, the required 7006 form was not utilized. Failure to maintain completed animal
records hinders accurate tracking, identification, and tracing of animals upon their removal from the current facility. Each
dealer and exhibitor shall use Record of Acquisition and Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS Form 7005) and Record of
Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS Form 7006) forms to make, keep, and maintain required information concerning
each dog, unless a variance is granted by APHIS.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility did not have complete acquisition records for the newly obtained bobcat.
Acquisition and disposition records, including offspring born at the facility, are necessary to accurately track and identify
animals being used in regulated activities, as well as aid in the detection of movement of animals upon relocation to a new
site. The facility shall make, keep and maintain records that fully and correctly include all the required acquisition and


disposition information, including: the name and address of the person from whom the animals were acquired, the USDA
license number of the person if licensed or the vehicle license number and state and driver’s license number and state if
not licensed, the name and address of the person to whom an animal was given/sold, the date of acquisition or
disposition, the species of animal and the number of animals involved.
