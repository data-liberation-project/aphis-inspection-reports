SANITATION.
*** In the goats and sheep primary enclosure there was feces covering the pens floor. The generalized area in
which the pelleted feces is covering does not allow the animals to stay out of it and needs to be cleaned more
frequently to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce
odors. Correct by October 21, 2016.
