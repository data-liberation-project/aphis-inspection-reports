2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 879 adult, weanling,
and newborn guinea pigs were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of
adults, weanlings, or newborns present since May of this year.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Facilities, general.
During the inspection, two guinea pigs were observed to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the
building. The licensee stated there was a loose board that needed repair where the animals could escape the enclosure.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to


access food and water.
The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times and does not allow them to escape.
Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

3.26(d)

Facilities, indoor.
There was one guinea pig pen the licensee had set up temporarily due to excess animals that the walls on 3 sides were
bare wood not sealed or painted.
Unsealed surfaces are difficult to clean and sanitize, which can lead to disease hazards for the guinea pigs.
Interior building surfaces must be constructed and maintained so that they are impervious to moisture, can be readily
cleaned and sanitized, and won’t absorb moisture or odors.
