ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 PM on
29-SEP-16.
There is a sign at the entrance stating the facility is currently closed and will reopen in the winter months. I spoke to
a person who works for the new company and he confirmed the change of ownership, however the previous care
taker is the current caretaker. I called the phone number on file and it was disconnected. If ownership has
changed, this licensee must notify the eastern regional office to cancel their license.
