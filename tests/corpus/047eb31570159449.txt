3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence is less than six feet in height around the "Yard" pen at the front of the facility. Additionally, the rear
perimeter fence line is in poor repair and is constructed of weathered wooden and metal posts connected with broken
and/or sagging wire; it is less than six feet in height all along its visible length. Neither of these fence sections are true
perimeter fences because they are functioning as the walls of primary enclosures and can therefore not serve as a
secondary containment system for any escaped animals; they also cannot prevent other animals and unauthorized
persons from entering. These situations pose a risk of injury for both people and animals.
The licensee must modify the existing fence(s) or install a different perimeter fence or fences of at least 6 feet in height
(for the species inventoried at the time of this inspection), a minimum of three feet from the primary enclosures, and
constructed so that the fence(s) protect(s) the animals by restricting entry of outside animals and unauthorized persons
from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the animals in the facility.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
In the “Yard” pen, accessible to one adult kangaroo and eight juvenile goats, there are two broken, wooden ramps with
holes large enough for animals’ feet to pass through and an unused chain link dog kennel that is being stored in the open.


The wire of the kennel’s chain link walls is cut and protruding in numerous places, resulting in holes and sharp points.
Within “Miles’ Pen”, containing one adult axis male deer, one juvenile yak, one adult llama, four adult alpacas, two lambs
and 24 kid and adult goats, there is a wooden shelter with a thin metal roof that is in poor repair, with sharp edges that
could easily come into contact with the animals in the pen. These situations pose risks for injury to the animals.
Elsewhere throughout the facility, there are accumulations of rubble, building materials and other unused items. Such
accumulations provide a harbor for vermin and pests that could pose a risk of injury or disease for the animals.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in the regulations. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in
designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
