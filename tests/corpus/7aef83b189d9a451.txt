Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:00PM on 12 Aug

Called as soon as I arrived at the address, no answer and left a message. Knocked on door and spoke to family
members, Registrant was not available for inspection at this time and the family members did not have access to the files.
