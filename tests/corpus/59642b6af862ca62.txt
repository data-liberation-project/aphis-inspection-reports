2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:10 pm on
04/29/2015.
Inspectors arrived at the facility at approximately 3:10 p.m. and rang the doorbell. We waited by the door for about 5
minutes, when no one came to the door we returned to the vehicle to call the licensee. The licensee did not answer
the phone and a voicemail message was left. While waiting at the facility the licensee called us back and notified us
that he was currently out of state. He also informed us that he was not sure when he would be back to his facility. I
asked the licensee if he could email his itinerary to me so I can try to arrange for another inspector to inspect him
while he was traveling. The licensee stated that he would email his itinerary to me.
