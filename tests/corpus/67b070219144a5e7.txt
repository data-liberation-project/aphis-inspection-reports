ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is using a bottle containing a blue-colored liquid that was described as Ivomectin. This bottle has an
illegible label on it. Medications that are not labeled with legible labels may be used inappropriately. The licensee
must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired and labeled properly in accordance with
standard veterinary practices must be relabeled if label becomes illegible. Correct by 18 November 2014.
There is a litter of four puppies that were born on 10/27/2014. The licensee stated they were dewormed on
11/3/2014. The written Program of Veterinary Care form states that puppies will be dewormed "at 6 weeks and
between 7 and 8 weeks" of age. Not following the written instructions from the veterinarian may result in ineffective
treatments. The licensee must ensure that treatments and medications follow the written instructions of the
attending veterinarian. Correct by 18 November 2014.
3.6(a) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The buried welded-wire fencing has become uncovered in sections of at least two dog enclosures resulting in
exposure of the fence openings and a gap between the fencing and the ground. Dogs may become entangled in
these openings causing injury to the dogs. All surfaces must be kept in good repair so dogs are protected from
injury and surfaces are maintained.
This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
