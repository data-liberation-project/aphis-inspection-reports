ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Licensee(cid:25)s current Program of Veterinary Care has not been signed or updated by the Attending Veterinarian since
2007. In addition, the only guidance provided is for the wolves (Canis lupus) and did not have any other species
listed on the plan. The Program of Veterinary Care is a crucial tool that all facilities must maintain to ensure that the
animals receive adequate and timely veterinary care for health issues and for all species located at the facility.
Licensee must ensure that he has a detailed Veterinary Care Plan, in writing, for all treatments, medications,
vaccinations, etc. This plan must be approved by the Attending Veterinarian and updated at least once a year
(annually).

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are two outdoor enclosures that house a total of 5 wolves that do not have adequate drainage. The entire
floor space of the enclosures, climbing fixtures and the shelter structures are all covered with mud and/or water.
There were several small to medium puddles in various areas of the enclosures covering at least 30% of the floor
space. All of the wolves had mud covering the tail, all 4 paws, and their legs all the way up to and including their
stomach area. These enclosures did have shelter structures with some bedding. However; the bedding is not
adequate to keep animals clean and dry when the animals are wet and muddy. The licensee stated that they have
had a hard time with the water and drainage this year. Additionally, he stated that hay or straw is normally used on
the ground of the enclosures every two to three days to assist with decreasing the wetness. No clean or dry hay or
straw was evident on the ground or floor of theses enclosure at the time of today's inspection. However; Licensee
did direct two employees to lay some straw down in these enclosures when we were leaving the facility. The
inability to access a dry housing area is distressful and when prolonged, may lead to the development of husbandry
and sanitation related illness. Constant environmental moisture can not only promote infections but also affects the
animal'(cid:25)s ability to thermoregulate in the low temperatures during the cooler season known to be in this area.
Licensee must ensure that all enclosures have a suitable and effective method to rapidly eliminate excess water
from these enclosures. Licensee must also ensure that all animals are able to get out of the mud and water withintheir enclosure. In addition, there must be a clean and dry area that these animals can have access to at all times.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The Lynx enclosure and two cougar enclosures (with a total of three cougars affected) do not have any climbing
fixtures or elevated platforms for these animals to allow them to move freely and exhibit normal social adjustments
and postural behaviors for their species. The only elevated surfaces within these enclosures are plastic igloo style
dog houses that are currently being used as shelter structures. Two of the cougars were noticed to be pacing back
and forth within their enclosure and the other two animals were noticed to be lying with no real movement within
their enclosure at the time of inspection. Not having the elevated platforms or climbing structures within these
enclosures can case these animals unnecessary stress and may cause abnormal behavior patterns (such as but
not limited to continual pacing). Licensee must ensure that all species of animals at the facility have an adequate
amount of space and fixtures, such as elevated platforms and climbing structures, to allow the animal to move freely
and exhibit normal social adjustments and postural behaviors.

WATERING.
The watering receptacle in two cougar enclosures, one bob cat enclosure and one ground hog enclosure had a
moderate to heavy accumulation of dirt, mud and green organic material in and around the surrounding surface of
the water receptacle. Fresh, potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of
the animal. All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized. In addition, Licensee must ensure that he has
a routine for cleaning for the facility, to include all water receptacles. The two cougars and the bob cat all had fresh
clean water with clean water receptacles at the time of Exit.
