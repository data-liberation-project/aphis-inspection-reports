FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several areas where the wire mesh of the inside and outside portion of the enclosure are broken, falling
down, or otherwise in disrepair. These areas presented possible escape routes, areas the animals could get
trapped or tangled in the wire, and a possible sources of injury through puncture or abrasion. In addition; there is a
piece of tin roofing currently being used as part of the shelter structure of the goat pen. This piece is bent and
broken in several places causing sharp and jagged edges exposed in the outside portion of the enclosure. One
portion of the fencing of the outside enclosure is currently leaning toward the enclosure. This fencing is on a hill and
is effected by rain and water flow, causing erosion of the dirt surrounding the fence posts. All enclosures and areas
of the facility shall be maintained in good repair, contain the animals securely and protect the animals from injury.
