ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 PM on
10-OCT-19.
Drove out to facility, stopped about a mile away (before cell service disappeared) and called at 1:00 PM, left
message advising that inspector was almost there and would wait at the gate until 1:30 PM. Received a call back
from the licensee at 2:49 PM, when the inspector was already over an hour away. Discussed with licensee
procedures for completing unannounced inspections in this location.
