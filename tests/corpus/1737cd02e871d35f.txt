Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:22 AM on 15-
APR-21. Upon arrival to the facility, I called the available phone number and left a voice mail, followed by an additional
call to the licensee 8 minutes later. I honked the horn 8 times. After waiting approximately 25 minutes, a teenager came
outside of the house to greet me from a long distance. Upon inquiring about conducting an inspection, she shared that no
adult was available to do an inspection. She also conveyed no adult would be available until sometime in the afternoon. I
prepared and left a leave-behind flyer, and then left the property.
