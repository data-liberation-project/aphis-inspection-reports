Housing facilities, general.
There is a section of wire inside the lemur enclosure which is hanging down loose from the top of the enclosure on one
side of the wire. This wire lines the top of the enclosure. This is an injury hazard for the lemur as it might become
entrapped or one of the lemur’s limbs could become caught between the two layers of wire. Housing enclosures must
be constructed to protect the animals from injury. This wire should be securely attached to prevent injury to the lemur.

Outdoor housing facilities.
The outdoor enclosure for the lemur does not have the required 6’ perimeter fence. This fence serves to protect the lemur
by restricting unauthorized access of humans and animals. It prevents physical contact of the lemur by these
unauthorized animals or humans. Construct a perimeter fence 6’ in height at least 3’ from the lemur’s primary enclosure.
It should be constructed to keep animals from going through or under it.

The temporary day housing enclosure housing one cow has a section of panel fencing which has been buckled outward
and pushed down by the cow. This fence could become an injury hazard to the cow as it could become tangled in the
fence while attempting to exit the enclosure. This enclosure should be of strength appropriate for the animal it contains to
protect the cow from becoming injured or loose from the enclosure. Repair/replace this animal enclosure.
