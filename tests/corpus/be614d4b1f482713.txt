FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In an enclosure housing a single cow, the edge of the barn had a broken section of wood which exposed a nail
point, and another nail head. Sharp points are a potential source of injury to enclosed animals. This area of the
barn was repaired during the inspection.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted by Michael Tygart (VMO), Robert Whiteley (ACI) and facility personnel.
