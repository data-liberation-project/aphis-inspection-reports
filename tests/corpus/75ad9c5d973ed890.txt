2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***One pig was found to have dark red-black, thickened skin, approximately 8" by 2" running from the base of the
skull down the dorsal surface of the neck. It was learned that when this pig had surgery one week earlier, a regular
heating pad had been used to maintain body temperature during the procedure. The pig sustained the injury/burn to
the back of its neck because of the use of the regular heating pad. The protocol states, "...pigs will be placed on a
water circulating heating pad...", however, this day a regular heating pad was used, causing injury to the animal.
This protocol was not followed as approved. Protocols must be followed as approved by the IACUC to ensure
appropriate oversight and treatment of the animals.
Correct by: The facility IACUC must review and approve all proposed protocols to ensure that the proposed
activities comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. Correct by ensuring that all future activities are done in
accordance with the IACUC approved protocol and all significant changes to the ongoing use of animals are
reviewed and approved by the IACUC.
