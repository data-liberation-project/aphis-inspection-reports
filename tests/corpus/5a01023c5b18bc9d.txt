Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is not maintaining records of the current animals on hand at the facility. He also was not able to provide
disposition records for the animals that were recently sold.
Failure to maintain animal records can make it difficult to track the movement of animals and make it hard to identify
trends in animal losses, which could indicate disease conditions in the animals.
Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully disclose the information concerning animals,
purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or
which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.

Sanitation.
There is a build-up of dust, hair, and cobwebs in several areas of the building. There is a thick buildup of dust, hair and
debris on the top and sides of at least 40% of all used and unused enclosures. The three animal rooms also have an
accumulation of dust and cobwebs on the walls, window sills, and vents.
Failure to clean animal facilities regularly can adversely affect the health of the animals and can potentially attract pests.


The facility must maintain the premise (buildings and grounds) by keeping it clean and in good repair in order to protect
the animals from disease hazards and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
