2.126(a)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
APHIS officials arrived at the facility at 10:37 am and requested to conduct an inspection with the licensee. The
licensee did not grant access as requested, but instead stated that he did not know what he and his wife wanted to
do regarding the inspection. He stated he did not know anything about the recordkeeping at the facility that only his
wife knew where the records were kept, and she had to leave for an appointment. The inspectors explained that if
his wife was able to show him where the records were kept that he could accompany us on the inspection as he
was also listed as a responsible party. He then returned inside the house to discuss the situation with his wife. He
exited the house at 10:53 am, and informed the inspectors that his wife would make a decision regarding the
inspection and be outside with us shortly. His wife met us outside and explained that she had an appointment and
would not accompany us on inspection. We again explained that she could show her husband, or us, where the
records were kept and that we could conduct the inspection with her husband. She declined to accompany us on
the inspection, or to allow her husband to accompany us. Inspectors explained that this was considered a refusal of
inspection, and that the refusal would be documented on an inspection report as a non-compliant item. She
indicated that she understood that she would receive a report in the mail documenting the refusal of inspection. All
dealers must allow APHIS officials to inspect and photograph the records, facilities, property and animals as the
APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the Act and assess the health and welfare of the animals.
