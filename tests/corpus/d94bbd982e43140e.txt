INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There have been changes in personnel assigned to the active protocols.These include a change in the attending
veterinarian as well as persons drawiing blood from the rabbits. The protocols do not reflect these changes nor do
they list the qualifications/training of these individuals.The IACUC must review activities involving animals and
approve significant changes to the protocols as they occur and ensure that all persons working with the animals are
appropriately trained and qualified in the procedures they perform.
