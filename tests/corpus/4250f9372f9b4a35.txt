2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: The tallest white male alpaca has a significant amount of saliva accumulating on
his lower lip. The alpaca took hay from the hand of a facility employee and saliva drooled out of his mouth while he
chewed the hay. The alpaca has not been seen or treated by the attending veterinarian for his current condition.
The saliva and drool may indicate a tooth or mouth problem, or may be a symptom of a general overall
condition/illness. Once the APHIS official identified the condition of the alpaca, a facility employee said the
veterinarian was coming later today to re-evaluate another animal and could look at this alpaca too. Each exhibitor
must establish and maintain adequate programs of veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. The facility must have the identified alpaca evaluated
by the attending veterinarian to ensure an accurate diagnosis and an adequate treatment plan. The facility must
provide the APHIS official with documentation of the outcome of this examination, and treatments in writing, upon
request. Correct by having the drooling white male alpaca seen by the attending veterinarian and following the
recommendations of the veterinarian. Correct by the end of today, November 30, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with a pet sales employee.
