Requirements and application
I was notified by the licensee via email that she had moved on Nov. 24th. I contacted her on a few occasions via phone,
email and USPS to inform her that she needed to cancel this license and apply for a new license in the state in which she
moved. I also provided a voluntary surrender form on multiple occasions. A licensee must notify the office no fewer than
90 days before a change in address occurs. Correct by 20 Jan. 2023.
