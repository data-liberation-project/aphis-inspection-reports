>>Along the right side of the outdoor enclosure housing 4 adult dogs named Hondo, Boudreaux, Gremlin and Goober is a
large hole with an exposed ground metal panel lying on top. The metal fence has multiple sharp edges and holes large
enough where the animals can step into and get caught.
>>Along the left side of the outdoor enclosure housing 3 wolfdogs named Rhea, Takoda and River is a large hole with an
exposed ground metal fence panel lying on top. The metal fence has multiple sharp edges protruding upward and holes
large enough where the animals can step into and get caught.
The sharp edges and holes in the metal fence panels presents an injury hazard to the animals. Maintain all housing
