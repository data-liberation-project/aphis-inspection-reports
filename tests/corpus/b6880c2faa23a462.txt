** The innermost sectional fence in the alpaca's primary enclosure is sagging and in some areas is rolling up at the
bottom. There are also some loose strands of wire hanging from the fence. This fence is in disrepair and to prevent
the animals from becoming entangled it needs to be repaired or removed. Correct by November 12, 2017.
