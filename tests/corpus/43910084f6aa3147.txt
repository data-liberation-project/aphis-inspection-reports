INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The inspector reviewed canine, bovine, feline, equine, caprine, and small mammal teaching protocols which did not
contain a written assurance from the principal investigator that the activities involving animals do not unnecessarily
duplicate previous experiments. Assurances that activities involving animals do not unnecessarily duplicate previous
experiments are required in order to prevent the unnecessary use of animals. The IACUC must ensure that all
principal investigators provide written assurances that the activities do not unnecessarily duplicate previous
experiments.
