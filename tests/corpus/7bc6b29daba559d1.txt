ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In building B, there is a female, white Bichon (ear tattoo #79) that has a wound on the right side of her neck. The
wound is red and parts of it are still raw. There is a dark brown material caked on the hair around the wound. The
area of the neck containing the wound is slightly swollen. The right ear has some dried blood on the tip of it from
touching the wound. Neck wounds such as this can cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as lead to other
health issues.
This same dog also has a thick dark brown substance caking the surface of her check teeth making it difficult to see
the teeth. Poor dental health can cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as lead to other health problems.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for her neck wound and dental health. Licensee must obtain
an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan from the veterinarian. This diagnosis and treatment plan must be
documented and made available to the inspector upon request. Licensee must ensure that all dogs receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.

and grime on their walls. There are a total of three dogs housed in these enclosures. This buildup of dirt and grime

more often if necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt, grime and disease hazards.
