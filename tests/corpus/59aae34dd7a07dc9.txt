2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
On September 8th, 2019, a cynomolgus macaque was found dead in its enclosure. Subsequent to a study
procedure in August, monitoring of blood cell counts and body weight was conducted according to an approved
protocol. Over the course of one week, there was a >80% decrease in the animal's white blood cell count to levels
substantially lower than the normal reference range. These low levels persisted and continued to drop in two
subsequent tests conducted over the course of the following week. Bi-weekly body weight measurements on this
animal were documented and show steady and progressive weight loss over the same time period. Both of these
parameters changing concurrently represent strong evidence that this animal was experiencing a health problem.
However, the research team did not contact the facility veterinarian to provide timely and accurate information
regarding the health and well-being of this animal, and the animal passed away without veterinary assessment or
treatment.
Research facilities shall maintain programs of veterinary care that include a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health are conveyed to the
veterinarian.
This incident was voluntarily self-reported to the USDA by this facility, and corrective measures had been
implemented prior to inspection.
This inspection was conducted from December 16th to December 18th, with a preliminary exit interview conducted
on site with facility representatives on December 18th. A final exit interview was conducted with facility
representatives by phone on December 19th.
