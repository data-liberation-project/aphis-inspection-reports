2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC functions.
1. The IACUC has not updated their reports to the Institutional Official (IO) at least once every six months as
required. The last Semi-annual IACUC Report submitted to the IO was dated 5/10/16. Although the IACUC did
perform semi-annual reviews of the program for animal care and animal facility inspection in November 2016, a
Semi-annual Report for those reviews has not been submitted to the IO. Almost 9 months have elapsed since the
IACUC prepared and updated their semi-annual report to the IO.
Per this Section of the Regulations, reports of the IACUC semi-annual evaluations of the program for animal care
and animal facility inspection should be updated at least once every 6 months upon completion of the required
semiannual evaluations and the report submitted to the IO. Compliance with this requirement is important so the IO
is updated regarding the status of the animal use program and the condition of the animal facilities to ensure that
the research facility is adhering to the standards and regulations specified under the Act.
The IACUC needs to update their Semi-annual Report to the IO for the November 2016 evaluations.
Correct by 3/1/17.
NOTE - Exit briefing held 2/6/17 on-site with facility representative. Report delivered by e-mail 2/7/17.
