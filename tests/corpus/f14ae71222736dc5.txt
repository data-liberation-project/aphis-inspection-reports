2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
* The facility self-reported that on the evening of 27 April 2013, there was a rabbit which appeared to have signs of
discomfort and difficulty breathing. The observation was noted by the caretaker in the animal's medical record but
the veterinary staff was not notified of the animal's condition. The next morning, the animal was found dead in its
enclosure. Timely communication between the care staff and the attending veterinarian is critical to prevent
unneccessary pain and discomfort to the animals. The registrant must ensure that there is a mechanism of direct
and frequent communication with the veterinary staff when there is a problem with animal health, behavior, or
well-being. This non-compliant item was self-reported and corrected prior to the time of inspection.
The inspection was conducted 25-26 August 2014 with facility personnel. An exit interview was conducted on 27
August 2014 with facility personnel.
