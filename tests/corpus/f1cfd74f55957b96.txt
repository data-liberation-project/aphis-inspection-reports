Facilities, general.
There was a crack in the concrete along the edge of the beach of the harbor seal pool. The crack was approximately 2
feet in length and approximately ½” wide but in one ~6" section, the width of the crack was ~2” wide.

Outdoor housing for marine mammals must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury. Cracks that are present in the concrete beach of a seal's pool can cause an injury to the skin or flippers of the
animal.

The condition of the concrete beach needs to be addressed for the health and comfort of the seal. Correct by 12/15/21.

Separation.
The harbor seal at the zoo has been housed alone since the death of its harbor seal companion in 2019. The number of
training sessions and keeper interactions have been increased and the zoo is actively looking to relocate the seal to
another facility that can provide a social living environment. Although veterinary, husbandry, and training staff have been
having regular ongoing discussions on the care of the singly housed harbor seal, there is no written plan approved by the


Attending Veterinarian developed in consultation with the husbandry and training staff as required per this Section of the
Regulations.

Marine mammals that are known to be primarily social in the wild, such as harbor seals, must be housed with at least one
compatible animal of the same or biologically related species unless it has been determined that such housing is not in
the best interest of the marine mammal’s health or well-being. Animals that are housed separately must have a written
plan developed in consultation with the husbandry/training staff and the plan must be approved by the Attending
Veterinarian. The plan must include the justification for the length of time the animal will be kept separated or isolated,
include information on the type and frequency of enrichment and interaction, and include provisions for periodic review of
the plan by the Attending Veterinarian.

The facility needs to develop a written plan for the singly housed harbor seal. Correct by 11/29/21.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted 11/10/21 with facility representatives.
