2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The male adult cream colored Poodle with no official form of identification that was listed under 2.40 (b) (2) on the
December 10, 2015 and November 30, 2015 inspection report did not receive appropriate veterinary care. The
licensee stated the dog was sold without being examined by a veterinarian. The licensee stated the dog improved
before it left the facility. The history involves a bloody stool of several days duration. The licensee submitted a fecal
sample on December 3, 2015. The licensee did not follow-up with the attending veterinarian's additional questions
and recommendation of presenting the dog at the clinic for a physical exam.
Failure to follow the attending veterinarian's recommendations and have the dog examined does not ensure the
dog is receiving adequate veterinary care. The licensee shall assure the attending veterinarian has appropriate
authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care for all dogs.
To be corrected this day forward.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female red and white King Charles Spaniel with no official form of identification has a problem with both of
its eyes. Both of the eyes have a moist greenish colored discharge covering more than half of the surface of each
eye. There is a dried and crusty dark brown colored material matted in the fur along the bottom of each eye. The
licensee and facility representative both stated they had not noticed the problem with the eyes and a veterinarian
has not been consulted. The abnormal appearance could be an indication of injury, infection, or other medical
issues. Not having clear vision can cause discomfort affecting the health and well-being of the dog.
The dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administered. Documentation
should be available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment must be part of their
documentation.
An adult gray Lhasa Apso mix with no official form of identification has matted hair on the top of the head and along
its back. The matted hair is tightly twisted and ropey on its head and face. There are also clumps of matted fur along
its neck and back that are tightly adhered to the skin. Excessive matting can cause pain and discomfort. The
licensee needs to remove the matted fur. As part of the facility(cid:25)s program of veterinary care, the licensee mustestablish and follow a program of regular coat maintenance for all the dogs to prevent the development of excessive
matting. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Most of the dogs at the facility do not have an official form of identification. The licensee stated they had recently
ordered new tags but they have not arrived yet.
Official identification is needed to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the
inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all dogs have official identification on them at all times.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Stucture; construction.
At least three outdoor wire enclosures that are attached to the east side of the sheltered housing facility are in
disrepair affecting five dogs. There are areas that have bent and broken wires creating gaps the dogs could
squeeze through and sharp points near the entrance of the enclosure where three dogs can come in contact with.
Some of the wire points have small clumps of fur caught on them. The wire enclosure on the north end containing
two dogs have at least three sharp wire points near the front of the enclosure and one on the back side of the
enclosure that the dogs can come in contact with.
Inside the east sheltered building there is an enclosure containing three dogs that has a plastic wall panel that has
broken loose and the dogs are able to move it creating a gap large enough to get their heads or limbs caught in.
The potential for injury exists if any dog comes in contact with sharp edges or gets caught in openings created by
broken wire or plastic fencing. The licensee must ensure all enclosures are kept in good repair, protect the animals
from injury and contain the animals securely at all times.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
At least four wire enclosures on the east side of the west sheltered housing facility containing dogs have rusty wire
door panels the dogs can come in contact with. The areas of wire where the paint is flaking off has become rusty
and pitted.
A red plastic food receptacle in the west sheltered housing facility being used by an adult female Cocker Spaniel is
excessively chewed and damaged creating a rough and jagged surface.
Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis can lead to unsanitary conditions and potential disease or health risks.
The licensee must ensure all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis or be replaced when worn. The licenseemust also ensure all surfaces can be readily cleaned and sanitized for the health and well-being of all dogs.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At least five primary enclosures containing dogs located in the west sheltered housing facility have an accumulation
of dried and caked fecal residue on approximately 60 percent of the plastic flooring and approximately half-way up
the plastic divider panels. The licensee stated the enclosures inside the building are cleaned a couple times a week.
There is an accumulation of dirt, cobwebs, rodent droppings and other debris on and around the food receptacles
and other surfaces of the primary enclosures. The metal entry doors have a layer of dirt and grime on the surface. A
facility representative stated the doors were last power washed before it got cold approximately two weeks ago. The
collection trays inside the building under the primary enclosures have an excessive accumulation of excreta and
food waste. There is a pest control program in place; however rodent droppings are still present in the affected
areas. At least two outdoor wire enclosures attached to the west sheltered facility affecting four dogs have an
excessive accumulation of frozen excreta on the coated wire covering approximately 40 percent of the floor surface.
Fecal waste build-up reduces the available clean floor space the dogs have access to and unsanitary living
conditions exist that could lead to potential contamination or disease risks. The potential for soiling or caking of the
hair coat exists when the dogs walk, rest or otherwise come in contact with the affected areas. The licensee must
ensure that all surfaces are cleaned on a daily basis and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if
needed.
