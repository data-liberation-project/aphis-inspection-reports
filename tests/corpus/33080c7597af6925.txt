2.31(c)(1) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC conducted a program review and facility inspection on 20 May 2015 but not again until 4 January 2016.
The IACUC noted this as a deficiency during the 4 January 2016 program review and has already developed a plan
to correct the problem moving forward. The animal care and use program and the animal facilities must be
reviewed/inspected at least once every six months so the IACUC can ensure the facility is in compliance with the
Animal Welfare Act regulations
The registrant must ensure that the IACUC conducts a program review and an animal facility inspection at least
once every six months.
