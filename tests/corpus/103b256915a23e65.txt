HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were multiple primary enclosures that had chewed fiberglass along the bottom of the mid-panels in the run
area; and the wood framing along the bottom of 4 dog doors and the wood legs on the feeders in 2 of the
enclosures have been chewed and needs to be repaired or replaced.
Chewed wood or fiberglass can affect the strength of the structure causing to be weak and unable to keep an
animal in their enclosure or being able to use the feeders properly. The splinters from the chewed wood can also
cause possible health issues if ingested or being lodged in the gums or mouth.
The licensee must repair or replace and chewed fiberglass or wood structures inside the primary enclosures and
run area.

3.3(c)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The indoor part of the facility did not have a light source except for a portable hand held flash light bar, or headlamp.
There was not enough light in the facility by the few windows to be able to see into the dog boxes or into the cages
along the wall that would allow for proper cleaning and observation inside the kennel. There was not enough light to
be able to read notes made during the inspection without going near a window.
It is important to have a light source available inside a facility that allows for all areas in the kennel including floor
surfaces and corners in the primary enclosures and wire surfaces to be observed for cleanliness. It is also important
that a light source is adequate enough to observe any health issues with the animals that could be missed if they
are kept in enclosures with limited light and visibility. It is possible for a maintenance or health issue to go
un-noticed which could cause a potential hazard if left un-resolved.
The licensee must provide a light source inside the kennel facility that will shed light into each enclosure to allow forproper health and maintenance checks and adequate cleaning.

3.3(e)(1)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Currently the cement surfaces in the indoor and outdoor portions of the enclosure where the dogs have contact are
not sealed adequately. The surfaces had been sealed in 2011, however at this time the sealant has worn off in most
areas along the floor, walls and wooden framing in the dog houses. The 3 enclosures outside of the run area are
completely made of wood including floors, wall framing and dog houses, and those surfaces need to be sealed.
All surfaces in contact with the animal need to be impervious to moisture in order to allow for proper cleaning and
sanitization. Surfaces not impervious to moisture can hold bacteria and fungus and excreta that can not be properly
removed and expose the regulated animals to possible disease issues.
The licensee must keep all surfaces that come in contact with the animal impervious to moisture, which includes
sealing any cement or wood surfaces.
