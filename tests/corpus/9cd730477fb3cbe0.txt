3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The front section of the goat pen, near the water bucket, has a portion of the fencing with no wire fencing between the
second and third wooden rungs. However, a small section of wire fencing is present on the right side of the fence between
these rungs. This portion of wire fence is detached at the left edge and bent inward into the enclosure. A small area of the
wire is bent. Fencing should be constructed in a manner to prevent injury and with material of such strength as
appropriate for the animals within the pen. The detached and damaged portion of the wire fence must be removed or
replaced with a material of such strength to withstand the physical force of the goats to prevent injury to the animals.
