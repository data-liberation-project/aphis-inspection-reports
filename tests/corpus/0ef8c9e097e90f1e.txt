SANITATION.
One of the chinchilla enclosures had two metal shelves which the surfaces were actively rusting with flakes of rust.
The shelves had evidence of use by the animal's waste and bedding on them. They were situated above the food
dish. Rust is not readily sanitizable and flakes of rust can be ingested and potentially cause harm. Enclosures must
be kept in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices
of the Animal Welfare Act.
