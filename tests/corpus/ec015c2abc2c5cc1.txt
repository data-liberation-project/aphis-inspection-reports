2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A pregnant female Bichon (microchip # (900) 032002944762) aged approximately 2 years old was noted to be
squinting and it had discharge coming from its right eye. The eye was clearly irritating the dog. Upon closer
examination, the eye was slightly clouded over and it had an indentation in the eye. The licensee had not yet
observed the dog's condition and therefore was not providing treatment to the dog. A clouded over eye that has an
indentation and has discharge coming from it indicates there is something wrong with the eye. The dog may have
impaired vision and it may be painful to the dog. The Attending Veterinarian must be consulted with and the dog
must be treated per the Veterinarian's instructions. Correct by 3/1/18.
Note: The licensee has contacted the Attending Veterinarian. The dog will be evaluated by the Veterinarian
tomorrow morning.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
