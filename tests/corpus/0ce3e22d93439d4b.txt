3.84(b)(3)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In SPW there is a plastic barrel containing enrichment items in the hallway to the animal rooms. According to the
label on the lid, these items have already been sanitized and are ready for use. I observed a foraging board
composed of a removable vinyl turf type mat on top of a metal tray. There is dried particulate matter, appearing to
be food, on the inside surface of the tray which should have been removed during the cleaning process. Food
receptacles to be used in the enclosures shall be properly cleaned and sanitized prior to use in the enclosures.
Corrected by end of inspection.
The inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representatives.
