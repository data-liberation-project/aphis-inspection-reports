MISCELLANEOUS.
At the time of inspection it was observed in canine barrier #6 that eleven dogs were exhibiting abnormal behavior to
include spinning and circling. Two females with nursing litters were noticed to be hyper and circling. There is the
potential for not only these animals but their puppies as well to be injured. In addition it is possible that these
abnormal behaviors indicate behavioral stress of these animals. The facility needs to ensure that behavioral stress
and unnecessary discomfort is minimized for all animals.
