2.50(c)(2)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The licensee does not have identification tags for the 11 dogs traveling for exhibition purposes. The licensee was
concerned that he needed to have the dogs wear the identification tags and this was clarified during the inspection
that an official USDA sequentially numbered tag is kept on the door of the animal's cage or run and a duplicate tag
accompanies each dog whenever it leaves the compound or premises.
Proper identification of dogs is required so that all dogs used or co-mingled with dogs used in regulated activities
can be readily identified during the inspection by APHIS officials. This ensures that dogs are legally acquired and
transported humanely for regulated activities.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The primary enclosures for 2 dogs used in exhibition had the vinyl flooring torn or missing. One of these enclosures
on the bottom row housing a poodle named "Chuchulfin" also had a large hole (~2.5 inches in diameter) on the wall
of the enclosure.
The damaged vinyl flooring and the hole in the wall are in disrepair and cannot be properly cleaned or sanitized
since excreta and debris can become entrapped in these areas.
Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound. The
primary enclosures must be kept in good repair.
