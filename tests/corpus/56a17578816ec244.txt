2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There are 10 rabbits currently present at the facility, however, the inventory identified only four rabbits. The inventory
identifies three fainting goats present at the facility, but only two fainting goats are currently present. According to the
facility representative several new rabbits have been born recently and one fainting goat passed away but was not
documented. Failure to maintain accurate records of acquisitions and dispositions can make it difficult to account for
animals under the facility's care and ensure that animals are obtained from appropriate sources. The facility must keep
and maintain up-to-date records regarding acquisitions and dispositions.

3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
There are several areas of the facility in disrepair. There is a vertical wooden plank on the back fence of the goat pen
which is broken and split approximately 1.5 ft off the ground. There is also a fractured horizontal wooden board on the
front fence line of the cattle pasture. Two goats were seen walking on the outside of the enclosure fence with all gates
closed. According to the facility representative they have been having trouble with the goats escaping and are working on
correcting the issue.
Broken boards and damage to primary enclosure fencing leads to sharp edges and narrow openings that can cause injury
or entrapment of an animal. Animals that can escape their primary enclosure are at risk of coming into contact with other
animals, encountering dangerous situations and at an increased risk for injury.
Correct by ensuring all enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals.
