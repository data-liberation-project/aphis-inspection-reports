OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(c) Construction
* An enclosure containing two dog houses (housing two dogs total) had entrances that were excessively chewed
around the edges and significantly opening the entrance area. These excessively chewed entrances could no
longer be cleaned and santized and were no longer in good repair. Licensee must establish and maintain a
maintenance program to ensure that all surfaces in contact with the dogs are repaired, replaced or removed when
worn out to allow for proper cleaning/sanitization to occur and to prevent injury to the dogs.
** To be corrected by: 9/29/14 (verbally instructed at time of inspection)
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(d) Pest control
* Upon entering the inside of the shelter building (housing 25 dogs and 24 puppies), flies swarmed around the
inspectors head. Three fly strips were hanging up. However, they were completely filled with flies. Flies were also
observed in and on the dog enclosures. An effective program to control insects that can affect the dogs must be
established and maintained at all times to reduce disease/contamination hazards, minimize stress and discomfort to
the dogs.
