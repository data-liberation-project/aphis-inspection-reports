2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female oryx and her 3-4 month old male offspring both appeared thin. The ribs, spine and hip bones are very
visible. Care staff notes that they are both eating and that they have been dewormed. Both were noted grazing
today. Care staff thought that the female might have weaned the young oryx too early. A veterinarian has not yet
been notified about the thin body conditions. A veterinarian needs to evaluate the animals' body condition to ensure
that they are healthy.
Correct by having a veterinarian examine the animals by 10/23/15.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A load of round bales of hay were recently delivered. They were placed outside on the ground next to the barn and
next to the tractor parking area. A couple of plastic tarps were present but only covered the front side of the stack of
bales at the barn area. Poor hay storage with no protection from the weather elements can lead to deterioration
and/or contamination of the hay. Hay must be stored in such a manner as to prevent deterioration, molding and
contamination.
Correct by 11/15/15.
Exit conducted with Kate Campbell, ACI, Susanne Brunkhorst, VMO and undersigned facility representative.
