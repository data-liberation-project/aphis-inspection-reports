2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
During public exhibit and training sessions, it was observed that some of the dolphins were made to look up into the sun
while interacting with employees and members of the public, in order to complete commands and to receive food rewards.
Requiring dolphins to repeatedly look up into the sun can be harmful to their eyes, and this can result in discomfort,
chronic eye problems, and loss of vision over time. Employees working with the dolphins should work under shade
structures whenever possible, or orient to animals so that they are facing away from the sun in order to protect their well-
being. To be corrected from this time forward.
3.103(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility is not entirely encircled by a perimeter fence that can effectively prevent people and animals from entering the
facility. Failure to provide an effective perimeter fence could allow animals or people to access the animals on exhibit,
which could be hazardous to their well-being. The facility is bordered by natural seawater and has alternate 24 hr security,
so it may be determined that a complete perimeter fence is not required, however the facility must obtain written approval
for such a determination from the USDA APHIS Animal Care Administrator, as per subsections under 3.103 (c).



Facility should continue to provide adequate surveillance and protection of the animals at all times, and create an effective
perimeter or obtain written approval by 2/15/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
