EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
*** At the time of this inspection several dogs were noted not to have toys in their enclosures. The exercise plan as
developed by the facility calls for the provision of toys. The dogs appeared hyperactive. It is possible that their
abnormal behavior is at least partially attributable to the lack of enrichment.
The facility must ensure that it follows an appropriate plan as developed and approved by the attending veterinarian.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Structural damage has occurred to the ceiling in one of the dog housing rooms. The damage was temporarily
corrected by the time the inspectors left the facility, but there remains a concern that flaking paint and/or chipping
plaster could fall into the enclosures of the dogs housed directly below.
Premises must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

EMPLOYEES.
*** During the course of the inspection a number of husbandry issues such as long nails on dogs, grimy surfaces,
and accumulations of dust were noted. Upon review of IACUC documents and a discussion with facility
represenatives it was concluded that the husbandry issues may be attributable to the facility being understaffed.
The facility must ensure that there are an adequate number of employees to carry out the level of husbandry
practices and care required for the health and well being of the animals.
