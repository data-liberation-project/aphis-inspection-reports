ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
"Bumper's" (goat) hooves are long. "AJ" (cat) has fleas. "Cujo" has scabs at the tail base which is evidence of a
flea allergy dermatitis. "Jasper" is thin. His ribs can be easily visualized, and his hip bones are very prominent.
The May 2017 flea control administered to the dogs was Comfortis, but the Comfortis that was shown expired in
April 2015.
The facility appears to have a program of flea control, but this program appears not to be entirely effective in
preventing fleas and flea dermatitis. Consult with your veterinarian about re-evaluating the current flea control
program (both for the animals & the environment). Have your veterinarian examine Jasper. Provide hoof care for
Bumper.
3.4(b) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
"Akasha's" igloo type shelter continues to not have a floor (this igloo was also very dirty) Shelters in outdoor
facilities for dogs and cats must contain a roof, four sides, and a floor.
There are 2 small shelter structures available for 3 cats, one bobcat, & one raccoon. If all of these species wanted
to seek shelter at the same time there would be an insufficient amount of shelter space for all of these animals to sit,
stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn around freely. Additional shelter space shall be provided.
3.6(a)(2)(x) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The dirt in the Dorkie's enclosure continues to be eroded at the front of the enclosure which continues to expose the
underlying chain link flooring. The size of the mesh holes in the chain link still poses a risk that their small feet and
legs can become entrapped in them causing injury. The floors of this enclosure shall be constructed and
maintained in a manner that protect the dogs feet from injury, and that, if of mesh construction, do not allow the
dogs feet to pass through any openings.3.9(b)
FEEDING.
There is a large food bucket in "Akasha's" enclosure. This food bucket has approx 8 cups of food. This food was
wet and caked due to heavy rainfall that entered the enclosure sideways. This can lead to molding.
Food receptacles must be used for dogs must be protected from rain. Measures must be taken to ensure that
there is no molding, deterioration, and caking of feed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Due to soil erosion, there is a gap between the fence and the ground in 2 location in the goats/pig enclosure. These
gaps in the fence-line creates a risk of injury of entrapment or facilitates the entrance of unwanted animals or
predators.
The small wire mesh that is around the water bottle for a raccoon has sharp points. This mesh was installed in an
effort to prevent this animal from knocking off the water bottle. During the inspection the raccoon did knock the
water bottle off. These sharp points pose a risk of injury to this raccoon as he attempts to dislodge the water bottle.
The elevated wood resting surface and ramp in the goat /pig play area has numerous exposed screw heads. These
screws pose a risk of injury to the goats that are in this enclosure.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Due to soil & vegetative build up, the perimeter fence around the Puma measures 7 feet 3 inches high on the back
side from the exterior side of the fence-line.
Baby Boo (skunk) perimeter fence measures 67 inches high measured from the exterior (public) side. This fence is
also not straight up.
Petey (opossum) perimeter fence has become unattached from one of the posts towards the upper end. This fence
is also slack on one side because there is no supporting post between the corners of the fenceline.
The perimeter fence shall be at least 8 feet high for the Puma. All fences shall be upright and well supported.3.130
WATERING.
The potable water for the bear is the pool that is provided for cooling/bathing. This pool of water is not a potable
source of drinking water for the bear.
A clean potable source of water shall be provided to the bear.
