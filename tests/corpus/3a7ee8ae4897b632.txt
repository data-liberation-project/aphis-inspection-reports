FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are two outdoor enclosures housing two juvenile tigers each and one outdoor enclosure housing one juvenile
tiger. All three outdoor enclosures do not have adequate shelters to protect these animals from inclement weather.
One enclosure housing two juvenile tigers has a sky-kennel (plastic shipping crate) that is too small for both animals
to get into and is not designed to provide protection from wind and rain in an outdoor application. The other
enclosure housing two juvenile tigers has a plastic dog house that is too small for both animals to enter and
therefore cannot provide protection for both animals from wind and rain. The enclosure housing the single juvenile
tiger has a wooden shelter with bedding but it is barely large enough for the animal to get into. The owner stated
that these outdoor enclosures were just for daytime use and the five juvenile tigers were placed in an insulated
transport trailer with individual partitioned cages for the night. This provides the animals with a warm dry shelter for
the night. However, regulations and good animal welfare require all enclosures housing animals provide them with
adequate shelter from inclement weather.
These five juvenile tigers must be provided adequate shelter for protection from inclement weather in these daytime
outdoor enclosures.
