2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult, female guinea pig was found in need of veterinary care during this inspection. In the first enclosure on
the left of the building, there was a pregnant, dark brown and white smooth hair guinea pig with an abnormal left
eye. The surface of the eye was uniformly cloudy throughout with a whitish-gray circular band in the center. The
animal was not squinting nor was discharge observed.

The abnormal conditions of the eye described above can result from a variety of causes including trauma and
disease. When left untreated eye problems are often significantly painful and can progress quickly resulting in
unnecessary suffering, and possibly impairment of vision or even loss of the eye due to rupture. Correct by having
the affected animal listed above examined by a licensed a veterinarian to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment of
this conditions as well as to ensure that spread of the condition to other animals is prevented if infectious in nature.
The licensee shall maintain documentation of this examination and all veterinary recommendations for review by
APHIS Officials.
The seven animals that were previously cited on the last inspection were not examined by a licensed veterinarian
nor received a diagnosis or treatment plan. Instead, these animals along with 13 other guinea pigs were sold to
another licensee. Failure to have the previous animals examined and diagnosed could result in the spread of an
infectious disease or condition in the remaining colony.
Remains uncorrected.
2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One animal was found in need of veterinary care at the time of inspection (as described above). The licensee failed
to identify the affected animal prior to USDA inspection. There was no documentation to indicate that the licensee
discussed any of the animals previously identified in need of veterinary care with the Attending Veterinarian to
ensure that appropriate measures were implemented to provide care for the other animals. All licensees are
required to use adequate methods for daily observation so that animals with health problems are identified quickly.Additionally, there must be a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian (AV)
so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed and
proper care can be directed by the AV and provided by the licensee in an appropriate manner. Failure to make
effective daily observations to properly identify animals in need of care and then communicate those findings to the
AV in a timely manner delays care and results in unnecessary animal suffering. Correct by ensuring that adequate
daily observations are being conducted and that there is a mechanism for direct and frequent communication with
the AV from this point forward.
Remains uncorrected.
2.126(a)(4) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) still allows euthanasia of guinea pigs by the licensee using CO2,
however, the equipment and supplies used for this procedure are located in an area of the property which is not
accessible to inspectors because of biosecurity concerns. Dealers must allow APHIS Officials to inspect the
facilities, property and animals as necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act. Locating portions of the facility
(such as equipment used for euthanasia) in an area of the property that is off-limits to inspectors prevents
inspection to ensure that euthanasia is conducted in a manner consistent with adequate care. Correct by ensuring
that all areas of the property, and animal facilities including all equipment are accessible to inspectors for all future
inspections. If the licensee chooses to change the methods used for routine euthanasia, this must be made in
consultation with the attending veterinarian and the current PVC must be updated to note the change in the method
of euthanasia.
Remains uncorrected.

3.29(d) REPEAT
FEEDING.
There are still at least 5 food bowls with severely chewed edges along the top rim. The chewed edges can no longer
be adequately cleaned and disinfected. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards
such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Food receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as often as
necessary and at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by replacing chewed feed bowls and keeping feed bowls clean
and sanitizing bowls at least once 2 weeks. Remains uncorrected.
3.30 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
There were at least 10 enclosures with dirty water bowls at time of this inspection. The water in the bowls was filthy
and discolored with brown debris from shavings and excreta. Animals were observed drinking the dirty, brown water
during the inspection. Water for guinea pigs must be clean and potable and provided daily unless the food
supplements consumed by the animals supplies them with their normal water requirements. Open containers such
as water bowls must be placed in enclosures that minimizes the contamination from excreta. Water that is
contaminated by soiled bedding and excreta can expose the guinea pigs to disease hazards and health problems.
Correct by ensuring that potable water is offered as often as necessary to ensure the health of the animals and at
least daily. Additionally, ensure that watering receptacles are free from contamination and are properly sanitized
when dirty.
Remains uncorrected.
Cleaning and housekeeping items were corrected from the last inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee, Ashley McIntosh, VMO, and Robert Markmann, ACI.
