3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are areas within the facility with standing water under and around the enclosures. These areas include the
far end of the east end barn housing 44 dogs, the whelping barn housing 172 animals, and the back area of the
whelping barn housing 90 dogs. The standing water in the back area is contributing to the attraction of flies which
were observed in and around the food receptacles. Failure to provide adequate drainage systems that eliminate
standing water increases risk of odors, insects and disease hazards. This affects the husbandry standards of the
facility and can affect the health of the animals. Establish and maintain an effective drainage system to rapidly
eliminate excess water in order to minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors, disease hazards and to
allow for required husbandry practices. Correct by July 2, 2014.
3.3(e)(1)(1)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The floor in the husky barn is no longer impervious to moisture. Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture can
hold and trap urine and other substances and can contribute to odor buildup within the facility. These conditions
can affect the health of the animals. Place the indoor floor areas in contact with the animals in a condition that is
impervious to moisture. Correct by: August 6, 2014
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were large numbers of flies observed in and around the food and water receptacles in the back area of the
whelping barn. Flies can contaminate the animals' food and water and pose a disease hazard. Establish and
maintain an effective program to control flies and reduce the contamination of the food and water. Correct by: July
