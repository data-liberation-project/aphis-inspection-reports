Handling of animals.
In May 2021, two keepers attempted to capture a male Prevost squirrel for transport to the facility's quarantine. The main
keeper that worked with the Prevost squirrel attempted to voluntarily capture the animal; however, after several
unsuccessful attempts the animal was hand contained and transferred into a transport cage, totaling a time span of 45
minutes from initial attempt to final capture. Approximately an hour or so later, a keeper checked on the squirrel in its
cage, and was observed, per the facility, walking around with an abnormal, drunken gait. The keeper called for assistance
and eventually the Bird and Mammal Curator was called. The attending veterinarian was contacted and instructed that the
staff administer Pedialyte and prepare subcutaneous fluids but when the staff entered the enclosure to administer the SQ
fluids, the squirrel was found deceased. A necropsy report found incidental disease findings as well as evidence of stress-
related pathologic findings. Although both keepers were trained on the proper methods to capture an animal, the
continuous unsuccessful attempts to capture the squirrel over the span of approximately 45 minutes negatively impacted
the health and welfare of the animal. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a
manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
