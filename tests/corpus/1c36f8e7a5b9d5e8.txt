FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A survey of the perimeter fence surrounding the zoo grounds revealed the following:
>>> On the main road along the south west side the new electronic gate is not closing properly due to the automatic
gate mechanism not working. The electronic gate is part of the new perimeter fence and at the time of inspection
was being left open. The gate was closed manually by an employee and has a gap underneath the gate about 8.5"
high along the entire bottom length of the gate which is 14' 4".
>>>Next to the electronic fence is an access gate which has about a 4" gap along the bottom.
>>> On the west side along the road is a 5.5" gap in the bottom of the fence.
>>>On the north west side near the hay barn is a 5" gap and behind the hay barn is a 5-6" H x 6.5" L gap on the
bottom of the fence.
>>>Behind the ferret building at the fence post is a 5" gap in bottom of the fence.
>>>On the north west side between the 2 new "drainage gates" is a gap ranging from 3.5 -6" high and extending
about 10" long on the bottom of the fence The washed out area near the 2d "drainage gate" is a 7-8" H x 34" L gap
in the bottom of the fence.
>>>A tree limb is hanging over the perimeter fence below the Shrine area that is bending the barb wire which is
attached to the top of the fence.
>>>Adjacent to the fire service road near the new fence is a rock sitting on the outside next to the perimeter fence
reducing the effective height of the fence by about 1 foot.
>>>The north vehicle access gate at the far end of the fire service road has a 6"H x 31" L gap in the bottom of the
gate it and also has a 3.5" gap where the chain link is not tightly secured to the lower post. >>>On the north side of the perimeter fence near the fire service road is a large pine tree growing into the fence and
bending the barb wire.
>>>On the south side halfway down the hill is a 5-6" H X 4" L gap. Also in this area before the steep drop next to
the old rebar fix is an 11" H X 12" L gap in the bottom of the fence.
>>>Along the south parking lot to the maintenance area are several areas of about 5-6" H X up to 12" L gaps in the
bottom of the fence.
These areas cannot effectively restrict animals or people from entering the facility or function as a secondary
containment for the facility animals.
Construct and maintain the fencing so it is in good repair to protect the animals in the facility and is of the required
height.
Inspection and an exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
