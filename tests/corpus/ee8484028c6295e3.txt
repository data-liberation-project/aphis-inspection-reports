Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC approved protocols 5 and 57 involve a procedure that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or
distress to the rabbits. The protocols do not include a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to
determine that alternatives to the procedure were not available. Consideration of alternatives, including refinement,
reduction and replacement, assists in the minimization of pain and distress to the animals. The IACUC must ensure that
the principal investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or
distress to the animals and has provided a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine
that alternatives were not available. To be corrected by November 15, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
