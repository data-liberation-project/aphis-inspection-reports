Facilities, general.
Currently, the licensee has weaned four fox kits and housed them in a moveable fenced in area on the back porch. During
the inspection, it was observed that the kits now know how to climb the enclosure fence and run free on the porch. They
also identified the gate that restricts access to the back of the property and began attempting to climb through it.
Unrestricted access to the porch and subsequently the back property poses a risk of escape to the young animals. The
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sounds and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
Correct by May 3rd, 2022 or prior to the next scheduled relicense inspection.
