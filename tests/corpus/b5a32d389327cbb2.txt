2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****A Chihuahua (mc# 0A01627962) was very thin. The coat was thick and was in good condition but the backbone
and hips were very prominant. Weight loss can indicate underlying medical conditions. The owner needs to
separate this dog from the other 3 in this enclosure and have the dog evaluated by a veterinarian for causes of lack
of weight. The results of the evaluation and treatment plan must be documented and available to APHIS officials
upon request.
2.50(a)(2) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
(2) Live puppies or kittens, less than 16 weeks of age
****There were 38 weaned puppies that were less than 16 weeks of age that did not have any form of identification
on them. Proper and accurate identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known
with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare
documentation. The owner must identify all live regulated animals and assure that records are kept at all times.
The inspection and exit interview was done with a facility representative.
