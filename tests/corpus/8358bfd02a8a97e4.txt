*** A few areas of the building need to be addressed. There is exposed insulation above the windows at the front of
the building, there is a hole in the drywall above the door way area and there are several areas where the plaster is
cracked and in disrepair. Premises need to be maintained in good repair to facilitate cleaning practices and for the
safety of the animals.

area housing the animals needs to be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste, and discarded matter to
facilitate good housekeeping practices.
