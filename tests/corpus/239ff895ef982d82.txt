2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a black male pekingese named Halo (microchip 941000021088292) with an injured left eye. The eye
was red and cloudy and had a mass of red tissue protruding from the cornea. A creamy white fluid was oozing from
the eye and the fur around the eye was matted with yellow crust. The licensee stated that he was not aware of the
injury. Eye injuries can be painful and should be appropriately addressed in a timely manner to ensure animal
welfare. The licensee must observe all animals on a daily basis to assess their health and well-being and
communicate their findings with the veterinarian in a timely manner to ensure adequate veterinary care.
The licensee left during the inspection to have the dog evaluated and treated by the attending veterinarian.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility consists of an indoor whelping facility and 2 sheltered facilities with indoor/outdoor cement runs. In the
older sheltered facility housing 9 pekingese dogs, there was an accumulation of feces on the ground at the end of
the outdoor runs. There was also an open PVC pipe drain along one side of the outdoor runs that had a heavy
buildup of feces inside the pipe and caught in between the pipe and the cement where the pipe had started to pull
away. There was an odor and flies were swarming the waste material. Waste material poses disease and
contamination risks and attracts pests. Housing facilities must be constructed with drainage systems that rapidly
eliminate animal waste and water.
