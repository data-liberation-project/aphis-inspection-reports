The facility failed to provide adequate authority to the attending veterinarian by treating three animals with medication not
approved by the attending veterinarian (AV). The medical treatment records for 26 Oct 2021 showed that caretaker staff
had identified three dogs as being too thin (CGDDBN, CJFCLZ, CLHCHF). These records also indicated that a
medication (later identified by the attending veterinarian as Cefpodoxime) had been given to these dogs that day. Medical
records did not show that a veterinarian had been consulted regarding the diagnosis of thin body condition or prescription
of medications to these dogs. There was no guidance in the program of veterinary care allowing caretaker staff to start
this medication on dogs they perceived as too thin. The AV verified that she did not prescribe this medication for these
dogs nor would she prescribe this for a dog with only a thin body condition. When APHIS officials brought this to the
attention of the AV, she completed an examination on these dogs and directed the antibiotics be stopped. Employees who
diagnose and prescribe treatment for animals without consulting the AV are undermining the authority of the AV to ensure
the provision of adequate veterinary care for the animals. Correct by ensuring that the AV has adequate authority to
ensure the provision of veterinary care and to oversee all other aspects of animal care and use. Additionally, ensure that
timely and accurate information concerning health of the dogs is communicated to the attending veterinarian in


accordance with section 2.40(b)(3) so that appropriate methods are used to diagnose and treat all diseases and injuries
as required by section 2.40(b)(2). Correct by November 5, 2021

Adult, female beagle (CIACNG) was squinting her right eye and had extensive tear staining and clear discharge around
and under her right eye. There were small eyelashes pointing down from the upper lid toward the surface of her eye. This
dog received a physical exam on 4 Oct 2021. The physical exam findings documented at that time were consistent with
the eye problems seen during the inspection. The veterinarian documented on the physical exam form that the action for
this dog was “cull”. The facility was unable to provide any documentation showing that this dog had received any kind of
treatment since the diagnosis was made during the physical exam on 4 Oct and, as of the time of the inspection, had not
been “culled” or otherwise disposed of through either adoption, sale, or euthanasia. This dog’s symptoms are consistent
with untreated conditions resulting in eye pain. While the condition was diagnosed by the veterinarian, the disease was
not treated. The licensee must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Three dogs had medical conditions that had not been identified or treated by the facility prior to the inspection.

October 25, 2021:
*** A male beagle puppy (CMHCKL) has an abnormal left eye. There was yellow-green discharge present at the corner of
the eye with dried discharge surrounding the eye. The membrane at the inner corner of the eye was extended slightly and
there was increased tearing present. This eye condition was not previously identified by the facility and the dog was not
receiving any treatments for the eye. The facility examined the dog and immediately began treatment for an eye infection.



*** An adult female beagle (CKJCAZ) has a medium firm, pink, and swollen area of tissue between the 4th and 5th toes of
her right rear paw. The swelling was approximately 1/3” in diameter and the inflamed tissue was easy to visualize from a
distance. The condition was not previously identified by the facility and the dog was not receiving any treatments for the
foot. The facility examined the dog and immediately began treatment for an interdigital cyst.

October 26, 2021:
*** An adult female beagle (CGHCAC) has multiple skin lesions on all four feet. The hair between all four feet was
discolored red, commonly seen with licking/chewing due to the presence of saliva. On the left front paw there was a small
firm and swollen area of tissue between digits 3+4, and a large firm, swollen, and pink area of tissue between digits 2+3.
The larger swelling also has a scab present closest to the toe. On the right front paw there is thickening present in the
crevice of skin between the 4th + 5th toes with pink skin and a small scab. There is a medium firm, pink, and swollen area
of tissue between digits 3+4 with yellow crusts attached and an oozing sore on the top surface. There is also thickening
and inflammation of the skin on the 5th digit between digits 4+5 with two more scabs present. On the left rear paw there is
swelling of the skin on digit 4 between digits 4+5 with an open wound on the top surface and partial scabbing. In between
digits 3+4 there is a lot of inflamed, pink, and thickened skin with numerous crusts/scabs on the front edge of the toe and
an exposed raw area of skin. Between digits 2+3 there is a medium firm, swollen, and pink area of tissue with a scab on
the top surface. On the right rear paw there is a small firm, swollen, and dark pink area of tissue with white flaking crusts
between digits 2+3. The condition was not previously identified by the facility and the dog was not receiving any
treatments for her feet. The facility examined the dog and began treatment.



Animals with medical conditions including eye and skin problems may suffer from pain, discomfort, infection, and stress.
Daily observations of animals to identify medical problems is essential for animal health and welfare. The licensee must
observe all animals at least daily to identify physical, medical, or behavioral problems. Additionally, ensure that all findings
are communicated in a timely manner to the attending veterinarian so that they can examine animals and ensure that
appropriate treatment is provided as required by section 2.40(b)(2) and further, that the findings are documented in
accordance with section 3.13.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility still does not have complete acquisition or disposition records for their animals. Facility records, known as
Inventory Change Notices, are used to record newborn puppy numbers, procedures performed, and changes in puppy
numbers due to euthanasia or death. The facility continues to have animals which are no longer present for unknown
reasons that they have stated to be clerical errors.

***Records indicate that a female puppy born on 9-27-2021, from the dam CIICMP, was not present during a litter count
conducted on 10-14-2021. The original litter count was 4 males and 5 females. On 10-14 there were only 4 males and 4
females. There was no record of this puppy dying or being euthanized which would account for its absence. When the
facility was asked as to the status of the missing female puppy, they were unable to determine if the original puppy count
was wrong (i.e., there were only 4 males and 4 females at birth) or if a female puppy has truly been lost. If the puppy has
been lost, the facility does not know how or when.

***On 4 November the facility’s Manager of Operations disclosed that she recalled a neonate puppy was found in the
drain under an enclosure on 13 October 2021. The puppy was removed from the drain and subsequently died later that


day. This puppy had not been given an acquisition number and was not included in the acquisition records provided
earlier to inspectors. There was no record of this puppy included in the “mortality logs” or other disposition records
provided by the facility to inspectors. When asked, the Operations Manager stated that that she was not sure why it had
not been included, but perhaps the employees were “not sure how to code it”.

Accurate and complete recordkeeping of all acquisitions and dispositions is important for animal identification, traceability
or animals, animal loss, and investigation of disease outbreaks or animal theft. Correct by maintaining records that fully
and accurately document all dogs and cats acquired by the facility (through birth, purchase, or other method) and all
animals that are disposed of (by sale, death, euthanasia, or other method) including all information required in this
section.
2.131(b)(1) Critical Repeat

Handling of animals.
Animals have not been handled as carefully and expeditiously as possible leading to subsequent death.
*** According to the manager of operations, a newborn puppy was found in the drains below the kennels on 10-13-2021.
The Manager of Operations explained that the facility had recently laid down a new type of flooring on top of the existing
kennel grate to enhance puppy safety. The manager believes that the puppy fell into the drain because one dam
(CKJCCT) had shifted a piece of the flooring, exposing a gap, and whelped on top of the old flooring. The puppy was
found between 1-2 pm and immediately brought to the clinic for a bath and was returned to the above dam who had
recently whelped near where the puppy was found. The puppy was also provided supplemental heat but died later that
day. The Manager of Operations stated that in response to this incident, employees replaced the flooring and added
paper to the back of the kennels to prevent another occurrence.



*** Mortality records show that a 7-week-old puppy (CLICBE) was found deceased on 21 Oct 2020 with its head stuck in
the swinging kennel door of a bedded whelping run. Facility representatives state that an investigation of the incident was
completed at the time, but they do not have access to the files from previous management. It was determined that the
entrapment and subsequent death was a result of employee error. The employee has since been terminated. Failure to
handle animals as carefully and expeditiously as possible can lead to injury or death. Employees must take special care
when working with small puppies as they are more easily overlooked and seriously injured. The licensee must ensure all
animals are handled expeditiously and carefully in a manner that does not cause physical harm, trauma, or unnecessary
discomfort.

3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The facility has surfaces in contact with the dogs that are not being spot-cleaned frequently enough to prevent the buildup
of grime and dirt and to reduce disease hazards. In multiple enclosures, the outer cement walls housing the dog doors
have brown dirt/grime built up. According to the facility, the outdoor enclosures are hosed down once per day with either a
pressure washer or a routine hose. Every two weeks the enclosures are sanitized using a product called “Intervention.”
Due to the accumulations of dirt and debris on the walls, it is evident that the facility is not spot-cleaning or sanitizing
effectively to prevent accumulations or to reduce disease hazards.



Buildup of feces, dirt, and grime on a surface accessible to the dogs exposes them to unnecessary disease hazards and
does not satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. Correct by November 8, 2021 by ensuring all
surfaces in contact with the dogs are spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with this Subpart.
3.6(a)(2)(ii) Direct Repeat

Primary enclosures.
Mortality records show that from 2 Aug 2021 to 3 Oct 2021, nine dogs (CLCCVA, CLBCES, CLFCAB, CLCCUU,
CLLCGK, CLLCGS, CLACJT, CLCCIN, and CLECRN) were injured from having a body part (such as a limb or tail) pulled
through the wall of the kennel by a dog in an adjacent kennel and bitten. The exact injuries varied in each case, however
regardless of whether it was a minor or substantial injury, these nine dogs were subsequently euthanized. Dogs
sustaining injuries from being pulled through the enclosure wall have experienced physical harm and unnecessary pain.
The facility must ensure that all primary enclosures protect the dogs from injury.
3.6(a)(2)(x) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
The flooring in G2 which houses puppies from about 6 weeks and older still uses flooring that allows young puppies’ feet
and legs to pass though the openings. The facility agreed, via conditions of a correction date extension approval, that they
would cover the flooring in kennels housing young puppies with cardboard cage liners as a temporary measure and
additionally that they would provide increased night monitoring of all animals until all noncompliant floors could be
replaced. However, there were two enclosures seen during the inspection that did not have these in place or even the
heavy butcher-type paper which was covering the floor in other enclosures. Inspectors witnessed multiple puppies with
legs and feet passing through the openings in the floors of these enclosures. Raised mesh or slatted flooring that contains
openings that are wide enough for a limb, paw, or digit to pass through can lead to an animal becoming trapped or
injured. When an animal becomes entrapped, they can become distressed, dehydrated, or may suffer additional injuries.


The facility must ensure that floors of primary enclosures are constructed and maintained in such a manner that does not
allow dogs’ feet and legs to pass through any openings.
3.7 Direct Repeat

Compatible grouping.
The facility is still having compatibility issues between dogs housed in groups.

October 26, 2021:
***Two adult female beagles (CIBCTG and CJACNF) being housed together had scabs covering multiple small puncture
wounds/scrapes. CIBCTG had hair loss present on her back midline and wounds located on her right nose, right ear, left
ear, and left cheek. After replacing CIBCTG in the kennel, she began biting and chasing her kennel mate (CJACNF).
CJACNF had scabs/wounds on her right knee and inner left thigh. The biting and wounds had not been previously
identified by the facility. When questioned, the facility stated that CIBCTG is currently in heat and may be picking fights
with her kennel mates. When inspectors identified this issue, the facility representatives removed CIBCTG and placed her
in a separate kennel. No steps have been implemented at the facility to prevent potential compatibility issues.

***Two adult female beagles were currently being treated for fight wounds that occurred on 10/25/2021. An adult female
beagle (CJACRI) had fight wounds on her chest and left ear. The other adult female beagle (CGFCFA) had fight wounds
on her rear end and right front shoulder. These dogs were removed from two different kennels subsequent to fights which
resulted in these injuries. According to the facility representative, following a fight, the injured animal is removed and
treated medically. Once they are healed, the animal is relocated to a new enclosure in the attempt to find more compatible
kennel mates. If one dog is found to be involved in multiple fights and thought to be the aggressor, they may elect to
euthanize due to temperament. There is currently no systematic pro-active attempt to identify incompatible animals


through behavioral observation; rather, dogs are moved only after injuries are sustained.

***Facility records also show on 10/14/2021, a female dog CMHCAC was found dead. The mortality log and mortality
record sheet from October 14th attributed the dog’s death to evisceration (EVIS). CMHCAC was being cohoused with 9
other dogs approximately the same age (10 weeks old). According to the facility, the dog was found dead and the
“littermates had chewed on it.” The facility was unable to provide additional information when asked. There is no
description of the lesions identified other than the facility code “EVIS” and no record of post-mortem examination findings.
When inspectors asked to talk to the employee that found this puppy dead, they were informed she was unreachable due
to leave. Dogs attacking/chewing on another dog, whether alive or deceased, is an uncommon behavior for dogs with
adequate nutrition and likely indicates a compatibility issue.

Even though this facility continues to have compatibility problems in their group housed animals, there has been no action
taken by the facility to proactively identify and potentially house separately those dogs that are incompatible or have an
aggressive disposition. Failure to maintain compatible groups of dogs can lead to injuries, pain, and even death in the
dogs. Correct this by ensuring all dogs are maintained in compatible groups.
3.11(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The facility continues to have general sanitation problems with cleaning of enclosures, waste gutters, and odor control.
***At least two enclosures had old, dried, and moldy feces still present in the outdoor section. According to the facility, the
lactating females inside do not currently have outdoor access. Additionally, an enclosure in Building G1 housing an adult
male beagle contained at least nine to ten piles of feces in the outdoor portion, preventing him from accessing a majority
of the outside run without stepping in his own waste and creating a disease hazard. Due to the presence of mold on some


feces and the excessive number of feces in with the male, it is apparent that some of the enclosures are not being
cleaned, at a minimum, daily.

*** In at least 50% of the rooms being used within Buildings G1 and G2 there are still accumulations of waste and an
overpowering fecal odor that emanates from below the kennels. Significant accumulations of animal waste and fur on top
of 2 pulley systems used to scrape solid waste underneath enclosures are contributing to the excessive odor in the
facility. One waste gutter found in Building G2, outside Room 7 had a pile of feces stacked on top of the pulley system
approximately 5-6" high. According to the facility, this happens when the gutters are drained and flushed prior to the
facility power-washing the enclosures. Another waste gutter found in Building G1, inside Room 8 had a very large
collection of fur and fecal matter piled on top of a pipe and the surrounding floor just in front of the pulley mechanism. The
waste in the gutters below the main sheltered housing buildings of G1, G2, and G3 have been flushed out since the last
inspection and, although the gutters contain much less waste, several waste gutters throughout the facility still had
accumulations of feces and urine sitting under the kennels. According to the facility, the waste gutters are limited to being
flushed once every other day due to water supply and storage on site.

***Throughout the facility there are areas where a strong sewage odor emanates from the waste gutters surrounding the
rooms. The odor is not present at all rooms in a building, but every building has at least one or more rooms with a strong
odor. The facility is aware of this issue and has been looking into possible causes and potential solutions.

Buildup of feces, urine, food waste and wastewater provide a breeding grounds for pests and insects and exposes the
dogs to unnecessary disease hazards and noxious odors. The licensee must ensure that excreta and food waste is


removed from and under primary enclosures as often as necessary and with a functioning system that reduces disease
hazard, insects, pests, and odors.
3.11(d) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There are still large numbers of dead flies and spiders noted throughout the facility especially in the corners of buildings,
near drains, and in the storage areas. Additionally, some areas near drains have populations of small live black flies. The
facility has changed pest control companies and there is an improvement in the number of pests found during this
inspection. However, failure to remove dead pests makes it impossible to properly monitor the effectiveness of the pest
control program. Correct by ensuring an effective pest control program is established and maintained.
3.12 Direct Repeat

Employees
The facility continues to have insufficient numbers of employees to successfully care for the animals. There continue to be
severe staffing shortages and currently there are approximately 32 employees at the facility, with only 17 staff members
directly responsible for all husbandry, daily observations, and medical treatments for almost 5000 dogs. Four dogs were
identified by APHIS inspectors with medical conditions that required treatment and should have been found by staff during
their daily observations. There are also numerous dogs that have been identified with severe periodontal disease by
veterinarians and still require prescribed dental cleanings. Additionally, basic husbandry such as cleaning out kennels
daily to remove feces, cleaning contact surfaces to prevent buildup of debris, and general housekeeping including dead
pest removal is not being performed in accordance with the AWA regulations. The employees who are responsible for
assessing animals for medical problems are also responsible for assisting with husbandry and cleaning. While the facility
brought in temporary, visiting veterinary staff following the last inspection to assist in preventive medicine duties such as
dentals and physical exams, the facility still has not completed all the needed procedures identified on those exams.


There is still only one full-time veterinarian to oversee the daily medical care of all the animals as well as assisting with
research projects. The facility must ensure that there are sufficient employees to carry out the level of husbandry
practices and care required in this subpart.
3.13(b)(2) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
Veterinary medical records are incomplete for at least 7 dogs. This includes:

*** Mortality records from August 14th and 15th, 2021 shows a list of three puppies coded as deceased from FALV (fatty
liver) - CMGCAE, CMGCCZ, and CMGCAU, and two puppies as deceased from ENTE (enteritis) - CMFCYE and
CMGCFA. All puppies were approximately 5-6 weeks old. When the complete medical record was requested for these
animals, it only listed the facility’s code for fatty liver and/or enteritis, respectively. Records indicate necropsies were
performed on all these puppies however, there are no exam findings, description of lesions observed, or test results
recorded. Additionally, there are no description of symptoms leading up to these animals’ deaths. These are diagnoses
that can’t be made without either a history of symptoms or further diagnostic testing such as histopathology. There are no
descriptions in the medical records of problems, daily observation of symptoms leading up to the death, examination
findings, or test results listed for these puppies.

*** The mortality records for October 21, 2021 lists a puppy (CMICFA) coded deceased from FALV (fatty liver) and PNEU
(pneumonia). The medical record for this puppy lists a mortality code of HPNE (hemorrhagic pneumonia) and FALV (fatty
liver). Although, the record indicates a necropsy was performed on the puppy, descriptions of necropsy findings, specific
observation, and descriptions of symptoms leading up to the animal’s death are not present.



*** The inventory change sheet and medical record for a puppy (210801001C) shows that it was euthanized due to DMGB
(damage by bitch), a broken jaw on August 17, 2021. However, the medical record does not have physical exam findings,
such as the location or severity of the fracture of the jaw, type of fracture, diagnostics performed, or test results.

*** Medical records and a treatment form for a 6-week-old puppy (CMFCPH) on August 5, 2021 indicate that the dog was
“lame on all four legs” had a “broken left femur” but failed to contain additional physical examination findings, diagnostics,
or test results. The facility representative who found the dog told inspectors that they observed a head tilt and the puppy’s
balance seemed off, but there was no obvious limping on any specific leg. The manager of operations stated that when
the Attending Veterinarian examined the dog, she felt a “pop” in the puppy’s left femur and suspected a fracture. The AV
recommended euthanasia and the dog was subsequently euthanized. The medical records did not include any of the
attending veterinarian’s examination findings but rather a presumptive diagnosis.

***On 4 November 2021, the facility’s Manager of Operations disclosed that a neonate puppy (less than 1 day old) was
found in the drain under an enclosure on 13 October 2021. She stated that the puppy was retrieved and was provided a
warming pad and was cleaned before being returned to an enclosure. The puppy died later that day. There is no medical
record for this animal documenting an examination, treatment, or death of this puppy.

The presumptive diagnoses listed on the medical records are an incomplete record of all findings/lesions on physical
exam, necropsy, diagnostic testing, or results. Due to incomplete records, the facility cannot determine the exact cause of
death and therefore ensure the health of the entire colony. Additionally, these animals are coded with problems that
present with clinical signs prior to death such as weakness, lethargy, coughing, heavy breathing, inappetence, diarrhea,


and vomiting. The facility appears to have missed these clinical signs during daily observations as there are no records
indicating problems found prior to death or treatments initiated.

Incomplete medical records do not allow the attending veterinarian to adequately assess the needs of individual animals
as well as the medical needs of the colony as a whole. The licensee must ensure that if a problem is identified in a dog
(such as disease, injury, or illness), the date and description of the problem, examination findings, test results, plan for
treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed are recorded in the medical records. Additionally, daily
observations must be made in accordance with 2.40(b)(3) to prevent unnecessary suffering and death in animals.

This inspection was conducted with the Site Director, Manager of Operations, Attending Veterinarian, and Supporting
Veterinarian. The exit briefing was conducted with the Site Director, Manager of Operations, Attending Veterinarian,
Supporting Veterinarian, Senior Vice President for Vet Services, the Director of Quality Assurance, the Regional Quality
Assurance Manager, the Vice President of North American Operations, and the Chief Operating Officer.
