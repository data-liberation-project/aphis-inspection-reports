2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One Muntjac Deer was observed to have hair loss and redness on top of its rump. Hair loss indicates there may be
an health issue with this animal. The licensee had not observed the hair loss prior to inspection and the Attending
Veterinarian has not been notified of the health issue for this animal. The Attending Veterinarian must be contacted
and the animal must be treated per his/her instructions. Correct by 7/1/17.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A wooden post along the top railing of the fence line in the Dromedary Camel enclosure was broken in half. A
broken wooden post along the top railing of the fence line doesn't ensure that the enclosure can adequately contain
the camel. If the camel were to lean up against that section of the fence, the fence could potentially give way
allowing the camel to escape from the enclosure. In addition a metal panel on the sidewall of the kangaroo,
wallaby, and wallaroo enclosure had a hole in it. Sharp edges and points were sticking out into the enclosure.
Sharp edges and points could potentially injure any animals that come into contact with it. The enclosures must be
fixed and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Food and debris was observed on the floor of the small mammal room. This could attract rodents and other pests.
In addition, the hay storage area at the home location had twine and equipment surrounding the area making it
difficult to assess the area for evidence of pests. All premises shall be kept clean and in good repair. Correct by
7/1/17.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
