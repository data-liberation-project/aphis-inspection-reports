3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
An outdoor primary enclosure, housing 2 Bactrian camels, had a large gap in the fence. The gap was approximately 2-3
feet and extended upward from the ground. The gap in the enclosure fence is large enough for a camel to stick its head
and neck through causing injury or entrapment.
Facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain them.
The licensee must fix the gap in the enclosure fence to prevent injury to the camels.

3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility exhibits dangerous animals thus requiring an 8-foot-tall perimeter fence. Approximately 120 feet of the
perimeter fence was not the required 8-foot height. The shortest point of this affected area measured approximately 75.5
inches. There was an overgrowth of vegetation which was affecting the fence integrity causing it to bend downward. With
an inadequate perimeter fence, animals and unauthorized persons can access the animals and may cause stress,
transmit disease, injure, or release the regulated animals.


All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. Fences must be at least 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals such as large felines,
bears, wolves, rhinoceros, and elephants and at least 6 feet high for other animals. The fence must be constructed so that
it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and
having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical
contact between the animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such fences shall
be 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure.
The licensee must ensure that outdoor housing facilities are enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height and
maintained in good repair to keep animals and unauthorized persons out.
