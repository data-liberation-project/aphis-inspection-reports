3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
There were no dates recorded for the administration of distemper and parvovirus vaccines for the adult dogs. Failure to
keep and maintain records on the dates and administration of all vaccines and treatments makes it difficult to determine
when the dogs were last vaccinated or received treatments. Licensee must keep and maintain records of the names and
dates of all vaccines and treatments administered to adult dogs. Correct by November 26, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
