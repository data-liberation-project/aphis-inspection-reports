ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00pm on
11/25/2014.
I knocked on the front and side doors with no answer, and called out into the back property where there are
enclosures with no response. I tried to call however there was no answer at this time or answering machine on to
allow leaving a message. I waited 25 minutes in the driveway. There was no contact made on this date.
