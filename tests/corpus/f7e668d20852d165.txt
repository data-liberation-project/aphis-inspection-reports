FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are two wolves that do not have an 8' perimeter. They are surrounded by a 4' fence on three sides and have
no perimeter fence on the fourth side.
Perimeter fence. On or after May 17, 2000, all outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be
enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences
less than 8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals, such as, but not limited to, large felines (e.g., lions, tigers,
leopards, cougars, etc.), bears, wolves, rhinoceros, and elephants, or less than 6 feet high for other animals must
be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the
facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the
animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact betweenanimals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such fences less than 3 feet in
distance from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
An 8' perimeter fence must be constructed to be used as a secondary containment and to ensure there is no public
contact with the wolves to protect the safety of the animal and the public.
