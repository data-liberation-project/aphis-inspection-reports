2.33(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The Attending Veterinarian prescribed several treatments for different animals which the research staff did not
follow. The neglected care by one research staff employee included: a hot pack wasn't provided for a lame pig, an
incision was cleaned with water rather than betadine, and a weight was not taken as directed to determine the
proper pain medication dose for a pig. Another research employee disregarded the Attending Veterinarian's
medical directive to examine a lame pig while under anesthesia. Medical orders should be followed as directed in
order to ensure the animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times. The registrant must ensure that the
Attending Veterinarian has the appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care. This
non-compliant item was self-identified by the IACUC and corrected prior to the inspection.
The inspection and an exit interview were conducted by Dr. Amanda Owens and Dr. Heather Cole with facility
representatives.
