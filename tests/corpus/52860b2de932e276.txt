3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Along the backside of the outdoor enclosure housing 2 adult mountain lions named "True" and "Zia" the upper fence
extension is no longer securely attached to the primary fence along three panels. This is creating multiple gaps at
the junction of the two fences. These gaps are large enough that if an animal jumps on the fence, it could reach
through the gap and injure itself or potentially escape.
Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from
injuries.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted facility representative.
