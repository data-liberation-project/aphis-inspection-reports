3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There are accumulations of soiled bedding and excreta covering the floors of the enclosures housing guinea pigs
with fresh hay on top. Primary enclosures for guinea pigs must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent
accumulations of soiled bedding and excreta. The cleaning process (method and frequency) is not often enough to
prevent this accumulation. Ineffective cleaning and sanitation exposes the guinea pigs to potential diseases hazards
such as bacteria, fungal, and viral diseases. Correct by ensuing that all primary enclosures are kept clean to prevent
an accumulation of soiled bedding and excreta and that enclosures are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
