FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some areas of pens are in need of repair; the lean-to building in the whitetail pen has sharp tin edges exposed to
where deer can get to them. The goat pen has loops of loose steel cable hanging off of one of the towers. Sharp
edges and loops of cable could cause injury to animals. Ensure that sharp edges and the loose cable are
repaired/removed/replaced to protect the animals. Maintain enclosures free from sharp edges and loose material
that could injure animals.

3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The licensee reported that on or around 7/21/2019 after some work with the whitetail deer was done, a doe got out
of her primary enclosure. It is not clear if a gate was left open or how she got out. Feed was placed in an empty
open pen and two days later she came back in but the licensee said when trying to secure the gate she bound
against the panel and got out and hasn't returned. Proper containment of animals is needed to ensure their
well-being. The facility must be maintained in good repair to contain the animals.
Maintain correct from this day forward.
