ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A fawn and white adult male French Bulldog (microchip number 105 352 115 ) have long toe nails on both front
and rear feet. The toe nails were an estimated half inches in length. The toe nails were curving backwards toward
the foot pad. Long toe nails can be painful causing discomfort when the dog is trying to walk. The potential for
injury exists if the toe nail becomes caught in the wire flooring. Lack of nail care on a regular basis can affect the
health and well-being of that dog. The licensee must establish a nail trim maintance program for all dogs at the
facility. Correct by 11/7/14.
**********************************
* The following medication was past the labeled expiration date. There was one (cid:19) 1000 ML bottle of Safeguard
with an expiration date of 02/2014. This medication was intermingled with other products that are currently being
used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of expired medical materials such as drugs, fluids, or
sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute
adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are
administrated to dogs could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure that
all medications used are not expired and labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices. Correct
by 11/17/14.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* There was no record of inventory present on "unweaned" puppies born at the facility. No inventory information

recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the enclosure must have the following information attached to it:
dealer's USDA license number, the letters (cid:28) USDA (cid:28) and the number identifying each puppy in that litter. If no
offspring have been recorded on USDA official 7005 forms, then the following information must be recorded and

litter, the dam's ID number, a description of each puppy ( breed, sex, color and any distinctive markings ). Theinventory information records must be maintained with all corresponding 7006's for one year. If the licensee

inventory information is required on the enclosure. Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure that
every puppy's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace all puppies. The licensee must
maintain complete and accurate records of all puppies at all times at their facility. Correct by 11/17/14.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta on an estimated three fiberglass wall boards and three metal
entryway doors. Six dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces which are located in sheltered housing. The
affected area covers approximately 15 to 20 percent of the wall surface and 40 to 50 percent of the metal entryway
doors. Sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards. It
indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or health risks. The licensee must
spot clean all surfaces daily and ensure that all surfaces are sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often
if needed. Correct by 11/5/14.
* The facility inspection done on 11/3/14 and exit briefing done on 11/4/14 were conducted with the licensee.
