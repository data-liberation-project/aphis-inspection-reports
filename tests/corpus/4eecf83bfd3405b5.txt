2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During todays inspection a female Golden Retriever "Nicole" was noticed to have a heavy accumulation of crusty
black/brown dry matter adhered to the hair on the top of her head. In addition, the skin underneath appears dull and
flakey in several areas. The facility did identify this issue about a week ago, but has not started any treatment for the
current skin issue. In addition; this facility does not currently have guidance provided in their program of veterinary care
and has not communicated with their veterinarian on the proper course of treatment for this dog. Heath issues that are left
untreated can cause pain and discomfort to the animals. The Licensee must have a a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is
conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
