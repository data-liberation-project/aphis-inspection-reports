ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 100pm on
08/13/2014.
Upon arrival at the facility there was no one there. Contact was made with the licensee by phone who advised that
he was several hours from being able to be back at his facility, due to a work related detail. While Wednesday's
were advised to be the best days to do inspections according to his schedule, on this date the work obligation had
to be done and he could not return for an inspection.
