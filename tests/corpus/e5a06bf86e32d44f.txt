3.50(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** There was a rabbit that was outside of the rabbit box but inside the barn during the inspection. This rabbit belongs
in the enclosure but was able to hop out. The animals shall be contained in an enclosure that is structurally sound
and designed to adequately contain that species to prevent them from being injured or harmed.
3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** In the ring tail lemurs enclosure on the floor there was a pile of old feces that had not been picked up in a couple
of days. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to
prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards. If the species scent mark, the surfaces must be sanitized or
replaced at regular intervals. Contaminated material must be removed or replaced whenever raking and spot
cleaning does not eliminate odors, diseases, insects, pests, or vermin infestation. All other surfaces of housing
facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and
practices. Correct by February 21 ,2017.
3.125(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The enclosure containing the arctic foxes had been penetrated from within on February 9, 2017. The foxes
burrowed out of the enclosure and escaped the facility. They burrowed down beneath their den at least two feet and
out of the enclosure about 3 - 4 feet passed the fence line. Three days later one fox returned with mild seizures and
was treated by the Attending Veterinarian immediately. The second fox returned the next day with a broken right
rear foot which was also treated by the Attending Veterinarian promptly. Five of the remaining foxes have not
returned and the facility has laid traps and bait to attempt to catch them. The facility has revamped the enclosure by
extending the fence vertically 4 - 5 ft below the ground into concrete to prevent the current foxes from escaping. The
facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Curator.
