SANITATION.
In the enclosure housing 10 prairie dogs, there were two dead mice and one dead bird lying near the water
receptacle. Pest control measures must be maintained to prevent pests, i.e. rodents and birds. Effective pest control
measures must be identified and implemented to eliminate breeding and living areas for the birds and mice in order
to minimize exposure to pathogens that may cause illness. The dead bird and mice must be removed from the
enclosure and an effective program for control of rodents and birds must be established and maintained so as to
promote the health and well-being of the animals.
