2.50(b)

Time and method of identification.
7 puppies and 2 adult dogs were not individually identified using an approved form of identification. The facility uses
microchips to identify animals, and these dogs and puppies had not been microchipped. Individual dog identification is
important for recordkeeping and traceability of animals that are lost or stolen. Correct by 10/1/22 by ensuring that all dogs
and cats are identified in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations.
3.1(c)(1)(ii)

Housing facilities, general.
The bottom of a chain link gate for an enclosure housing two puppies was in poor condition. The chain link had been
chewed and broken, resulting in sharp points. The affected area was approximately 6 inches by 4 inches in size, and had
been patched with zip ties and a mesh wire patch. Sharp points from broken chain link can cause scratches, punctures, or
other injuries to dogs nearby. Correct by 10/1/22 by ensuring that enclosures do not contain sharp points that could injure
the animals within.
3.4(b) Repeat

Outdoor housing facilities.
An outdoor enclosure temporarily housing 5 juvenile approximately 3-month-old large breed puppies contains only one
shelter structure which is not large enough to accommodate all of the animals at one time. The shelter structure is a hard


plastic dog house approximately 2 feet wide by 2.5 feet long. Animals without adequate access to shelter may suffer from
exposure to the elements or stress. Correct by ensuring that outdoor enclosures contain enough shelter structures to
permit all animals to sit, stand, and lay in the shelter(s) comfortably at one time.
3.6(b)(4)

Primary enclosures.
Four enclosures, each containing two kittens, did not contain elevated resting surfaces. Elevated resting surfaces are
important for comfort, hygiene, and stress reduction in cats and kittens. Correct by 10/1/22 by ensuring that cats and
kittens have access to an elevated resting surface that is big enough to accommodate all of the cats in the enclosure, and
which is otherwise in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations.
3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Small live ants were present in the bulk container for adult dog food, and were also observed in a bowl of dry cat food in a
kitten enclosure. Ant bait had been placed in the areas but was not effectively preventing ants from getting into the animal
food. Ants and other pests may contaminate food or degrade its quality. Correct by 10/1/22 by maintaining an effective
pest control program.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative. This inspection report is a continuation of
the focused inspection report delivered on 9/12/22, and contains the remaining non-compliances identified during that
inspection.
