ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**While reviewing the records it was noted that the program of veterinary care was not complete. In Section IV,
Other Warm Blooded Animals, Part B (vaccinations) indicates to list the diseases for which the vaccinations are
performed and the frequency of vaccinations, Part C (parasite control program) treatment and sampling, however,
only monthly treatments are indicated. The program of veterinary care should reflect the appropriate vaccinations
and parasite control program for the animals on hand. The program of veterinary care should be updated to
accurately reflect the vaccination and parasite program for the animals. Lack of a complete program of veterinary
care does not ensure that proper veterinary care is being provided in accordance with currently accepted veterinary
medical standards.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**The mat covering the wire mesh flooring in several rabbit enclosures was saturated with urine and dirty wood
shavings. The rabbits have to walk through the wood shavings in order to access the water bowl. The rabbits do
not have a clean surface to lay on or walk through to access food and water. The floor coverings should be
maintained in a manner to allow the rabbits to be clean and dry while in the enclosure.3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**The left side of the doorway to the arena entrance containing numerous goats, sheep, pigs and mini-horses was
missing several cinder blocks exposing insulation and jagged edges. Several animals were observed rubbing
against the fencing material attached to the wall that had protruding wire. Jagged, uneven edges and protruding
wire has the potential to cause injury to animals housed in the area. Indoor facilities housing animals should be
maintained in a manner to contain and protect the animals from injury.

3.126(b) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
**There is a strong smell of ammonia in the area housing the goats, sheep and rabbits. The smell was strongest by
the enclosure housing the sheep and goats. The shavings in the sheep and goat enclosure was soaked with urine
and fecal material. The ammonia level was high enough to cause the inspectors' eyes and throat to burn upon
entering the area. Ammonia at a level that causes irritation to the inspectors' eyes and nasal passages can be
expected to cause similar irritation and discomfort to the animals. Although there was an open door there is no
additional ventilation. This room must be properly ventilated and the source of the ammonia corrected to minimize
odors and provide for the health of the animals.
