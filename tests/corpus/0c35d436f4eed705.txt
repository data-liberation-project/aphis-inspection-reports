INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
One ring-tail lemur is currently being housed indoors and was noted sitting quietly on a resting perch. There are two
small open windows to the indoor area. The temperature inside the building at a height at which the lemur was
sitting was 88.8 degrees F at 10:45 am. The temperature inside at 12:45 pm was 92.4 degrees F. The outdoor
temperature was continuing to climb as a high close to 100 degrees F was predicted for late afternoon. No cooling
mechanisms such as fans, misters or air conditioners were noted in the building. High temperatures can be
uncomfortable to non-human primates and may lead to overheating and other medical issues if prolonged. The
indoor housing facilities must be sufficiently cooled when necessary to protect the non-human primates' health and
well-being and must not rise above 85 degrees F for more than 4 consecutive hours when non-human primates are
present. Correct by June 19, 2015.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The approved environmental enrichment plan addresses special considerations for individually housed non-human
primates by providing toys only. The use of toys satisfies the need for manipulating items and creating noise.
However, social interactions with other non-human primates allow for appropriate complex stimuli that toys alone do
not provide. In accordance with acceptable professional standards, multiple senses should be addressed in
considering an enrichment plan for non-human primates that are housed alone and are unable to see or hear other
non-human primates. The environmental enrichment plan should be updated to reflect current standards for
providing adequate enrichment for non-human primates that are singly housed for their psychological well-being.
