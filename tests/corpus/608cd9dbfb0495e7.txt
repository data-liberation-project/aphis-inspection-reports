3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
**At the time of inspection, there was no written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs. The written program of
veterinary care (PVC) care had not been documented in writing and signed by the attending veterinarian at the time of
inspection. Failure to establish and maintain a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs does not allow for the
facility to provide appropriate treatments and care of the animals. A written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs
must be established and maintained so that the facility has a plan for providing adequate preventative care and
treatments as necessary. The plan must include all of the required components as listed in the Animal Welfare Act and
Animal Welfare Regulations, Part 3, Subpart A, Section 3.13.
