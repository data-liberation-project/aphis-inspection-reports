and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the enclosure must be free of jagged edges, sharp points or open
gaps that may cause injury to the animals. A system of maintenance and repair of enclosures must be in place to
protect and prevent injury to the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The effectiveness of the perimeter fence has been reduced by the placement of an approximately 6 ft high storage,
supply cabinet inside and directly next to an area along the west side of the perimeter fence behind the lion cage.
The area near the perimeter fence must remain clear of items such as storage bins, crates, trailers, etc. that could
facilitate the entry of unauthorized humans or animals, or could allow animals to escape the perimeter fence from
the inside. A system must be in place to ensure the perimeter fence is maintained in an effective manner.Correct by 12/23/2014
