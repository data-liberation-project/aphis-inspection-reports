2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There were 6 litters of puppies less than 16 weeks of age, with and without the females that did not have any
proper identification on the enclosure identifying the female and the number of puppies, or weaned puppies that did
not have any cage card or plastic-type collar that identified the regulated animals with their ID numbers, and USDA
number.
It is important to have all females and their puppies, as well as weaned puppies with proper identification present on
the cages or on the animal for proper care and management of the regulated animals.
The licensee must provide cage cards or plastic-type collars with the proper information according to sec 2.51 for all
puppies less than 16 weeks of age.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There were no puppy records for any of the Shar-pei puppies that were sold privately. While there were 7006
Disposition forms filled out and signed, there was no records of the females or the puppies with their ID numbers
available that would allow for any traceability of the puppies sold.
Complete and updated puppy records should be kept for proper management and care of the regulated animals.
The licensee must provide a record to include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or
under his or her control and provide the information required under this 2.75(a)(1) section.

3.1(c)(3)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The majority of the whelping pens(12) have a large buildup of brown grime around the feeders and inside of the
feeder, as well as a buildup of dirt and grime on the walls of the enclosures. There are several run doors on the east
side of the kennel that have a buildup of dirt and grime on the inside doors where the dogs push with their muzzles
to go outside. While the primary enclosures are being cleaned daily and sanitized every 2 weeks, the walls and
doors need to be scrubbed more frequently and sanitized more often to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime on the
walls, feeders and doors. When dirt and grime are present, the facility is not able to be adequately sanitized
according to AWA regulations and standards.
The buildup of dirt and grime on the surfaces of the walls, doors and feeders can provide a vector for disease and
bacteria to live that could be a source of other possible health issues.
The licensee must clean and sanitize all surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals as often and
necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime.
