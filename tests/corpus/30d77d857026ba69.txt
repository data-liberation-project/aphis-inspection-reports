3.101(a)(1) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A large chunk of the concrete floor, near the drain of the main pool adjacent to the lower viewing window, remains
missing thus leaving the bottom of the pool in disrepair. Repairs to the damaged floor have not been made.
Damaged concrete leaves the pool structurally unsound for the sea lions housed therein.
Housing facilities for marine mammals must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair for the health and
well-being of the animals.
3.101(a)(3) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Rusty drain covers are still present on the "beach" side of the main pool. Rusted materials cannot be sanitized and
pose a potential hazard to the sea lions housed therein. The rusty drain covers have not be removed or replaced.
All surfaces in a primary enclosure must be constructed of durable, nontoxic materials that facilitate cleaning, and
disinfection as appropriate. All facilities must implement a written protocol on cleaning so surfaces do not constitute
a health hazard to animals.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
