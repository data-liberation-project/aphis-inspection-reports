2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care lacked dated evidence that the attending veterinarian had made a regularly
scheduled visit to the premises of the exibitor within a calendar year.
Lack of regularly scheduled visits may result in inadequate veterinary care being provided to the five dogs. A visit
by the attending veterinarian must be documented with the date and signature of the veterinarian and scheduled
within the time frame documented on the program of veterinary care.
