FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing the Golden Tabby Tiger has areas of fencing near the "feed holes" that have excessive rust.
The added on pieces of fencing over the these feed holes are not large enough and may not contain this tiger if the
rust worsens. This entire area of this rusted fencing needs to replaced. Outdoor housing facilities shall be
structurally sound / strength and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain
the animals.
