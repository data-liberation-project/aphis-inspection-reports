Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 PM on
30JUN2022.
I knocked on the door. I was approached in the driveway by a neighbor that told me that the Whetstone family was on
vacation in Ohio until 02JUL2022.
A sorry I missed you flyer was left inside the screen door with directions to contact me.
