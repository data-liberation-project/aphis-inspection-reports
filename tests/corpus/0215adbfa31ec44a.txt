3.137(a)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
At least four holes were present in the expanded metal sheets over the windows in the compartments of the primary
animal transport trailer (South Carolina plate #PV21191). The holes where this metal has been cut or broken leave
sharp edges, most of which are bent outward away from the animal compartments. Sharp protrusions in the
compartments pose a risk of injury to animals contained therein, especially during times of transport. Licensee must
ensure that no sharp edges are present in the primary transport enclosures that pose a risk of injury to the animals.
