(c) Surfaces. (3) Cleaning.
***In the sheltered facility housing six adult dogs, the floors, walls and doors (interior and exterior) of the primary
enclosures and the air conditioner had a build up of dirt and grime. There were at least four enclosures that did not
have dogs in them at the time of inspection and had not been cleaned since the dogs were moved a couple of days
ago. Cleaning of hard surfaces is essential for a healthy environment and reduces disease hazards by eliminating
harboring places for diseases and pests. The licensee must remove the dust, dirt and grime from these areas and
make sure that all hard surfaces are cleaned and sanitized as required.

(e) Storage.
***In the sheltered facility, there was a sack of opened food on the floor by the entrance. Opened food creates an
opportunity for pests, vermin and moisture to contaminate the food. The licensee must place the opened food in a
container with a tight fitting lid and assure that food is stored appropriately as required.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(f) Drainage and waste disposal.
***In the sheltered facility, there was a sack of opened trash leaning up against the puppy enclosures. Trash that is
not contained in a leakproof container with a tight fitting lid attracts pests which increase the risk of disease to the
animals. The licensee must assure that all items of trash are stored as required at all times.
