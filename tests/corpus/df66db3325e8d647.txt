ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
An inspection was attempted at the licensee's home site at 12:30 P.M. on 10/19/2016. An adult (not a
representative of the licensee) at that location stated that the licensee was out of town exhibiting his animals. The
licensee was then contacted by telephone and stated that he was exhibiting his animals in Arizona. At time of this
inspection, no current itinerary has been received by USDA-APHIS-Animal Care that accounts for this travel.
In the case of traveling exhibitors, itineraries must be submitted to USDA via fax, mail, or electronic mail at least two
days prior to any overnight travel. The itinerary should contain complete and accurate information concerning the
whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site.
To be corrected by submission of an itinerary for all future travel in which regulated activities will be conducted.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
