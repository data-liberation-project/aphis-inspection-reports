3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the time of inspection, there was still a lack of perimeter fencing around several outdoor housing enclosures,
which include servals, lynx, and a hyena. Perimeter fencing must be of sufficient height (6 feet) for potentially
dangerous animals. The fencing is important to keep unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from the facility.
Perimeter fences must be properly constructed as a secondary containment so as to protect and contain the
regulated species and prevent unwanted entry by animals and unauthorized persons.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
