FACILITIES, INDOOR.
***There is not adequate ventilation in indoor building #18, housing 218 guinea pigs and 73 rabbits.
The air in the animal room was stuffy and the odor of ammonia caused APHIS personnel’s eyes to water and their
noses to run. While the thermostat in the room noted the temperature to be at 72.0F, the inspector’s Kestrel 4000
found the ambient temperate to be at 79.2F and the humidity at 45%. During the inspection at 12:00 PM, the
majority of the floor was wet, and several small puddles of water were present in different areas of the room. There
was a large central drain that appeared to be functional, however the floor was covered in a layer of water. Facility
staff informed the inspectors that the floor had been cleaned with water and squeegeed at approximately 8:00 AM
that morning.
Strong ammonia odors can cause irritation and discomfort to the animals housed in this room. Fresh air is
necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the guinea pigs and rabbits. Additionally, a lack of air flow can
contribute to moisture condensation. Indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs shall be adequately ventilated to
provide for the health and comfort of the animals at all times. Such facilities shall be ventilated so as to minimize
drafts, odors, and moisture condensation.

3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
***Guinea pigs and rabbits are being placed in primary enclosures that have not been adequately sanitized.
The dirty guinea pig and rabbit enclosures are stacked alongside the clean and sanitized enclosures. APHIS
personnel noticed that many of the dirty cages were in contact with the clean cages. Facility personnel informed the
APHIS inspector that the dirty enclosures are cleaned with a sprayer containing disinfectant and then a manual
steam cleaning occurs. This cleaning process occurs alongside the dirty enclosures and in close proximity to the
clean ones. The current process of cleaning the dirty enclosures is contaminating the already sanitized enclosures,
which are not being sanitized again before being used to house animals. Animal enclosures must be adequately cleaned and sanitized in order to reduce disease transmission and to
provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards. Primary enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often
enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris, provided that such enclosures shall be sanitized at least
once every two weeks in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

FEEDING.
The cement feed troughs in an enclosure with two horses were not clean. There was an accumulation of dried horse
feces and other debris in the troughs. Facility staff informed APHIS personnel that the horses are fed grain out of
these troughs.
Surfaces on which food is placed should be clean so that the food does not become contaminated. Contaminated
food may harbor pathogens and cause disease in the animals. Food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at
all times.

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
***Numerous birds were roosting above the sheep pens. In one pen there was an accumulation of bird feces on the
central light source and in another there was feces covering the metal bars making up one wall of an enclosure.
There was an accumulation of bird feces in the grain troughs.
The presence of pests can cause contamination of the food supply and also lead to health hazards for the animals.
The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of pests to promote the health and
well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in all animal areas.
