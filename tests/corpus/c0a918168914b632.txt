2.1(a)(1) REPEAT
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This is a repeat search inspection.
The facility currently exhibits farm animals (including 12 goats, 5 pot belly pigs and 12 racing pigs) as part of a fall
seasonal Corn Maze and Pumpkin Patch exhibit without a valid USDA license. The facility submitted an application
in 2013 which was returned for incompleteness and never resubmitted. One of the goat enclosures includes a large
multilevel goat walk structure in the enclosure. The public is allowed to pet and feed the animals. Admission is
charged for entrance. A valid license is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals and to comply
with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations. The facility needs to obtain a USDA license or discontinue regulated
activities. Facility has an application packet.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
Exit briefing conducted with undersigned facility representative.
