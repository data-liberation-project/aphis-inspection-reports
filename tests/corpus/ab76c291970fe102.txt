3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Within the enclosure containing six elk and five deer there are metal and wood fence posts, as well as, a long
section of woven wire lying in a pile on the ground. These materials had come from a fence building project in the
animal enclosure. The animals could become entangled in the discarded woven wire resulting in injury. The
unused fence posts can also increase the injury risk to the animals as they move around them.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and facilitate husbandry
practices. Trash and unused materials shall be placed in appropriate areas and cleared from the animal areas to
protect the health of the animals. The facility must store the unused fence posts and woven wire in an appropriate
area away from the animals in order to eliminate the risk of injury and to promote the health and well-being of the
animals. The licensee must ensure that the animal enclosure remains free of unused materials and trash at all
times.
