2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
There was one white rabbit observed to be keeping both eyes partially closed and shedding an excessive amount of
hair as compared to the other rabbits. The rabbit appeared slightly dull when attempts were made to interact with it
during inspection. There is no apparent discharge around the eyes and the rabbit has been eating and drinking
normally according to the owner.
This condition was noticed by the owner when the rabbit arrived at the facility, about a week ago. Although the
owner wishes to remove this rabbit from the colony due to its potential ill health, he is not certain when this will
occur. Veterinary care has not been sought for this rabbit.
Abnormal behavior, including dullness, squinting, and excessive shedding in rabbits can be a sign of underlying
illness. Left untreated, illness can progress and potentially cause significant discomfort to the animal.
Appropriate methods must be used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This includes
consultation of a veterinarian whenever abnormal conditions and behaviors are observed in rabbits.
