2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This was a search inspection.
The owner has sold or received compensation for wild animal sales, loaned out a wild animal, has more than 4
female cats and hedgehogs combined and sells the offspring and adults, and offers sight unseen sales of the cats.
Searches were conducted and the owner was spoken to on 12/13/16 and 3/21/17 in regards to needing a license
when conducting regulated activity. In addition, the owner has been previously licensed with the USDA and is aware
of what constitutes regulated activity.
Conducting regulated activity without a USDA license does not comply with the Animal Welfare Act or ensure that
APHIS officials can assess the care of the animals. The owner must either cease regulated activity or obtain a
license from the USDA to continue conducting regulated activity under the Animal Welfare Act.
No regulated activity may be conducted until USDA license is obtained.
End of report.
