ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the indoor housing facility there are three bottles of drugs on top of a sink along the back of the building. One
bottle that has a needle and syringe sticking out of it does not have a label. Licensee stated the bottle contained a
mixture of ivermectin and alcohol. Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to
ensure that the contents of the container can be known with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses and
medications are not used past their expiration dates. As part of the adequate program of veterinary care, the
licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian and ensure that all medications at the facility are labeled with
the medications, the dosage instructions and expiration dates. The licensee must also ensure the veterinarian has
approved the use of any medications that have not been approved for use in dogs to ensure the proper dosing and
administration is accomplished. This must be added to the program of veterinary care at the facility.
