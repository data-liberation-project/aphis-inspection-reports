ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***I called the facility at 11:00 am on 02/12/2014. The partner called me back to let me know that he was unable to
be at the facility until 3:00 pm. I let him know that if no one was available and I couldn't do the inspection that it
would be an attempted inspection. I told the facility to call me when they got to the facility. The partner never called
me back to come do the inspection. A responsible adult was not available and shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
