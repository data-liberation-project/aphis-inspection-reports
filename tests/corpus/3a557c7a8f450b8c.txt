Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total 374 guinea pigs were counted during this
inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of adults, weanlings, and newborns held or on hand or
the number of guinea pigs that died in the last few months. Failure to keep and maintain records including births and
deaths makes it difficult to track changes in production, losses due to death, and to assess the animal care program.
Licensee must ensure that records are kept and maintained on guinea pigs held, owned, sold, including births and deaths,
to help keep track of animals, document changes in ownership, and to assess the animal care program. Remains
uncorrected.
3.28(c)(1)(iii) Repeat

Primary enclosures.
Space. Insufficient space was being provided in three enclosures housing weanling guinea pigs. Enclosures measured 32
inches by 48 inches or 1536 square inches of floor space. These three enclosures were housing 33 to 35 guinea pigs
each. Weanling guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams require at least 60 square inches of floor space per animal. Can
not house more than 25 guinea pigs in this size enclosure.

Inadequate floor space can increase stress, aggression, and disease risks in animals. Licensee must ensure that guinea

pigs are provided with at least the minimum amount of floor space per animal to prevent stress and discomfort. Remains
uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
