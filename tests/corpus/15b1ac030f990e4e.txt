Watering.
Three enclosures had water bottles with dark green material adhered to the bottles’ interior sides and tops. These bottles
provided the only water source for the animals housed in these enclosures. Dirty water bottles with algae growing in them
can be sources of bacteria that is detrimental to animal health and the water may not be potable. Water receptacles must
be kept clean to ensure animal welfare.

Correction: The facility removed the dirty bottles at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
