ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On inspection, the Program of Veterinary Care included treatment and husbandry protocols for all animals except
the rabbit on site. All animals should be provided with adequate veterinary care by an attending veterinarian. A
written program of veterinary care for the rabbit should be established by the exhibitor and the attending
veterinarian. This will ensure that disease can be prevented and controlled for the rabbit.
