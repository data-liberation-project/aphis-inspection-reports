ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
An individually housed juvenile (approximately six months of age) ring-tailed lemur was housed at the facility. The
facility representative stated that the attending veterinarian had been contacted about the acquisition of the animal
and the need of a environment enhancement plan. The animal has been on site for approximately three months
and no approved plan was in place at the time of the inspection.
The lack of appropriate environment enrichment, including special considerations for infants and young juveniles,
and individual housing, can impact the growth and psychological well-being of a nonhuman primate. All dealers and
exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to
promote psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently
accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed
by the attending or species specific veterinarian. This plan must be made available to APHIS upon request.
