ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:50 p.m. on
12-Jul-17.
In addition to waiting 30 minutes, I called the phone number provided, knocked on the house door and honked my
vehicle horn.
