ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following animals are in need of nail/hoof care. The mule deer, Bambi, has overgrown hooves on all four feet
including an abnormal curvature of the rear dewclaws. A black pig, Tiny, has overgrown hooves on all four feet. A
brown, female llama has slightly overgrown toenails of both hind feet with abnormal curvature of the lateral nails.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Inside the food storage trailer, there was an open bag of a feed additive (Diatomaceous Earth) used for covered
species. There was an accumulation of dirt and debris on food storage shelves, on the floor and on walls adjacent
to bags of feed. Also several cobwebs were noted on the ceiling and in corners above stored food.
-There were several, stacked bales of hay which were not adequately covered or protected by the existing tarp.
There has been steady rain the past few days in the local area which may potentially cause molding and
deterioration of the hay.
Supplies of food or food supplements must be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration, molding or contamination by pests to ensure the health and well-being of all animals. A system of food
storage which adequately protects the supplies of food for all animals must be in place.

SANITATION.
-A kitchen and an adjacent room with animal medical supplies had an excessive accumulation of rodent feces on
the floor, along baseboards of walls, in corners, and behind cabinets.
-There were several areas of bird feces within a food storage trailer including on the floor, on the outside of bags of
feed and bedding, on a wooden, platform shelf as well as inside an open container of a bird diet. During inspection,
a few, free-roaming chickens attempted to enter the food storage trailer once the door was left open.
Control of all pests including vermin and avian is needed to reduce contamination and potential disease hazards
and to promote the health and well-being of the animals. An effective program of pest control must be established
and maintained.
