2.40(a)(1) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee does not have a formal arrangement with an attending veterinarian, nor a written program of veterinary care.
The licensee advised they have found a veterinarian, however the paperwork and formal agreement has not been
completed nor confirmed.

It is important to have a formal arrangement and written program of veterinary care to protect the regulated animals at the
facility.

Each dealer and exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time
attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary
care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer or exhibitor.
2.75 Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The complete 2020-2021 acquisition, disposition, birth and broker records for the facility were not available during the
time of the inspection. The licensee has started updating the records, a partial inventory was available, however it was
missing the 'acquired from' addresses. There were some disposition on several kittens sold and a coati, however the

majority of records still need to be found and recorded in a manner inspectors can review.

The lack of updated and proper records can prevent proper management and traceability of the regulated animals coming
and going at the facility.

All records must be made available to the inspector at the time of inspection for proper tracking of the animals arriving or
leaving the facility, including all of the births and deaths. A broker is required to have all of their buying, selling and
donating activities documented in order to assist with traceability or disease monitoring and management.
2.131(a) Repeat

Handling of animals.
The licensee acquired 2 tigers and 2 cougars for exhibition over the past two years. All licensees who maintain wild/exotic
animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of those animals. There have been many dangerous
incidents, documented in previous inspection reports, that prove a lack of the necessary knowledge and experience.

Since the acquisition of these dangerous animals, the licensee has not taken steps to gain the acquired knowledge, other
than having a person with tiger cub experience at the facility for a short time and talking with other licensees. The
licensee can bring an experienced person (with these species) to the facility or go to other facilities and work with them to
gain the required knowledge/experience.

Lack of the required knowledge/experience is dangerous for the licensee/volunteers/public and the animals and could
result in serious injury or death in any of those groups.


All licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the species
they maintain.
3.11(b)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There are two kittens being held in a storage room with a cement floor between the coati and lemur enclosures. The room
was full of dirty buckets, barrels, gas can, chainsaw and pet carriers. The floor had dirt and debris throughout the room.
There were no clean surfaces that the cats had contact with that were sanitized.

The lack of proper sanitization and cleanliness of the primary enclosure for the regulated animals can be a possible
source of discomfort and possible health issues.

All surfaces that come in contact with the cats must be made of materials impervious to moisture and sanitized at least
once ever two weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt and debris.

The licensee cleaned the room for the cats after the inspection and before the exit interview.
3.75(c)(1) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
There are surfaces in multiple non-human primate primary enclosures that are made of unsealed wood materials. There is
a buildup of old food, oils or dirt and debris that is soaked into the well-used areas of some of the wood surfaces. It is
impossible to clean/sanitize unsealed wood surfaces. The inside wooden walls and upper wooden beams of the Albifron,
Snow Macaque (Dexter), Rufffed Lemur and Ring-tailed Lemurs need to be sealed. The shelves and perches of the ruffed
lemur and four Ring-tailed Lemurs have not been sealed and are made of raw wood. The ropes in Dexter's inside shelter

area are dark black and brown with grime and need to be cleaned or replaced.

Unsealed wood or surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be cleaned and sanitized properly. If they cannot
be cleaned and sanitized appropriately, they must be replaced. Soiled surfaces can be a source of bacteria and cause
possible health related issues if not cleaned or replaced regularly.

The surfaces of housing facilities - including perches, shelves, swings, boxes, houses, dens, and other furniture-type
fixtures or objects within the facility - must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily
cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.
3.127 Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The eight-foot perimeter fence surrounding the facility is still under construction. The South and East sides of the facility
are still completely open with no fence structure to prevent animals from escaping the property. The North and NW part of
the property has a six-foot perimeter fence, with the SW part of the property having an eight-foot wooden fence behind the
tiger, cougar, macaque and porcupine enclosures.

The cougar wooden fence on the SW side that uses the perimeter fence as the primary enclosure wall has gaps at the
bottom up to 2 inches in some areas between the bottom of the fence and the cement footing. This amount of space
allows for the possibility of people on the outside of the fence to put their fingers or hands under the fence and make
contact with the cougars. There is a gap under the entry gate of the cougar enclosure (approx. 2inches) that could allow
for a cougar to reach under the door and make contact with a worker in the walkway area.


An eight-foot perimeter fence is required for the two cougar and two tigers that are in outdoor primary enclosures on the
facility property due to being considered dangerous animals.

There is no six-foot perimeter fence completely surrounding the non-dangerous animals as required. This requirement is
for animals such as the three badgers (bottom of the perimeter fence is not secured and open for animals to get under),
the two coati, Geoffroy's cat, bobcat and non-human primates. While a six-foot perimeter fence and partial eight-foot
perimeter fence surround over half the facility, the remaining South and East sides are open which can allow any of these
animals to escape if they get out of their primary enclosures, and allow other animals or people to gain entry into the
facility and make direct contact with the enclosures.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
There were multiple areas around the facility that had an excessive amount of flies. The lynx indoor shelter room had
dirt/debris, meat and cobwebs that attracted numerous flies inside the shelter along the walls and door window and food
area. The areas around the tigers, cougars and Geoffrey's cat had excessive flies around the outside of the enclosures.
There was no form of pest control being used at the facility to try and control the fly population.

Uncontrolled fly or pest populations can be a source of harassment, discomfort and possible disease for the regulated
animals that cannot escape the areas infested with these pests.

A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained.


The licensee put up numerous fly bait stations throughout the property within 24hrs after the inspection and before the exit
interview.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
