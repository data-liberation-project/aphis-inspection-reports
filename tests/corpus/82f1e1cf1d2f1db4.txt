PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The two lemur enclosures (one housing one lemur, "Lola", and another housing two lemurs, "Jack" and "Jill") had
wooden floors that had areas of rotten and worn wood that was breaking apart. The pen housing "Lola" was much
more severely affected. There were holes in the floor, splintered wood and exposed nail heads which create a risk
of injury to the lemurs. Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the
nonhuman primates from injuring themselves. The floors must be repaired or replaced.
