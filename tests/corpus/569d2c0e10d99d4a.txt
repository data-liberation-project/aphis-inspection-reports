3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
This facility does not have a complete perimeter fence. Facilities that house dangerous animals must have a
perimeter fence not less than 8 feet high. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the
facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the
animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. It
must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals
inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such fences less than 3 feet in distance
from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
This facility is in the middle of a residential area and next to a school. The lack of a perimeter fence allows contact
with the animals in some areas which could be dangerous to both children/adults and the resident animals. A
complete perimeter fence must be installed or written approval for lack of a perimeter fence must be obtained from
the Administrator.
