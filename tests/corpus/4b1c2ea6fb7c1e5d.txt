HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***On Saturday, July 15, 2016 in the late morning, a patron gained access to a restricted area through an open gate
and was injured by the Himalayan bear. During the cleaning of the bear enclosure, the gate leading to the
secondary containment area was left open. As the caretaker was hosing down the bear enclosure, a member of the
public entered the area and reached her hand into the bear enclosure to pet it. The bear reacted by grabbing her
arm and possibly biting. The patron sustained non-life threatening injuries. The bear was un-harmed.
Leaving the barrier / perimeter fence gate open during public exhibition allowed a member of the public to come in
direct contact with the Himalayan bear resulting in an injury. The integrity of a barrier / perimeter fence must be
maintained to prevent the public from coming in direct contact with the bear. Standard operating procedures for the
securing of gates and entry into the secondary containment area for the Himalayan bear enclosure must be
modified and followed for the safety of the bear and the public. Correct immediately.
This is a focused inspection. The exit briefing was conducted with the owners.
