3.80(b)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Approximately one week before the inspection, the licensee brought all the nonhuman primates in from their
outdoor enclosures to a heated barn due to the cold weather. The licensee is near completion of constructing a
second, heated barn since the one does not have enough space to house all the licensee's birds and primates.
Due to space constraints in the barn, the licensee housed one pair of adult ring-tailed lemurs in a medium-sized dog
travel crate and another pair of ring-tailed lemurs (with an infant) in a large dog travel crate. The medium crate was
21 inches tall and provided 2.9 square feet of floor space. The large crate provided 5.1 square feet of floor space
and was 30 inches tall. Adult lemurs are required to be housed in enclosures which are at least 30 inches tall and
provide each adult with at least 3 square feet of floor space. Therefore, the medium crate was too small and too
short for even one ring-tailed lemur. The large crate provided the minimum amount of space required for one lemur,
but did not provide adequate space for the two adults housed in it. Primates require sufficient space to allow them
to make normal postural adjustments for their health and well-being.
** The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures provide each nonhuman primate with the minimum floor space
and height required by the regulations. Specifically, each ring-tailed lemur must have at least 3.0 square feet of
floor space (6.0 square feet if there are two adults) and at least 30 inches of height in their primary enclosures. TO
BE CORRECTED BY: 24 November 2014.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(b) Shelter from inclement weather.
* A camel, zedonk, and some of the goats had tall, metal shelter structures which were two-sided with an overhead
roof. Many of the other animals housed outdoor had three-sided lean-to shelter structures. Many of the three-sided
structures had at least one of the three walls not fully intact, resulting in nearly half a wall missing in some cases.
This was the case for the shelter provided for two older, recently sheared alpacas observed shivering at the time of
inspection. Temperatures in the area during the past week were below freezing and reached a low of 10 degrees
Fahrenheit the night before the inspection. Wind speeds in the area during the past week reached a high of 26mph. Shelter structures with less than 3 solid sides do not provide adequate protection from inclement weather.
Inadequate protection from the elements can result in great discomfort to the animals and/or health issues such as
hypothermia or death.
** The licensee must ensure all animals have appropriate shelters to protect them from inclement weather and to
prevent discomfort. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 11 December 2014.
3.130 DIRECT
WATERING.
* The drinking water in nearly all the outdoor enclosures was frozen solid. Many of the animals were observed
hovering over and around the water receptacles, pawing, striking, and licking at ice chunks. Some of the buckets
measured 13 inches in height with the solid ice chunks measuring 11 inches. There were no ice chunks present
near the water receptacles to indicate there had been recent watering activity. Upon request by the inspectors, the
ice was dumped and fresh water was provided for two different enclosures housing multiple goats. The goats
immediately crowded around the water and were observed head butting and shoving each other to gain access to
the water. One goat drank the fresh water for over two minutes. Another goat drank the fresh water for over five
and a half minutes. Drinking for this long indicates the animals were excessively thirsty and most likely very
dehydrated. Even in cold temperatures, animals must have access to adequate amounts of water to stay hydrated
and healthy.
** The licensee must ensure potable water is provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the
animals. TO BE CORRECTED BY: All animals were provided with fresh water at the time of inspection.
The inspection and an exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
