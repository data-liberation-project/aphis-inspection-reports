3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
At least 25 enclosures housing 25 skunks have gaps between the wire outdoor portion of the enclosure and the wooden
nest box.
One enclosure housing one racoon has a gap between the wire floor and wire side.
The gaps in these enclosures are large enough that a foot could easily fall through and get caught and cause injury to an
animal. The enclosures must be repaired or modified to eliminate the gaps.

One enclosure containing 4 ferrets has sharp points created by the broken flooring.
One enclosure containing 3 skunks has sharp points around the opening to the nest box where the wire mesh outer
enclosure attaches to the nest box.
These sharp points could cause injury to the animals. The enclosures must be repaired or modified to eliminate the sharp
points.

All of the above structural issues were corrected by the applicant at the time of inspection.



This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class "B” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant. All items must be in compliance within two more inspections or by March 28, 2022, or the applicant will forfeit
the license fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License
inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
