ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are 3 goats that are limping when they were walking in the pasture near the barn. One white and brown
buck, one dark brown and one brown with white head goat were favoring their front left limbs while walking.
According to the facility representative accompanying me during this inspection these goats have no received
veterinary care. It was stated that these goats sustained injuries from jumping out of their pasture. For the health
and welfare of these goats they need to be seen by the attending veterinarian.
This exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

The partial roll of hay on the ground in the goat and sheep pasture does not have a cover over it to protect it from
