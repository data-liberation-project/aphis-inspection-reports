(a) Structural strength.
The enclosure containing 2 Siberian Lynx and the enclosure containing the two Servals have wire over the tops of
their habitat type caging. Leaves, small branches, and debris, has fallen on the top of these enclosures creating a
sag in the wire over the top portion of the cage. This sagging from the weight of these wet leaves, branches, could
allow for the wire to be pullded out or loosened from its connection leaving a structural strength issue and a
possible escape avenue. The enclosure must be structurally sound and maintained to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
To be corrected by December 27th, 2014.

EMPLOYEES.
An untrained person was allowed to work as a volunteer with the cats (Lynx, Serval, Caracal). This agreement was
set up by the caretaker of the animals, unknown to the owner of the facility. The volunteer, having unlocked two
gates to receive access to the lynx, unknowingly to the caretaker, entered the enclosure. The lynx scratched the
head of the volunteer with its claw. Paramedics were called. No treatment was required and the volunteer was
treated and released at the scene. The caretaker, who allowed the untrained, unauthorized, person to be at the
facility, has been relieved of his position. Correction, with the firing of the Caretaker, the situation has been handled.
All employees must be trained in proper safety measures and volunteers are to work directly under supervision.
No records were reviewed at the time of this inspection.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted by the ACI, with the facility representative.
