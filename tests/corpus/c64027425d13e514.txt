Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
Review of the November 2021 auction records show that one of the auction's principals sold a male capybara (tag 014)
and another of the auction's principals sold a neutered male kinkajou (091). The inspector was told that these animals
were purchased at another out of state auction facility by the principals. No acquisition records were available to confirm
the acquisition at the out of state auctions. The inspector was told that the records may be in the principal's truck. Each
dealer shall have all records including all required acquisition information available to allow APHIS officials to examine
records required to be kept by the Act. Correct by Dec. 31, 2021.

This records inspection and exit interview were conducted with one of the auction representatives.
