Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
There were no reviews of the facility’s Animal Care and Use Program, nor IACUC inspections of the facility’s animal
facilities, since the activation of this site in September 2021.

It is essential that Program Reviews and reports be completed on time (regardless of animal use activity frequency) in
order to help ensure the humane care and use of animals at the facility. The IACUC’s review of the facility’s Program for
humane care and use of animals (including animal facilities and animal study areas) and animal activities must be
conducted at least once every six months in order to ensure appropriate care and use of research animals and to ensure
facilities are compliant and appropriate for conducting animal teaching or research. This Program Review and associated
reports need to be completed, presented to the Institutional Official (IO) and made available to APHIS in order to ensure
the Program is monitored regularly, that the status and findings are communicated in writing to the IO, and to help the
inspector evaluate the Program.
