Handling of animals.
An accident during the handling of a male capybara resulted with a fracture of the animal's leg. The capybara was given
a sedative through training for veterinary examination while inside its enclosure. As per facility staff, shortly after the
injection, the animal reacted by running towards the staff and jumped into the empty exhibit pool before anyone could
capture it. Veterinary staff were present and provided immediate treatment to the animal. Handling of animals shall be
done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause physical harm.

Sanitation.
The facility noted four instances of nuisance raccoons inside the capybara enclosure within a three week timespan.
During this time, the facility was solely providing for pest control provisions on an in-house-basis. The male capybara
sustained injuries from interactions with the raccoons that required veterinary consultation. Nuisance raccoons can carry
diseases and injure animals. Assure effective provisions to control the nuisance raccoons are in place.


Note: Since these instances, the facility has contracted with a pest control company and they have not had issues with
nuisance raccoons.

The inspection was conducted with the Conservation Education Curator. The exit interview was conducted with the
General Curator, Deputy Zoo Director, Executive Zoo Director, Zoo Managers and Conservation Education Curator.
