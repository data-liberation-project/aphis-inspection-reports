PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The over-laid wire mesh that is between the two spider monkeys has been pulled away at the top right corner. The
male spider monkey was observed pulling at it during the inspection and has also pulled the structural wire mesh off
the support post in this same area. The mesh needs to be re-attached and the corner of the structural mesh
re-attached to the support post. Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so that
they are structurally sound for the species of nonhuman primates contained in them.
