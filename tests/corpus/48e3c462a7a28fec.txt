ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was no veterianary care documentation on the newly aquired cougar, patas monkey and young red kangaroo
during this inspection. It is not known if the recommeded vaccines and TB tests were administered, including
parasite prevention The newly acquired animals are not being quarantined. I observed the red kangaroo having
white eyes around its pupils. The care takers states it has cataracts and will be treated soon, however no vet care
documentation was available during this inspection. The written program of vet care states parasite prevention
(fenbendazole) for fleas, tickes, and mites will be given monthly for all animals. No documentation nor the product
was available during this inspection. Vet care documentation for all USDA regulated animals needs to be made
available during inspections to ensure adequate vet care is being provided. According to the attending veterinarian
new animals need to be quarantined for 30 days to prevent the spread of any diseases and parasites to other
animals and persons. Each Exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that
include: the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The red kangaroo does not have barriers between the animal and the general viewing public as to assure the safety
of the public. During this inspection I attempted to pet the kangaroo and it nipped at my fingers. Since there is a
possibility this kangaroo may bite members of the public, there needs to be a barrier surrounding this enclosure.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm the public.
TO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY.
2.131(d)(3)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The adult female cougar is not under the direct control and supervision of a knowledgeable and experience animal
handler. Of the two care takers present, it was stated one has worked around large felids several times and theother handler none. The care takers were not aware of the contengency plan - in case of an emergency where this
cougar needed vet care or of an escape - transporting. At least one of these care taker should have adequate
knowledge and experience with large felids - potentially dangerous animals. The licensee was not available during
this inspection to review any written documention of experience with these employees. During public exhibition,
dangerous animals must be under the direct control and supervision of a knowledgeable and experienced animal
handler.
TO CORRECT BY: IMMEDIATELY

3.81(b)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The environment enhancement plan for cage complexities and foraging is not being followed to promote the
psychological well-being of the nonhuman primates. During this inspection I observed non-human primates sitting
without environmental enrichment - cage complexities and foraging. One of the Macaque enclosures has a swing,
but it was either not set up or broken. The lemurs are able to move on branch type object, but no other cage
complexities enrichment is being provided. When the fair opens, the public are allowed to place feed into a tube
which enters the non primate enclosures. However, there needs to be different foraging / task-oriented feeding for
these non human primates. There were just a two toys for enrichment available during this inspection. The written
plan should address the different task-oriented feeding methods and cage complexities being provided for each
species and documented to ensure its being followed.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: MARCH 9, 2015.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The chain-link primary enclosure housing the adult female cougar is not structurally sound to protect it from injury
and contain this animal. This enclosure is placed on top of the grass surface without being secured. During the
inspection I was able to move the enclosure including picking it up off the ground. To ensure this cougar does not
escape this enclosure, it needs to be secure to the ground.
TO CORRECT BY: IMMEDIATELY. 3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
I was not able to review the diet for the newly acquired adult female cougar. The care taker stated that cougars
food was in the transport truck, however it was locked and the licensee was not available. No written plan for the
cougar was available during this inspection.. To ensure this cougar is being provided a complete nutritive value
diet, the feed and written diet needs to be made available during USDA inspections. This non compliance was cited
during the March 20, 2014, inspection.
3.137(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
During this inspection, I was unable to inspect the primary transport enclosure for the newly acquired adult female
cougar to ensure its in compliance. The care taker stated the large plastic veri kennel being used for the red
kangaroo on exhibit will be the cougars transport kennel. The kennel needs to have its front door attached and
placed in the transport trailer to ensure its structural strength during transport and can withstand the normal rigors
of transportation.
TO BE CORRECTED BEFORE TRANSPORTING COUGAR

3.137(c)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
During this inspection, I was unable to inspect the primary transport enclosure for the newly acquired adult femalecougar because it does not have its front door attached. To ensure there is adequate space for this cougar during
transport, it needs to be inspected with her inside the primary enclosure.
TO BE CORRECTED PRIOR TO TRANSPORTATION
This inspection was conducted with the care takers and the exit interview with the licensee on March 5, 2015, at the
Lee County Fair, North Fort Myers, Florida. Prior to inspection no itinerary was on file. Itineraries must be sent to
the eastern regional office and updated as often as needed.
