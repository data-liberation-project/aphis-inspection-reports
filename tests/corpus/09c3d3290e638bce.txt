HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several primate housing areas are excessively dirty, with spiderwebs, rodent feces, and dirt. These include the
male baboon, vervets, and DeBrazza housing. The dirty areas include the interior walls of the wooden shelters
which contain metal wire enclosures for the primates. Although the primates cannot contact most of these areas,
they are part of the primate housing and must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to meet generally accepted
husbandry standards. To be corrected by 2-24-17.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Mice feces was found in multiple areas throughout the commissary with large amounts on the floor along the wall
behind the refrigerators. A live mouse was seen on a shelf containing feed bags. Two bait boxes were empty.
Rodent holes were also seen around several enclosures. Although there is a pest control program in place, it is not
currently being effective. Rodent control measures need to be established and maintained in order to decrease the
likelihood of disease transmission from wild rodents. To be corrected by 2-24-17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with owner and curator.
