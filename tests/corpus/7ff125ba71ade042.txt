3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The perimeter fence needs to be addressed by the coyote enclosures. There is a section of the wood post that is
warped and beginning to rot at the bottom of the chain link. In addition there is a section of chain link that is
damaged and sagging down affecting the height requirement of the fencing. This fence needs to be repaired so that
it maintains structural integrity to restrict animals and unauthorized persons from going through, and so that it can
function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
