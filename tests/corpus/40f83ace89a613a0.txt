ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Licensee stated that euthanasia by gunshot was the routine form of euthanasia for the facility. Licensee also said
that they were under the impression from their veterinarian, that it was acceptable and he had written it on the old
Program of Veterinary Care, which the inspector did not see. The current Program of Veterinary Care states that a
lethal injection by the veterinarian is the facilities routine form of euthanasia. The inspector explained to licensee
that gunshot is an unacceptable form of routine euthanasia.
Euthanasia by gunshot can cause unnecessary pain and distress to the dog. According to the 2013 AVMA
(American Veterinary Medical Association) Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals, gunshot is not an acceptable
routine form of euthanasia for dogs. The licensee agreed to stop using gunshot and will use lethal injection by
veterinarian as the facilities routine form of euthanasia.
