FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing two pigs is made of wire fencing with wooden boards at the bottom and top. The wire
fencing is not secured to the wooden board on all sides. On the side shared with the goat/sheep pen, the wire is
loose enough that it could be an injury hazard if the pigs try to get under it or root near it. The fencing should be
constructed and maintained in a manner that prevents injury and escape of the animals. Correct by 10/29/15.
Exit conducted with facility representative.
