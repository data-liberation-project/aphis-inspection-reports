Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were at least four adult rabbits that had long toenails. This included two orange Netherland Dwarf rabbits and two
chestnut-colored rabbits. Some of the toenails were approximately an inch long and were starting to curl on both front
and/or rear feet of the rabbits. The long nails could get caught in the wire flooring of the enclosures. The licensee must
trim the toenails of these animals to ensure that the animals can move normally and prevent the potential for injury. As
part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must establish and follow a program of regular toenail
maintenance for all the animals to prevent the overgrowth of toenails. To be corrected by: March 23, 2022

There were at least 2 adult rabbits heard and/or observed to be repeatedly sneezing during the inspection. One of the
rabbits was a female orange Netherland Dwarf (#5) observed with a small amount of white to light green mucous like
material, possibly nasal discharge, in the fur around the nose. Another rabbit was a female orange Netherland Dwarf (#6)
observed sneezing. Both rabbits also had long toenails as described above. The licensee’s Program of Veterinary Care
did not instruct on treatment for these animals’ conditions. The licensee was also not aware of their conditions which
could be due to infection, illness or other veterinary medical condition. The licensee must consult with a licensed


veterinarian in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that
the treatment plan is followed. To be corrected by: March 19, 2022
3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
There was a heavy accumulation of dirt, grime and fecal material within several of the guinea pig enclosures. This
accumulation of material was located mostly at the front of the enclosures on the solid flooring where the animals
accessed their self-feeders and automatic waterers. The buildup of grime and fecal material also appeared wet mostly in
areas underneath the waterers. Most of the animals were observed towards the back of their enclosures with cleaner/drier
appearing bedding; however, some animals were observed walking through the waste material to get to their food. There
was also a buildup of dirt, debris, and grime along the side walls of some of these enclosures. Accumulations of food
waste, bedding, and fecal material were also observed in piles on the floor directly in front of occupied enclosures. Failure
to properly clean and sanitize primary enclosures can attract pests, odors and potential disease hazards. The licensee
must establish and maintain a program to ensure that primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough, but not
less than every two weeks, to prevent an accumulation of dirt and debris. To be corrected by: March 23, 2022
3.53(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
There were sharp points present on several of the rabbit enclosures constructed of wire material. Multiple long pointed
wire ends were located around the access doors as well as the surrounding door frames of their enclosures. In some
enclosures, the wire ends were covered so that some or all of the sharp points were not exposed; however, many wire
ends were not covered and sharp points were exposed. Some of the exposed wire ends were approximately 1 inch in
length. One rabbit was observed sticking her head in the gap between the access door and the surrounding frame which
allowed her to come into contact with several long sharp wire ends from both the door and the surrounding bent upper


frame. Sharp points increase the risk of injury to the animals. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury, to contain them, and to keep predators
out at all times. To be corrected by: March 30, 2022
3.56(c)

Sanitation.
Within the indoor building housing rabbits there was a buildup of hair, debris, and grime. Approximately 20 rabbit
enclosures had an excessive amount of hair on the tops, fronts and/or sides of their enclosures. A buildup of hair, debris
and grime was also present on and around the water lines and self-feeders in front of the rabbit enclosures. A heavy
accumulation of white to green material, that appeared to be mineral deposits, was also present around some of the
automatic water nozzles where the animals access their water. The buildup of hair, debris and grime increases the risk of
disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that the premises remain clean in order to protect the health of the animals
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. To be corrected by: March 30, 2022

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
