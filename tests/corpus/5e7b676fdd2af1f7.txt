WATERING.
There were at least 5 enclosures with dirty water bowls at time of inspection. The water in the bowls was discolored
with brown debris from shavings and excreta. Animals were observed drinking the dirty, brown water during
inspection. Water for guinea pigs must be clean and potable and provided daily unless food supplements consumed
by the animals supplies their normal water requirements. Open containers such as water bowls must be placed in
enclosures that minimizes the contamination from excreta. Water that contains dirty bedding and excreta can
expose the guinea pigs to disease hazards and problems. Correct by ensuring that potable water is offered as often
as necessary to ensure the health of the animals and at least daily. Additionally, ensure that watering receptacles
are free from contamination and are properly sanitized when dirty. Correct by November 30, 2017.
