HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Condition and site.
The area in the three sided shelter used to store feed has a pile of empty feed sacks on the floor. This can attract
pests and provide a place for rodents to nest and breed. The empty feed sacks need to be removed from the facility
and disposed of properly to reduce nesting areas for rodents and to demonstrate proper husbandry practices. All
housing facilities and areas used for storing animal food and bedding must be free of accumulations of trash and
discarded materials.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces.
The wooden shelter being used by an adult male Boston terrier and female beagle has been scratched and or
chewed by the dogs around the front entrance and inside. Paint is also flaking or peeling off exposing bare wood.
The worn surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. This can create disease hazards and affect the health
and well being of the dogs.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities including houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced
when worn or soiled.
3.4(b)(3) DIRECT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At the time of inspection the inspector's Kestrel device recorded an outdoor air temperature of 34.3 degrees
Fahrenheit. According to the National Weather Service the low temperature for tonight will be around 14 degrees
Fahrenheit. Within the outdoor housing facility there is a shelter being occupied by an adult male Boston terrier and
a female beagle. There is no wind and rain break at the entrance of the shelter.
An outdoor enclosure containing three beagles has a shelter that also does not have a wind and rain break.
Lack of wind and rain breaks does not provide protection from the elements. All shelters being used must beprovided a wind and rain break at the entrance.

3.4(b)(4) DIRECT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Within the outdoor housing facility there is an enclosure containing an adult male Boston terrier and a female
beagle. The shelter being used does not contain any bedding material. Both dogs are periodically shivering slightly
for a few seconds at a time.
Failure to provide clean dry bedding within dog shelters does not ensure the animals can remain warm and dry
during low temperatures which can lead to health hazards for the animals. Shelters for dogs must contain clean, dry
bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Additional clean, dry bedding is
required when the temperature is 35 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. Sufficient bedding material needs to be provided
for all outdoor shelters being used.
Corrected at time of inspection.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The licensee stated the excreta in the primary enclosures in the outdoor housing area are scraped out of the
enclosures on a daily basis. However, all of the used enclosures have not been sanitized within the last two weeks.
Not cleaning and sanitizing the enclosures on a regular basis can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. Used
primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every two
weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other
disease hazards.


3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are bird droppings on the inside and outside of a food receptacle being used by one dog in the outdoor
housing area. There are also several areas of bird droppings on the pens being used in the kennel area.
Surfaces caked with bird droppings cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. This can also create disease hazards
that can affect the health and well being of the dogs. An effective program for the control of birds must be
established and maintained to reduce the contamination by pests in animal areas. The licensee must remove all
bird droppings from the kennel area.
