3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are least 3 plastic dog shelters that have chewed, jagged edges present around their openings. Jagged
surfaces can trap debris and pathogens and contribute to disease transmission. All surfaces must be maintained on
a regular basis so surfaces can be readily cleaned and sanitized.
3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is a board that is pulled away from the post that now has 3 nail points exposed. Sharp points can potentially
cause injury to the dogs. All surfaces must be constructed in a manner so there are no sharp points present.
