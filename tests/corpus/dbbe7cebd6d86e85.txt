3.138(a) CRITICAL
PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
The facility transported mink on July 13, 2018. Four mink died in transit and one wasn't healthy upon arrival and
was humanely euthanized. Necropsy findings on the euthanized mink and one of the passed mink supported heat
stress to have been likely. The animals were transported within a trailer ventilated with ambient air. Heat stress
indicates ambient conditions likely were too warm for the affected animals. The facility must ensure that transport
methods used will protect animals' health and ensure the safety and comfort of the animals at all times.
Note: The facility recognized this incident and reported it to the IACUC. The IACUC has reviewed the incident and
noted the importance of monitoring climate conditions prior to transport and the need to plan accordingly. Ensure
corrective actions are taken to prevent further occurrences.
