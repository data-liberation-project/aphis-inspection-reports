2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female lion cub named "Lucie", approximately 8 months old, was found to be severely lame, uncomfortable, and
unwilling to stand at the time of inspection. At the time of the last inspection on 4/27/17 the cub was exhibiting
some lameness in its hindquarters, and had a history of intermittent lameness in the front as well. The exhibitor was
asked to have a diagnostic work up completed by a veterinarian who is experienced with this species, by 5/1/17.
Radiographs and blood work were completed by that date, but the results were inconclusive. The animal is currently
unwilling to stand, and clearly in discomfort. The animal is currently on pain medication, but its condition has not
improved, and at the time of the inspection the animal had not been observed by the veterinarian since 5/31/17.
The licensee must have a consultant veterinarian with more experience with big cat nutrition and medicine review
every aspect of this case and to determine an appropriate treatment plan including specific guidance about medical
care, treatment, diagnostics, diet and nutritional supplements for this animal. The licensee must immediately follow
the exact recommendations of the expert veterinarian. The outcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing,
to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, any diagnostic tests and
the outcome of those tests that were performed, any medications or supplements prescribed along with the dosing
instructions, the treatment plan, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the
medication or supplement is administered to the animals, showing the amounts, and who administered it.
All animals should be observed on a daily basis, with any problems conveyed to the attending veterinarian, or
his/her designee, in a timely manner. Failure to consult with a veterinarian, and provide appropriate diagnostics and
treatment can result in a poor outcome for animals.
The licensee must ensure all animals at the facility are provided with adequate care to include ensuring that timely
and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian.
To be corrected by 6/21/17.3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
Although the exhibitor now has a feeding plan which shows the correct level of supplements to be added to a
muscle meat diet for big cats, in order to ensure optimal bone growth and development in growing cubs, the diet
plan was not being correctly followed for an 8 month old lion cub named "Lucie", which was found to be severely
lame and in discomfort at the time of inspection.
The exhibitor had not determined how many scoops of the powdered calcium carbonate and calcium gluconate
supplements would be equal to the specified number of grams required. It was discovered that over the past week
the exhibitor has been giving the animal about 30 grams of calcium gluconate daily when the dose it actually
needed was 100 grams daily.
Failure to provide an appropriate diet can lead to serious medical problems for the animals, especially growing
cubs, which are susceptible to metabolic bone disease, which can cause lameness and fragile bones. The exhibitor
must ensure that diets have sufficient nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The diet should be
prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. The exhibitor must comply
with the written diet plan, and document which calcium supplement is given, and how many grams per feeding, and
maintain these records for inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the exhibitor / licensee.
