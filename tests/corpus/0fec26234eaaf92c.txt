3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- On March 3, 2016, one koala was found missing from her open exhibit. Koalas housed with her
the night that she went missing were unharmed. The koala exhibit is furnished with trees and other
climbing apparatus. The design of this enclosure allows several areas or access points which would
permit entry of unauthorized animals. According to a facility representative, the remains of this koala
were found approximately 300 yards from the exhibit.The remaining koalas from this exhibit and an
adjacent exhibit have since been relocated to temporary housing.
No predator owned by the zoo escaped its enclosure at this time. According to facility representatives,
a mountain lion not associated with the zoo and with a radio collar has been identified on their surveillance
cameras at least four times during the time surrounding the incident.
As a precautionary measure, all vulnerable animals, with exception of some of the larger hoof stock, are
now locked in at night. The facility is actively working to cover holding yards in order to have additional
overnight space for protection.
Increased surveillance after hours has been implemented and the facility continues to inspect the
perimeter fence on a regular schedule.
Given a predator has been identified on surveillance cameras on the premises since the event, the
facility cannot exclude the possibility of another unauthorized entry onto the zoo's grounds.

****************************************************************
-The following was noted during a walkthrough of portions of the north and south sides of the perimeter
fence:
North end:1) At least one gate that is part of the perimeter fence measures less than the required 8 feet
height.
2) Vegetation has grown into or adjacent to the perimeter fence and can be used by an unauthorized
animal to facilitate entry or exit into the facility.
South end:1) There is an area where tree branches/vines have grown into and around the barbed wire
kick-ins, resulting in drooping or damaged wires.
According to a facility representative, the perimeter fence is over two miles in length and is inspected at
least twice each month. The perimeter fence log (PFL), which documents issues found and work orders needed, was reviewed. The PFL for the past month shows over 20 entries of both new and old issues
ranging from trees up against the perimeter fence, overhanging trees on the fence-line, and broken or
displaced barbed wire kick-ins. Although many issues have been corrected, it appears there is a back log
on repairs to be completed as the PFL from earlier this year describes at least 3 work orders (submitted in
July or September of 2014) had not yet been completely addressed and/or repairs finalized. A system to
ensure work orders are addressed and/or completed in a timely manner should be in place.
All outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter fence
that is of sufficient height to exclude animals and unauthorized persons. The fence must be constructed so
that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from
circumventing it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a
secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.

An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative. This was a focused inspection of the koala
incident.
