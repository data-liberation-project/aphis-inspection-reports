SANITATION.
A wolf enclosure containing 11 adult wolves had a watering tub within the enclosure that the wolves frequently use
for bathing. The watering tub was green in color upon observation. Although clean drinking water was present,
excessively discolored water indicates the swimming water hasn't been changed frequently and that it may be
contaminated which could result in sickness of the animals. The swimming water from the tub needs to be changed
out on a more frequent basis.
Note: Licensee corrected this before exit interview.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
An off-exhibit lock-out area housing two pumas had boxes and clutter within four feet of the enclosure gate that one
of the keepers had to walk over and around to approach the gate of the pumas. This can make husbandry practices
(such as cleaning and shifting animals) difficult to complete correctly. The areas around animal housing areas
need to be maintained free from clutter so that husbandry practices can be easily and safely be completed.
Note: Item was corrected prior to exit interview.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
The food prep area had an overabundance of flies. The flies were landing on food products throughout the area. A
fly strip was hanging from the ceiling, but it was ineffective in controlling the amount of flies that area has attracted.
In addition, bugs and spider webs were found in a container containing powdered mineral mix which is sometimes
added to the feed for some of the animals. Pests such as flies, spiders, and various other types of bugs can
contaminate the food supply and contribute to the spread of disease. A safe and effective program for the control of
insects shall be established and maintained. Correct by 6/23/16.Exit interview conducted with facility representative by VMO Scott Welch and ACI Kevin Wilken.
