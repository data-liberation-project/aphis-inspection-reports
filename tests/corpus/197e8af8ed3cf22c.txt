SANITATION.
A rake, a shovel, and other tools used to clean sheep enclosures were being stored in an unsanitary manner. The
tools had a moderate to heavy accumulation of waste material caked on them. These items should be stored and
maintained in a manner that minimizes contamination in animal areas. Excreta shall be removed from primary
enclosures and animal all areas as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein
and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
