ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A six year old male Boston terrier, (Microchip #042821540) has brown, dry and flakey material around both eyes.
The periphery of both eye balls is reddened. The central area of both eyes is cloudy and small, round and cloudier
areas are within. The upper and lower canine and cheek teeth have a thick, brown material covering a majority of
the teeth and touching the gum. The area of the gum that is touching the thick, brown material is darker red than
the rest of the gum.
A male, approximately ten years old, black poodle (no ID) has a severe build-up of a thick, grey/tan material
encasing all of the upper and lower cheek teeth and approximately half of the surface of each canine. The majority
of the surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized due to the excessive build-up of the grey/tan material. Part
of the upper right cheek teeth easily move when touched. The gums are severely red and swollen and in some
areas they are pulled back from the teeth.
A female Chihuahua, approximately four years old (Microchip #0A01524341), is continuously squinting and has
moderately cloudy eyes. The cloudiness is present throughout the surface of both eyes. The white areas
surrounding the eyes are severely reddened and there is a small amount of crusting present on both eyelids.
Dental and eye conditions such as these can be painful and can lead to further health complications. All of the
animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian by 12:00 pm on Saturday, July 11, 2015 in order
to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This
information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made
available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary
care at all times.
3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Old Kennel" there is one enclosure, containing three dogs, whose gate is constructed of metal chain linkfence. The metal frame at the bottom of the gate has become excessively rusty. The rust is pitted and flaking
which prevents the proper cleaning and sanitization of the metal. This metal frame must be replaced, repaired or
altered in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization to occur. The licensee must ensure that all
metal fencing and frames remain free of excessive rust.
Correction date: July 23, 2015
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Old Kennel" there is one enclosure, containing one dog, whose wire wall is covered in a sheet of vinyl
plastic. This plastic has been chewed and damaged by the dog. In the same building there is another enclosure,
containing at least two dogs, whose wall is also covered in a sheet of vinyl plastic that the dogs have chewed, torn
and damaged and have exposed the plywood underneath. The dogs have begun chewing on the edges of the
plywood.
In the "New Kennel" there is one enclosure, containing at least two dogs, whose walls are also covered in vinyl
plastic that has been chewed and damaged by the dogs exposing the plywood beneath.
The damaged vinyl plastic sheets and chewed plywood cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which can increase
the disease risk towards the dogs. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surfaces of housing
facilities that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced or repaired when worn or soiled. The
licensee must repair or replace the damaged sheets of vinyl plastic and plywood and must ensure that all surfaces
are well maintained in order for proper cleaning and sanitization can occur.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the "Old Kennel" there are three enclosures, containing at least six dogs, which have a buildup of dirt and grime
on the walls. The buildup of dirt and grime can increase the disease risk towards the dogs. All used primary
enclosures must be sanitized once every two weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt,
grime and any other disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are kept free of dirt and grime
buildup in order to promote the health and well-being of the dogs.
