SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
A new cage rack system was obtained and 8 hedgehogs were placed in the plastic cages. These cages are only
five inches high. The hedgehogs are 3-4 inches tall so this does not provide enough room above their heads for
them to make all normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. They need to be
moved into enclosures which provide more space above their heads. To be corrected by 2-13-15.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
