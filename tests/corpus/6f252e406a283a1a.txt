Facilities, general.
There was an incident in July 2022 in which a male lion attacked a hyena. The lions and hyenas are housed in adjacent
indoor enclosures separated by a wall and have access to the same outdoor enclosure on a rotating basis via shift doors.
There was an issue lowering the shift door completely and the male lion was able to pull the hyena under the door. The
lions and hyenas were subsequently given access to the outdoor enclosure at the same time and the lion bit the hyena on
the neck. The attending veterinarian stated the wound was approximately 2-3 inches in size and did not involve tissue
below the skin. The veterinarian stated he sedated both the lion and the hyena and repaired the wound with sutures.
Failure to provide housing facilities that protect the animals can result in injury.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury.
Corrected at the time of inspection
