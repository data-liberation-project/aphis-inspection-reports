ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female hedgehog in bin #43 was noted during the inspection conducted on 9/21/2015 to appear thin and,
based on the licensee's cage card records, had lost 13% of her body weight (398 grams on 6/11/15 compared to
346 grams on 9/19/2015). The animal was not reweighed by the licensee until the AC VMO returned on 9/23/2015
when the weight for this animal was 341 grams, which had dropped another 5 grams since 9/19/2015..

This significant and continued weight loss of >13% total body weight below pre-pregnancy weight along with her
thin appearance may indicate she is either not eating well enough after the pups have been weaned or there may
be an underlying problem causing the weight loss.
**This hedgehog must be examined by the attending veterinarian by 9/23/2015 for possible diagnosis for the weight
loss, including treatment and follow-up plans. Records containing information on the suspected diagnosis,
treatment needed, and follow-up plan need to be made available to APHIS inspectors by 9/25/2015.
**A juvenile male hedgehog was evaluated by a veterinarian on 9/21/2015 where a diagnosis of mild upper
respiratory infection was made. The veterinarian initiated treatment for the diagnosed condition and there is a plan
to repeat antibiotic treatment in two weeks if animal has not improved.
Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of
emergency, weekend, and holiday care.
