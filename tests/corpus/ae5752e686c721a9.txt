2.33(b) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Eleven Romanov lambs died during weaning and processing in the ANPC building on March 23, 2018. At the time
of the event, the lambs were under IACUC approved protocol #A16045. The current NDSU IACUC Adverse Event
and Protocol Deviation Reporting document requires that the PI and/or animal care staff must report an
unanticipated adverse event or protocol deviation within 72 hours to the IACUC Office. The IACUC Office in turn
notifies the attending veterinarian. The document also stipulates that animals that die unexpectedly, or are
euthanized unexpectedly in a research study, must be submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory for necropsy.
The institutional attending veterinarian was not informed about the lamb deaths until May 04, 2018. This was
approximately 6 weeks after the adverse event occurred. Additionally, none of the eleven lambs that died were
presented for necropsy to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory.
Direct and timely communication with the attending veterinarian and appropriate diagnostic testing are essential to
the well-being of all institutional animal herds, flocks and colonies when unexpected mortality or morbidity occurs. A
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior and well-being is communicated to the attending veterinarian.
2.131 CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(cid:9)
On March 23, 2018, while weaning and processing Romanov lambs in the ANPC building, facility personnel found
eleven Romanov lambs dead inside a temporary holding pen located along the east wall of the sheep area. The
sheep were under IACUC approved protocol #A16045 at the time of the event. The attending veterinarian for the
institution was informed of the lamb deaths by ANPC personnel on May 04, 2018. On May 11, 2018, following aninvestigation of the deaths, the attending veterinarian contacted the USDA inspector (VMO) to inform the USDA of
the adverse event and investigation results.
The holding pen was empty at the time of USDA inspection on 05-23-2018. Discussion with facility personnel
revealed that 150 lambs and 63 ewes had been placed into the pen on 03-23-2018 for the purpose of staging the
lambs for weaning, elastrator band placement and vaccinations. Approximately ninety minutes after the pen had
been filled, barn personnel discovered the sheep had piled to one side of the pen and eleven lambs had died. The
lambs, which were 8 to 13 weeks of age at the time, had not yet undergone any of the weaning procedures
described above. Square footage of the pen was measured at the time of USDA inspection and was found to be
approximately 348.5 square feet (25’ 2” L (length) X 13’ 2” W (width), with an additional 10’ 11” L X 4” W wall cove
area).
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible, and in a manner that does not
cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Failure
to restrain and handle animals properly may result in increased animal distress, injury or death.
During the inspection, facility representative proffered corrective actions to help prevent future mortalities during
weaning and processing of lambs. The corrective actions include: reduced ewe and lamb group sizes in holding
pens when processing, additional training for students and personnel on handling, increased observation frequency
during processing, and timely communication with the attending veterinarian when issues occur.
Correct this date forward.
3.130 CRITICAL
WATERING.
On May 09, 2018, a water line supplying drinking water to fourteen hogs located in pen 6 in the commercial room of
the swine unit building, was found to be non-functional by facility personnel. The fourteen hogs were then moved to
another pen with water on the same day. One of the fourteen hogs was found dead later during the day of May 09.
Another hog in the group subsequently died on the morning of May 10. A third hog from the group, which had
become debilitated, was euthanized on May 11. The affected hogs were under IACUC approved protocol #A17043
and were 6 months of age at the time of the event. The remaining eleven hogs from the pen survived and were
reported to have no outward signs of distress nor debilitation. The facility attending veterinarian was contacted by
the swine unit manager on the morning of May 10. The facility attending veterinarian contacted the USDA inspector
(VMO) on the morning of May 11 2018 to inform the USDA of the adverse event.
No hogs were present in pen 6 during USDA inspection on May 23, 2018. Discussion with facility representativesrevealed that ceiling work had been done in the room prior to the event and the hogs had been temporarily moved
to another pen in the room. According to the corrective action report supplied by the facility, a nylon fitting on the
valve of the water line supplying water to the pen had been found to be defective at the time the hogs were initially
removed from pen 6. The hogs were then moved back into the pen (pen 6) on May 02. Facility personnel
discovered that the water line fitting had not been repaired and the line was non-functional on May 09 2018.
Subsequent necropsy of one of the hogs that died (VDL Ascension Report #18-5104) revealed findings consistent
with dehydration and water deprivation.
If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health
and comfort of the animal. Failure to provide potable drinking water at adequate frequency or amounts may result in
undue stress, dehydration, debilitation or death.
During the inspection, facility representative proffered corrective actions to help prevent potential future mortalities.
The corrective actions include: a daily observation checklist which includes all watering devices, timely reporting of
animal issues to the attending veterinarian, and a reporting system to the facility manager and personnel when
broken or non-functional equipment is found. Newly installed dry erase boards for reporting equipment issues were
also observed to be present in the swine unit at the time of USDA inspection.
Correct this date forward.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian and the IACUC Coordinator on
May 23 and May 24 2018.
This amended inspection report replaces report id # 2016082569157896 previously submitted, signed and dated on
