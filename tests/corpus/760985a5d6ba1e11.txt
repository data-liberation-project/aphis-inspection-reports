FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Based on discussion with the facility manager and review of facility records, April 2, 2016, the ambient temperature
of the cold chamber, which housed hamsters being acclimatized under Protocol # 02-16-2016, reached 100.4
degree Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). According to facility records, thirty-five hamsters perished due to a
malfunction in the cold chamber and alarm system. The alarm system failed to notify personnel when temperatures
fell outside the appropriate temperature ranges.
The facility must ensure that the ambient temperature shall not exceed 85 degrees Fahrenheit for the health and/or
well-being of these animals.
Based on the review of supportive documentation, the facility took effective corrective actions and implemented
appropriate preventive measures to address this issue. There have not been any additional incidents since the
corrective actions have been undertaken.
An on-site exit interview was conducted June 15, 2016 with Dr. Ashley McIntosh (VMO) and facility representative.
A follow-up exit interview was conducted June 16, 2016 via telephone with facility representative.
