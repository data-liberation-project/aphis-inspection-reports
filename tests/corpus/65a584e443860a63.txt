ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care is not detailed enough for each species held at the facility. The program does not
list each species and what is required for routine veterinary care annually.
Each exhibitor shall have an attending veterinarian, in the case of a part time veterinarian the program must be
written.
Have your veterinarian add more detail to the program so that the inspector can ensure that animals are receiving
appropriate annual care.
