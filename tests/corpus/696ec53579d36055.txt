3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one enclosure, a piece of the plastic floor board is broken with a rough edge, and at one point is creating a hole
approximately 1.5 inches long by 0.5 inches wide. In at least three other enclosures, there is plastic wall paneling
that has been excessively chewed and roughened. In at least one enclosure, the plastic door to the outside is
chewed and roughened at the top corners. The licensee stated that he has been meaning to fix these issues, and
showed the inspector the materials he has in order to do so.
Chewed, roughened surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized, and could cause disease hazards. In
addition, the hole in the floor could cause injury.
The licensee must repair or replace these surfaces. The licensee must develop and follow a plan that ensures all
surfaces are maintained on a regular basis. All surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be
repaired or replaced when worn or soiled.
To be corrected by March 16, 2016.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
At least one self-feeder with a narrow metal ledge on the interior has a caked and hardened buildup of food
particles. This indicates that the food receptacles are not being cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to
ensure the health and well-being of the dogs.
Food receptacles that are not cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks can cause disease hazards.
The licensee must ensure all feeders are kept clean, and must be sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b) of this
subpart. Measures must be taken to ensure there is no molding, deterioration, and caking of feed.To be corrected from this day forward.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Several enclosures in the sheltered building have an excessive buildup of grime and hair on the walls, in the
corners, and under the wall dividers. There are also several doors to the outside that have a blackish-brown grime
on their surfaces. The licensee was cleaning the kennel when the inspector arrived, but the excessive buildup of
grime indicates the enclosures have not been thoroughly cleaned for at least several days.
Primary enclosures must be thoroughly cleaned daily to prevent an excessive accumulation of excreta and food
waste to keep from soiling the dogs and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures be cleaned at least daily and sanitized at least once every two
weeks or more often if necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals.
To be corrected from this day forward.
