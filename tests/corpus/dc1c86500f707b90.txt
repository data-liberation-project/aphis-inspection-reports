2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several expired bottles of Lidocaine and Azithromycin were found in the facilities medicine cabinet. You cannot be
assured that expired medications will have the desired treatment effect and therefore are not considered adequate
veterinary care. There should be a regular schedule of review of all medications and removal of those that have
expired.
