FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The large petting zoo pasture behind the owner's house has an 8 foot tall fence made of two sections of 6" X 6" wire
fence. At least two areas were noted where a patch of extra fencing was placed over the original fence. The
patched areas have rough edges with loose and protruding wires. Along the back fence, sections of fencing have
been pushed down by downed trees (which were removed) and this fencing needs to be repaired. There are
partially fenced off smaller areas along the tree line and this fencing is in disrepair with some broken protruding
wires and pieces of loose fencing laying on the ground. All fencing needs to be maintained to contain the animals
and prevent any potential injuries. The owner has plans to remove several areas of fencing and replace other
areas. Most of the animals will not be at the farm for several months as they will be with the traveling petting zoo.
The fencing needs to be corrected when the owners return or by 2-10-17.

SANITATION.
In the large pasture for the petting zoo animals is an area of storage for primarily fencing items, including stacks of
fence panels, rolls of fencing wire, and a section of 1"X 1" wire on the ground. The goats, sheep, and other petting
zoo animals have access to these structures and could potentially injure themselves. The items need to be
removed or fenced off so the animals cannot access the items. To be corrected by 11-4-16.
