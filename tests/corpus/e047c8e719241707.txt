FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Four metal barrels used to store cat food were found with moldy/wet food and insects inside them. These
barrels must be kept sanitary and the food must be stored in a manner to avoid contamination by molding or insect
infestation. Feeding of moldy or contaminated food can lead to sickness in the animals. Correct this by storing all
food properly.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The facility has made significant improvements by removing brush and trees from inside the perimeter fence.
Several trees remain near the perimeter fence in the upper storage area and behind the coatimundi/deer area of the
facility. There is also one tree growing through the perimeter fence in the upper East portion of the fence. Trees
near the perimeter fence may act as a climbing source for animals should they get out of their primary enclosure.
Correct by completing removal or altering of trees in a manner to ensure the perimeter fence can adequately
function as a secondary containment system.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED.
