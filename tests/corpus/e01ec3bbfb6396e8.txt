HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a space present where the enclosure wire meets the roof of the shelter box in the capuchin enclosure on
the left side of the gift shop. This space is large enough to allow one of the non human primates to put their head or
limb thru resulting in an injury. This must be repaired or replaced and maintained in good condition to protect the
animals from injury and secure them .
