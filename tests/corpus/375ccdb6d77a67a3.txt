2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:50 a.m. on
11-SEP-18.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 9:50 a.m. and was not able to locate anyone. I called the animal caretaker
on her phone, she explained to me that she was not currently at the facility and would not be able to make it back to
do the inspection today.
