3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
The facility is currently in the process of replacing the rusted sugar glider enclosures identified on the last inspection
however there are still at least ten enclosures that need replacement due to rust issues. The rust is rough to the touch and
pitting the metal. During the routine check on the animals last night, the licensee noted that one sugar glider had escaped
from its enclosure due to a broken rusted wire creating a large enough opening to allow escape. The facility has placed
food and water in the building and is trying to recapture the sugar glider.
Excessive rust will lead to loss of structural strength of the metal which can lead to injury or escape of the animals in the
enclosure. In addition, pitted rusty surfaces cannot be cleaned and sanitized. The sugar glider enclosures must be made
and maintained such that they are structurally sound including being free of excessive rust.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
A large number of fruit flies were noted in the animal enclosures and on the animal bedding. When an enclosure was
moved, a cloud of flies could be seen. The licensee reports this is a recent issue and that they have obtained a
recommendation for a product to use for the fruit flies but that they have not yet obtained it.


Fruit flies can be a nuisance to the animals and can spread disease organisms from one enclosure to another. The facility
shall ensure that a safe and effective program is in place for control of the fruit flies. Correct by June 5, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
