ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are multiple animals at the facility that have veterinary care issues. These health problems of these animals
were not observed or identified before the time of inspection. The daily observation of the animals can be conducted
by the veterinarian or by the licensee, as long as any changes in animal health are communicated to the
veterinarian.
The failure to observe the animals daily can lead to health problems that are not identified or treated in a timely
manner. Untreated health problems can affect the health and well-being of the animals.
The licensee must observe each animal on a daily basis. If changes in animal health are noticed, these changes
should be documented and must be treated by following the PVC. If the PVC does not describe the treatment for
the specific condition, the veterinarian needs to be consulted so that the health conditions can be diagnosed and a
treatment plan started if necessary.
Records of sick or injured animals should be kept and must be available to Aphis officials at the time of the
inspection.
