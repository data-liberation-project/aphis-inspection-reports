2.31(d)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) discussed three incidents that involved Principal
Investigators (PIs) carrying out activities that did not conform to their approved protocols. At the time of this
inspection, these incidents were reviewed by USDA / APHIS / Animal Care inspectors, and the following was
determined:
1.) On protocol AN121408-01A involving swine, there was a procedure involving steam ablation of the gallbladder.
The approved protocol called for four puffs of steam to be administered at one centimeter intervals. Animal number
6727 underwent this procedure on 7/9/16, but the medical records show that 200 puffs of steam were administered,
which far exceeds the size of the gallbladder. The animal stopped eating, received appropriate supportive veterinary
care, and was subsequently euthanized on 7/13/16. Necropsy showed that the stomach had been perforated.
2.) On 10/16/16 a pig, number 6737, on protocol AN136364-02 was taken for CT scan imaging under anesthesia,
as per the approved protocol. The animal died while being returned to its enclosure following the procedure. The
PI's team disposed of the carcass prior to finding out whether the veterinary staff wanted to carry out a necropsy,
which could have helped to determine the cause of death. The IACUC reviewed this incident and counseled the PI.
At the time of this inspection a further review revealed that the PI's team did not adhere to the approved protocol.
The protocol called for one contrast material to be used, but on this animal both the conventional contrast material
and the test material were given, for a total of three doses. This may have prolonged the time that the animal was
under anesthesia, as the approved protocol stated that anesthesia would be approximately from one to three hours,
but this animal died after four and a half hours of anesthesia. The IACUC was not fully informed by the PI regarding
the deviation from the protocol that may have contributed to the animal's death.
3.) On protocol AN135213-01C involving voles, the PI had requested an amendment to his protocol to add a new
procedure - a cranial surgery. The PI proceeded to do this surgery on two animals on 4/2/17, prior to IACUC
approval. The small incisions on the head did not heal as expected, and the animals were euthanized once the
unapproved activity was discovered by the veterinary staff.Failure to adhere to the IACUC approved protocol can have a serious animal welfare impact, as evidenced here in
these cases. Significant changes cannot be made to the study protocol without IACUC approval. The Principal
Investigators are responsible for ensuring that the procedures involving animals adhere to their approved protocols,
in order to provide adequate oversight of the welfare of the animals on study. The IACUC must reinforce the
importance of strictly adhering to approved protocols; Principal Investigators are responsible for ensuring that all
members of their teams strictly adhere to procedures outlined in IACUC approved protocols. The IACUC must
provide adequate oversight of animal activities in order to safeguard the welfare of animals on study.
This inspection was conducted at all UCSF sites with covered species on 7/26/17 and 7/27/17, and an exit interview
with the inspectors and the facility representatives occurred on 7/27/17.
