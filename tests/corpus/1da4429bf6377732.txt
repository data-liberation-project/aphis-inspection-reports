ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has a part-time attending veterinarian but had no written program of veterinary care available for review
at the time of inspection. It is important for licensees to have and be familiar with written programs of veterinary
care to ensure important things such as nutrition and parasite control are provided as directed by the attending
veterinarian. The licensee must ensure there is a written program of veterinary care which is followed and available
for inspections.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was one black and white-spotted, adult, female, non-lactating goat which was very thin. Her backbone was
highly visible and formed a continuous ridge. When palpated, her lumbar vertebrae were easily grasped between
the thumb and forefinger. There was an obvious depression in the transition from her spinous to transverse
processes. Her hip bones were very prominent and readily palpable under the skin. Her ribs were also palpable.
While the other goats in the enclosure (in better body conditions) foraged around just prior to feeding time, this
particular goat went to the corner of the enclosure to lay down, appearing somewhat lethargic. Thin animals could
have parasites or other harmful medical conditions. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed
veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is
developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

3.56(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.There was an outdoor, bi-level rabbit hutch housing five rabbits on the side of the barn, separated from the rest of
the animals and Bunnyville. The enclosure had an excessive amount of excreta resulting in more feces than
bedding on the floor of the bottom layer. All five bunnies were observed walking on the feces while foraging for
food. The fecal pellets were so numerous that they had spilled out the front of the enclosure resulting in an
accumulation of pellets just outside the enclosure. A build up of feces poses a health risk for the animals. The
licensee must ensure that the rabbit enclosures are kept reasonably free of excreta by periodic cleaning. This
non-compliant item was corrected at the time of inspection.
The inspection was conducted on 14 October 2015 with a facility representative. The exit interview was conducted
on 16 October 2015 with a facility representative.
