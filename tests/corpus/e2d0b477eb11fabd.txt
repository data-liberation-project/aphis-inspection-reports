3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The lower plastic shelter wall for three shelters is coming apart where the seams are and are loose. These seams
are located below the dog door insert. Some of the plastic is chewed away or missing where the seams are. This is
creating a gap and is exposing bare wood, thus preventing required cleaning and sanitization.
All shelters must be kept and maintained in good repair, for the prevention of diseases from required cleaning and
sanitization and for the prevention of injury to the four adult dogs.
3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is wire fencing on top of the enclosures, housing 33 adult dogs, in the West Room. This wire fencing has an
accumulation of hair and gray dust or debris. This dust can fall down into the dog's enclosures causing potential
health problems. The accumulation of hair and dust can attract pest and vermin and provide living and breeding
areas for them. This could cause potential health concerns.
For the prevention of health concerns, living and breeding areas for pests and vermin, all housing facilities must be
kept clean of trash, dust, hair and other discarded material.
To be corrected by, 31-January -2020.
3.1(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(cid:9)
* Six enclosures have metal frames are used as the dog entryway for 10 adult dogs. These metal frame surfaces
are excessively rusty, pitting and in areas have corroded away. There are jagged edges caused by the corrosionfor some of the metal frames. This could injure the dogs.
These metal surfaces prevent required cleaning and sanitization, thus increasing the disease hazards. The surfaces
have corroded away in areas affecting the structural strength allowing possible injury to the dogs.
For the prevention of disease potential from required cleaning and sanitization and the prevention of injury from
structural integrity, all metal surfaces must be maintained repaired or replaced when worn and rusty.
3.6(a)(2)(i) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Three enclosures, all housing a total of four adult dogs, have galvanized dog door inserts or galvanized
channeling. The metal has corroded away causing a jagged edge and or allowing the edge of the channeling to
bent outward into the dog shelter. These protruding jagged edges are at eye level of the dogs in normal standing
position. These jagged edges could potentially injure the animals.
For the prevention of injury to the animals, all enclosures must be free of sharp points and jagged edge.
3.6(a)(2)(x) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* Four litters, all totaling of 26 puppies, was observed walking across the plastic wire flooring with openings. The
vinyl wire flooring openings were approximately 1" X 1" in size. The puppies feet were passing through the openings
as they walked. This could potentially harm the puppies and affect their gait.
For the prevention of injury and proper development, all flooring with openings should not allow the animals feet to
pass through.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owners and Randall Wagner (AC).
