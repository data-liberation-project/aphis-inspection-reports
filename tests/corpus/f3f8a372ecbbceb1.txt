puppy, did not provide adequate floor space. The puppies were not able to turn about normally or lie in a natural
position without obstruction. Natural posturing and movement within the primary enclosure during transport is
important to the well-being and safety of the animals. Moving forward licensee shall, ensure that all animals
transported have sufficient floor space to turn about normally or lie in a natural position unobstructed.
