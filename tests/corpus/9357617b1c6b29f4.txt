3.28(a)(1) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A hamster was observed hanging from the watering apparatus in its primary enclosure at the time of inspection. Its
right hind limb had become entrapped between the plastic water bottle and the wire support. An area of the skin on
the inside of the affected limb (approximately 0.5" x 0.5") was red and irritated in appearance and the distal part of
the limb appeared swollen. After being freed by the licensee, the animal was noted to be bearing weight abnormally
on that limb, consistent with injury or pain. The facility veterinarian was contacted to direct treatment.
The water bottle in this enclosure does not fit snugly into the wire holder, and this lack of structural soundness
leaves gaps between the water bottle and the wire. An animal was injured subsequent to entrapment in one of these
gaps.
Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound to protect hamsters from injury. The licensee stated that he has
ordered new watering devices and plans to replace all the waterers of this type to prevent further injuries.
To be corrected by February 17th, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted on site with the licensee.
