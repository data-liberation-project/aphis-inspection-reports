ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The rhino had what appears to be an oval mass approx. 1.5 inches under the skin fold of the right front elbow. Fifty
percent of this mass was slightly pink in color.
The attending veterinarian and caretaker was unaware of this growth.
The mass needs to be examined to make a diagnosis and treat appropriately. An assessment of the mass to
determine if this growth interferes with movements of this animal shall be also made.
A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems
of animal health, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian by the caretakers

2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There was a missing section of the chain link barrier fence which gives the public easy & direct access to the bear
and capuchin enclosures.
The absence of a complete barrier fence places both the animals as well as the public at risk of injury.

3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was a lack of drainage and mud accumulations in several areas within the camel, aoudad, and rhino exhibits.
In the case of the camels and aoudad, the animals have to walk through these areas to gain access into their
shelters. The animals had mud accumulation on their lower legs so the underlying skin and hooves could not be
completely visually inspected.
The mud that was seen on the limbs of this animals may cause infections, and lameness with resulting pain to the
affected animals.
The excessive mud and moisture observed on the camels may be a contributory cause for the cracked hooves
observed.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess standing water.To be corrected by 11-5-2016.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Cockroaches where seen dead and alive in the feed storage trailer. There were also dead cockroaches in the camel
barn feed storage area.
There were open bags of pelleted feed in the storage trailer. These open bags of food serve to attract vermin and
cockroaches and do not minimize these pests which can contaminate these open bags of feed.
The established pest control program does not appear to be effective in controlling the cockroach populations in
these areas. A safe and more effective program for the control of cockroaches shall be established and maintained.
The areas should be cleaned more frequently in order to remove dead cockroaches, and all open bags should be
placed into containers for better insect control.
