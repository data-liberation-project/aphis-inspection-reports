Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The majority of the required records of acquisition, and the record of animals on hand were not available at the time of
inspection. There were numerous disposition records that did not have a corresponding acquisition record. These
animals include capybara, kinkajou, mink, and fox.

Each dealer shall shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or
otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her
possession or under his or her control.

Records, or copies of the records must be kept on hand to be reviewed at time of inspection. These records must include
all animal acquisitions, and dispositions. A record of animals on hand must also be available. These records must also
include animals born at the facility, animals euthanized or animals that have died at the facility. Records must be kept to
ensure all facilities and individuals that are required to have a license are licensed, and to trace and track animal
movement in the case of animal disease outbreak.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The licensee has a ring-tailed lemur that is housed alone. This is the only non-human primate at the facility. There is no
plan for environment enhancement at the facility.

Dealers must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the
psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. Special considerations - Certain nonhuman primates must be provided
special attention regarding enhancement of their environment, based on the needs of the individual species and in
accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian. Non-human primates that require special attention include
-Individually housed nonhuman primates that are unable to see and hear nonhuman primates of their own or compatible
species.

Facilities, outdoor.

The licensee has a muntjac, and 4 patagonian cavy housed outside without a perimeter fence.

On or after May 17, 2000, all outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter
fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 6 feet high for non-
dangerous animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it protects
the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having
contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in
the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between
animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such fences less than 3 feet in distance
from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the administrator.

A 6' perimeter fence must be erected no less than 3' away from the primary enclosure to prevent unauthorized persons
and other animals from having contact with the animals held at the facility. This fence can also function as a secondary
containment in case an animals escapes from the primary enclosure. A perimeter fence variance can also be requested.

animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Replace the enclosure, or repair the opening to prevent injury to the hedgehog.
