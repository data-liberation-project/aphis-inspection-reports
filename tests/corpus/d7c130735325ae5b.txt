SANITATION.
*** The main barn for the reindeer needs to be cleaned out. Currently the barn has a lot of fur, dust and debris
throughout the rafters, fans and walls that should be cleaned. There is an old fly trap filled with dead flies that needs
to be removed. There is a door with paint that is flaking off that should either be re painted or stripped of paint for
the safety of the animals. Lastly the black tubs used for salt and mineral blocks need to be kept clean when used for
nutritional supplements.
