3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A rodent was observed inside the macaque enclosure, another along the fence line outside the enclosure, and
rodent burrow holes were observed under the walls to the off exhibit enclosures. Rodents can carry parasites and
other diseases that could compromise the health and well-being of nonhuman primates, as well as any animals on
exhibit. An effective pest control program must be established and maintained to promote the health and well-being
of the animals on exhibit and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
