RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
The licensee uses a "Live Animal Intake Form" at each store whenever they purchase animals from the general
public. The form allows collection of all information required by the Animal Welfare Regulations for brokers of
animals. However, there were at least 13 forms that had incomplete information regarding the sellers of the
animals. Properly completed records are necessary to facilitate record-keeping requirements for acquisition,
disposition, and healthcare of the animals. The licensee must keep records that contain the name and full address
of the seller. If the seller does not have a USDA license, the licensee must keep records of the seller's vehicle
license number and State, and the seller's driver's license number and State. The record must also contain the date
of the purchase and a description of the animal.
TO BE CORRECTED BY AUGUST 7, 2015.
The exit briefing was conducted with the licensee via telephone on July 31, 2015.
