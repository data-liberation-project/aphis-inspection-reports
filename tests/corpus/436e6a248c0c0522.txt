FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor enclosure housing one grey fox named "Velcro" the elevated wood platform has two boards missing
leaving a large gap. The fox could fall or get caught in the area of the missing boards and could potentially become
injured. On the roof of the additional wood den is a nail head protruding upward that could cause an injury to the
fox. Maintain indoor and outdoor facilities so that it is structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals
from injury.
