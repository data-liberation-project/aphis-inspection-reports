ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were three rabbits during today'(cid:25)s inspection that were identified as needing veterinary care.
(cid:28)"Gillian"(cid:29), a female Angora Lop, had previously been seen by the veterinarian on January 7th and January 27th for
a severe eye infection. Although she was prescribed medication initially, the eye was still inflamed with prominent
whitish discharge of the left eye on today'(cid:25)s inspection. Additionally, there is now hair loss which may have resulted
from consistent moisture from the abnormal tearing or physical trauma from scratching due to discomfort from the
infection. Although the animal was initially examined by a veterinarian, it is the responsibility of the licensee to seek
veterinary care if the condition does not improve or worsens. Gillian also had numerous mats on her hair coat.
One black female Fuzzy Lop identified as "(cid:28)Charcoal"(cid:29), was observed sneezing. On examination, greenish yellow
discharge was observed coming primarily from the left nostril. This animal had not been observed by the licensee
and therefore the veterinarian wasn'(cid:25)t contacted. The licensee stated that this animal was not receiving any
treatment at the time of inspection.
"(cid:28)Copper"(cid:29), a male copper and gray French Angora had clear nasal discharge from both nostrils. Copper also had
red, dry, dark, scaly debris that filled the entire inner portion of his left ear such that the ear canal was entirely
obscured by this material. Copper was also severely matted with one large mat measuring approximately 6 inches
by 8 inches that went down to the skin and encompassed his lower back and rear. The licensee stated that she had
observed the matting present on Copper and that she intended to groom this animal. When the debris present in
left ear was pointed out to the licensee, she stated that she was unaware of that condition and that he was not
currently receiving any treatment for it.
Failure to report signs of eye, ear, skin, and respiratory conditions to the veterinarian can result in severe health
issues, discomfort and pain, permanent disability and can even result in the death of the animal. This facility must
provide an accurate and timely means of communication with their Attending Veterinarian to ensure that all health
issues are reported and treated within an accurate and timely manner. In addition, the Licensee must have frequent
communication with the Attending Veterinarian when a treatment is not working or a health issue has worsened.Correct By: 3/21/2015

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are several animals at this inspection that were identified by inspectors as needing veterinary care. One
animal (cid:28)"Gillian"(cid:29) (as described above) was identified by the Licensee as needing veterinary care prior to this
inspection, however, the eye condition had been treated without improvement for a significant period of time and no
action was taken to address the ongoing issue. An additional two animals ("(cid:28)Copper"(cid:29) and "(cid:28)Charcoal"(cid:29)) had not
been identified by the licensee as requiring veterinary attention. Daily observation of all animals to appropriately
identify animals in need of care is essential for their health and well-being. Additionally, licensees are required to
have a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the Attending Veterinarian to communicate when
these problems are observed or treatments are failing to adequately address the illness that was identified. Without
this mechanism in place to communicate accurate information, the Attending Veterinarian cannot provide adequate
advice regarding the care and treatment of these animals. Failure to report signs of severe health issues or
unchanged/worsened health conditions to a veterinarian results in diseases not being treated appropriately and may
potentially result in the death of the animal. This facility must provide an accurate and timely means of
communication with their Attending Veterinarian to ensure that all health issues are reported and treated within an
accurate and timely manner. In addition, the Licensee must have frequent communication with the Attending
Veterinarian when a treatment is not working or a health issue has worsened.

2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
This facility does not currently have an effective method for documenting new acquisitions (either for animals born
on the property or acquired by other means) or disposition of animals whether by sale, gift, death, or euthanasia. In
addition the facility does not have any mechanism in place for accurately documenting the correct number of
animals on hand.
Missing records of disposition: At the last inspection (January 2015), APHIS Officials documented 77 adult rabbits
present on the property. At today(cid:25)'s inspection, there were 42 adult rabbits on hand (three of which the licensee
stated she had just recently acquired). There is no record of disposition for the 38 adult rabbits that are no longer
on the premises.
Missing records of acquisition: On today'(cid:25)s inspection there were 25 young juvenile rabbits that would not havebeen present on the last inspection (based on their age they would have been born since the last inspection).
There are no records of births of these animals or acquisition through any other means. In addition, the acquisition
records for the 42 adult rabbits present on the property at the time of inspection were incomplete and did not fully
disclose all required information.
When asked about record keeping, the Licensee provided inspectors with a list of some of the animals. However;
the Licensee misidentified or changed several of the rabbits names throughout the inspection. She stated that she
and a worker have a hard time agreeing on names and that several animals have two different names or have the
same name as another animal at the facility. The records the Licensee presented for these animals included only
approximate age, breed, color, sex, and other information pertaining to their breeding history. There was no
information regarding the date of acquisition, name or address from which these animals were acquired, or USDA
license number for the person from which they were acquired (or driver'(cid:25)s license number and vehicle license
number if not USDA licensed) as required by this section. Based on this information the licensee is missing
acquisition records for several animals (to include the 25 juvenile rabbits mentioned above) and has incomplete
records for an additional 42 rabbits.
Accurate record keeping is essential to allow APHIS to accurately track animals and ensure that all animals are
receiving proper care as required by the Animal Welfare Act. Additionally, specific information regarding sources for
acquisition and disposition are necessary in the event of disease to facilitate tracking animal movement and ensure
both animal health and welfare.
Correct by creating accurate records of acquisition (as much as possible) for all animals on hand at the time of this
inspection. Additionally, the licensee must also make, keep and maintain records which fully disclose information
from this point forward concerning all acquisitions and dispositions (including all births, deaths, and animals
euthanized as well as all other information required by this subsection).

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There were two rows with 8 enclosures housing about 9 adult rabbits and 1 juvenile and a large cage holding 13
juveniles that had no protection from the wind, rain or snow. These enclosures had a structure over the top of the
enclosure to protect the animals from the direct rays of the sun. However; these enclosures did not have anything
to block the wind, rain or snow on the front, back or either side. These animals would be directly exposed to all
weather elements. The Licensee showed inspectors documentation from the Attending Veterinarian suggesting thatthese enclosures should have sides to protect the animals from the direct effects of the weather. Exposing these
animals to inclement weather conditions may be a contributing factor to several animals sneezing and having nasal
discharge as was seen during today(cid:25)'s inspection. Licensee must ensure that these animals are protected from the
weather on all sides of their enclosures, as suggested by the attending veterinarian. These animals must have
adequate shelter to protect them from the wind, rain and snow and other inclement weather.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During today'(cid:25)s inspection, inspectors noticed a large domestic rabbit outside the perimeter fence about 10 feet
away in a wooded area. The rabbit had built a burrow and would randomly disappear into the burrow and come
back out while inspectors watched. The Licensee identified the animal as being one of her rabbits, Silverado, a
female silver colored Creme D'(cid:24)Argent who she said was currently pregnant and expected to be giving birth soon.
She stated that she was unaware that the rabbit was loose and would be catching it later to return her to her home.
This facility takes bunnies to birthday parties and has rabbits that are tamed for frequent handling. Tame rabbits are
not aware of natural predators or how to protect themselves in the wild. While loose, this animal is likely to be
harmed or killed. Licensee must ensure that there are measures in place to readily identify when an animal is
missing in the event of an escape. In addition, Licensee must ensure all enclosures are constructed in a manner
that will adequately contain the animal to prevent escape.

FEEDING.
There were many food receptacles that contained no food. The Licensee stated twice that it was alright for the
animals to go at least 3 days without food or water. Several food receptacles had a heavy accumulation of adhered
mounds of wet food and/or feces. There were multiple feeders with excessive rust and accumulation of calcium
deposits. When licensee was asked to show inspectors the food storage bins they were empty. Licensee stated
that she went to purchase food every weekend. Contaminated food receptacles directly expose the animals to
harmful bacteria that affect the health and wellbeing of the animals. Licensee must ensure that all food receptacles
are cleaned and sanitized to minimize disease hazards. In addition, food must be provided at least once each day.This item was previously on November 19, 2014 and January 13, 2015.
Although this citation is a REPEAT NONCOMPLIANCE THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED, these animals must be
provided clean dishes with food immediately.
3.55 DIRECT
WATERING.
On today inspection, Inspectors noticed that (cid:28)"Harvey Dent"(cid:29) an adult, male French Angora Lop with black coloration
was repeatedly trying to get water out of an empty water bottle attached to the side of his cage. The Licensee told
inspectors that she had an issue with her water line for this animal and others in this area and had put a water bottle
on the cage for the animals until she had fixed the water line. The Licensee turned the water line back on for this
rabbit and showed him that the waterline was working. This animal was video recorded drinking water for over 7
minutes. The inspectors discovered that most rabbit enclosures outside of the first area were lacking water bottles
or any other water source. Inspectors asked that the rabbits be given water. As the licensee approached with the
water bottles, the rabbits became anxious. The rabbits that were group housed were frantic to get water and the
young rabbits were standing up on their hind legs and competing to get the water. The enclosure containing 15
adolescent rabbits (fifteen weeks old) were video recorded drinking water for over 15 minutes. Two adult rabbits,
"Yetti" (a white female Angora Lop) and "Liard" (a white male Holland Lop), were video recorded drinking water for
over 11 minutes. There were several other rabbits that were lacking water bottles in their enclosure. Each time
these other rabbits were offered water, they all had very similar reactions to the rabbits the inspectors were able to
record on video. Licensee stated that as long as the rabbits had water and food every 3 days that they should be
alright.
Severe dehydration or thirst can cause dizziness, confusion and decreased urine output. It can be very distressing
to the rabbit and may even cause death. Licensee must ensure that all rabbits have a sufficient amount of potable
water daily.

3.56(a)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
All enclosures, framing of enclosures, trays, fixtures, wire mesh, and all other hard surfaces have an excessive
amount of dirt, urine, feces, hair and other organic material build up. There were several structures that weresaturated with urine and were deteriorating. Licensee showed inspectors documentation from the Attending
Veterinarian stating that the sanitation for the facility needed to be improved . Sanitation issues can damage the
hair coat and skin and make the animals susceptible to environmental exposure. Poor sanitation also exposes these
animals to bacteria growth that can be hazardous and lower the immune system of these animals. A compromised
immune system does not allow these animals to build up the necessary antibodies to fight disease and infection.
Licensee must ensure that there are adequate measures in place to remove all dust, dirt, urine, feces and all other
organic material from all surfaces of the facility. In addition, Licensee must have effective methods to clean and
sanitize all surfaces on a consistent basis.

EMPLOYEES.
Licensee is currently using a temporary service that provides individuals for a few hours each week to assist at the
facility. In addition, she has been interviewing people for permanent staffing. The licensee'(cid:25)s current paid staff
consist of individuals whose primary focus is to take the rabbits and bunnies to birthday parties. They do not
consistently assist with any daily chores such as cleaning, feeding, watering, etc. The Licensee told inspectors
several times that she knew that her staffing was inadequate and that she needed more help taking care of the
facility. She stated that she did not have time to keep up with her record keeping due to being so busy taking care
of the facility. Due to the lack of employees at this facility, the animals and the facility housing them are suffering
tremendously. The Licensee must ensure that she has an appropriate amount of animals that she can adequately
care for or hire and train an adequate amount of employees to care for the rabbits and to repair and maintain the
facility.
