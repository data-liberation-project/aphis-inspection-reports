2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On November 22, 2014, a patron reported being bitten by a camel in the drive thru park. The camel(cid:25)'s head was
completely inside of the vehicle and the patrons tried to push the camel(cid:25)'s head out of the vehicle. The camel
continued to get more forceful by biting the passenger side patron on the arm. Animals must be handled to
minimize the risk of harm to the public or injury to the animal. There must be sufficient distance and/or barriers
between the animal and the public. This will assure the safety of the animals and the public. This animal has been
removed from the exhibit and quarantined by the licensee.
Correct from this date forward.
Inspection and exit interview conducted by APHIS personnel with facility representative.
