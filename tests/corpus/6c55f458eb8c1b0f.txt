HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On 4-22-15, a reporter from the local news interviewed the licensee for a story. During the interview the owner and
the reporter were standing next to an enclosure with a juvenile lion and tiger. The reporter squatted next to the
cage and petted the lion who was rubbing against the cage wires. In the news report, the tiger could be seen
pawing at the owners feet under the gap at the bottom of the enclosure fence. During any public exhibition, animals
must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or
barriers between the animal and the public so as to assure the safety of the animals and the public. Although the
licensee did not give permission for the reporter to pet the cat, he did allow her to come into direct contact with two
large cats by petting the lion and being within reach of the tiger. This action had potential for injury to her and
possibly the cats. The public is to have no further contact with juvenile and adult cats. To be corrected from this
day forward.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Although this entire facility has a perimeter fence, it is not the required 8 feet high for dangerous exotics. The
current chain link fence is 6 feet and has a 3 strand barb wire kick-out, giving a total of 7 feet. Two lions and 8
tigers are being rotated into two outdoor enclosures, which have four foot barriers around them. The perimeter
fence needs to be raised to 8 feet high or separate perimeter fences - 3 feet away from the enclosure fences - can
be placed around the outdoor enclosures. This is required to prevent unwanted entry of people or animals and as
a secondary method of containment for the animals. To be corrected by 5-26-15.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
