FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The inner fence along the front of the enclosure near the wood tower housing 1 Adult Male Elk has a large
horizontal gap in the fence. The two pieces of fence are no longer secured together causing this large gap in the
fencing. The elk was observed rubbing and pulling on the fence with his antlers which was causing more damge to
that area of the fence. The fence is not in good repair and could cause the animal to become trapped or injured.
Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound and in good repair to contain and protect the
animals from injuries.
