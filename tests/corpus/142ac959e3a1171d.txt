ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Several of the camelids in the teaching herds have overgrown toenails. The nail overgrowth is causing misalignment
of the toes.
Specific animals noted were Napoleon, Laya, Bentley, Tonto, and Olive Oyl.
Records on Napoleon document nail trims on 8/19/15, 6/28/16, and 9/22/17. One month after the latest trim, the
nails look overgrown.
Records on Laya document nail trims on 8/3/16 and 9/26/17. One month after the latest trim, her nails were long
enough to affect her stride. The nails were first noticed by the inspector after she seemed short-strided in the hind
limbs.
Records on Bentley document nail trims 10/9/12, 6/30/15, and 6/30/16. Notes from a Sept 2013 stay in the hospital
note each day a plan to trim nails, but there was no documentation of a trim before he was discharged from the
hospital.
Additionally, Bentley has a skin condition on his lower legs and ventral thorax first noted in January 2016 when the
hyperkeratosis, lichenification, and alopecia were documented . It was suggested on a later note to be a result of a
possible zinc deficiency, but there was no substantiation with exam or diagnostics, or notes of any mineral
supplementation to treat any deficiencies. Lack of a definitive diagnosis and treatment, if indicated, of a skin
condition can cause unnecessary discomfort to the animal.
Tonto's records show he was donated on 6/24/15, and his only documented nail trim was 6/28/16.
Olive Oyl was donated on 9/20/10, and nail trims are documented on 7/31/12, 6/30/15, and 6/28/16.
Office of Campus Veterinarian (OCV) personnel reviewed records from about 17 additional animals. These records
showed intervals similar in length and regularity.
The records of these animals show that trimming is inconsistent in frequency and, likely, quality. Improved
observation of nail condition with trimming as nail conditions dictate, as well as appropriate training and supervision
of the personnel doing the trimming should be implemented.
Overgrown nails to this extent can cause discomfort to the animals and the misalignment it causes can contribute to
gait abnormalities and degenerative joint disease. Animals that have progressed to the point of anatomical distortionneed frequent corrective trimming to get and maintain them as close to normal as is possible.
Correct in 30 days, by 11/24/2017.
This inspection was conducted on 10/24-25/2017 accompanied by facility personnel, and the exit interview was
conducted with OCV and IACUC personnel.
