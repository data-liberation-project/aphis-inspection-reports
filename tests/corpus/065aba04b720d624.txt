3.75(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
Excessive rust was observed on each of the three outdoor primary lemur enclosures as follows:
• Two primary enclosures that group-housed lemurs both had excessive rust on the lower enclosure panels. The rust was
found to be pitting and flaking on the frame around the lower mesh panels on two sides of each enclosure.
• In the singly housed lemur enclosure, two areas of excessive rust had caused deterioration of the enclosure’s metal
poles that anchor the chain-link. One area had completely rusted through the enclosure’s lower horizontal metal pole at
the center back wall leaving approximately 16 inches of missing pipe with jagged metal edges remaining. The defect was
covered with a metal grate, but the rust continued along that lower metal pipe to the right rear corner of the enclosure.
There, it was rusted away at both the horizontal (missing approximately 4 inches) and the vertical portion (missing
approximately 2 inches) of the metal pipes that made up that bottom right corner leaving sharp jagged edges as well.
More rust was observed flaking on most of the mesh panel at the left side of the enclosure where the lemur climbs. All
the rusted areas and sharp points were accessible to the lemur.

Lemurs were coming into contact with the rusted areas and the singly housed lemur was also exposed to sharp jagged
edges. Excessive rust on surfaces indicate that the surfaces can no longer be adequately cleaned and sanitized. In


addition, the excessive rust can affect the structural strength of the metal and exposure to jagged metal edges could
injure the lemurs. Rusty areas that cannot be treated, that have diminished structural strength, or are missing, will need
to be replaced. Correct by ensuring that any significantly rusted surfaces that are in contact with the primates are
repaired or replaced and also have no sharp points.

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two separate perimeter fences surrounding the ring-tailed lemurs' primary enclosures were not sufficient for non-human
primates:
• One perimeter fence surrounding two separate primary enclosures for group-housed lemurs was insufficient in height
(varying from a minimum of 2 feet, due to rolled fencing materials lying up against the current perimeter fence, to a
maximum of 45 inches tall). This perimeter fence also had gaps between two separate fence posts that were adjacent to
opposite sides of a food storage building causing approximately 5-8” wide gaps. An access gate of this perimeter fence
was found open during inspection and holes below the fence were also observed. The licensee stated the holes were
caused by a tortoise kept on the property that has been digging (one area was approximately 2 feet long by 3 feet deep
by 3 feet wide with a piece of sheet metal overlying the hole, another hole approximately 18 inches long by 12 inches
deep by 12 inches wide had fencing material lying over it). Also, vegetation was overgrowing the 37 inch tall section of
perimeter fence from the neighboring property. The vegetation was touching this portion of the perimeter fence along the
shared property line for approximately 50 feet.
• Another lemur, singly housed away from the other lemurs, was enclosed in a separate perimeter fence that was 6 feet
high but not 3 feet from her primary enclosure. It was no more than approximately 12 inches away along two sides of her
primary enclosure, and at one area, was touching her enclosure due to a gap of approximately 9 inches where the 6-foot-
tall panels did not touch to make a continuous perimeter.



The lack of an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the non-human primates within the facility in that there
isn’t an adequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or a sufficient
barrier to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. A perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet high for non-human
primates, as well as a minimum of 3 feet away from the primary enclosures, is needed. The perimeter fence must be
constructed to prevent unauthorized humans and other animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going
through or under it. The facility shall ensure the primary enclosures for the non-human primates, are enclosed by an
appropriate perimeter fence, or a variance, if appropriate, needs to be obtained and can be requested from the
Administrator/Regional Office.

Primary enclosures.
Upon inspection, the outdoor enclosure of the singly housed ring-tailed lemur had a large fan that had a live unprotected
electrical cord powering it to cool the lemur and was accessible to the animal. This large fan was attached to the primary
enclosure and the electrical cord powering the fan was within the reach of the lemur (approximately 12 inches away). The
spacing of the wire mesh of the primary enclosure was large enough to allow the lemur’s hands, arms and/or head and
mouth (observed this during the inspection) through the mesh to the location of the powered electrical cord. Electrical
cords pose a significant health risk to animals that may chew or pull on them. Unprotected powered electrical cords that
are within an animal’s reach allows access to an electrical hazard that can cause electrocution, injury and/or death. The
primary enclosure must be constructed and maintained so that it protects the non-human primate from injury including
limiting access to electrical cords.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The documented environmental enrichment plan for the non-human primates was incomplete. It did not describe the plan
for the social needs and special considerations of the singly housed female ring-tailed lemur named Tink. Tink is housed
far enough away from the group housed lemurs that she cannot easily see them. A well-documented and complete plan
covering social grouping provisions as well as special attention provided to singly housed individuals is extremely
important to ensure the psychological well-being of the non-human primates. The facility must develop, in accordance
with the currently accepted professional standards and as directed by the attending veterinarian, a documented plan for
the environmental enrichment that addresses the social needs and special considerations of the singly housed lemur.

Facilities, general.
Two separate areas were not found in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or to contain the animals:
• The outdoor primary enclosure for two African Crested porcupines contained a wooden doghouse as a shelter, but it
was missing approximately 1/3 of one of the side walls that was also splintered due to chewing, per the licensee, by the
animals.
• The outdoor primary enclosure housing two Patagonian cavies and one red kangaroo had multiple holes below the
bottom of their enclosure’s fence. The animals have been trying to dig under the enclosure (the kangaroo was observed
digging during the inspection) resulting in three holes along the bottom edge of the enclosure as measured
(approximately) below:
* 3 feet long by 6 inches deep by 12 inches wide
* 12 inches long by 5 inches deep by 8 inches wide
* 12 inches long by 6 inches deep by 18 inches wide with a metal mesh panel placed over the exterior portion of the hole


outside the enclosure.

The porcupines’ shelter is not structurally sound and therefore poses a safety hazard. An injury could occur from the
splinters and sharp points as well. The holes along the bottom of the primary enclosure of the Patagonian cavies and red
kangaroo may allow escape and therefore would not adequately contain the animals. The porcupine shelter needs to be
repaired or replaced and the holes below the Patagonian cavies and red kangaroo's shared enclosure needs to be
repaired so the animals are adequately contained.

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence surrounding the primary enclosures for the coatimundis, kinkajous, porcupines, Patagonian cavies,
and a red kangaroo was insufficient in height since it varied from a minimum of 2 feet (due to rolled fencing materials lying
up against the perimeter fence) to a maximum of 45 inches tall. It also had gaps in the fence where the perimeter fence
posts did not touch the food storage building’s walls on two opposite sides leaving an approximately 5-8 inches width gap
on each side, an access gate in the perimeter fence was found open during the inspection, multiple holes were found
below the fence in different areas that the licensee stated were caused by a tortoise kept on the property that had been
digging (one area was approximately 2 feet long by 3 feet deep by 3 feet wide with a piece of metal overlying the hole,
another hole approximately 18 inches long by 12 inches deep by 12 inches wide had fencing material lying over it), and
overgrowth of vegetation from the neighboring property was touching the top of the perimeter fence (37 inches tall at this
portion) along the shared property line for approximately 50 feet.

The lack of an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the animals within the facility in that there isn’t an
adequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or a sufficient barrier


to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. A perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet high, as well as a minimum of 3
feet away from the primary enclosures, is needed and must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the animals in the
facility. The facility shall ensure the primary enclosures for the species listed above are enclosed by an appropriate
perimeter fence, or a variance, if appropriate, needs to be obtained and can be requested from the Administrator/Regional
Office.
