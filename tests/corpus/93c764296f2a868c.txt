must include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each outdoor facility, and that are
large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about
freely. The dealer must provide all animals in outdoor housing with a shelter structure at all times to protect them
from the elements, allow them to stay clean and dry and to protect their health and welfare.
