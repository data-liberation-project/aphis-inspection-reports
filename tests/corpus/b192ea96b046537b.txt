2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Male mini-Australian Shepherd ("Kip Evans", DOB 04-15-17) has poor dental health. A thick buildup of dark brown tartar
is coating the majority of the surface of the upper left and right canine teeth and cheek teeth. The upper gums on both
sides of the mouth are moderately reddened. The dog had received a physical exam from the attending veterinarian on
September 16, 2021. A dental grade of "3" had been assigned to the dog and the veterinarian stated on the exam report
"Needs dental prophy done within 60 days (Before 11-16-21)". At the time of the current inspection, this dog has not
received the required dental treatment.

Female mini-Australian shepherd ("Lollipop", DOB 03-16-12) has poor dental health. A buildup of light brown colored
tartar is located along the gum line of the upper right canine tooth and cheek teeth. Dark brown colored tartar is fully
encasing the large upper left cheek tooth. The dog had received a physical exam from the attending veterinarian on
September 16, 2021. A dental grade of "3" had been assigned to the dog and the veterinarian stated on the exam report
"Needs dental prophy done within 60 days (Before 11-16-21)". At the time of the current inspection, this dog has not
received the required dental treatment.

Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. Failure to provide the treatment required by the attending

veterinarian could cause the issue to worsen and the health and well-being of the animal may suffer.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases. The licensee must have the
above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment
plan. The licensee must ensure that all treatments required by a veterinarian are given as instructed and that each dog
receives adequate veterinary care.

Housing facilities, general.
A 7-8 week old Boston terrier puppy was observed in an enclosure with two adult French bulldogs that were neither its
dam or foster dam. The puppy had crawled through a gap located beneath the fence panel dividing its enclosure from the
French bulldogs. The inspector watched the puppy crawl back through the gap and enter its original enclosure which
contained its dam and littermates. Failure of the enclosure to contain the animal may result in injury as well as the
inability to access appropriate food, water, and shelter.

Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury and contain the animals securely.
The licensee must alter the enclosure in a manner that eliminates the ability of the puppy to pass through the gap and into
the adjacent enclosure. The licensee must ensure that the enclosures contain the dogs at all times.

To be corrected by: The facility representative placed a concrete block on top of the gap beneath the fence, therefore,
stopping the puppy from escaping.


This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
