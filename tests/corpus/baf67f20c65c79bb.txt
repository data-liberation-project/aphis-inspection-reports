ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Moles are a covered species and are not included in the facility’s approved written Program of Veterinary Care
(PVC). All covered species should be addressed in the PVC to ensure the facility has a program to follow
concerning the care of all the animals.
Failure to do so could adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals. A complete and accurate written
Program of Veterinary Care with consultation from the attending veterinarian must be in place.
