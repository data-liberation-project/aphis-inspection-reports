ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Sec. 2.40 Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors). (b) (2).
* The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is incomplete and inaccurate. The plan does not list the
vaccinations and medications that are being used in the facility. The owner stated, that a Saint Bernards right eye
had been treated with (cid:28)penicillin(cid:29). However, there was no bottle of the medication of the premises labeled with
instructions for usage and the (cid:28)penicillin(cid:29) was not listed with instructions in the Program of Veterinary Care. A written
Program of Veterinary Care Plan without proper instructions from the Attending Veterinarian for usage of the
vaccinations and medications can potentially affect the 20 adult dogs(cid:25) health and well-being. The Program of
Veterinary Care must be completely filled out by the Attending Veterinarian with instructions of proper usage of the
vaccinations and medications. Thus, proper usage of the vaccinations and medications will ensure the health and
well-being of the dogs.
* Enclosure three, counting from the south in the North Kennel Building, has a 3 year old, female Saint Bernard, (not
identified) with a large clump of matted hair on the neck. This clump of matted hair is approximately 5(cid:29) " long by 3(cid:29)"
wide. The hair is tangled and the skin cannot be visualized because of the thickness of the tangled hair. This large
clump of matted hair can cause skin irritation and disease and discomfort. Mats can affect the animals(cid:25) ability to
regulate its body temperature. All dogs must be properly groomed on a regular basis to prevent mats or dog hair
from tangling together in large clumps. This will prevent skin irritation, disease and discomfort.
* Enclosure four counting for the west South Kennel building has a 4 year old, male Saint Bernard (not identified)
whose right eye is bright red in the white portions of the eye. There is clear discharge from the eye. The owner
stated, the dog had been treated with (cid:28)penicillin(cid:29). However there was no bottle of (cid:28)penicillin(cid:29) with labeled
instructions on premises upon request. (cid:28) The eye can potentially cause discomfort and pain to the animal. This
Saint Bernard must be seen by the Attending Veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of
this consultation and instructions of medications used for treatment must be kept and provided upon request for the
next inspection. This will ensure the animal receives proper veterinary care for the right eye.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Sec. 2.50 Time and method of identification. (a).
* The owner stated that all the dogs on the premises are identified with microchips. However, upon request to
inquire the microchip number for two adult dogs, the microchip scanner was not available. A microchip scanner
must be made available upon request for identification of the dogs. This will allow for certainty of the identification
of the dogs. For future inspections the microchip scanner must be available.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Sec. 2.75 Records: Dealers and exhibitors. (a)(1).
* Upon the request, the records of the (cid:28)Dogs on Hand(cid:29) was not available. A record of the (cid:28)Dogs on Hand(cid:29) must be
kept and maintained for the 20 Adult dogs. This will allow with certainty and track the movement of the dogs held
on the premises.

3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (a) Structure.
*Counting from the south of the North Kennel Building, a support post for divider paneling between enclosures three
and four is chewed or rotted off at the bottom near the concrete flooring. This is causing the panel divider to lean to
one side. This is not structurally sound and could allow for injury the two adult dogs housed in those enclosures.
The dogs could get stuck in the paneling from going through or under the panel divider. The dogs could get stuck or
injured from possibly fighting through the gaps the lean paneling is creating.
Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept
in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury. These posts, doors, and enclosure need to berepaired or replaced to prevent injury to the dogs and to maintain structural soundness of the enclosure fencing.
3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces--(1) (i).
* Four metal dog doors in the North Kennel Building and Four Metal dog doors in the South Kennel Building were
excessively rusty. The rusty surfaces do not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization. Thus, improper cleaning
and sanitization can allow for increased disease potential for the eight adult dogs.
All metal surfaces must be free of excessive rusty that prevents required cleaning and sanitization. Proper cleaning
and sanitization will decrease the disease potential for the dogs.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sec. 3.1 Housing facilities, general. (c) Surfaces--(2).
* In the North Kennel Building, seven wood dog boxes, housing seven adult dogs, have a wood divider inside.
These wood dividers have dog doors that are excessively chewed and scratch along the edges. The North Kennel
Building has three support post and the South Kennel Building has four support posts that were excessively chewed
and scratched. These posts are located supporting the divider panels between the enclosures housing nine adult
dogs.
These excessively chewed and scratched wood surfaces do not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization.
Therefore, increasing the disease potential for the animals. All wood surfaces must be maintained on a regular
basis or impervious to moisture. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitization. With proper cleaning and
sanitization the disease potential for the animals is decrease.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.Sec. 3.6 Primary enclosures. (a) General requirements. (2) (i).
* Enclosure three counting from the south, North Kennel Building, has wire that is protruding inward into the
enclosure. These sharp points are approximately lower to midlevel on the one Saint Bernard housed in the
enclosure. Sharp protruding points can cause injury to the animals. All enclosures, housing dogs, must be kept
free of sharp protruding points for injury prevention.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Sec. 3.11 Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control. (c).
* The North Kennel Building had an excessive accumulation of dust and cobwebs on the wood dog boxes. There is
an excessive accumulation of empty dog food bags and dust around the wood boxes. There is an excessive
accumulation of dog hair in the wood boxes, along the bottom of the divider panels and primary enclosure fencing.
The South Kennel Building had excessive accumulation of dust and cobwebs on the dog boxes and alleyway floor.
There was an excessive accumulation of dog hair along the bottom of the divider panels and primary enclosure
fencing.
The accumulation of empty dog food bags, dust and dog hair can attract and provide breeding and living areas for
vermin, pests and other rodents. Thus, affecting the 20 adult dogs(cid:25) health and well-being. Premises must be kept
free of trash, accumulations of dust, dog hair and cobwebs. This will facilitate cleaning of the premises and pests
control. Therefore, protecting the animals(cid:25) health and well-being.
