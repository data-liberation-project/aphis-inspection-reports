HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Several of the barriers around the enclosures in the park are in disrepair and need to be addressed. Many of the
barriers have wood posts that are coming out of the ground and the fence line is falling inwards towards the
enclosure. Some of the fencing is no longer connected at joints and need to re secured. These barriers need to be
addressed to function as intended and keep sufficient distance between the guests and animals for the safety of the
animals and the guests.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** A 6-week old lynx cub was injured when it was in a holding area at the main building. Three cubs were left in an
area with an unsecured play pen and the play pen fell on the cub causing a fracture in the right humerus and a
fractured scapula. These animals need to be kept in an area that is safe with husbandry items secured to prevent
injury.
Correct from this day forward.
*** The fence for the primary enclosure for the one large farm pig is in disrepair. Several sections of the wood fence
are rotted and the wood is breaking apart from the posts. The inspector was able to easily pull the fence downward
and the fence is very unstable. This fence needs to be replaced and maintained in good repair for the safety and
containment of the animal.

*** The shelter in the wolf holding area needs to be replaced. The shelter box is made of wood and has holes in the
side walls and sharp edges. This needs to be addressed to keep the shelter in good repair. Additionally the secondholding area for the wolves has significant digging in the corner and concrete bricks left in the area. The bricks
should be removed to prevent any possible injury and the holes around the fence should be filled in appropriately.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** Two pigs are housed in enclosures with no access to a mud wallow or pool. Enclosures must be designed to
provide sufficient space to allow animals to make normal postural and social adjustments. Normal postural
adjustments for pigs would be to get into a wallow during hot days to allow their body temperature to cool off
through thermoregulation. Additionally mud baths help with parasite control and sun protection. Providing a mud
wallow helps promote these normal adjustments for these animal.This needs to be addressed for the health and
comfort of the animals.

FEEDING.
*** Three Lynx cubs were pulled from mom to be hand reared at a week old. The cubs were put on a goats milk
formula with no additional supplement. The diet was not approved by the attending veterinarian. A week after being
pulled a vitamin tablet was added to the formula with turkey baby food. The vitamin was crushed and mixed with the
formula divided between the three cubs so there is no way to determine how much vitamin each cub was receiving.
When the female cub was injured radiographs were taken of her and of a male cub still being parent reared. The
radiographs showed lower bone density for the female and the fractures in the right humerus and scapula. This low
bone density can be a contributing factor to injuries the animal sustained when the play pen fell on top of her in
holding. The male cub who is parent reared had a higher bone density.
When these cubs are pulled for the purpose of hand rearing the diet formula and amounts should be directed by the
attending veterinarian. This should be documented prior to the first bottle fed to assure the cubs are receiving
sufficient quantity and nutritive value to meet their rapidly growing needs. This needs to be addressed for the health
of these cubs and all future hand reared cubs at the facility.

SANITATION.
*** There was an excessive amount of weed and tall grass growth around the back holding areas for all animal
species. In addition the storage area of miscellaneous building materials and cages in the area behind elk barn is
also overgrown. These overgrown areas become breeding and living areas for pests. These areas around the
animals need to be maintained to promote good housekeeping practices.

EMPLOYEES.
*** The facility has not had a Supervisor with a background in Animal care for approximately the past 18 months.
The facility has a low number of animal keeper staff that appears to struggle with the work load of the facility based
on the amount of non compliant items in the report. In addition the third year keeper who was put in charge and
made direct decisions about the initial formula mixture for the cubs without consulting the attending vet and was
acting as a supervisor without the level of experience or background that would be expected for a facility of this size.
Current best practices for an animal facility such as this zoo would be to have an Animal Curator who has authority
over the keeper staff with a background in animal care. This needs to be addressed to assure that the animal
keepers are adequately trained to maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices and care.
The facility needs to have a plan moving forward to hire a supervisor with a background in animal care.

An exit briefing was conducted with the interim Executive Director and the Zoo Board at the time of the inspection.
