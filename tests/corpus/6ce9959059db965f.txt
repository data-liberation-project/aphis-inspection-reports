FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the commissary(cid:25)s feed storage room, multiple bags of monkey pellets were found directly on the ground. Storing
pelleted food directly on the floor can lead to mold and contamination from vermin and other pests. Supplies of food
and bedding must be stored in ways that protect it from deterioration, molding or contamination.
