3.6(a)(2)(11)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The dog run is divided into 2 sections. The dogs must go through a pass through that is built into the enclosure
divider. The size of the pass through is both too short and too narrow for the dogs to pass through making normal
postural adjustments. The dogs must bend down and squeeze through the opening to get from one side of the
enclosure to the other.
Enclosure design shall allow all dogs to make normal postural adjustments within the enclosure

SANITATION.
The circumference around several pools located at the waters edge in the dolphin stadium are cracking with loose
pieces of concrete located at the edge of these pools. Additionally there are areas of loose flaking paint on the walls
of the meet & greet dolphin pool.
These pieces of debris can easily fall into these pools and potentially be ingested by the dolphins and pose a risk of
injury.The concrete at one area of the sea lion stage is now worn down to the rock matrix and porous. This particular area
can no longer be adequately cleaned &/or sanitized, and the rough surface poses a risk of abrasive injury to the
pinnipeds.
These surfaces shall be repaired or replaced to keep them in good repair and prevent possible injury to the marine
mammals.
