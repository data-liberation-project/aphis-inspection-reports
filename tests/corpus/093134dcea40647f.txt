FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Ventilation.
There was a strong ammonia odor in the building during inspection. During the inspection I noted my throat and
eyes felt irritated. Strong ammonia odors can cause animals to do poorly and get sick easier. The building must be
provided with fresh air while maintaining a temperature between 60 and 85 degrees F. Cleaning enclosures more
often can also help with the ammonia odor. To promote animal health, the ammonia odor must be decreased
greatly.
3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(1) Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair...
Some feeders since last inspection have been replaced, however at least 5 feeders were observed to be
excessively rusted and/or have sharp edges on them. Sharp edges could injure guinea pigs. Rusty feeders cannot
be cleaned effectively. Feeders must be repaired or replaced and all surfaces in the enclosures must be free of
sharp edges to prevent injury to the guinea pigs.
3.31(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
The ceiling and areas around northwest corner and northwest gas heater had an excessive amount of dust and
cobwebs. This can create a fire hazard. To protect animal health, routinely clean the building from ceiling to the
floor to prevent buildup of cobwebs and dust on the walls, heaters, and ceilings.3.51(d)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
(d) Interior surfaces.
Rabbit enclosures west of the feed storage have painted wooden corners. These corners have been chewed and
worn so that they are no longer impervious to moisture. Some nesting boxes had corners that were also bare wood
and could soak water up. Surfaces in rabbit enclosures must not soak water or moisture up. Surfaces that can
soak liquids up cannot be cleaned effectively and can cause animals to get sick. Replace or repair wooden rabbit
surfaces so that moisture cannot soak into them.
Make all surfaces that rabbits contact impervious to moisture (waterproof) by April 30, 2014.
3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(1) Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury...
A feeder in a rabbit's enclosure was noted to have a hole rusted through the top, exposing sharp edges. This could
injure the rabbit. Replace or repair this feeder and any other rabbit feeders with sharp edges to protect rabbits from
injury.
Corners in many enclosures had the wood chewed down exposing sharp staple or screw points. Other enclosures
had wire points sticking into the corners. Sharp points could injure rabbits. Repair and maintain enclosures free
from sharp points.
