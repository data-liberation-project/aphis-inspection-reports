2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a male white poodle (microchip # OAO-327-6515, DOB 2008) with severe dental tartar, sores on both
front feet and excessive matting. Severe dental tartar and creamy yellow discharge was observed on both sides
(left/right) and the upper/lower cheek teeth. Gum tissue was bright red, puffy and pulling away from the tooth root.
Both front feet had open wounds approximated the size of a pea on the top of the foot. The area of the wounds
were wet, red and swollen. Matting of the fur was loosely over the body of the poodle with tighter, heavier and more
soiled matting around the front feet. The mats were varying in size but all of them on the feet were wet and dark
material was present with in the mats. Excessive matting with thick wet, dark oily material was seen on the edge of
both ears and inner ear flaps.
There was a chocolate and white chihuahua (microchip # OAO-271-6111, DOB 2010) with severe dental tartar.
Severe dental tartar and creamy yellow discharge was observed on the upper/lower right canine teeth. Gum tissue
was bright red, puffy and pulling away from the tooth root. The rest of the teeth were not present.
There was a female English Bulldog (DOB 2009, named Helen) observed squinting. The inner eyelids were vibrant
red, swollen and excessively tearing with a yellow brown discharge encompassing the outer eyelids. The white
portion in both eyes was severely bloodshot. The surface of both eyes were moderately cloudy.
There was a female English Bulldog ( DOB 2015, named Violet) observed consistently squinting her right eye. At
times she would completely close her eye with excessive blinking.The inner eyelid was red and swollen. She pulled
her head away when trying to examine the eye closer. Mild cloudiness was observed throughout the surface of the
right eye.
There was a male English Bulldog (DOB 2014, named Zazu) with patchy, swollen, red and hairless regions on both
cheeks, neck and both front feet. On the right cheek was an irregularly shaped dark, yellow, crusty region
approximately 2 centimeters in diameter. The entire muzzle, chin and neck, down to chest bone was moist, sticky,
swollen, hairless and severely red in color. Both front feet were warm to the touch, severely red, and swollen large
patches of hair loss. The licensee stated all 5 dogs were microchipped but the reader was non-functional. He supplied two of the
microchip numbers from paper records.
Veterinary care issues such as those listed above can cause pain and discomfort to the animals and can lead to
further health complications. The licensee must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian for proper diagnosis and an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be
documented and made available to the inspectors upon request.
2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Most dogs are identified by microchip on the property; the remainder are identified by tags. The five dogs that are
listed under 2.40(b)(2) had names, but the licensee had no operable means to verify their individual identification
(microchip numbers). The licensee was able to produce a microchip reader, but it was not functioning at the time of
the inspection.
Lack of proper and effective identification does not allow for accurate records or to identify an individual animal for
treatment. The licensee must have an approved form of identification, including microchips, but must be legible. A
functioning microchip reader is required to have the information on the microchip legible.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: January 20, 2017
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Throughout the facility there were chewed and worn surfaces in multiple enclosures housing 23 adults and 63
puppies.
***A chewed rim of a water bowl with hair and debris caught in the rough surface
***An upholstered bench with a hole of approximately 2 feet in diameter and went all the way through the seat
exposing metal springs.
***All of the carpet squares in with puppies had frayed edges with strings of varying lengths.
***A front of a wooden shelter in an outdoor enclosure had chewed surface on the edge to the left of the egress
door.
Chewed and worn surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which can lead to disease hazards. All surfaceof housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized
must be replaced when worn or soiled. The damaged and worn surfaces and items must be replaced or altered in a
manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization to occur and to prevent injuries from ingestion or entanglement.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces remain in good repair at all times.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Throughout the facility in multiple enclosures housing 29 adults there was brown grimy residue on egress doors,
thresholds, exterior walls, and corners of the concrete floor enclosures. In the outdoor portion of a sheltered
enclosure housing 6 puppies there was a build-up of feces covering more than 75% of the surface, in the holes of
the plastic mesh flooring.
The build-up of dirt, feces, and debris can harbor diseases. The licensee must spot-clean all used primary
enclosures daily, and sanitize at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation
of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, VMO Cole, and VMO Unck.
