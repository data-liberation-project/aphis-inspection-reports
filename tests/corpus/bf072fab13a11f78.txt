Contingency planning.

handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster is
necessary to help prepare for proper care of the animals during/immediately after the emergency/disaster. The facility
shall develop and document in writing a contingency plan. Correct by 10/15/22.

Separation.
The alpaca/llama enclosure currently houses 5 alpacas and 1 llama. One male alpaca currently does not get along with
the llama. When they are put into the enclosure together the animals vocalize at first until they quiet down. The alpaca
also tries to get out under the fence of the enclosure. Wool from the alpaca was noted caught at the bottom wire of the
fence in a low spot. Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible in order to prevent injuries and


discomfort. The alpacas and llama must be housed such that the animals in the same enclosure are compatible. Correct
by 10/15/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
