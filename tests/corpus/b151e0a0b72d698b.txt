2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility veterinarians have prescribed daily treatments for three elephants (Nichole, Sara, Rudy) but the
treatment logs show that there are gaps of between 1-4 days where treatments have not been given. The
employee that signs the treatment log and is the primary individual administering the medications stated that he
thought the days that the elephants are transported in the train cars may account for missing a day's dose since he
cannot access the elephants to give the treatments. He could not account for the gaps of 2-4 days where
treatments were not administered. The concern that prescribed treatments were not being given as directed was
discussed during a phone call with one of the facility veterinarians. The veterinarian stated that there was supposed
to be a notation on the records indicating when and why treatments were missed but was not aware that these gaps
in treatment had occurred.
Treatments prescribed for the control of medical conditions diagnosed by the facility veterinarians should be given
as directed and, when unable to be given, that a reason for why the treatment was missed is documented. This can
help the handlers and the veterinary staff to determine if these animals are being adversely affected by missing the
doses.
Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
To be corrected from this time forward.
