2.126 CRITICAL
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
During this inspection, the inspector confirmed that there were no rabbits in the facility but was not able to determine
the disposition of the rabbits. The licensee demonstrated that the facility did not have any of the 153 rabbits listed
on the previous USDA inspection report of 15-Aug-2017.
After walking through the rabbitry, the licensee then walked away from the inspector and into her private residence
as the inspector was asking additional questions about the rabbits to complete the inspection. The inspector
concluded that the licensee had terminated the inspection. As the inspector was preparing to leave the facility, the
licensee came back out of the residence and went into her vehicle to apparently leave the premises.
Complete inspection of facilities and their records are necessary to confirm compliance with the Animal Welfare Act
(AWA) and to assess the health and welfare of regulated species.
The licensee must allow APHIS officials to inspect facilities, property, animals and records as the APHIS officials
consider necessary to enforce provisions of the AWA.
Correct from this date forward.
This inspection was conducted with Kirsty Lee. No exit briefing was conducted due to the termination of the
inspection.
This Inspection Report was sent as duplicate originals via standard mail and certified mail of the US Postal System.
