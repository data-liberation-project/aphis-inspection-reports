2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Appropriate Methods of Treatment
One Chinchilla BDZ-289 was noted as having a large protruding growth coming out of its neck. The licensee stated
that he had discovered the problem earlier and intended on taking the animal to the veterinarian the next day,
however there was no proof that the problem had been noted before today, nor that there were any intentions on
having it treated. Health problems that may arise must be addressed by a veterinarian or they may lead to more
serious problems in the future. The above listed animal must be seen by a veterinarian.
3.125(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
REPEAT
In at least 6 enclosures, there are blocks of wood being used as enrichment. The animals have chewed these wood
blocks to the extent that they are exposing nails which were inside them that now poses an injury hazard. Most of
these were removed during the inspection. Several feeders throughout the facility has jagged rusty edges that may
come into contact with the chinchillas when they eat. Several enclosures were noted as having jagged, rusty points
sticking out towards the chinchillas caused by damage in the front metal wire walls of the enclosures. Several of
these were removed during the inspection. Direct injury and infection can occur by exposing animals to sharp or
rusted objects. Remove any enrichment containing sharp or rusty objects.
DIRECT/REPEAT
Enclosures housing 131 adult Chinchillas contained a tray on the floor in the past which the animals had directcontact with. These trays have since been removed, exposing 1 inch by 1 inch metal wire flooring underneath.
Other enclosures in the back room have always had 1 inch 1 inch flooring. The flooring does not protect the
animals from injury, as the gaps between the wire are much larger than the feet of the chinchillas. Materials that
come in contact with the animals must protect the animals from injury. Ensure that the enclosures are structurally
sound and maintained appropriately.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
Water Receptacles
There continues to be many sections of the watering line that has an excessive buildup of hair, cobwebs, and
excreta built up on them. At least 5 glass water bottles being used in enclosures without watering lines have a
green hazy buildup on the inside walls of them. Unclean watering lines can contaminate the water supply which can
affect the animals in a negative way. All watering lines must be cleaned or replaced in order to assure a clean
supply of water to the animals.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures
There continues to be an excessive accumulation of excreta in several at least 3 of the primary enclosures. The
facility failed to maintain the primary caging of these animals in a sanitary condition. Unsanitary conditions can lead
to biological disease hazards and can affect the comfort of the animals as well as their health and well-being.
Eliminate the buildup of waste material from the primary enclosures and maintain in a clean and sanitary condition.
Exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
