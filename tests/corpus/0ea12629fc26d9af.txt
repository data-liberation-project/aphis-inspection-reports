Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Mastiff "Piper" microchip number 90011002498391 was bite by another female mastiff on 1-February-2022 on
her left font leg. The wound is approximately 2 inches by 2 inches in size and is black around the edges with pink tissue
present in the middle with a callus forming in the pink area. In the wrinkles of the wound is moist pink skin and there are
pieces of straw and hair stuck to the wound. The licensee asked the veterinarian over the phone at that time if it was okay
to put "Wound-Kote" blue lotion spray wound dressing on the wound once a day or every other day. The veterinarian
verbally stated that treatment was acceptable. The licensee has been applying the spray every day or every other day
depending on how it looks and has not contacted the vet since that initial conversation. The inspector attempted to
contact this veterinarian but they no longer work at the practice and there were no medical records present for this dog at
the veterinary practice under the name "Piper" or her microchip number. This dog also has an abnormal skin condition on
her left hip that the licensee states is a 'hot spot' and is treating with the same wound spray once a day or every other
day. There is no approved treatment plan for skin conditions that is approved by the attending veterinarian.

Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being can be discussed and a treatment plan can be made. The facility
must communicate any animal health concerns with their attending veterinarian so that an effective treatment plan can be

put in place.

This dog must be seen by a licensed veterinarian by end of business 15-April-2022 and create an effective treatment
plan.

Time and method of identification.
There are 3 litters of puppies; 2 litters of Huskies totaling 7 puppies that are approximately 2 weeks old and a litter of 8
Golden Retriever puppies approximately 1 week old per the licensee, that have no official identification. Official
identification is necessary for APHIS officials to be able to trace animal movements. The licensee must assign an official
identification number to each of these dogs in timely manner after their birth.

To be corrected by: 15-April-2022.
2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
During the fall harvest season of 2021, a male Welsh Pembroke Corgi "Okie" microchip number 900215000488887 ran
off of the property while out of his enclosure to exercise. The licensee made attempts to locate the dog but the dog was
never recovered. The dog was marked as deceased on the Record of Acquisition of Dogs on 1-October-2021.

An animal escape can cause severe distress, trauma, and/or physical harm to the animal. Handling of all animals must be
done in a manner that cannot lead to an animal escape and prevent trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or
unnecessary discomfort. The licensee has since taken additional precautions to ensure an animal escape in less likely to
happen in the future.


To be corrected: From this day forward.
3.6(a)(2)(ix)

Primary enclosures.
There are at least 13 dog enclosures housing approximately 31 adult dogs that have heated plastic water bowls that have
been heavily chewed on. Surfaces that have been chewed on cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized to prevent disease
hazards to the dogs. The surfaces must be repaired or replaced so they are able to be readily cleaned and sanitized.

To be corrected by: 3-May-2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
