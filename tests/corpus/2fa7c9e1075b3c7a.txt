HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The roof over the Vanishing South building which houses several species of non human primates needs to be
addressed. There are large holes in the ceiling where water damage is evident. In addition it was raining throughout
the inspection process and while walking in the building rain drops came down on the inspector. Based on the
damage on the ceiling there is a concern that sections of the ceiling could collapse potentially into animal holding
areas. Housing facilities for non human primates must be kept in good repair for the safety of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** Several freezers throughout the facility have broken seals along the doors and the doors are no longer creating a
good seal. The freezer in the rainforest building has a build up of ice along the back wall and shelves. The
fridge/freezer in the giraffe area has a weak seal and cracks along the door which need to be addressed. Finally the
freezers in the lion/tiger building area also have cracks along the doors and weak seals for the freezers. These
doors need to be addressed to make sure that perishable food items are adequately protected from deterioration.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** During the inspection the temperature was approximately 45 deg F and it rained a light steady rain all day. The
tiger out on exhibit was waiting by the shift door and did not have access to a shelter area to get out of inclement
weather. Also the Zebra were standing near their barn door that was also closed. The facility states it has protocol
for the animals to have access to their holding areas in inclement weather or when the temperatures fall below a
certain point, but these protocols were not being followed. This needs to be addressed with the facility staff and
animals given access to allow them the choice to get out of inclement weather. Correct by: Dec 25, 2015
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative at the time of the inspection.
