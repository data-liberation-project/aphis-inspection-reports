HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The enclosure housing the single lemur did not have a public barrier to prevent contact with the animal. The wire
mesh of the enclosure is large enough that people could stick fingers or objects through the mesh. The lemur was
observed sticking his fingers through the wire. There was an area of the mesh where there was a larger opening,
which the licensee stated was to facilitate feeding treats to the lemur.
Unauthorized contact poses a possible risk of injury to both members of the public and the lemur.
The facility must handle animals so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient
distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals
and the public.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The camel enclosure, which contained one camel, did not provide any natural or artificial shelter from inclement
weather. Shelter from inclement weather is necessary to provide protection and comfort for the animal. The facility
shall provide natural or artificial shelter from inclement weather.3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The fence at the perimeter of the property adjacent to the road and containing the exotic hoofstock was not
continuous, was not structurally sound, and was not 6 feet tall in all areas. The perimeter fence was falling down in
some areas. There were multiple gaps between where different fencing materials came together.
Perimeter fencing prevents unauthorized entry of people and animals. Animal injury may result from poor fencing or
from attempts of the animals to escape through damaged fencing or subsequent to their escape.
