2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:05 pm on
18-Jun-19.
The licensee's son said that she was not at home and he did not know when she would return. I called the
licensee's cell phone and left a message to see if she would be home soon, but did not get a reply.
