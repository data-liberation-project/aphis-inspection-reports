2.38(b)(1)(2)
MISCELLANEOUS.
Records demonstrating the IACUC's humane care and use program review, facility inspections and reports to the
Institutional Official were not available for review at the time of inspection. Lack of access to records for review does
not allow APHIS Officials to determine if the IACUC is performing all functions as required. Ensure all required
records are maintained and available for review at the facility during business hours. Correct from this time forward.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with Farm Manager, Attending Veterinarian, VP of Development and this
Veterinary Medical Officer.
End of report.
