3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
At the time of inspection, there is no written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for Dogs. A written Program of Veterinary
Care (PVC) for Dogs is required to ensure that there is an expectation about the care provided to any dogs at the facility.
Failure to establish and maintain a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for Dogs can decrease the ability to ensure
optimal care of the dogs.
A written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for Dogs must be established and maintained so that the registrant has a
plan for providing adequate preventative care and treatments as necessary. The plan must include all of the required
components as listed in the Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations, Part 3, Subpart A, Section 3.13.
