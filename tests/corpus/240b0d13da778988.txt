Outdoor housing facilities.
Two separate outdoor pens were housing 4 large dogs each. One pen contained 4 Bernese Mountain dogs, and the other
pen contained 3 Bernese Mountain dogs and 1 Standard sized poodle. Each pen was observed having one small,
circular, igloo-like shelter within them that measured approximately 3 feet by 3 feet. The licensee stated these dogs are
housed in these pens all the time. There are no other shade structures located within the pens. Animals housed in
outdoor facilities that do not have access to shade can be injurious to their health. Animals housed in outdoor pens that
do not include shelter with enough space for all animals can lead to health problems and competition among the animals.
Ensure one or more shelter structures are accessible to each animal that are large enough to allow each animal in the
shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. In addition to the shelter structures,
ensure one or more separate outside areas of shade are provided that are large enough to contain all the animals at one
time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun. Correct by close of business on October 7th, 2021.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Most of the primary enclosures housing adult dogs had brown, waxy debris mixed with hair built up and caked along the
bottom seams of the enclosures. Brown, waxy material was also observed caked on the doggy doors that lead to the


outside runs. Accumulations of dirt and debris are hazardous to the health and wellbeing of the animals. Clean primary
enclosures as often as necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
