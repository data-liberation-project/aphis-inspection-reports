3.126(d) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Between the evening of November 22,2016 and the morning of November 23, 2016 the temporary housing facility
for the bat colony flooded. After speaking with the curator it was determined that flooding was caused by the drain
cover being clogged with excess fruit dropped by the bats as well as the keeper turning the flowing water up to a
higher than normal rate. The standing water forced the bats, who typically drink from flowing water, to land in
standing water on the floor. 36 Jamaican Fruit Bats were found dead the morning of November 23, 2016. Another
estimated 6 bats were found to be hypothermic and were able to be rehabilitated and were all returned to the
colony. After review of necropsy records it was determined that the 36 Jamaican Fruit Bats died due to hypothermia
after exposure to the standing water. After discussion with the curator and veterinary staff, proper protocols are in
place to prevent re-occurrence. Curators informed the USDA inspector on the day of this event. Suitable methods
shall be provided to eliminate rapidly, excess water from indoor housing facilities.
This was a focused inspection to follow up on the voluntary reported incident as well as previous NCI.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with animal management staff.
