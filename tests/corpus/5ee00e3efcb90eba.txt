*** A Female Shih Tzu (#148) had lesions under her neck. The underside of this dog's neck had an area
approximately 3 inches long and 1.5 inches wide that had an area of reddened skin, lesions and scabs. After this
dog was pointed out and caught, the facility representative said they had treated this dog for neck problems, but
was not under any current treatment and didn't have any documentation of prior treatment. The condition of this
dog could indicate an injury, illness orother veterinary medical condition which may be uncomfortable. The licensee
must consult a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

transfer bottles, with no product name or expiration date of what was in the bottles. Some of the other bottles did
had a product name wrote on the bottle but no expiration date. These medications were stored with other
medications that were currently being used, and therefore ready to use. Expired medication may not work as
anticipated, could become contaminated or harm the animals. Usage of medications that are not properly labeled
may harm the animals. Licensee must establish and maintain a program that ensures medications are not used past
their labeled expiration date and ensure all transfer bottles are labeled correctly.
