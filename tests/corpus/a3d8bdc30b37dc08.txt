3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
Two dogs’ “Sierra” and “Sharla” had not received their rabies vaccine booster by 12/24/2021. The program of veterinary
care states that dogs receiving their first rabies vaccine, must receive a booster within 1 year. The program of vet care
describes how to perform surgical procedures for dewclaw removal and tail docking. The licensee told the inspectors that
he is not following these procedures as described in the program of veterinary care. The program of veterinary care is a
required document that APHIS inspectors use to determine the quality of veterinary care for the animals at a facility. This
document must be followed by the licensee to ensure adequate care and treatment of the animals. All schedules,
treatments, and procedures listed in the program of veterinary care must be followed by the licensee.
3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee has not been recording the administration of prevention for external parasites in the animal’s medical
records. It is required that all preventions, vaccinations, treatments, and testing be recorded in the animal’s medical
record. This information is needed for APHIS inspectors to evaluate the quality of medical care provided by the facility.
Record all treatments, testing, preventions vaccinations and all other medical procedures required by section 3.13 in
medical records maintained for each animal at the facility.
