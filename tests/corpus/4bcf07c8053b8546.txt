FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Facility Yard:
-There were three wooden, climbing structures for the goats which were in disrepair with loosely, attached boards
and exposed ends of sharp, protruding nails. Additionally, there were several nail heads protruding from the facility’s
main building and two other storage structures within the facility yard. Structures in disrepair and sharp, protruding
points or edges in areas of contact with the animals may lead to injury.
-Several sections of a wooden railing, material were loosely stacked against the side of a storage shed and on the
ground. Animals could potentially become injured or trapped in the railing openings if these items fall or are
knocked over.
-There was a heavily worn, sagging and loosely attached particle board covering a crawl space opening along the
side of the facility’s main building. The lack of structural stability of this board covering could lead to injury by an
animal falling through or becoming trapped within this opening.
- At least four, exposed and unprotected, extension cords connected to a single power source were lying directly on
the ground in this yard. Electrical cords located within reach of the animals pose the risk of serious injury from
electrical hazards. Two goats and one pig were freely roaming within the facility yard at time of inspection.
Coatimundi/Raccoon Enclosure: There was exposed underground wire meshing material in several sections of this
enclosure. Exposed, wire meshing may cause potential injury or entrapment of the animals.
All enclosures must be structurally sound, kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges or other
hazards in order to protect the animals from injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely
identification, facility repair and maintenance must be in place.
