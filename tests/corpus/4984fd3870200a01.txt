HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During this inspection the only employee/attendant working in the animal areas noted to be readily identifiable was
the warm room employee. The auction charges admission to the auction grounds. The inspector was approached
by two visitors with concerns thinking she was an auction employee. Members of the public were observed petting
the animals (including petting zebras and taking selfies with the zebra) by the inspector without any readily
identifiable employee or attendant present. Many of the animals housed at the auction may be potentially dangerous
to people having contact with them. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or attendant
must be present at all times during periods of public contact. Correct prior to next public auction.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
Four enclosures housing a total of six guinea pigs were noted to be too short in height (two housed two smaller
younger guinea pigs and two housed a single larger guinea pig). The enclosures measured only 4 1/2 inches tall.
The guinea pigs were not able to stand up normally on all four feet and make normal postural adjustments. The
interior height of the primary enclosures used to transport guinea pigs shall be at least 6 inches (for guinea pigs less
than 500 grams) or 7 inches high (for guinea pigs over 500 grams). Correct prior to next auction.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT NONHUMAN PRIMATES.
Two adult ring tail lemurs were housed in a wire enclosure with openings large enough (approximately 1 in x 5 in)
for them to put their hands, feet, arms and legs through the wire openings. One adult common marmoset was
housed in a wire enclosure with openings large enough for it to put its hands, arms, feet and legs through the
openings (approximately 3/4 by 1 1/2in). In both instances, all four sides and top of the enclosure were made of wire
and contained the openings. There were no solid walls and no mesh was present. An electrical cord was hanging
near the outside of the marmoset cage and could have been grabbed. The non-human primates may injure
themselves, become entrapped or injure other animals nearby/people picking up the enclosures if they extend their
body parts through the openings. The facility shall ensure that non-human primates are securely contained within
the enclosure at all times and cannot put any part of their body outside the enclosure. Correct prior to next auction.3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The weather during the auction included several periods of heavy rain and some light rain.
*The outdoor enclosures/pens in the back behind the covered barn stalls/pens are completely open to the elements
with no sides or overhead protection from inclement weather. The animals outside including the water buffalo,
watusi and bison had no protection or shelter to allow them to remain dry. The dirt in their enclosures quickly
became wet sloppy mud and by Friday there were large areas of standing water in a few of the stalls. The animals'
haircoats became wet. The mud in the enclosures was over ankle deep for many of the animals. The animals' feet
made sucking sounds when lifted by the animals to move about. In some of the pens the animals did not have any
dry ground to move to to get out of the mud/standing water.
*Three enclosures/stalls/pens in the covered barn area have one side open to the elements (pens nearest to the
back of the auction building). Two housed zebu and one housed a Scottish Highlander. The rain water was raining
into/draining into these enclosures with thick mud in all three. There was little to no dry ground for the animals to
access. By Friday, there was standing water in the pens. The lower half of the zebus' legs were covered in wet dirt.
When the zebu were standing in the muddy areas, the mud came up over their hooves and their hooves were not
visible.
*Excessively muddy/wet ground in the enclosures may lead to slipping of the animals, hoof problems and injury. In
addition, the inability to seek shelter from the inclement weather may lead to distress to the animals. Live animals
shall be provided protection to allow them to remain dry during inclement weather.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
On Friday early morning the inspector observed two ferrets in a wire enclosure with a solid bottom that had no
shavings or other absorbent material present in the enclosure. The inspector also noted two chinchillas in an
enclosure with a solid bottom which had shavings on the bottom that were thoroughly soaked with fluid such that the
bedding was a dark brown instead of a light yellow color. The chinchillas were not able to find a dry place to sit.
Their haircoats appeared damp especially on the lower half of their bodies. The inspector mentioned these
enclosures to the warm room attendant and was told that her boss had informed her that she was not to handle any
of the enclosures or animals in any way. Instead she was told to contact the owner. She had tried to contact the
owner but was unable to. The chinchilla litter was noted to have been changed by mid afternoon.
Wet bedding can no longer absorb and cover excreta which can cause the animal injury, distress, and increased
risk of disease. Animals must be provided clean litter of a suitable absorbent material that can absorb and cover
excreta. This inspection took place on May 2 and May 3.
This inspection was conducted with auction personnel.
This exit interview was conducted with undersigned facility representative.
