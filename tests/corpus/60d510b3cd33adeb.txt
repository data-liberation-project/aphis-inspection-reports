2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
The facility self-reported to APHIS officials that on February 27, 2018 a staff member mistakenly removed a section
of a guinea pig enclosure resulting in one guinea pig falling out of the enclosure to the floor. The enclosure was on
the top row of a rack, approximately five feet from the floor. The animal died shortly after falling. The employee
received refresher training on the care of guinea pigs and received a Letter of Expectation from the facility.
Animals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar
problems from occurring in the future.
Locations inspected: Primate Center, 03, 08a, 08b, 08c, 08d, 09a, 09b, 09e.
