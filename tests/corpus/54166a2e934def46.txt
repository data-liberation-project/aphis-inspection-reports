3.1(c)(1)(ii) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are screws with the sharp points penetrating through the wood of 2 shelters, affecting 3 dogs. These sharp
points, at the dogs level, could cause injury to the dogs. The licensee must repair these shelters so that there are no
sharp points and ensure that all enclosures are free of sharp points and edges which may cause injury to the dogs.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are 3 dog shelters, containing 4 dogs, that did not have enough bedding provided. There was some bedding
inside of the shelters but the bare floor was visible. When the temperature drops below 50 degrees Fahrenheit
bedding must be provided for the dogs to stay warm. The amount of bedding must be in the amount that allows the
dogs to burrow down into the bedding. When the temperature drops below 35 degrees Fahrenheit more bedding
must be added for the dogs to stay warm and protect them from the extremes of the cold weather.
Licensee corrected this at the time of inspection.
3.4(b) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At the time of inspection there was no shade structure provided for 11 dogs housed in an outdoor enclosure. The
licensee had recently moved the outdoor enclosures a couple weeks ago and had not yet replaced the shade
structures. During the daylight hours one or more separate outside areas of shade must be provided, large enough
to contain all the animals at one time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun. The licensee must provide
areas of shade for every dog in an outdoor enclosure throughout the daylight hours. 3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In an outdoor enclosure, containing 1 dog, there is a large hole chewed in the corner of the shelter, approximately 1
ft x 6 in. This shelter must be repaired or replaces so that it will protect the animal from the elements of the weather.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in an outdoor enclosure that are no longer in good repair are replaced or
repaired to protect the animals from the elements of weather at all times.
