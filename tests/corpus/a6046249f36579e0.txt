FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
Lufthansa flight number 454 arrived from France carrying two dogs in Cargo: one dog, a Carlin, originating from
Portugal with waybill number 020-50885166, and the other a Pug originating from Lithuania, with waybill number
020-72442473. The dogs were inspected in the cargo office. It was observed that both dogs were in crates where
there was only one food / water receptacle.
The carrier should ensure that there is a food AND a water receptacle in each enclosure at the time of consignment,
so that the animal can be properly cared for during transit.
To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with a cargo office representative.
