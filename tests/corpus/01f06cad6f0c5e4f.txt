INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Item IACUC 2.3.1 e 3
In May 2014 the investigator for protocol 804222 performed a dental mold bite block on a non human primate. This
procedure had been left out of the protocol at the of its renewal.
The investigator has since filed an amendment for the protocol.
In addition protocol 804006 involves a group of animals with repeated brain injuries as part of the study. In January
of 2014 it was discovered that the repeated injury group was not in the experimental design in the renewal for the
protocol and therefore not approved by the IACUC.
The investigator submitted an amendment for the protocol.
In the future both the Principal Investigator and the IACUC need to insure protocols are complete and accurate and
provide a complete description of the proposed use of animals.

MISCELLANEOUS.
Item Handling 2.38 f
In May of 2014 a non human primate underwent a procedure as part of protocol 804222. The investigator used a
thermal disc to keep the animal warm. The animal had been insulated from the heat disc by layers of folded
blanket, but the disc still resulted in thermal burns on the animal.
The IACUC needs to insure the handling of animals does not cause any trauma or stress
The IACUC has put into place a series of procedures designed to prevent this from happening again. There have
been no further incidents of this nature.
