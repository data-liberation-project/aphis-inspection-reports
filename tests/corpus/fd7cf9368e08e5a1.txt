Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The December 16, 2020 meeting minutes describe an unapproved deviation from an active research protocol.
The IACUC approved protocol # A2020 04-024-Y1-A7 for this study stated that blood would be collected from the
saphenous vein. However, on November 25th 2020 and again on December 7th 2020, blood draw on multiple hamsters
were done from the vena cava. Two hamsters, one after each day of collections, were found dead.
The blood collection technique used was not approved by the IACUC and contributed to the death of these hamsters. To
ensure the well-being and humane treatment of all research animals, it is important for the IACUC to review and approve
any significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing research activities.
Corrective actions had been developed and implemented at the time of inspection.
2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
On September 9th 2020, a 2 year old sable colored female fitch ferret ID # E6640 was unable to recover from inhalation
anesthesia and died unexpectedly. The facility’s internal investigation found that mistakes in the anesthesia technique
used during the procedure contributed to the death of this ferret:
- The ferret was maintained under maximum anesthetic concentration for the entire duration of the procedure. It was


stated that the usual procedure was for the ferrets to be induced at higher to maximum concentrations, to then be
maintained at a reduced concentration for the remainder of the procedure.
- One graduate student was alone monitoring 4 anesthetized ferrets. The investigation also found that the student, while
performing the procedure, was not well positioned to simultaneously monitor anesthesia of the ferrets.
Mistakes in handling, mainly anesthesia technique and monitoring, done during this procedure contributed to the ferret’s
death. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Corrective actions had been developed and implemented at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
