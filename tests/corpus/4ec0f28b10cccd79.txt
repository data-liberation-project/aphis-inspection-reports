Registration.
The registrant moved to a new office on February 1, 2022, and did not send notification of change of address. The
registrant also reported that regulated animals began moving to a new location approximately 2 weeks prior to inspection.
At the time of inspection, all animals had been moved to the new location, and the registrant had not sent notification of
the new site.

The research facility must notify the Deputy Administrator of any change in the name, address, or ownership, or other
change in operations affecting its status as a research facility, within 10 days after making such change. This notification
is required by the AWA regulations in order to keep facility information up to date.

Corrected on the day of inspection.

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
For the April 2021 semiannual evaluation, the report to the Institutional Official was signed by a majority of the IACUC
members on April 30, 2021. Although a semiannual evaluation was conducted in October 2021, the report to the


Institutional Official was not signed by a majority of the IACUC members until April 8, 2022 (the same date as the
subsequent semiannual evaluation). This created a period of almost 1 year between signed reports to the Institutional
Official. At the time of inspection (September 2022), the report to the Institutional Official for the April 2022 semiannual
evaluation had not yet been signed.

Semiannual reports to the Institutional Official must be reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members at least
once every six months, upon completion of the required semiannual evaluations.

The semiannual reports provide information regarding the current state of animal facilities and the program for humane
care and use of animals. Without timely IACUC communication and review, animal welfare may be negatively impacted.
All reports to the Institutional Official must be reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members, include any
minority views, and be reported at least once every six months upon completion of the required semiannual evaluations.

The report to the Institutional Official for the April 2022 semiannual evaluation should be signed by a majority of the
IACUC, and submitted to the Institutional Official. To be corrected by October 4, 2022.

For future semiannual reports to the Institutional Official, correct from this date forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
