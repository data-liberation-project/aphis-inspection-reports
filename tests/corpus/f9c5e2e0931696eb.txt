2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The documented Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) could not be located by the licensee during the inspection. A
documented PVC is required to be kept available for inspections to ensure proper oversight of animal husbandry
and care and also to demonstrate to APHIS officials that a formal agreement between the Attending Veterinarian
and the facility exists. Locate and maintain the PVC available for future inspections or work with the Attending
Veterinarian to document a new PVC.
