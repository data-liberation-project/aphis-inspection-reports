FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Drainage
*** The area under the shelter and in the barn for the 3 cows are wet and muddy. Efforts have been made to dry out
the areas. However, the cows do not have a dry area to seek shelter under. Water should be drained properly to
keep all areas of the pen dry. Methods to allow excess water to drain rapidly should be established and maintained
for the health of the animals. Correct by July 11, 2015.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
