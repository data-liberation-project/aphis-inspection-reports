INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Proposals to conduct activities involving animals.
1. Review of Protocol #2013-07653: There are several inconsistencies and/or incomplete descriptions of the
proposed use of the study animals contained in the text of the protocol that was reviewed and approved by the
IACUC.
Per this Section of the Regulations, a proposal for animal use must contain a complete description of the proposed
use of the animals so the IACUC can determine that the components of the activities related to the care and
proposed use of animals activities are in accordance with the requirements as outlined in this subchapter.
The IACUC needs to address these issues as identified for this research proposal.
Correct by 8/1/14.

WATERING.
Watering.
1. At the end of May 2014, two single-housed Peromyscus mice were found dead in their enclosures several days
following complete cage change. It was later determined that the Peromyscus died as a result of employee error
when their enclosures were placed onto an automatic water-equipped rack incorrectly and as a result the animals
did not have access to any water.
Per this Section of the Regulations, water must be provided to animals as often as necessary for the health and
comfort of the animal. The lack of access to sufficient amounts of water can have adverse effects on the health and
well-being of the animals.In response to this incident and to prevent any future incidents, the institution took corrective actions including but
not limited to providing re-training of husbandry staff on the standard operating procedures for daily cage checks
and daily animal health checks.
This item has been appropriately addressed by the research facility.
NOTE - Inspection conducted 6/23/14 through 6/26/14. Exit interview held 6/26/14 on-site with facility
representatives.
