2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A Program of Veterinary Care was not available for review at the time of this inspection. Licensees with part time
attending veterinarians must have a formal written arrangement with a veterinarian (PVC) that addresses the
preventive care for all regulated species. This is required so that USDA personnel can confirm that the licensee is
working with a knowledgeable veterinarian and is following the recommendations from that veterinarian.
A program of veterinary care needs to be developed by the attending veterinarian that addresses
all regulated species owned/exhibited by this licensee .
Topics that should be covered in the PVC include:
*The veterinarian's schedule for visits to the facility.
*Parasite control program specific for each species.
*Vaccination recommendations specific for each species.
*Instructions on necropsies for unexpected deaths.
*Diets appropriate for each species.
*Chronic health issues for any specific animals including required hoof trims and dental issues.
*Any other medical/husbandry recommendations the veterinarian feels necessary for this facility.
*Emergency contact information.
The PVC must be signed and dated by the attending veterinarian. This document must indicate to USDA
representatives that the licensee and the veterinarian have an active working relationship. A copy of the PVC should
be available for review even when traveling.

2.126(c)ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensees did not submit an itinerary for their current trip. Exhibitors who travel with their animals away from
their approved site for longer than 24 hours must submit an itinerary to the regional office. This is necessary so that
USDA officials can find covered species if necessary. An itinerary needs to be submitted for all future travel at least
48 hours prior to that travel.

2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The petting zoo consisted of a middle area of approximately 50 ft x 50 ft with smaller enclosures along 3 sides of the
middle area. The public was allowed into the middle area but not the smaller side enclosures however they were
still able to touch the animals in most of the side enclosures. The middle area contained approximately 40 animals.
The enclosures along the sides contained a zebra, a camel, a watusi, a cavi, a porcupine, a coati, and a lemur. At
the time of this inspection there were approximately 25 to 30 people in the middle area with only one attendant. The
only way to identify the attendant was when he had a rake and dust pan in his hand.
One unidentifiable attendant for this many animals, some of which can cause serious injury, and this many people is
not adequate especially when the attendant cannot monitor the people while cleaning. There needs to be enough
identifiable attendants to visualize all people at all times. This is necessary to prevent harm to the public and/or the
animals.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, ACI Don Fox, and VMO Cindy DiGesualdo. This
inspection occurred at the San Angelo Stock Show in San Angelo, TX.
