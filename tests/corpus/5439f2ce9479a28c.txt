FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Some defects were observed on the surfaces inside the monk seal pool. The inspector returned to the facility on
3/22/17, when the pool was scheduled to be drained. Upon viewing the drained pool it was clearly evident that some
areas of the wall and floors of the pool have significantly deteriorated. On the wall, there are at least a dozen large
patches measuring up to five inches in diameter or more, where the original surface is missing, and the underlying
concrete has a roughened surface. On the floor, there are at least two areas where the surface has also failed,
including one two foot by one foot rectangle where eighty percent of the original surface is missing, and the
underlying surface is uneven and rough.
Failure to maintain the surfaces in good repair could result in ingestion of materials coming off of the pool walls and
floor, an inability to adequately clean and disinfect the surfaces, roughened pool bottom that could cause abrasions,
especially when the pool is drained, and / or the possibility of contaminants leaching through the unsealed,
deteriorated areas in the pool surface, which could affect water quality. Any of these could be detrimental to the
health and well-being of the animals.
Whereas the facility has contracted an architect to come up with plans for improvements to this exhibit, there is
currently no documented timeline for performing maintenance on the pool surfaces.
All surfaces in a marine mammal primary enclosure must be constructed of durable, nontoxic materials that facilitate
cleaning, and disinfection in order to maintain the desired water quality. All surfaces must be maintained in good
repair as part of a regular, ongoing maintenance program.
To be corrected by November 20, 2017.
This inspection was conducted on 3/20/17 and 3/22/17, and the inspection and exit interview were conducted with
facility representatives.
