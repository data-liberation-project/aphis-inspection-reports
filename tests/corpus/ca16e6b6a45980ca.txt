HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor housing areas for the Colobus and the Gorillas had several areas within the enclosure that had rusted
along the corner of the walls and ceiling. These rusted areas had peeled up and into the enclosure and left
approximately 4-6 inches of sharp metal exposed to the animals. At the time of the inspection, the lower level
holding areas of primate building were being re-painted and re-sealed, but these enclosures had not yet been
completed. The sharp metal currently in these enclosures is a hazard for the animals in the enclosure and could
affect their health and well-being.
The fan units directly above the the window of the Capuchin enclosure were heavily rusted. The rust on these fans
prevent them from being properly cleaned and also create the potential for metal and paint to enter the enclosure.
The paint on the metal support beams along the ceiling of the primate building was heavily peeling. This peeling
paint affected greater than 50% of the beams crossing above the enclosures. This peeling paint creates conditions
in which paint or metal could enter the primate enclosures.
The enclosures must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury.
Correct the sharp metal edges in the Colobus and Gorilla off-exhibit areas by September 22, 2016.
Correct the rusted fan by February 15, 2017.
Correct the peeling support beams by May 15, 2017.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The animal holding areas of the primate building have various rodents and insect pests present. In the enclosure
containing the Ring-tailed lemur, cockroaches were noted crawling across several cracks and crevices in the tree
structure as well as on the vines of the enclosures. This area was actively being treated at the time of exit. Six live
mice were observed moving throughout the hallway and through the indoor gorilla enclosures, and droppings were
noted near the food prep area. The staff pointed out a number of areas where the design of the building structurescommonly harbored mice, including between the walls and shift doors of the gorilla enclosures. The zoo's current
pest control program has this building treated every two weeks, however due to the number of pests and rodents
observed, this program is not effective. Insects and rodents can spread disease between animals and can be a
nuisance to the primates. The facility must coordinate the pest control program with their veterinary staff to ensure
the health and safety of their primates is maintained. An effective pest control program must be established to
promote the health and well-being of the primates.
