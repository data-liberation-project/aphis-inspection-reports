3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The coated wire flooring in at least four enclosures on the south side of the "Back Building," have areas of
excessive rust. Eleven adult dogs can come in contact with the affected areas. The wire coating is flaking or
peeling off and exposing the bare metal. The rusted and pitted wire flooring is primarily present near the front of the
outdoor run and extending approximately 1-3 inches towards the back. The licensee stated that he has new material
available that can be used to replace the rusted areas.
Surfaces that are not free of excessive rust cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Excessive rust and pitting can
also affect the structural strength of the surfaces. The licensee must repair or replace the rusted wire flooring and
ensure all surfaces of the housing facility are maintained on a regular basis.
