ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Shih-Tzu (tag number 148) has a skin lesion in the area of his right shoulder that is weepy and red in
appearance. The facility representative stated that the licensee has been treating the lesion with a topical
medication, but has not consulted the attending veterinarian regarding the dog's skin condition. The lesion is an
abnormal condition that may be painful and can become infected if not treated properly. Correct by having the
attending veterinarian examine and evaluate the dog's skin condition and then by treating the dog as directed by the
attending veterinarian. Correct by January 8, 2016.
