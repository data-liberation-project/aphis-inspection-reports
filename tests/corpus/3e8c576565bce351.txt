ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The daily treatment records for the rabbits were incomplete. The facility keeps a written, daily observation log
including documentation of any medications administered. According to a facility representative, the medication,
Oxytetracycline has been given to sick rabbits; however there is no written documentation or instructions for the use
of this medication in the records. The lack of complete and accurate documentation of the use of all medications
may lead to inappropriate use on the animals. Accurate information and records should also be available in the
event of communications with the attending veterinarian. A system of complete, accurate and timely information
concerning animal health problems and observations must be in place.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
-There were several cracks from 2ft to 6 ft long in the cement flooring of the rabbit building. Some of the deeper
cracks were filled with organic waste/debris which attracted several flies to these areas at time of inspection. Large
cracks in the flooring are not impervious to moisture and prevent proper sanitization. Also, these areas may trap
debris and bacterial organisms as well as attract flies or pests which all may pose a health risk to the animals.
-Several rabbit cages are moderately covered in rust. The presence of rust may prevent the required cleaning and
sanitization of the enclosures, which may adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals. There are
improvements being made which include sections of new cages and feeders that have replaced older ones.
The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that they are
substantially impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized.

3.53(c)(2)PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Several, primary enclosures housing adult rabbits did not provide the minimum amount of floor space as required.
The rabbit cages were 2 ft. X 1.5 ft. which provides a total of 3 square feet which is the minimum floor space for
adult rabbits between 4.4-8.8 lbs. Several rabbits in the facility at time of inspection weighed greater than 8.8lbs,
therefore requiring more than the 3 square feet provided by the cages.
Enclosures with insufficient space may have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals being
maintained within them. A sufficient amount of floor space for rabbits is necessary in order to ensure that they have
enough space to make normal postural adjustments and adequate freedom of movement. The facility should ensure
that the cages housing their rabbits meet the required minimum floor space set forth in the regulations.
