2.40(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several bottles of expired medication were found on inspection: long-acting penicillin, oxytocin, a liquid antibiotic,
and a reproductive medication. Expired medications are not acceptable for use in regulated animals, as efficacy
and sterility are no longer guaranteed by the manufacturer. The licensee must ensure that appropriate equipment,
including medications that are within their expiration, are available to provide the animals with adequate veterinary
care.
Corrected at the time of exit.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two Boston terrier puppies (aged 4 weeks) out of a litter of seven were found on the outside portion of their
indoor/outdoor enclosure with at least one foot each hanging through the gaps in the wire floor to the level of their
hips/shoulders. Although the puppies did not appear distressed or injured, the licensee removed them from the
outdoor portion of the enclosure and returned them to the inside, which contained a solid floor. Having dogs' feet
fall through the openings in the floor can cause physical harm and/or behavioral distress if they become stuck in that
position. Floors of primary enclosures must not allow dogs' feet to pass through any openings in the floor.
