05-Mar-18.Inspector attempted to contact licensee by knocking on the door and calling the phone number listed.
The voice message stated that the licensee would be out of town until March 6, 2018. This is the first attempted
inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
