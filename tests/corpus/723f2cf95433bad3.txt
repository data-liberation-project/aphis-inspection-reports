ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at about 2:30p
on 15-Jan-20.
ACI Bartels arrived and spoke with staff members. The staff contacted the licensee by phone. I was told that the
licensee would prefer to do the inspection when they are available at another time.
