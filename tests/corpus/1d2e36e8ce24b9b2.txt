FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength. There are least five sections along the fence where the galvanized wire is broken, protruding
inwards, and/or detached from the PVC post and rail fence. All animals must have enclosures that are structurally
sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to prevent escape. Facilities must
establish a maintenance program to keep enclosures in good repair. The galvanized fence must be repaired,
removed, or replaced to prevent injury to the goats and to contain them securely. Correct by May 4, 2016.
