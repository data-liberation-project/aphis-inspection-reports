3.3(e)(1)(2)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
* The outside concrete flooring, used to house six adult dogs, is wet. The moisture and fluid waste are soaking into
the surface. Approximately half of the surface is not exposed to the direct sunlight. The owner stated, that the
surface had not been treated. This surface does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization, thus increasing the
disease potential for the dogs.
All concrete surfaces that come into contact with the animals must be impervious to moisture. A surface impervious
to moisture will allow for rapid runoff of water and fluid waste. Additionally the surface will allow for proper cleaning
and sanitation. Proper cleaning and sanitation will reduce the disease potential for the dogs.

3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* The corner of the building in the west end enclosure for large dogs had large gaps between the wood, exposed
nails protruding inward and exposed bare wood. This can potentially lead to injury to the one adult German
Shepherd housed in the enclosure.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair. This will reduce the potential to injury to the animals.
