FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The two metal feed troughs for 17 goats and 2 alpacas and 1 of 2 metal feed troughs for 1 bison were excessively
rusted with holes in the bottom of the troughs. These holes were large enough for feet to become entrapped and
had sharp edges protruding, posing a risk of injury to these animals.
All outdoor housing facilities and any equipment for husbandry and feeding in the enclosure shall be maintained to
protect the animals from injury.
To be corrected by 10/20/2014.
Accompanied on the inspection by the Operations Manager. Exit interview conducted on site.
