3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Within the sheltered housing facility there are 23 enclosures with approximately 4"x9" openings in the front of the
coated wire panels. Red plastic food receptacles used to be mounted in these openings. They have been removed
from the enclosures and replaced with a different type of food receptacle that mounts in a different location. The
wire was cut to create the openings to mount the red plastic food receptacles. When they were removed it exposed
sharp wire points approximately 1/4" long protruding from these openings that the dogs can come into contact with.
Some of the dogs are able to get the front of their head through the openings and there is some dog hair stuck on
some of the sharp points. There are 32 dogs that can come into contact with these sharp wire points. Sharp points
or edges could injure the dogs. The licensee must repair or replace the affected area ensuring the safety or health
of the dogs.
