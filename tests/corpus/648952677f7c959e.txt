FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Currently the guinea pigs have access to go into the outdoor portion of the enclosure. The inspector observed the
guinea pigs freely going into the outdoor enclosure and back into the indoor enclosure. There are no approved
variances for this facility to house guinea pigs outdoors. Guinea pigs shall not be housed outdoors unless the facility
is located in an appropriate climate and prior approval is obtained from the Deputy Administrator. A letter
requesting a variance for outdoor housing for guinea pigs may be sent to the USDA APHIS Animal Care office in
Fort Collins, CO. The letter should describe the enclosure, location and climate. Additional information such as
photos of the housing area may be included and useful in determining if a variance is granted.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an excessive amount of bear feces piled 15 to 20 feet from the bear enclosure and is producing a foul odor.
The licensee informed the inspector this is where the feces are normally dumped once out of the enclosure. The
buildup of animal waste can potentially create a hazard that may promote disease and can attract vermin and pests
to the facility. Eliminate the excessive buildup of animal waste through proper disposal from the facility as often as
necessary to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards.

Inside the enclosure containing a coatimundi named (cid:28)Kiki(cid:29), there is old feces inside the shelter box that has become
greyish in color. The licensee informed the inspector that the feces have not been cleaned out in several days.
The shelter inside the enclosure containing the zebras has an excessive accumulation of feces that has built up
past the bottom 2x6 wood frame. Excreta should be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals contained and reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of this enclosure should
be more timely and effective to prevent the build-up of excreta.

The hippo pool has become dirty with excessive feces floating on the top and has a foul odor. The licensee
informed the inspector that the water pump has been broken for 1.5 weeks and has taken no attempt to drain and
clean it out. The licensee ordered the parts to fix the water pump but informed the inspector the parts will not be
available for another week. Hippos spend a great part of their day in the water and providing clean water is
necessary to maintain their health and well-being. The hippo pool must be cleaned and the filter maintained as
often as necessary to keep the pool water clean to minimize disease hazards, reduce odors, and prevent
contamination.

SANITATION.
Inside the feed storage building, there is an excessive amount of rat feces around the bags of feed. On the window
sill on the bear shelter, there are rat feces on the window sill where the licensee occasionally puts enrichment food
for the bears. Evidence of rat feces is an indicator of an ineffective pest control program. Rat droppings can harbor
disease causing organisms and could cause potential contamination in animal areas.
Inside the Ringtail lemur and Bettong enclosure, red ants have formed a mound next to the shelter. The animals
enclosed can be stung by the ants causing pain to the animals. The applicant should ensure an effective pest
control program is in place to control pests and reduce potential contamination.
