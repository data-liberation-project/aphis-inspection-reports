SANITATION.
The den box area for two rabbits in one hutch is excessively dirty. All of the deep pile of straw is wet with urine and
mixed with feces. Some of the feces has turned white indicating it is old and there is a strong ammonia smell when
the wet straw was moved.
All rabbit primary enclosures need to be cleaned on a more regular basis to prevent wetting of the rabbits, decrease
odors and prevent disease hazards. The wet dirty bedding was removed during the inspection.
The rest of the box needs to be thoroughly cleaned and clean bedding placed.
To be corrected by 11-7-17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
