Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1155 on 27 OCT 20.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the front door and called the contact number provided. I left a message and
waited. The licensee returned my call but was unavailable for inspection.
