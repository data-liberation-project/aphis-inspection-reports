2.1(a)(1) REPEAT
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
The owner of the property has Bobcats, cavies, goats, Watusi, Whitetailed deer and a rabbit on exhibit to the public
at his amusement facility.
Any person operating or intending to operate as a exhibitor, except persons who are exempted from the licensing
requirements under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, must have a valid license.
A USDA, APHIS, AC license must be obtained to exhibit animals to the public.
2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Since June, 2013 there have been new managers in charge of animal care at the facility and there have been
numerous
deaths of animals in their care. The list includes one ringtail lemur, 1 bobcat kitten, 2 adult watusi, 2 cavy, 1 fox, one
peacock, one Chinese pheasant and two fallow deer. Two Whitetailed deer fawns were recently acquired. The
caretakers have no experience bottle raising these animals. The managers husband stated that the technician that
was
hired this spring was represented as having wild and exotic animal experience, but they found out she had only
worked at a dog kennel, which is also the only experience that the manager and the managers husband have had
with animals. Since the previous inspection a rabbit has had a back injury due to poor handling.
All licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the
species they maintain.
The managers must gain the appropriate knowledge and experience of any species of animal prior to acquiring the
animal or hire someone with the proper knowledge and experience with the species involved.2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public is allowed to hand feed animals on exhibit including: six goats and a watusi. The public may contact the
animals during feeding. Employees or attendants are not present during these times of public contact. One of the
rabbits present at the last inspection was seen by the attending veterinarian for a back issue that was causing
lameness. The care takers are not aware of how the injury happened because there are no attendants present at
times of public contact. Unattended public contact may result in physical injury to the animals by trauma or them
eating unapproved items. The animals experience mental harm when they are subject to ignorant and inappropriate
human contact. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all
times during public contact.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The Watusi escaped its enclosure overnight and is now in the horse enclosure. The horse enclosure is in very poor
condition and is also not sufficient to contain a Watusi.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
All animals must be contained in an enclosure that is appropriate for the species to prevent escape or injury of the
animals. Replace or repair the fencing to contain the animal.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The two cavy are in an enclosure that does not have a perimeter fence.
On or after May 17, 2000, all outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a
perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 6 feet
high for other animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it
protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent
physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such
fences less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
A perimeter fence must be errected around any enclosure housing a wild or exotic animal to act as secondarycontaiment and to prevent death of the animal by a predator.
Exit conducted with the owner by phone.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A VALID USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.
