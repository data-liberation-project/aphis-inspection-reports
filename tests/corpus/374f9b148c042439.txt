FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an area approximately 15 feet in width, varying in height from 6 to 12 inches, on a wall inside the bear
outdoor exhibit area, where the top "stucco-like" coating is missing and the underlying concrete is exposed.
This area of exposed concrete is about 2 1/2 feet above floor level in the bear enclosure. Pieces of the thin
"stucco-like" surface coating may fall into the animal enclosure and could potentially be ingested by the bears.
The area of damaged wall inside this bear enclosure must be repaired in order to avoid accidental ingestion by
the two animals housed in this exhibit. To be corrected by: August 19, 2016.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
