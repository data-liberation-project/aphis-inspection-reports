FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A single llama is housed in an enclosure with an outdoor paddock and an indoor stall. The wall of the barn
contains a window with multiple small panes of glass. One of these panes was broken, leaving edges of exposed
glass along the perimeter of the window pane. This broken area was at the height of the llama's head, and within
easy reach of the animal. This is a potential injury risk to the llama. The broken glass must be removed as soon as
possible.
Corrected by facility.
