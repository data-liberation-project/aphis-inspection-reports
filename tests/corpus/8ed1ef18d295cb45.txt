***DIRECT - At time of inspection an adult female Maltese "Lou Lou" (m/c# 074550633) was exhibiting a thin body
condition. Her vertebra were visible and easily palpable. Upon further hands on inspection of the dog it was noted
that the teeth had a significant build up of tartar and the gum line was red and swollen. Dental disease can be
painful, can interfere with eating, and cause other adverse health conditions if left untreated. Licensee shall have
the above dog examined by a licensed veterinarian, and document the diagnosis as well as the execution of any
treatment. Additionally, the licensee shall implement a proactive regimen to monitor teeth and develop a plan with
the attending veterinarian to address dental care.

***There was a clear bag of pills that had no label. The licensee stated that the capsules were an antibiotic that she
administers following each C-section. However, the licensee did not know the name of the medication and did not
have directions on how to administer. Medications without labels or with incomplete labels can result in an animal
receiving the incorrect medication, the incorrect dose, or expired medication. The licensee must ensure that all
medication containers are labeled with the following information: Name of the medication, Dose (the amount to be
given), and the expiration date.
***A bottle of Cephalexin Capsules, with an expiration date of March 2015 and a bottle of Cystorelin with an
expiration date of 02-2016 were located with other medications ready for use. Expired medications or vaccines can
lose their effectiveness and their ability to prevent or control disease and/or pain. The licensee must ensure that all
medications and vaccines are within their expiration dates at all times.
