OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.(4)
***In the outdoor portion of the facility, there were at least nine primary enclosures containing adult dogs in which
the housing units in these enclosures contained either no bedding or an extremely small amount of bedding. Much
of the flooring in these shelter units was exposed and uncovered by bedding. According to the National Weather
Service, the overnight air temperatures (in Fahrenheit) for the facility's area had been in the low to mid 30's for the
last three nights prior to inspection. According to the licensee, he had last added bedding material to the shelters
two days prior to inspection. Lack of appropriate bedding in cold environments increases the risk of illness and
hypothermic situations. The licensee must provide adequate bedding to the outdoor facilities. The licensee must
ensure that adequate bedding material is provided when the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees F and
additional bedding is provided when the temperature is 35 degrees F or lower. TO BE CORRECTED BY: This day

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements. (2) (x)
***Within the sheltered building, there was at least one enclosure housing puppies whose feet were passing through
openings in the wire flooring. Flooring which allows the animals' feet to pass through the openings can increase the
risk of injury to the animals. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures are equipped with floors that will
protect the animals' feet and legs from injury at all times. TO BE CORRECTED BY: February 25, 2014.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
