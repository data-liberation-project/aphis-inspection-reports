2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Animal Records.
1. The pet store is not maintaining records that accurately disclose the disposition information for the exotic animals
that the store offers for sale. The complete name and address of the person to whom an animal was sold, the
species of animal sold, and the date of the sale are not being consistently recorded in the animal disposition
logbook that the store uses to maintain the animal disposition records. In addition, some of the disposition entries
were made in the wrong species section of the logbook that made it difficult to track the disposition of the exotic
animals sold by the store.
Per this Section of the Regulations, every dealer shall maintain records that fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning animals other than dogs and cats that were purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, or
otherwise in their possession or under their control, or which are transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer: the name and address of the person to whom an animal was sold or given; the date of
sale or disposition of the animal(s); the species of the animal(s); and the number of animals.
The pet store needs to maintain the required disposition records for all of the exotic animals that are sold in order to
accurately track the disposition of animals from the store.
