HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The rolled fiberglass insulation material inside the puppy house is loose and falling away from the roof and walls.
This material could potentially fall into the puppy primary enclosures and be ingested. All housing facilities for dogs
must be kept in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury. All insulation material used in the puppy
house must be secured to the roof and walls. To be corrected by: October 6, 2017.

Around the interior perimeter of the puppy house, there small piles of Styrofoam like material laying on the floor. It
appears that rodents are chewing through the Styrofoam material in the walls and roof and entering this puppy
housing facility. Rodents can be a potential source of disease transmission to the puppies housed inside this
building. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests
shall be established and maintained. To be corrected by: October 6, 2017.
