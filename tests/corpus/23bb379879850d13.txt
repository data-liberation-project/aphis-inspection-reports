Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
***In the petting zoo, there was one pig that had long hooves and were curling upward on the hind feet. Long hooves can
lead to discomfort, pain and crippling in animals. These long hooves must be addressed to avoid potential health issues
for the pig. The licensee must ensure that all animals are provided with adequate veterinary care as required.
To be corrected by April 1, 2022.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
***In the records portion of the inspection, on March 9, 2022, there is a record that three black jackals were received by
the licensee at another address. Two of these jackals were observed at this location during inspection. The facility
representative stated that all three of the jackals were received at this location, but that one jackal was transported to the
licensee on March 21, 2022. There was no disposition paperwork for the one jackal.

The following additional records were missing or contained incorrect information:

Acquisition


Red Kangaroo: 3 animals
Pere David's Deer: 2 animals
Ferret: 2 animals
Binturong: 2 animals

Disposition

Zebu: 1 animal
Muntjac: 1 animal
Savannah cat (Domestic x Exotic cat hybrid): 1 animal

Appropriate record keeping is essential for tracking animal movement and animal health. The licensee needs to make
sure that there is a clear distinction of records between the two facilities and ensure that all records are kept as required.

Watering.
***In the petting zoo, there were 20 goats, two pigs and two Zebu. Several goats were observed lingering around the
water trough. The water trough was empty. The facility representative stated that an employee was requested to fill the
trough last night prior to closing. One zebu drank for one minute and one goat drank for one minute and twenty-two
seconds. As the inspectors exited the enclosure several more goats proceeded to the trough to drink. Lack of water
increases the risk of serious health issues in the animals. The licensee must ensure that potable water is provided as
necessary to promote the health and comfort of the animals as required.
Corrected during inspection.
