3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The plastic entryway flaps in several dog kennels were coated with dried dirt. The presence of this biomaterial inhibits the
facility's ability to sanitize the plastic flaps as required in this subpart. The inability to sanitize all hard surfaces that come
in contact with the dogs may expose them to unnecessary disease hazards.

3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The two pens housing 3 and 15 pigs respectively are in need of maintenance. There are two wooden structures adjacent
to concrete feeding platforms that have portions of their metal roofs missing. Inside each pen, there are loose sections of
metal fencing and roofing that can pose physical hazards to the animals. The facility must maintain housing facilities in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Watering.
The water receptacles in 3 pastures housing 3 goats, 17 goats and 14 cattle respectively had large accumulations of algal
growth. Certain types of algae may produce toxins that are harmful to the animals. Additionally, the presence of algal


overgrowth is indicative that the facility is not keeping the water receptacles clean and sanitized as required.

3.131(c)

Sanitation.
There was an accumulation of deceased insects and two mice bodies on the floor of the feed room. The bodies of the
mice were desiccated and suggests that they had been present more than a few days. The build up of deceased pests in
an area where feed is stored poses a disease hazard and indicates that staff is not cleaning as often as necessary to
protect the health of the animals. The facility must keep the premises clean and in good repair in order to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.

3.132

Employees.
Currently, the facility has 4 dedicated employees to provide care for approximately 120 animals. The number of animals
may fluctuate higher depending on the time of year during the birthing seasons. These employees are also tasked with
the maintenance and grounds upkeep for a 260 acre agriculturally active farm. The current number of employees are
having difficulty maintaining the husbandry standards for the animals while also attending to the non-animal day to day
tasks. This has negatively affected the staff's ability to provide a professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices for
the covered species on the property. A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the
professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
