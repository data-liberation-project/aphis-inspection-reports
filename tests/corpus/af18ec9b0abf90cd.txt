The written program of veterinary care (PVC) is incomplete. The following animals: sloth, pig, prairie dog,
hedgehog, and tenrec are not listed on the PVC. A complete, written program of veterinary care is required when
the attending veterinarian is employed on a part-time basis in order to ensure the facility has a program to follow
and all covered animals receive adequate veterinary care. An updated, complete and accurate written program of
veterinary care with consultation from the attending veterinarian must be in place to ensure the health and
well-being of the animals.
