Care in transit.
This registrant transported a dog from San Diego, CA to Chicago, IL. According to the registrant, when he picked up the
dog the sitters (Rover) told him that the dog was vomiting and had diarrhea. The registrant spoke to the owner who
insisted on the dog being shipped up to Chicago, IL. The trip was made with stops in Arizona, Austin, TX, and South
Carolina where other animals were picked up and dropped off. Other stops were made when the registrant needed to get
gas. The animals were checked each time. The registrant said that would be about every 4 - 6 hrs. He did not have a
timeline associated with this trip. When he stopped in South Carolina he noted that this particular dog was not as playful
or interactive as he had been in the past. He spoke to the owner, who again insisted that the trip remain on schedule as
previously planned. When the registrant stopped in TN the dog was dead.
All animals need to be observed every 4 hrs. The regulated person must also ensure that any animals in obvious distress
obtains veterinary care at the closest veterinary facility. Due to the fact that the transporter / registrant noted that the dog
was not as playful or interactive, he needed to bring that dog to a veterinary facility. This type of situation will need to be
addressed before any other transports are scheduled.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
