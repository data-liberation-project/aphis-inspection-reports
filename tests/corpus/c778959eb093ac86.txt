3.55 DIRECT
WATERING.
At time of this inspection there was one very young rabbit found dead in it's enclosure. One other litter mate wasstill alive. I asked the licensee to add a bowl of water in it's enclosure as I feared it couldn't or didn't know how to
use the automatic water system. When offered water, the young rabbit drank greedily and for long periods of time.
It would rest and then resume drinking several more times throughout my inspection of the area. Young rabbits
need to be offered water in an accessible receptacle if the licensee does not see them actively drinking from the
watering system.
Corrected at time of the inspection.
3.56(a)(3)
SANITATION.
The catch pans for the wire mesh cages for the rabbits on the top row were excessively full of feces and urine. The
ground under the lower cages were also covered in excessive amounts of feces. If primary enclosures are
equipped with wire or mesh floors, the troughs or pans under such enclosures shall be cleaned at least once each
week.
Failure to clean the trays and ground become a haven for insects and mammalian pests.
