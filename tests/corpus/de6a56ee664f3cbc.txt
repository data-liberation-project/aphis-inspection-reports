An inspector arrived at 11:30 am in response to a complaint that the facility sells animals covered by the Animal
Welfare Act without a federal license. According to a posting on the glass, hours of operation indicate that the facility
should have opened at 11:00. The inspector knocked on doors with no answer. The facility had no lights on and no
one was visible inside. The inspector called the contact number in the file. There was no answer and no answering
machine. The inspector waited 30 minutes onsite and called the contact number again, receiving no answer and no
answering machine connection. The inspector departed at 12:00 pm.
The facility owner has received two applications packets from USDA Animal Care, but has not submitted either for
license application.
Selling animals covered by the Animal Welfare Act without a license is a violation of the federal Animal Welfare Act.
The facility owner is now instructed to contact the inspector via the following means at her earliest convenience:
