ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:40 AM on
12/28/2015.
The gate to the driveway of the facility was closed and tied off. I contacted the licensee by phone and left a
message. A relative of the licensee called me back a few minutes later and informed me that no one would be
home till later in the night. I informed the relative of the licensee that I would have to attempt the inspection at a
later date.
End of report.
