Facilities, general.
While open to the public on or around 10/06/2021, three kangaroos walked/hopped out of an unattended open gate of
their enclosure and walked around the driveway and parking area around the barn. After some coaxing and help from
volunteers two of the kangaroos returned to their enclosure while the big male was reluctant to return and remained loose.
He eventually returned to the enclosure. All the kangaroos were safely recovered. The licensee explained that the gate
was accidentally left open and the kangaroos walked out. Licensee has established protocol for moving, cleaning, and
handling of the animals but must assure that all protocols are followed completely. Escaped animals can become injured
and pose a threat to the health and safety of the public and well-being of the animals at the facility. To be corrected
