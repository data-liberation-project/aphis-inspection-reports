3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
Several enclosures housing multiple felines (123202, 123505, 123605, 123602, 123405) are not being spot cleaned daily
and there is an accumulation of litter and feces on the hard surfaces of the enclosure. The litter boxes in these enclosures
appear to be checked daily but according to an attendant, surfaces are wiped down every other day. Per this regulation
along with 3.11 (a), surfaces and enclosures must be spot cleaned daily to prevent this accumulation of waste to reduce
animals walking on soiled surfaces.
