2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two animals were noted during the inspection to have conditions requiring veterinary care:
**A Barbados ram lamb was noted to hide behind one of the ewes, his left hind leg appeared to be at an abnormal
angle, and he wasn't bearing full weight on the leg. The licensee stated the lamb had a broken leg. He stated the
attending veterinarian (AV) had seen the lamb a couple of days ago and stated "there is nothing to do about it".
There is no documentation from the AV or the licensee to show when this animal was noted to have a problem nor
what was to be done to provide relief from the painful condition.
**An adult Dorsett ewe was noted to have the left nostril partially closed and pinkish tissue around the nostril and
below the left eye appeared to be swollen. The licensee stated that the animal was old and may have a "sticker or
something" that was causing the misshapen or swollen face and that he planned to take her to an auction next
week. No diagnosis, treatment, or plan to relieve the painful/distressful condition had been made.
Limb fractures are painful and should be appropriately diagnosed and treated under the direction of the AV to
minimize pain and distress. Facial swelling and obstruction of the nares can be painful and/or distressful and
should be appropriately diagnosed and treated under the direction of the AV to minimize pain and distress.
The licensee shall have and follow a program of veterinary care for all regulated animals that includes the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries
These two animals need to be seen by a veterinarian by 1/23/2015 and the licensee must provide documentation to
APHIS officials regarding the diagnosis, any treatment prescribed and to show that treatment is given as directed, or
that other methods for eliminating pain and distress associated with the diagnosed condition, and a plan for
follow-up to determine if treatment is successful.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee did not have records for animals other than dogs and cats that were accurate and complete for thecurrent animal inventory:
**The record for pigs had not been updated since 12/2013. There was no documentation to show one female pig
that was sold or otherwise disposed of since the previous inspection on 1/7/2014. There was no documentation to
show the date of acquisition and the information from the person from whom the current juvenile female pig was
acquired.
**The record of cattle on hand only accounted for 10 animals and 14 were counted during the inspection. The
record had not been updated since 2013.
**The record of sheep on hand listed 27 total animals but only 24 were present during the inspection. The record
had not been updated since 6/2013. The licensee had several lambs on site during this inspection and believed
that other sheep had died or been sold since 6/2013 but no records of these acquisitions or dispositions were made
or were available for review at the time of the inspection.
Complete and accurate records for the acquisition and disposition of animals are necessary to ensure that animals
are acquired and disposed of legally and transported and cared for humanely.
