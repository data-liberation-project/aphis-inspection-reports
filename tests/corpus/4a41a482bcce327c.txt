2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A focused inspection was conducted on March 8, 2017 by APHIS inspectors and an IES investigator. The three pigs
with the excessively long hooves noted on the previous inspection had received hoof trimming and had been moved
into a different enclosure.
The coatimundi, Shyla, was not on the premises at the time of inspection. Licensee stated that she had taken the
coati to the veterinary clinic at approximately 8:30 am this morning. The licensee called the clinic at approximately
10:30 am and spoke with the assistant. At the time of the inspection, the licensee did not know what the
veterinarian’s plan regarding the diagnosis and treatment of the coatimundi.
The APHIS inspector contacted the veterinarian regarding the coatimundi at 2:37pm on March 8, 2017. The
veterinarian stated that she had not given any pain medication to the coati and that no medical treatment had been
provided that day. The veterinarian stated that she had given the coatimundi antibiotics last night but sent the
animal home as she did not have adequate facilities to house a coatimundi. The veterinarian stated to the inspector
via phone that the animal was “very aggressive” and that the “eye is pretty bad”. No other diagnostics, treatments,
medications or pain control have been given at the time of this inspection. The veterinarian stated to the inspector
via phone that she was planning to anesthetize the coati and try to clean the eye out and that she would “try to do it
today,” however she was unable to confirm when the coatimundi would be examined and treated.
The young gray and white female goat which was unable to straighten her front legs at the knees during the
previous inspection was still in her enclosure in the barn. Her condition had not changed from yesterday and she
was still unable to stand or walk normally. Licensee stated that the goat had not received any veterinary treatment.
In addition, the intact adult male tricolor goat that was non-weight bearing on his right front limb during the previous
inspection had been moved into the same enclosure as the gray and white female goat that was cited. The buck’s
condition was unchanged from the previous inspection and he was still non-weight bearing on the right forelimb and
lame at a walk. A veterinarian visually examined the goat yesterday and made a presumptive diagnosis. The
inspector spoke with this veterinarian regarding these 2 goats previously identified by the inspectors as needing
veterinary care on the night of March 7. He stated that he had recommended to the licensee that the goats inquestion should receive diagnostic testing in order to give a diagnosis and recommended a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory agent for pain control, however animal manager at the facility declined diagnosis and treatment.
The female fallow deer that had a fresh wound over the left point of the shoulder during the previous inspection had
not been seen by a veterinarian and licensee had not provided any treatment.
Injuries, diseases, and medical conditions that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may be
painful and can lead to prolonged suffering. The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of
veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate
diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of
veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate
diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency,
weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals at the facility.
The facility representative was notified verbally that he must have both goats (the male and female listed above)
examined and receive medical treatment by a veterinarian by no later than 10:00am on March 9, 2017 to obtain
accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plans for the leg problems cited above. In addition, the results of the
examination and treatment of the coatimundi should be made available to the inspection. The outcome of this
consultation must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the
veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian,
any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal
health record that list when the medication is administered to the animal.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each
animal identified on inspection, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary
treatment, and the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
Additionally, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as
described by the attending veterinarian in the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate
veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and
injuries.
