RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The owner consigned one coatimundi (on 5/2/19) and two ringtail lemurs (on 5/3/19) for sale at an auction in
Cookeville TN. The inspector contacted the owner who stated he bought the animals in the parking lot of the auction
during the auction from an elderly gentleman from Sumner County TN but that he had gathered no further
acquisition information from the gentleman. He stated that his initial plan was to keep the lemurs but then changed
his mind and consigned them to the auction. No written records were kept or exchanged regarding the acquisition
of the coatimundi and ringtail lemurs.
Every exhibitor shall make, keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose all the required
information (name and address of the person from whom the animals were acquired, USDA license number of the
person or if unlicensed his or her drivers license number/state and vehicle license number/state, date of acquisition,
species and number of animals) concerning all animals purchased.
This is a focused inspection of the coatimundi and ringtail lemurs observed at the auction.
