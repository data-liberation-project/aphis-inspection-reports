ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is one female yellow Lab (Tattoo # 85) with a large swelling on her chest. The swelling is large, approximately
five to six inches in diameter, firm, moderately red, and warm to the touch. There are several superficial
abrasions/scratches on the surface of the swelling. Some of the abrasions are scabbed over and some of them are
open, red and moist. The facility representative stated that they gave penicillin yesterday, however there was no
documentation stating that the swelling had been identified by the facility or that the animal was treated.
There is one female Old English bulldog (Tattoo # 358) with watery fecal material and staining on her rear end. The
fecal material/staining extends from under her tail down between her hind legs. The fecal material is extremely
watery and reddish-brown in color. The haircoat is extremely wet from the fecal discharge. The skin in the area of
the wet discharge is mildly red with a few small (approximately 1-3 mm in size) open sores. There is a significant
amount of watery/loose, bloody stool under the enclosure.
Conditions such as these can be painful and can lead to further health complications. The animals listed above
must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an
appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and
resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.
