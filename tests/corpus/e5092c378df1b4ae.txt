2.40(b)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility needs to ensure the availability of emergency, weekend and holiday care for the animals. In March of 2022 a
female camel went into labor on a Saturday. She was having trouble calving and it was determined that the calf was dead.
The licensee attempted to call his attending veterinarian but she was out of town and could not be reached. Another
licensee helped him pull the dead calf and the licensee treated the female camel with a sulfur bolus and gave her
injectable antibiotics. She died four hours later. Veterinary assistance needs to be available to ensure the use of
appropriate methods to diagnose and treat diseases and injuries including the use of pain control medications. The facility
shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries and ensure the availability of
emergency, weekend and holiday care. Correct by 7/13/22.
2.134

Contingency planning.
The facility has not yet developed and documented a contingency plan. Such a plan helps provide for the humane
handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of the animals in the event of an emergency or disaster. The facility
shall develop, document and follow an appropriate contingency plan that identifies situations that trigger the plan, the


tasks required to be carried out in response, addresses how response and recovery will be handled and identifies a chain
of command/who is responsible for fulfilling the tasks. Correct by 7/31/22.
3.77(a)

Sheltered housing facilities.
The sheltered housing facilities (inside portion) for the non-human primates need to be cooled during the hot summer
temperatures currently occurring (mid to high 90s). The temperatures measured indoors on Monday were 94.6 degrees at
4:30pm and 91.8 degrees at 6:00pm (Kestrel). On Tuesday morning at 9:30 am the temperature was already at 85.4
degrees. Adequate temperature control is necessary to prevent heat stress on the monkeys. The ambient temperature in
the sheltered part of the facility must not rise above 85 degrees for more than 4 consecutive hours when non-human
primates are present. Correct by August 1, 2022.
3.84(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The outdoor sections of the sheltered housing facilities for the spider monkeys and snow macaques have overgrown thick
green grass growing in them (six inches high) and around the outside of them. These grassy areas may harbor
pests/parasites such as for example ticks and also make it difficult to see food waste and excreta that may need to be
cleaned/removed from the enclosure. The grass had been trimmed about a month ago but needs to be trimmed more
frequently during the growing season. Grass must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest
control. Correct by 7/18/22.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Several outdoor housing areas of the facility are in need of maintenance.
*The fencing of the goat enclosure around the shade/shelter structure (roofed area) has openings large enough that goats


are able to go through the openings. If they do this at the front portion of the affected area, they will have access to the
drive and eventually the road which may lead to injury or escape. During the inspection two goats were noted outside of
the enclosure. One goat was seen reentering the enclosure through one of the openings.
*The shelter structure for the deer has sustained damage to the wood floor at the entrance of the structure. There is a
loose section of wood and a missing piece of wood that the deer may injure their feet/legs on if they step in the affected
area while entering or exiting the structure.
*The alpaca and llama currently have access to a stall in the large barn. Along the side of the barn in this enclosure the
ground has eroded away leaving a steep dropoff. There is sunlight visible between the dirt ground and the lowest board of
the wall of the barn. In addition, there is a piece of wood on the ground with a sharp exposed corner. One llama was lying
in this area when the inspector entered the barn. The animals may injure themselves if they get a body part such as a
limb caught between the wood and the ground or get wedged into this area.
*There are currently two main outdoor pastures that open off of the large barn. The larger pasture/outdoor enclosure
consists of an older standard four foot livestock fence. This fence is not strong enough/secure enough to house the zebra
which currently has access to this enclosure along with a zedonk and donkeys. Zebra are strong animals with a natural
flight response and can test fences and jump fences if stressed which may lead to injury and/or escape.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
The large barn housing the alpacas, llama and zebra along with the donkeys and zedonk needs to cleaned. Alpaca/llama
excreta has accumulated on the ground in the stall area they were seen lying down in. Equine excreta has accumulated
on the ground of the two aisles used by the zebra and donkeys. The licensee stated that cleaning the barn was already on


his maintenance to do list. Regular cleaning is necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to
minimize disease hazards and reduce odors. Correct by 7/31/22.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
The pasture surrounded by the 8ft high fence and currently housing the alpaca and llama is overgrown with thick bushy
weeds (up to 1 foot tall). The ground is not visible. The weeds may harbor pests/parasites such as for example ticks and
rodents and also make it difficult to see excreta that may need to be cleaned/removed from the enclosure. In addition, the
animals may not wish to venture outside due to the prickly nature of some of the weeds. The weeds must be controlled in
order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices and pest control. Correct by
7/18/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and his wife.
