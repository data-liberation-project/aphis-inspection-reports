3.101(a)(3)

Facilities, general.
The outdoor enclosures housing a total of 4 California sea lions (called the “right” and “left” sea lion pools) had surfaces
that were not in good repair.
On the “right” sea lion enclosure, where two adult female sea lions were housed (“Sage” and “Maya”), there was pitted,
flaking rust covering 100% of the horizontal metal bar at the bottom of the gate at the enclosure’s entrance. The rust
continued approximately 6 inches up the vertical metal bars of the gate. Within the enclosure, on the far right wall near
the floor, there was an approximately 8 foot long by 2 foot tall area of patchy paint loss, where paint had flaked off
exposing concrete cinderblocks. On the left wall near the floor, there was an additional area of patchy paint loss that was
approximately 3 feet long and 6 inches tall.
On the “left” sea lion enclosure, where one adult male and one juvenile female were housed (“McCoy” and “Khali”), there
was pitted, flaking rust covering 100% of the horizontal metal bar at the bottom of the gate at the enclosure’s entrance.
The rust continued approximately 6-12 inches up the vertical metal bars of the gate. Within the enclosure, on the far wall
near the floor, there was an approximately 20 foot long by 6 inches tall area of patchy paint loss, where paint had flaked
off exposing concrete cinderblocks.
Surfaces that are severely rusted, chipped, or poorly maintained may be difficult to clean and may accumulate organic


matter or harbor harmful bacteria which is detrimental to the health of the marine mammals in the enclosure.
Correct by May 1st, 2021 by maintaining surfaces in marine mammal enclosures in good repair.
