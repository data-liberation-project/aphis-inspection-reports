2.31(c)(7) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A group of 21 sheep were acquired on 3/19/14, and placed on Holding Protocol for sheep, Protocol number
14-5528A. On 4/2/14 twenty of these sheep were given Lutalyse, (cid:28)for any possible pregnancies on this premises(cid:29).
On 5/15/14 an additional forty six ewes were acquired, added to this protocol, and treated with Lutalyse, in order to
terminate possible pregnancies.
The Protocol specifies that the sheep will be vaccinated and treated for parasites, and that they will be examined via
ultrasound to determine pregnancy status, and that any pregnant sheep (cid:28)will not be included in a project(cid:29). The
approved protocol does not include treatment with Lutalyse.
Significant changes to protocols must be approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC is tasked with evaluating all procedures and treatments that the animal will experience as part of the
protocol, so that they can consider whether they are necessary, and whether there may be any alternatives that
would improve the welfare of the animals. Significant deviations from the approved protocol must not occur unless
reviewed and approved by the IACUC.
A similar issue was cited on 2/24/15 and 6/17/14.
2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A group of goats were observed in a pen that holds goats for the Surgical Research Laboratory. Two goats had
moderately overgrown hooves with curling toes. Overgrown hooves can lead to lameness or injury. Steps should be
taken to ensure that all animals have adequate and timely foot care.
Corrected: Hoof trimming was completed on this group of goats during the inspection period.
This citation is considered a repeat because different issues were previously cited under this same section on2/24/15 and 6/17/14.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A group of sheep were observed in a pen that holds sheep for the Surgical Research Laboratory. A fence inside the
enclosure, separating two sections of the enclosure, had boards that were deteriorated, and one had a pointy end
with sharp edges that could potentially injure the sheep. The boards were held in place, in part, by twisted wire, and
they were not very secure. A metal welded wire fence section had protruding ends that were no longer secured.
Many nails and bolts that attached the boards to the posts at either end had become detached, or partially
detached, and many had protruding heads that could cause injury.
The fence should be repaired so that it has adequate structural strength, and so that there are not any sharp points
that could injure the animals.
A similar issue was cited previously on 7/23/13 with a correction date of 8/31/13.
Inspection conducted 8/10/15 through 8/13/15.
An exit interview was conducted by Drs. Jeffrey Lee and Pamela Smith, Animal Care Veterinary Medical Officers,
with CSU Facility Representatives, at the conclusion of the inspection.
