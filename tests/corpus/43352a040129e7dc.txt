3.1(c)(3) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
The flooring was completely covered with feces in an enclosure with one adult dog and four puppies. The slatted floor was
completely covered in fecal material and the animals couldn't sit or walk without getting on fecal material. A build up of
feces is a disease hazard and can attract pest. The licensee must ensure all surfaces which come in contact with the
dogs and puppies are spot cleaned daily.
3.13(a)(4) Repeat

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care is missing the plans to maintain healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed toe
nails, healthy ears, eyes, skin, and teeth. Failure to have these plans could have a negative impact on the health and well-
being of the animals.
The Program of Veterinary Care must include an appropriate plan of preventative care and treatment to maintain healthy
and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed toe nails, and healthy teeth, ears, eyes and skin. The licensee must add the
missing plans to the Program of Veterinary Care in order to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
