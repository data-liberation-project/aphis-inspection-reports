2.31(c)(7) CRITICAL
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***Significant changes regarding the use of animals in protocol #AS2836-11-20, involving guinea pigs, were not
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
APHIS inspector discovered that the PI deviated from the IACUC approved protocol regarding the duration of
guinea pig exposure to cigarette smoke and initial exposure to nebulization. The protocol states that 8 guinea pigs
would be exposed to cigarette smoke in a smoking machine for “2 hours/day for 5 days for the first week, 3
hours/day for 5 days for the second week, and 5 hours for the third week.” A flow chart in the protocol also depicts
this timeline. Facility records indicate that four guinea pigs from group 1 were exposed to cigarette smoke for 5
hours/day for a total of 6 days. The PI had planned to continue to smoke exposure for 4 more days, however this
group’s final smoke exposure occurred on 03/19/18 due to the adverse reaction of a guinea pig. As the guinea pigs
were removed from the smoking machine, one female guinea pig, microchip # 052-550-022, was observed to have
“bloody discharge from nose,” and displayed “vocalization” and “open mouth breathing.” The guinea pig received
medical treatment, however she was euthanized that same day due to continued respiratory distress. Guinea pig
#051-774-537, also from group 1, was noted to have “serosanguinous discharge on both nares” when removed
from the smoking machine on 03/19/18.
The IACUC approved protocol states that medications “will be administered via nebulization to guinea pigs during
exposure to cigarette smoke.” The protocol does not state during which week of smoke exposure the nebulization
will actually begin. The PI informed the APHIS inspector that due to difficulty in obtaining the medication, she did not
begin nebulization until 04/16/18, by which time the smoke exposure had ended for both groups. The cigarette
smoke exposure ended for group 1 guinea pigs on 03/19/18 and ended for group 2 guinea pigs on 04/13/18. The PI
did not submit an amendment informing the IACUC of the change in procedure.
Unapproved significant changes to a protocol can result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animal’s
welfare at risk. All activities involving animals must adhere to those in the IACUC-approved protocols and
amendments. This conformance to protocol is necessary to ensure that the IACUC has the authority to assure the
proper care and use of animals in research projects. Any significant changes to the approved protocol must be
reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to implementing the changes.To be corrected from this date forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
