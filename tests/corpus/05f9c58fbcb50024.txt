ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Disinfectants used by keepers to sanitize primary enclosures and animal equipment are kept in a locked cabinet
in the (cid:28)shop(cid:29) building. A limited number of staff have keys to the cabinet. When keepers need disinfectants for
animal husbandry tasks they must request access to the cabinet via one of these employees. Multiple keepers
stated there have been times they could not appropriately clean as they were unable to access disinfectants they
needed. As part of the facility(cid:25)s programs of adequate veterinary care exhibitors must ensure that appropriate
equipment, including products necessary for cleaning and sanitization, are readily available when needed to comply
the regulations and standards. The licensee must ensure the availability of appropriate facilities, personnel,
equipment, and services to comply with the regulations and standards at all times.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The male Prevost squirrel had abnormal top incisors. The left incisor was approximately one third of the length of
the right incisor. When the squirrel held its mouth in a slightly opened position the right incisor extended past the
lower lip. Although the squirrel(cid:25)s incisors had been trimmed on November 5, 2015 no records document the
abnormal appearance of the teeth and none of the facility representatives indicated that they were aware of it. Tooth
abnormalities can prevent normal chewing or feeding and could occur as the result of trauma or malocclusion.
The licensee must have the squirrel evaluated by a veterinarian to obtain an appropriate diagnosis and treatment
plan; the licensee must document the outcome of the evaluation and that documentation must be made available to
APHIS upon request.
***Expired medications were found during this inspection: Fatal-Plus expired 4/14. According to records, the
Fatal-Plus was used on two animals since the last inspection which includes a serval (ID K4M008) on 11/4/15.
The use of expired medications is not considered to be a safe or appropriate method to prevent, control, diagnose,and treat diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience
pain and distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or due to unexpected side effects.
The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***A male De Brazza(cid:25)s monkey had an area of hair loss on the distal third of his tail; the underlying skin had a
normal appearance. The female De Brazza(cid:25)s monkey in the same enclosure had thinning hair on her tail. Facility
representatives stated that the female had plucked the hair from her tail and her cagemate(cid:25)s. Hair loss and
overgrooming can be potential indicators of psychological distress in nonhuman primates. The enclosure contained
a climbing structure and sparse enrichment: a spinning PVC tube feeder and two yellow plastic toy pieces that were
on the ground. An electronic facility record dated 11/19/2015 stated (cid:28)Debrazza pulling hair out of both her and the
male(cid:25)s tails&(cid:29) No records indicated that the attending veterinarian was consulted regarding the abnormal
behavior/appearance or that any special consideration was provided regarding the enhancement of their
environment. The facility(cid:25)s current primate enhancement plan does not address special considerations for
nonhuman primates that need special attention regarding environmental enhancement such as nonhuman primates
showing potential signs of psychological distress through their behavior or appearance to ensure that their
psychological needs are met.
As part of the facility(cid:25)s plan for environment enhancement, the licensee must ensure that all nonhuman primates
showing signs of being in psychological distress through appearance or behavior are provided special attention
regarding the enhancement of their environment, taking into consideration the needs of the individual species and in
accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian. The facility must develop, document, and follow an
appropriate plan for the environment enhancement for these De Brazza(cid:25)s and any other nonhuman primate
requiring special considerations.

EMPLOYEES.
***The facility has six animal keepers on staff who work on a rotating schedule. When fully staffed there are four
animal keepers each covering one of four (cid:28)areas(cid:29) on any given day. Employees typically work 8 or 9 hour shifts
(depending on area assignment) and overtime is not authorized. Approximately 370 animals of a variety of species
are present including nonhuman primates, big cats, bears, hoofstock, exotic/wild mammals, domestic mammals,and a large variety of raptors, exotic birds, domestic birds, reptiles, and amphibians. These animals have complex
medical, behavioral, nutritional, reproductive and other husbandry needs.
Several keeper daily reports show that daily tasks were not done due to lack of time. Employees estimated it can
take anywhere from seven to ten hours to complete basic animal husbandry tasks each day, depending on the area
they are covering. This estimate does not include other areas of responsibility such as maintenance, assisting with
veterinary care/physical exams/procedures, animal training or seasonal activities such as keeper talks and cleaning
and maintenance of public areas when the zoo is open that could add one to several hours of work. When asked, all
employees interviewed by AC personnel stated they do not have enough time to complete what they need to each
day.

On several occasions, employees verbally stated or noted on daily reports they have had to cover multiple areas in
one day due to sick employees or last minute call-ins. When employees were asked how they accomplish all tasks
when covering two areas, they responded that not everything gets done. Several employees stated that cleaning is
either minimal or not done at all on those days. Additionally, verbal descriptions of facility practices regarding
cleaning and sanitization, enrichment, and animal behavioral training indicate that if there is not enough time, the
facility may not complete all tasks. Inspectors identified multiple areas during the inspection where nonhuman
primate enrichment was sparse, maintenance had not occurred, cleaning was inadequate, or appropriate
sanitization was not completed.
Facilities are required to utilize a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professional
husbandry standards described in the regulations and standards to ensure that the animals are kept in appropriately
maintained, sanitary facilities and receive appropriate monitoring, veterinary care, feeding, watering, and care.
The licensee must evaluate the current work load and staffing level and ensure that a sufficient number of
adequately trained employees are utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices
described in the regulations and standards. A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to
maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In the back housing area of the red panda exhibit, broken wires were protruding into the animal enclosure,
measuring approximately two to five inches in length. The female red panda was observed climbing the enclosure
walls and could come into contact with those wires and be injured.
***In the back holding area of the Bactrian camel enclosure, multiple twisted metal wires with sharp points were
located along enclosure panels. AC personnel noted clumps of hair on several of the wires. Additionally, thisenclosure currently houses a camel calf, whose head is within the same height range as the protruding wires. The
twisted wires are protruding into the animal area and pose a risk of injury to the animals.
Housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. A routine schedule of
maintenance shall be established that identifies and corrects these broken wires to protect the animals from injury
and steps must be taken to ensure these items do not repeat.

SANITATION.
***Inside the sloth bear back housing, an accumulation of heavy dust and cobwebs covered the surfaces, light
fixtures, hanging heating units, and equipment. Inside the sloth bear refrigerator, a dark residue covered the bottom,
along with various pests.
***Inside the zebra barn, an accumulation of heavy dust and cobwebs covered the light fixtures, hanging heating
units, and the rafters.
***The back window inside the food storage area, has an accumulation of cobwebs, dust and dead pests.
Accumulation of debris (i.e. dust, cobwebs, dead pests) make it difficult to maintain husbandry standards, can be
areas for harboring pests which can transmit disease to the regulated animals and may be an indication of
substandard husbandry practices. Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order
to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
***The following animals: Lar gibbons and New Guinee Singing Dog, cited under 2.40(b)(2) on inspection report
dated Oct-27-2015 have been evaluated by a veterinarian and are receiving care.
