3.14(a)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
The licensee is transporting dogs for exhibition in a manner that does not meet the regulations under this Section
(3.14(a)(1-9).
The dogs are being transported without being contained in a primary enclosure. Several ride in the back of the
licensee's pickup truck or within the mobile home without being contained in a compartment, transport cage, carton,
or crate and on a surface that is not solid, leakproof, or with bedding/litter that is suitably absorbent.
This manner of transport does not adequately contain the animals to protect them from injury or to allow for cleaning
and sanitizing of the areas should they become soiled.
Dogs must be contained in a primary enclosure as required under the AWA.
To be corrected by 9/6/2014.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee at the Colorado State Fair, Pueblo, CO.
