FACILITIES, GENERAL.
This facility had 12 ground squirrels on their last inspection dated July 1, 2015. Since that time frame, the director
indicated that they had 2 squirrels escaped from the enclosure. The facility has made changes to the rear wall in an
attempt to keep the squirrels contained within their enclosure. However; they had 4 squirrels that were unable to be
found or located between fall of 2015 and spring of 2016. It is unclear at this time the actual disposition of these
animals or when these animals disappeared from the facility. This facility must ensure that there are methods in
place to monitor animal movements to identify animal escapes in a timely manner. In addition; all enclosures must
be constructed and maintained in a manner that will securely contain the species of animal contained therein.
