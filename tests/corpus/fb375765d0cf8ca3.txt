ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Maltese with tag number 008 has areas of hair loss on her left side and around the base of her tail. A
female Bichon with tag number 373 also has areas of hair loss on her front legs above the paws. The skin in the
areas of hair loss on both dogs appears reddened and all areas have small raised reddish colored lesions present.
The facility representative is currently treating the areas of hair loss with a topical spray, but has not yet sought
veterinary attention for the dogs. Failure to have the issue addressed by the attending veterinarian can result in
pain and discomfort to the animals. The animals must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian and the
prescribed treatment must be administered.

the required information pertaining to the acquisition of the dogs must be documented on the facility record of dogs
on hand to ensure that the facility records are complete and accurate.
