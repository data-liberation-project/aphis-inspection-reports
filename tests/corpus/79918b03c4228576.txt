2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
-(cid:9)Two sheep on an active protocol involving a tick study had no record of a required medication being administered.
The protocol states that each sheep was to receive an injection of Dexamethasone to relieve inflammation and
discomfort. This protocol utilizes two sheep every 10-14 days. There is no record being kept to demonstrate that
any sheep in this protocol have received the dexamethasone injections. In addition, the sheep are not being
individually weighed prior to being used on the protocol. Failure to weigh each individual sheep makes accurate
dosing extremely difficult. The facility must ensure that accurate weights are obtained for each animal prior to being
utilized on the protocol. Records must be kept for any medications given to ensure that appropriate relief is being
provided for the animals on this study.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.
