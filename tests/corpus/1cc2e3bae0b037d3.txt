3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The facility has more improvements by removing brush from inside the perimeter fence. Several trees remain
near the perimeter fence in the upper storage area and behind the coatimundi/rabbit area of the facility. There is
also one tree growing through the perimeter fence in the upper East portion of the fence. Trees near the perimeter
fence may act as a climbing source for animals should they get out of their primary enclosure. The facility President
stated that the facility plans to have the trees removed by the end of the calendar year. Correct by completing
removal or altering of trees in a manner to ensure the perimeter fence can adequately function as a secondary
containment system.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED.
