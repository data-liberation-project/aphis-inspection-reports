3.14(a)(9) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At the cargo facility serving Turkish Airlines, two fawn male juvenile dogs were inspected after arrival from Kyiv,
Ukraine via Istanbul, Turkey on waybill number 235-67264584.
1. Fawn male juvenile dog #1 - This animal's enclosure contains a mixture of white and brown shredded paper
material. The quantity of material covers only ~50% of the solid plastic floor of the enclosure, leaving the plastic
floor exposed in the front half of the enclosure. Approximately 70-80% of the paper material is visibly soiled with
both liquid and solid excreta, and there is a pile of uncovered fecal material at the front of the enclosure. Small
amounts of brown, malodorous waste material are evident on the animal's feet and legs. A strong odor of animal
waste is present in and around the enclosure. There is not enough absorbent litter material to absorb and cover the
excreta, and as a result the animal is in direct contact with the excreta.
2. Fawn male juvenile dog #2 - This animal's enclosure contains a plastic absorbent pad, which contains an
absorbent gel. Also present is an accumulation of loose, shredded paper litter material. One corner of the plastic
absorbent pad visible from the front of the enclosure is stretched and torn, exposing the absorbent gel within the
pad, and pieces of the blue plastic have been torn away, which is consistent with digging and/or chewing behaviors.
This plastic film and other components of this absorbent pad may be harmful to the animal's health if ingested.
Carriers must ensure that primary enclosures with solid floors contain enough previously unused litter material to
absorb and cover excreta. The litter material must be of a suitably absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic.
This inspection was conducted at the cargo facility serving Turkish Airlines. Two representatives from Customs and
Border Protection were present at the time of inspection. No airline representatives were available at this location.
