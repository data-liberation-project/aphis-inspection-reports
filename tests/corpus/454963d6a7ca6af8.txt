ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female black and white Boston Terrier (Zado, #71) was extremely thin. Her ribs, spine, long bones and hips were
easily seen. There was a very defined tuck behind her ribs. She was nursing 7 puppies. Poor body condition can
be an indication of inadequate nutrition, parasites, or an underlying medical condition. The dog must be evaluated
by a veterinarian for appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Documents of the evaluation and treatment must be
available to APHIS officials.
