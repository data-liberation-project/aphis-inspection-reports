3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The food is not stored in a manner that protects it from spoilage, contamination and vermin infestation. The food bin
located in the whelping building did not have the lid secured and flies were on the food. There were sacks of
unopened dog food laid directly on the floor.
Supplies of food must be stored in a manner that protects them from spoilage, contamination, and vermin
infestation. The bags must be stored off the floor and away from the walls and the food bins must have lids secured
to prevent contamination and deterioration of the food's nutritive value to maximize healthy nutritive absorption for
the dogs and/or puppies.
Correct from this day forward.
3.2(d) REPEAT
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The seal on the wood frames in the whelping kennels have deep and extensive scratch and chew marks on them
which exposes the unsealed wood underneath. These areas are no longer impervious to moisture and now cannot
be properly cleaned and sanitized. Routine maintenance and repair of any surface in contact with the animals must
be impervious to moisture to ensure proper cleaning and sanitation to prevent the spread of disease to puppies and
their dams.
