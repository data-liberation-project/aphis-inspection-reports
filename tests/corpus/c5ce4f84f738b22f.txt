2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
*** On September 23, 2016 two ferrets on protocol 16-06-024B escaped their cage. The staff observed through the
window during the AM check that the bottom cage door was ajar. Once the staff accessed the room he was only
able to locate one of the two ferrets. Ferret #15145 was not found and the facility has yet to discern how the animal
escaped the room. The staff was trained to double check the enclosures with the understanding that they have the
potential to not latch. During questioning the staff member mentioned that there could be a chance that the door
was not properly secured. There are other advantage points in which the animal could have escaped the secondary
containment but not the primary containment.
Animals should be handled carefully, in such a manner that does not cause them trauma, physical harm, or
unnecessary discomfort. The facility should ensure that corrective actions for handling issues will prevent similar
problems from occurring in the future.
The facility has implemented additional enclosure locks on the cage to ensure they are secured once closed. Also
there have been other corrections implemented on the second containment. The facility self-reported the incident to
APHIS officials.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian.
