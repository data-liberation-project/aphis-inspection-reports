2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***The primary enclosure for the wolves, llama's, nilgai, muntjac, wallaby, pig's, fallow deer, axis deer, goat's and
cow do not have a barrier fence. These areas are not constantly monitored by a zoo employee, the public can easily
get to the enclosure fence and put their hands or other objects through the enclosure.
All enclosures must have a barrier fence that is at least 3 feet from the enclosure on all sides to protect the animals
and the public from injury.
3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***One patas monkey enclosure and the enclosure housing two mona monkeys have tree limbs and/or tree stumps
in their enclosures that is covered in green growth indicating that this surface is not readily sanitizable or can not be
readily sanitized. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and
sanitized to prevent disease hazards.
***The straw bedding in the mona monkeys den had insects and bugs crawling throughout it. Contaminated material
must be removed or replaced whenever raking or spot cleaning does not eliminate diseases, insects, pests, or
vermin infestation. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy
generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
3.80(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** The mona monkeys enclosure had a metal support at the bottom of the gate that is rusted to the point that it is
flaking and rusting through the surface of the metal. This could affect the structural strength and is not in good
repair. The support must be repaired and maintained to ensure that the enclosure is structurally sound and in good
repair. To be corrected by: 02-12-15.3.84(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***The lemurs den box and the baboons night building had what appeared to be rodent droppings on the floor.
Rodent droppings can be a disease hazard.
***The mona monkeys den box had roaches and ants crawling throughout the bedding. Insects can be a disease
hazard and contaminate the bedding.
The facility must establish an effective pest control program to control insects, and mammals that are pest to
promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pest in the animal areas. To be
corrected by: 01-19-15.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The tiger night building has water damage to the ceiling with wood that is rotting and falling apart. The water
damage and rotting wood can affect the structural strength of the ceiling and the building is not being kept in good
repair. The damaged ceiling maybe allowing rain water into the enclosures which may be wetting the bedding. The
ceiling must be repaired and maintained to ensure that the building is structurally sound and kept in good repair.
*** The wallaby shelter building had three exposed nail heads along a support board at ground level. The animal
can come into contact with the nail heads which could injure the animal. The nail heads must be removed to ensure
that they do not injure the animal housed in the enclosure.
All facilities must be structurally sound and kept in good repair.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The fallow deer enclosure did not provide adequate natural shelter from inclement weather. The fallow deer
enclosure contained two artificial shelters. One shelter is missing most of the wall slats on one side of the shelter.
This does not provide adequate shelter from inclement weather and one shelter is not large enough to allow all of
the animals at one time access to adequate shelter. The shelter must be repaired or replaced to provide adequate
shelter to all of the animals in the enclosure at one time. Outdoor facilities must provide animals shelter from
inclement weather. To be corrected by: 01-26-15.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. *** Along the perimeter fencing adjacent to the diet facility there was a space approximately a foot from the ground
to the bottom of the fencing. There was an overgrowth of foliage and the fencing was rusted and broken at the
bottom of the fencing. These areas of deficiency are extensive and the entire perimeter fence should be checked.
This space at the bottom of the fencing could allow predators or unwanted animals access to the premises. The
gate behind the diet facility was bent and did not close properly. An area of the perimeter fence adjacent to the
neighbors livestock had a metal pole jarred against the perimeter fence post for support, the fence post were not
stable and could be move back and forth by hand. The gate and fence post must be repaired to ensure that the
perimeter is structurally sound.
All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. The fence must be at least 8 ft in height. The fence must be constructed so that it
protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility.
