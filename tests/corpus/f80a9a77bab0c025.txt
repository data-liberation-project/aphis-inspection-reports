Kitchen/food preparation area: Cutting boards were stored on top of a refrigerator which had an accumulation of
dust, dirt, and debris including rodent feces. There was a buildup of dust and dirt on the outside of several plastic
food storage containers and inside of a plastic tub used to store knives and other kitchen utensils.
Premises including buildings, surrounding grounds and animal areas must be kept clean, free of clutter and in good
repair in order to protect the health and well-being of the animals, to prevent the harborage of vermin and pests, and
to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. A system of maintaining effective housekeeping practices must be
in place.

SANITATION.
Accumulations of rodent feces were visible in corners of the floor as well as on top of and behind refrigerators in the
kitchen/food preparation building. Also, a dry food storage shed had an excessive amount of rodent feces present
on the floor, along the walls behind bags of food, and along a window sill.
Excessive accumulations of rodent feces pose a risk to the health and well-being of the animals. Although there is a
pest control program in place, it is not sufficient to prevent visible evidence of pests in these buildings. A safe and
effective pest control program must be established and regularly maintained so as to promote the health and
well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
