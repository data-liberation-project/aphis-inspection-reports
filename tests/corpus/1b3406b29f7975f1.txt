Fremont Exotic Animal auction. The owners of these animals do not have a USDA license. The sale of exotic animals

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The auction accepted Four Russian foxes in four enclosures measuring 18 in x 14 in x 12in. The water bucket inside the
enclosure took up approximately half of the floor space. There was not enough floor space to allow the fox to make
normal postural movements (stand, sit, lie and turn around freely). All primary enclosures used shall be large enough to
ensure that each animal contained therein has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make normal postural
adjustments.

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.

Four enclosures (each containing a Russian Fox) with solid bottoms did not have any absorbent material. Due to the lack
of absorbent material, the foxes were wet and walking/lying in fecal material. All enclosures with solid bottoms shall
contain clean absorbent litter material in such a quantity to absorb/cover excreta (unless on wire or other nonsolid floors)
to allow animals to remain clean and dry.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
