2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult white male rabbit has an approximately 1-inch long oval shaped wound on his back, over the shoulder blades.
The licensee stated that this was due to the other rabbit over grooming him, which the other rabbit has now stopped
doing, and stated that she has been treating the wound with topical antibiotic ointment twice daily per the Attending
Veterinarian’s instructions. The ointment that the licensee has been using expired in April 2022, and has a few holes in
the side of the tube. Medications that are expired or contaminated may loose potency or may be less effective. Correct by
11/25/22 by using medications that are not expired, in accordance with the Attending Veterinarian’s instructions.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Disposition records were not available for 2 chinchillas, 5 hedgehogs, 1 sloth, 1 pig, and 1 tamandua. Accurate
recordkeeping is important for animal traceability in the event of disease outbreaks or animal theft or loss. Correct by
01/01/23 by updating and maintaining records to accurately and completely capture animal disposition information.
2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
The licensee conducts public encounters with nonhuman primates at home and at off-site locations, both of which are
conducted in a manner which poses significant risk to the animals and the public. The licensee allows public encounters


with a variety of nonhuman primates including juvenile red ruff lemur, juvenile owl monkey, and juvenile spider monkeys.
The licensee stated the primates always wear a leash. The licensee stated that while wearing a leash, the nonhuman
primates are petted and held by members of the public (including children), and the animals are allowed to climb on the
head, shoulders, arms, and lap of the members of the public doing the encounter. One spider monkey gives hugs to
members of the public. The licensee brings these and other animals to off-site events including children’s birthday parties
and preschools. The licensee stated that offsite encounters are conducted the same way as other visits with regards to
animal handling. Photos posted on the licensee’s social media account from a few recent events were reviewed with the
licensee. Photos show nonhuman primates climbing on the head, shoulders, arms, and laps of members of the public
while wearing a leash. Allowing nonhuman primates to climb on the head, shoulders, and arms of members of the public
poses significant risk of harm to the animals and the public. The animals may contract diseases from members of the
public, or animals may be injured when roughly handled or dropped by members of the public. Members of the public may
be bitten or scratched when animals are startled, scared, or stressed, which in some cases may result in euthanasia of
the animal for rabies testing.

Correct by 12/18/22 by conducting encounters with nonhuman primates so that there is minimal risk of harm to the
animals and to the public to assure the safety of the animals and the public.
2.134

Contingency planning.
The licensee does not have a written contingency plan in place that adequately identifies emergency scenarios and the
resources, equipment, and personnel needed to cope with those scenarios. Employee training on the contents of the plan
has not been documented. A written emergency/contingency plan is required to help ensure animal health and well-being
in the event of an emergency or disaster; without this tool, animals may suffer illness, injury or death due to


unpreparedness should an emergency or disaster strike. The licensee must develop, document and follow an appropriate
plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of their animals in the event of an
emergency or disaster (one which could reasonably be anticipated and expected to be detrimental to the good health and
well-being of the animals in their possession). The contingency plan must include all of the information and documentation
as detailed in Section 2.134(a-c) of the Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations. Employees must be trained
on the contents of the plan and their training must be documented. Correct by 02/17/23.
3.55

Watering.
Four adult rabbits were housed in an enclosure that had two water bowls, both of which were empty and dry. The licensee
stated that the rabbits had already been watered that morning, approximately 2-3 hours ago. At USDA’s request, the
water bowls were filled and 3 of the 4 rabbits eagerly began drinking water and continued to do so for 45 seconds. The
fourth rabbit waited until the others were done and then went to the bowls and drank for approximately 10 seconds. The
rabbits continued to revisit the water bowls to drink intermittently over the next 10 minutes. Rabbits without access to
adequate water may suffer from discomfort, stress, dehydration, or medical issues. Correct by 11/18/22 by ensuring that
all rabbits have access to adequate water at least daily to prevent discomfort, excessive thirst, and dehydration. Corrected
at the time of inspection.
3.80(b)

Primary enclosures.
Three juvenile nonhuman primates (a red ruffed lemur, a brown lemur, and an owl monkey) are housed in an enclosure
that is 36 inches long by 21 inches wide, providing 756 square inches of floor space (756/144 = 5.25 square feet). The
licensee stated that the animals are allowed out of the enclosure into a larger room often, but that they sleep together in
the cage at night. Three juvenile group 2 nonhuman primates require a total of 9 square feet of floorspace. The current


enclosure needs to provide an additional 3.75 square feet to meet the minimum cage size requirements. Animals without
adequate space may suffer from stress, discomfort, crowding, and may be unable to make normal postural and social
adjustments. Correct by 11/25/22 by providing all nonhuman primates with the minimum space required under the Animal
Welfare Act.
3.81(c)(1)

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The facility currently has 5 juvenile nonhuman primates, including some which were acquired at less than 2 months of
age. The facility’s current enrichment plan for nonhuman primates does not address the special needs of infant and
juvenile nonhuman primates. Nonhuman primates have complex social, environmental, and medical needs. Infants and
young juveniles require special attention and care in order to ensure proper socialization and to decrease stress. Infants
and juveniles without adequate social and environmental enrichment may develop abnormal behaviors that can result in
harm to the animal. Correct by 01/01/2023 by documenting and implementing an enrichment plan for nonhuman primates
that addresses the special needs of infants and juveniles, as approved by the attending veterinarian.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
