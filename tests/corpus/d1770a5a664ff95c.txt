2.134

Contingency planning.
The licensee has components of a contingency plan but it is incomplete and does not address all the possible situations
that would trigger the need for the measures identified in the contingency plan, specific tasks, chain of command and
training. The licensee must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling,
treatment, transportation, housing and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster. The contingency
plan must include all of the information and documentation as detailed in Section 2.134 (a-c) of the Animal Welfare
Regulations and employees must be trained on the plan.

Sanitation.
The floor in the kitchen area used to prepare diets for the mammals had areas of damaged tile and exposed concrete
floor. The floor with exposed concrete is no longer in good repair and the porous concrete does not facilitate cleaning and
disinfection of a kitchen area. Floors in kitchens must be maintained in good repair and able to be cleaned and
disinfected, consistent with good husbandry practices.
