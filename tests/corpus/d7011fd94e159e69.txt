ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white ten year old beagle with brown and black spots named Sheba, ear tattoo number Q8, was seen with
moisture around the lips and upon closer examination was found to have dental disease. The majority of the front
teeth of the upper jaw, including the canines, had a moderate amount of hard brown grey build-up. Most of the rear
teeth of both the left and right side of the upper jaw had a heavy build-up of that hard brown to grey material. Two of
the rear teeth on the right side of the upper jaw had a cream to tan colored spongy material at the gum line. The
dog’s gums had receded along some of the rear teeth as well. The licensee had not identified Sheba’s dental
condition and therefore was not providing treatment. If left untreated, the abnormal build-up can cause further
damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. Dental conditions can be painful and may decrease the dog’s ability
to eat normally thus negatively impacting the overall health of the animal.
A three year old white, black and brown beagle named Joey, ear tattoo number 1613, was seen with hairless areas
on the back of both the left and right paws. On the right paw, the skin on the larger of the two hairless areas
appeared slightly thickened. There were 2 hairless areas on the left paw approximately 0.5 inches in diameter,
located at the base of the toes. The skin in these two areas was raised and thickened. The skin surrounding the
hairless region was dark brown to black in color. Three pinpoint red spots could be seen on the hairless region to
the left of the paw. The licensee had not noticed and was not treating the skin condition on Joey but explained that
this is a common occurrence in their facility. The licensee stated having communicated with the attending
veterinarian in the past about treating and preventing this condition. Left untreated, this skin condition may worsen
causing pain and distress to the dog.
Failure to promptly identify diseases and injuries delays treatment and may cause undue pain and distress in
animals with conditions such as these listed here. A more complete method of daily observation of all animals must
be implemented in order to assess their health, well-being and for timely communication with the attending
veterinarian. The above described dogs need to be evaluated by a veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and
treatment.

3.1(c)(2)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several areas in the dog’s primary enclosures were identified in need of maintenance:
-(cid:9)In many of the outside runs, on the wall bellow the run door, there was a large accumulation of green fuzzy
material growing on the surface.
-(cid:9)In at least two outside runs, the concrete surface connecting to the interior area, was a quarter to half of the way
destroyed leaving a large gap with accumulated water.
-(cid:9)At least two hard resting surfaces for the dogs were seen with a large gap with frayed edges at a corner of the
structure.
-(cid:9)In the interior aspect of many enclosures, there were large gaps in the material coating the walls and the floors, at
times exposing bare concrete.
-(cid:9)Within many enclosures, there were small depressed areas next to the run doors that appeared to have patches of
crusty material black and green in color.
Surfaces in disrepair such as these are difficult to adequately clean and sanitize and may present a safety hazard
for the dogs. All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily
cleaned or sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.
To be corrected by April 11 2019.
