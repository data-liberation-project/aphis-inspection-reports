Water quality.
Water quality testing records indicate that daily water sampling for the pools in the enclosure housing two, adult male
polar bears was not performed and/or documented. A review of all water quality record logs available at the time of
inspection revealed 16 dates with no testing/results recorded: 03/07/22, 04/24/22, 04/28/22, 05/01/22, 05/12/22,
06/05/22, 06/22/22, 07/04/22, 07/08/22, 07/13/22, 07/24/22, 07/31/2022, 08/07/22, 08/19/22, 08/21/22, 09/03/22.
Failure to perform daily water quality testing for pH and any chemical additives increases the risk that water quality will not
be appropriate or safe for these animals that drink from, and spend a great amount of time in, these pools. Undetected
water quality problems can result in animal health and behavioral issues. Water samples shall be taken and tested at
least weekly for coliform count and at least daily for pH and any chemical additives. Furthermore, records must be kept
documenting the time when all such samples were taken and the results of the sampling, and records of all such test
results shall be maintained by management for a one-year period and must be made available for inspection purposes
upon request.
TO BE CORRECTED BY 09/15/2022.
