Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
There was no report to the Institutional Official (IO) prepared after the semi-annual review conducted on May 23, 2022.
Hand-written notes from the review include plans for correction such as label dog food, monitor fridge/freezer temps, etc.
but do not list the deficiencies, do not distinguish significant from minor deficiencies, and do not include a schedule with
dates for correcting each deficiency.
Failure to submit reports of semi-annual reviews can result in the IO not being adequately informed of issues in the
program or facility.
The research facility must prepare reports every 6 months upon completion of semiannual evaluations that contain a list
of deficiencies, distinguish significant from minor deficiencies, a plan and schedule with dates for correcting each
deficiency, and is signed by a majority of IACUC members and includes any minority views.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC chair.
