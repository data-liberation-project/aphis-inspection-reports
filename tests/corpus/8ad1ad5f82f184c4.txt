OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
***There was an outdoor enclosure housing three adult Cocker Spaniels with a single shelter that was not big
enough for each dog to make normal postural movements at the same time. According to the licensee, the
igloo-style shelter was a medium-sized igloo. Adequate shelter space for each dog is important for the health and
comfort of the dog. The licensee must ensure that one or more shelter structures are accessible to each animal in
each outdoor facility and that the shelters are large enough to allow each animal in the shelter sturcutre to sit, stand,
and lie in a nomral manner and to turn about freely. To be corrected by: September 22, 2014.
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(c) Housekeeping for premises.
***There were various areas throughout the facility with cobwebs, dead flies and/or a build-up of dirt and debris.
Inside the whelping building, there was an excessive number of dead flies on the floor located under the primary
enclosures and near the entrance door. Also, there were several cobwebs noted around the facility, including along
the wire panel of a primary enclosure and along the bases and entrances of some of the shelter structures for the
outdoor enclosures. The outside surfaces of some of the shelter structures also had some bird droppings on them
and/or a build-up of dirt and debris. An accumulation of cobwebs, dead flies, dirt and/or debris increases the risk of
disease hazards to the animals. The licensee must ensure that the facility premises are kept clean and in good
repair to protect the animals from injury, to facilitate the husbandry practices required in this subpart and to reduce
or eliminate breeding and living areas for pests at all times.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
