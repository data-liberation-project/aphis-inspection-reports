3.75(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In a primary enclosure for the male gorilla the floors and toilets have missing and chipped paint in some areas.
Paint is worn off of window frames and some areas of metal grating and supports. Window frames have reddish
dust, possible from rust. Some repairs have been initiated, including temporary measures to ensure that the floor is
not peeling, and is impervious to moisture. Further repairs have been planned, but not yet carried out.
The ceiling above the enclosure in the small yard has peeling paint, and the wood appears to be deteriorating, and
this could allow particles to fall into the enclosure. An estimate for making these repairs has been obtained from a
contractor, and repair planning is in progress.
All surfaces must be maintained and/or replaced on a regular basis. Failure to maintain and/or replace surfaces can
impede cleaning, create hazards, and otherwise put the health and well-being of the animals at risk.
