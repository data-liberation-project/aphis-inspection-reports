ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection of records, it appeared some recommendations of the attending veterinarian had not been
followed to provide adequate care to the giraffe herd. Three giraffes were in declining body condition when they
died. In September of 2013, the veterinarian at that time had instituted a Body Condition check involving
photographing each individual giraffe from various angles. There was a turnover in Veterinary Staff and the formal
practice was not performed in March/April 2014 or thereafter, although the new attending veterinarian has
re-instated this practice for this time forward.
The first animal, a 14-year old Masai giraffe named Naivasha, was evaluated on Jan 30, 2014. The medical record
indicates that a retrospective comparison revealed that her body condition had declined since the previous year
(2013). The veterinarian recommended adding one pound of supplemental feed (cid:28)Boost(cid:29) to her diet for an indefinite
period, but no formal prescription or treatment sheet was issued. While at least one record indicates Boost was
provided as a treat during training, there is no further documentation that Boost was added to her diet. The next
assessment of body condition was documented on May 22, 2014, when she was noted to have poor body condition.
There is documentation that the animal was formally prescribed and actually treated with the Boost feed at that
time. On August 7, 2014, the veterinarian noted: (cid:28)Body condition is not showing improvement despite good
consumption of supplemental feed (Boost).(cid:29) On August 12, 2014 the records state (cid:28)Giraffe found dead in stall this
AM. Plans had been for immobilization Thursday 8-21 with dental consult& Animal(cid:25)s condition and mentation had
declined steadily&(cid:29); even though Naivasha had been maintained in the giraffe barn and adjoining yard rather than in
pasture for over a year, which allowed for more intensive monitoring and treatment.
The second animal was an 8-year old Baringo giraffe named Geraldine. There is no evidence in the medical record
of her body condition having been documented with photographs, other than the September/October 2013 set of
photos. On May 28, 2014, this animal was brought into the chute for treatment of a chronic parasite problem
(documented high counts for parasites in fecal samples on April 16, May 2, and May 23, 2014). The animal was
resistant to handling and became recumbent. Despite veterinary care and monitoring provided, the animal was
unable to stand, did not recover, and was euthanized. The body condition score stated in the necropsy report was
2/5 or 3/9, (very lean to slightly thin) with evidence of GI tract abnormalities consistent with chronic parasite burden
and/or a suboptimal diet. The third animal, Mickey, a 19-year old female giraffe, died on 6/20/2013 from a rhinoceros goring. This animal had
pathology suggestive of being in an energy deficient state at the time of the goring. This animal died before the
attending veterinarian recommended routine Body Condition assessments.

Failure to follow the veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations may compromise the provision of adequate veterinary care,
which requires accurate and detailed records relating to follow up actions as part of the program of veterinary care.
Each exhibitor must assure that the attending veterinarian has proper authority to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. This includes the assurance
that when treatments or specialized diets are prescribed, that they will be administered properly and that if a
treatment failure is noted, or if animals are not eating a prescribed diet, the veterinarian will be made aware of it so
that they are able to formulate an alternative plan. Correct by ensuring that the attending veterinarian has
appropriate authority over the adequacy of veterinary care and other aspects of other animal care and use,
including nutrition, handling, husbandry, and animal compatibility. Documentation of the Attending Veterinarian(cid:25)s
recommendations on these issues and facility response (treatment administration, nutrition, policy development,
plan implementation, etc.) shall be maintained by the facility and made available to APHIS Officials upon request.
To be corrected by: from this time forward.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This facility is not adequately conducting and recording daily observations in a way that can be effectively conveyed
to the attending veterinarian. The facility(cid:25)s own protocols require keepers (cid:28)to record the security, health, and
wellbeing and pertinent noteworthy behaviors of the animals in their charge.(cid:29) The protocol also states that
noteworthy behaviors should include normal and/or abnormal locomotion, feeding, social grouping/association, and
aggression.
The Director of Animal Management stated that it can be difficult to observe all the animals on any given day. In
fact, several staff members stated that new animal births or deaths may not be noticed for up to several days in
some of the hoofstock areas due to the large amount of pasture land and animals hiding in wooded areas. The
majority (23) of the 36 deaths recorded in the past 11 months suggest a lack of adequate daily observation. Some
daily observations noted may have been indicators of more serious problems. For example, observations of rhinos
interfering with giraffe feeding were noted on 5/3/15 and 5/9/15. On 6/2/15, a 1.5 year old giraffe was found dead
by goring. Takin aggression was noted in early July 2015, but there was no evidence of follow-up. Three takin died
of traumatic wounds between July 13 and August 10, 2015.
Daily observation and assessment of animals(cid:25) health and well-being are important to identify when an animal is in
need of veterinary care or other intervention. If an animal in need of treatment goes unobserved or unreported for aprolonged period of time, that animal may suffer undue pain and distress that could be alleviated with adequate
veterinary care. Likewise animals that are not eating an appropriate diet in sufficient quantity to maintain their health
and well-being must be reported to the attending veterinarian. Records of these observations and subsequent
direct and frequent communication to the attending veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information
on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to facilitate the provision of adequate veterinary
care. Correct by ensuring daily observations of all animals by trained staff to assess their health and well-being and
appropriately document in records. Additionally, ensure that a mechanism is in place for direct and frequent
communication in order to ensure that timely and accurate information regarding problems of animal health,
behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following areas were found in need of repair or replacement:
1. The indoor enclosures and holding areas for the cheetahs had flaking and pitted rust on the metal bars of the
enclosure.
2. The plywood in the indoor giraffe housing area currently has several areas where the surface layer of the wood
has peeled or chipped away. From the floor level to approximately 1 foot in height around the indoor enclosure there
was water staining and soaked areas of plywood.
3. The black floor mat in the entry way of the indoor giraffe enclosure was significantly peeling, with missing chunks.
4. In the hoof-stock and rhino barns the plastic weather/freezer strips hung at the top of the doors were in disrepair.
These strips were broken in several enclosures and throughout all enclosures were stained with fecal material, dirt
and debris.
5. In the Med barn, the roof has a large area that is wet on the inside from water damage from a leak in the roof.
6. In the Med barn, along both sides of the hallway fronting the stalls, there is missing wood at the base and there is
water damage.
All of these areas are in need of repair or replacement. All animal enclosures must be properly maintained to
adequately contain the animals and protect them from injury. These repairs will also promote proper cleaning of
enclosures to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in the regulations and standards.

WATERING. There are six (6) pasture areas which house animals part or all year. All areas have access to one or more of five
(5) ponds on the site, one (1) area contains a fresh water source. Although previous water testing showed two (2) of
the ponds had elevated levels of E. coli and were deemed non-potable at the time of such testing, no recent testing
had been performed. While the facility had planned to install alternative temporary and permanent fresh water
sources and these materials were in storage at the time of the inspection, that work had not been undertaken at the
time of inspection. Additionally, keeper notes for the carnivore area on 17 January 2015 stated: (cid:28)No water in the
main building. Called maintenance and they said it is because the tank is empty. The animal waters filled from the
lake so they should be fine.(cid:29) The Vice President informed inspectors that water is pumped out of the lakes, but that
it is typically treated before being given to other species. There is no indication that this water was treated on that
day before being given to the carnivore building as is required by facility protocol. Adequate access to potable water
is necessary for the health and well-being of animals. Correct by ensuring that if potable water is not accessible to
the animals at all times, it is provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals.

EMPLOYEES.
Based on the noncompliances identified in this inspection, this facility does not appear to currently have a sufficient
number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professional level of husbandry practices described in the
regulations and standards for the 460 USDA-regulated animals (30+ species) in their care. The majority of these
species are being managed in large multi-species exhibits with active breeding programs and therefore animals are
present in a variety of different life-stages. As a result, there are complex medical, behavioral, nutritional, and other
husbandry needs for these animals. Relevant areas of non-compliance identified on this report include: inadequate
daily observations of all animals, inadequate management of animals showing signs of incompatibly, failure to
properly complete veterinarian prescribed treatments and husbandry recommendations, and inadequate general
facility maintenance. With regard to record-keeping, there are numerous days that facility husbandry logs have not
been completed by staff members, suggesting either that there were an insufficient number of employees to be able
to have the time to complete the logs, or that the employees in those areas were insufficiently trained in facility
protocols. The Vice President and the Director of Animal Management stated that training of all new employees is
largely via on the job training with current employees. Inspectors were informed that all employees are expected to
work in all areas of the facility when the normally assigned keepers are absent; however, there are limited
guidelines, checklists or Standard Operating Procedures for employees to follow when working in areas they aren(cid:25)t
typically assigned to ensure tasks are completed per facility protocols.

All facilities are required to have a sufficient number of adequately trained employees to maintain the professional
husbandry standards described in the regulations and standards, and to ensure that animals are receiving
appropriate monitoring, veterinary care, feeding, watering, and other care. The licensee must evaluate the currentstaffing level and employee training procedures to ensure that a sufficient number of adequately trained employees
are utilized to compile and manage appropriate records and to maintain the professionally acceptable level of
husbandry practices described in the regulations and standards.

SEPARATION.
Records indicate that in the last 11 months some animals have needed treatment or died as a result of traumatic
injuries possibly inflicted by other animals within their enclosures.
Examples include:
1. On July 7, 2015, a note on the observation log indicates several male takin were (cid:28)challenging each other;(cid:29) then
on July 13, 2015, a male takin was euthanized due to a severe limb facture. On August 9, two male takin were
observed fighting, and on August 12 one was found dead. On August 10, one female takin had been found
separated from the herd with severe gore wounds and was brought to the med barn for treatment. After three days
of extensive and intensive treatment and monitoring, including showing some signs of progress, she was found
dead.
2.. Przewalski(cid:25)s horses: Valkyrie, found dead, gored by Pere David deer in same enclosure; Namshir, treated for
(cid:28)injuries from Male Pasture(cid:29); Kloppy, treated for gore wound.
3. On June 2, 2015 a 1.5 year old male giraffe, Little Dog, was found dead in the pasture with abdominal wounds.
Records indicated that the abdominal wounds were presumed to be caused by a rhino sharing the pasture. This
incident was preceded by behavioral observations of aggression of the rhino towards other giraffe in the same
pasture. After this incident, the facility permanently separated the rhino from the giraffes.
Animals co-housed in the same enclosure must be compatible to ensure they can appropriately access feed and
shelter and to prevent stress and potentially serious traumatic injuries or death. The facility must ensure that all
animals housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible and are not housed with or near animals that
interfere with their health or cause them discomfort.
