3.6(a)(2)(ii) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The bottom horizontal support tubing of gate panels in four occupied exterior runs located on the north side of the
kennel building were found to be heavily corroded with broken areas and exposed sharp edges. The bottom
horizontal tube of another run panel located in the occupied southeast run of the kennel building was also found to
be corroded and broken with sharp points. The broken and perforated tubing is an injury risk to dogs occupying
these kennels.
Three runs located on the south side of the kennel building were found to have areas of corroded and perforated tin
on their exterior wall surfaces below the dog egress/entry doors. These perforated areas of tin contain multiple
areas of sharp points and edges which pose a potential injury risk to dogs occupying the kennels.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points which could injure the
dogs.
Non-compliance under 3.6 (a)(2)(ii) was previously identified on the previous inspection and report dated
08MAY2018.
3.6(a)(2)(ix) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Three enclosures located on the north side of the kennel building were found to have worn or chewed areas on the
doorways leading to the exterior runs. There was exposure of underlying wood in these worn areas. A plastic panel
on the side wall adjoining the door way in one of the affected kennels was also found to be separating from the wall.
Exposed and unprotected wood surfaces absorb moisture and can make it more difficult to adequately sanitize
those surfaces. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained in a manner that enables all surfaces in
contact with the dogs to be readily sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b) or replaceable when worn or soiled.Non-compliance under 3.6 (a)(2)(ix) was previously identified on the previous inspection and report dated
08MAY2018.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Walls, enclosures and shelf surfaces in the whelping room of the house were found to have an accumulation of
debris, dirt and grime.There was also a strong odor of urine in the room.
Two baskets used for dog beds in the main house area were also found to have a heavy accumulation of grime and
debris.
A buildup of grime and debris on surfaces makes it more difficult to adequately clean and sanitize the affected
surfaces. Strong odors may also be an indication of inadequate cleaning and sanitation. Primary enclosures and
enclosure furnishings used for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods
prescribed in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt, debris,
food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
Non-compliance under 3.11 (b)(2) was previously identified on the previous inspection and report dated
08MAY2018..
