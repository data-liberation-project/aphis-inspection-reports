ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A pug #061 was observed to have its back legs seemingly to go out from underneath it several times as it was
walking around the enclosure.
The licensee was aware of the vet care item listed above, but since the vet was due to come out in a few days; she
was just waiting to tell the vet at the time of the visit. Daily observation may be done by the facility, but when vet
care items are observed they need to be communicated with the attending veterinarian in a timely and accurate
manner so that the vet may determine the urgency of which to see the animals or what correction the facility should
take in treatment of the animals. This needs to be addressed for the health of the animals.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
*** There are 12 dogs on the records of hand with no id numbers. All dogs need to be identified through an official
number that is unique to that animal. This needs to be addressed in a timely manner when new dogs are acquired.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** Several areas of the plastic siding on the back wall on the far side of the kennel were cracked and in disrepair.
These sections of plastic siding need to be replaced to keep the enclosure in good repair and for the safety of the
dogs.
*** One of the large breed whelping enclosures had a section of chain link broken at the bottom of the door and
protruding into the enclosure. This section of chain link needs to be repaired for the safety of the dog and herpuppies and to keep the enclosure in good repair.
*** There are white plastic dividers between several of the wire mesh enclosures. These dividers are secured at the
top of the mesh but not the bottom and are bowing out. The divider needs to be secured at the top and bottom
points to keep it secure and for the safety of the dogs.

3.6(a)(2)(10) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** An enclosure housing a pug #277 with the deformed foot has a 1.5 X 1.5 wire mesh floor. This mesh is too wide
for the dogs(cid:25) feet and is allowing her feet to pass through the openings in the floor. She needs to be moved to a 1X1
mesh enclosure so her feet do not fall through. (this was done at the time of the inspection)
*** Several of the puppies in the whelping room are on carpets that are on a 1x1 wire mesh floor. When the puppies
come off the carpet, their feet fall through the openings. The whelping room needs to be reassessed to determine
the best housing situation for the puppies to assure they are not on wire mesh to early that would allow their feet to
fall through.
3.8(a)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
*** A female dog that was 46 inches in length was housed in a 5x5ft enclosure. This gives the dog 25 square feet of
space which meets the primary enclosure amount, but does not meet the 2x space required to meet the exercise
requirement (40.5 sq feet). The current exercise plan lists the dogs as being housed in enclosures that meet this
requirement or get time in an outside run. The option of being outside is only occurring when the weather is nice.
This needs to be addressed and large breed dogs at the facility need to be housed in enclosures that meet this
requirement or have ample time in an exercise run to meet the conditions of the exercise plan.
