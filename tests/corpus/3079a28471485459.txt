had matted hair over most of its body. Matted hair on all four feet and the lower parts of the legs contained
brown-black debris and staining. Matted hair fell from the dog's forehead over its eyes such that the eyes were not
readily visible.
Mats can be painful, cause skin irritation and infection, and trap moisture. Mats may trap foreign material and may
mask underlying conditions in the adjacent skin. Mats under the tail may interfere with urination and defecation.
Mats over the eyes may interfere with vision.
