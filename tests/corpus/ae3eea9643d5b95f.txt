ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**Several wolves ("Sonora" and "Uriah") had severe fly bites causing bloody and raw tips on their ears. Section III,
Part B of the program of veterinary care indicated to "apply topical insectides when infestation occurs", however,
although the licensee had boxes of Advantix and bottles of Swat they had not been used on the affected animals.
Raw, exposed areas on the animal can be painful and become infected. The licensee must address the health
issues of these animals by using appropriate methods to prevent and treat diseases as recommended in the
approved program of veterinary care.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**Several enclosures housing wolves have areas under the shelter or resting platform where the animals have been
digging resulting in large holes. These areas are a potential physical hazard that could result in injury to the animals
and also an area for standing water that can harbor a breeding area for pests. The defects need to be repaired.
The facility housing the animals should be structurally sound and maintained in good repair in order to prevent injury
and to contain the animals.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
**A 9 month old tiger cub weighing approximately 130 lbs is being housed in a 5' x 5' enclosure inside of the garage.
The 5' x 5' enclosure does not allow the animal to make normal postural or social adjustments. Providing
inadequate space may lead to stress and/or abnormal behavioral patterns. Enclosures housing the animals should
be constructed and maintained in a manner that allows sufficient space to make normal postural and social
adjustments with sufficient freedom of movement.Correct by: July 7, 2014
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
**The licensee currently has a 9 month old tiger cub that weighs approximately 130 lbs. The cub is being fed
approximately 4 bottles per day (48 oz) of a mixture comprised of esbilac, vitamins and yogurt in addition to raw
meat. Although the feline veterinarian recommended the tiger cub should be fed 1/3 lb meat per 5 lb body weight
which would be 8.6 lbs of meat, according to the records, "Shere Khan" is only being fed 6 lbs of meat. A diet not
properly prepared with consideration for the age, species and type of animal could jeopardize the health of the
animal by not providing sufficient nutrients. The diet that has been approved and reviewed by the attending
veterinarian should be followed to ensure the animals are receiving food of sufficient quantity and nutritive value.
3.130 DIRECT
WATERING.
**Clean-drinkable water was not available to all animals. The enclosure housing two dark colored wolves contained
a waterer with slimy, green water. Non-drinkable water can pose a potential health hazard by not allowing the
animal to get proper hydration that is essential during hot, temperate weather. Water should be potable and
contained in receptacles that are clean and sanitary.
