2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of inspection, the licensee does not have a record of acquisition for one zebra hybrid and does not have
disposition records for one Mexican wolf and two capuchins. The licensee has incomplete disposition records for one
mountain lion, one ocelot, one patas monkey, two red kangaroos and one springbok. Records containing the required
information for animals disposed of or acquired for use in regulated activities, including those offspring born on premises,
are necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their humane care and use. The licensee shall make, keep and
maintain records of acquisition and disposition of all animals that fully and correctly disclose the required information.

3.80(a)(2)(ii)

Primary enclosures.
On the inside of the enclosure housing two common marmosets, there is an electrical outlet in the ceiling with a cord
plugged into it to power a light fixture with exposed glass bulbs. The outlet, the cord and the fixture with glass bulbs are
all accessible to the animals inside the enclosure. Animal access to these items poses a risk for injury or death due to
electric shock or other injury. Primary enclosures for nonhuman primates must be constructed and maintained so that


they protect the non-human primates from injury.

3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
There is no true perimeter fence for some areas of the zoo, as parts of the perimeter fence/wall also serve as the actual
sides of the primary enclosures that house two capybara, two Mexican wolves and three mule deer. Additionally, the
perimeter fence does not meet the minimum height requirement of eight feet for the wolves or the two North American
black bears along its entire length; some sections of the perimeter fence are only six feet tall. Accumulations of dirt, dead
plant material and other debris, as well as broken or missing top wires, contribute to the insufficient height in some places.
There are also areas of the perimeter fence that are breached by trees that have grown through the fence, resulting in
damage.
The fence is inadequate because it cannot serve as a secondary containment system for all of the animals housed at the
facility and may not be able to prevent other animals and unauthorized persons from entering where damaged. The
licensee must assess all perimeter fences at the facility for adequate height and structural integrity and modify the existing
fence(s) or install a different perimeter fence or fences of at least 8 feet in height. The perimeter fence(s) must be a
minimum of three feet from the primary enclosures and constructed so that the fence(s) protect(s) the animals by
restricting entry of outside animals and unauthorized persons from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the
animals in the facility.
