2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
Six separate incidents of animals being returned to incorrect enclosures were documented from January through August,
2022. One animal was found dead from trauma caused by the resident animals in the enclosure. Four animals required
subsequent veterinary care, and one animal was found before any trauma occurred. The surviving animals were returned
to their correct social groups.

Inadvertently placing animals into unfamiliar enclosures with unfamiliar inhabitants puts the newly introduced animal at
unnecessary risk of significant injury and death caused by the resident animals. Per the regulations, handling of all
animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating,
excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

The facility has revised the standard operating procedure for animal return to enclosure and has made significant changes
in how animal returns are conducted and monitored. Corrected prior to inspection.
2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).


In two unrelated incidents in July 2022, two animals had digits become entrapped in structures inside their enclosures.
Both animals were found dead in their enclosures with their fingers entrapped.

Insufficient daily observations can result in animals who become entrapped not being identified in a timely manner,
allowing them to succumb to exposure to excessive environmental conditions. Per the regulations, each research facility
shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily observation of all animals to assess
their health and well-being; Provided, however, that daily observation of animals may be accomplished by someone other
than the attending veterinarian; and Provided, further, that a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required
so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the
attending veterinarian.

The facility has implemented improvements of the facility's standard operating procedures used for daily observations and
reporting of animal counts and findings to the AV. Corrected prior to inspection.
3.75(a) Critical

Housing facilities, general.
Six separate incidents of animals opening or escaping from their primary enclosures were documented between January
and August of 2022. Two groups of animals (7 animals and 4 animals) escaped through weaknesses in the chain link
fences of their primary enclosure but remained contained within the perimeter fence. Three groups (2 animals each)
opened the panels between their cages and had direct, unplanned interaction, three of which required veterinary care.
One additional animal escaped its primary enclosure and subsequently required veterinary care. All animals were
recovered and returned to their correct enclosures.



An infant monkey became entangled in a stretch gauze material used in an enclosure to hold a water bottle in a clinic
cage. The infant did not survive.

Enclosures lacking appropriate structural strength and design can provide opportunities for escape, entrapment, or
unintended interactions with other animals, potentially resulting in injury or death to the animals. Per the regulations,
housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for the
species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from
injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.

The facility repaired the associated weakened chain link areas and eliminated the use of the cages that the animals were
able to open for inappropriate contact. The use of proper water bottle fasteners was implemented. Corrected prior to
inspection.

This inspection (20Sep2022) and exit interview (21Sep2022) were conducted with facility representatives.
