2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocol #0860 states that the Principle Investigator’s staff will conduct daily observations on the animals, and the
Assistant Director stated that this is not being done and has not been done in a long time. Significant changes- such as
the cessation of daily observations by the investigator’s staff- can result in failure to identify and address animal welfare
concerns in a timely manner. Correct by 10/1/22 by ensuring that significant changes to protocols are reviewed and
approved by the IACUC.
2.31(e)(1)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocol "CY22-008" does not include an approximate number of animals. Species of animals are listed, but there is no
corresponding number of animals. In order for the IACUC to accurately evaluate the species and number of animals to be
used in a protocol, animal numbers must be provided. Correct by 10/1/22 by ensuring that protocols contain the number
of animals to be used.
2.31(e)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocol “CY22-008“ does not include a complete description of the proposed use of animals. The protocol indicates that
no euthanasia will be performed, and then lists numerous methods of euthanasia along with individuals authorized to


perform euthanasia. The protocol states that animals will be “euthanized for veterinary care/animal welfare issued based
on the opinion of the AV.” Records review and discussion with an animal husbandry employee confirm that euthanasia is
performed on voles on the holding protocol on an ongoing basis by individuals listed on the approved protocol without first
consulting with the Attending Veterinarian (AV) as required by the protocol. Protocol #0873 does not include a complete
description of the proposed use of animals. The protocol states that euthanasia will be carried out by the PI and describes
the method of euthanasia, but does not state when, why, or how many animals will be euthanized. Protocol #0860 also
indicates euthanasia will be performed but does not state does not state when, why, or how many animals will be
euthanized.
Accurately describing animal usage including determining and describing humane ends points is important for animal
welfare. Correct by 10/1/22 by ensuring that protocols completely describe the proposed use of animals.
2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Medical records show that on 5/25/22, a vole was identified by an animal care technician as having a swollen, red,
hairless left front limb. The records show that the Attending Veterinarian (AV) recommended euthanasia and the animal
was euthanized on 6/23/22. The timing of the AV’s recommendation of euthanasia is unclear. The facility does not know
which protocol this animal was on. The facility could not locate any additional records concerning the care of this animal
between 5/25/22 and 6/23/22. The Attending Veterinarian and Associate Director could not recall this animal. The
Associate Director stated that the animal was not provided any medications during the monitoring period because no
medications are maintained on site. Animals who have red, swollen limbs may have an infection or injury, and may
experience stress, pain, or discomfort. Correct by 8/23/22 by ensuring issues regarding animal health are communicated
with the attending veterinarian promptly, and that the AV's instructions for animal care are followed.
2.36(b)(5)



Annual report.
The facility submitted an annual report for FY21 which listed 217 “common mole rats”. The associate director stated that
the facility did not have any common mole rats in FY21, instead they had approximately 270 “Damaraland mole rats”
which are a different species than common mole rats. Accurate reporting on the annual report is important for
transparency and public oversight of animal use in research. Correct by 9/7/22 by ensuring that accurate reporting of
animal name, number, and pain category on the annual report.
2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
Since July 19, 2022 there have been 15 deaths (including animals found dead and those who were euthanized for
medical reasons) in the main room housing approximately 250 Damaraland mole rats (DMRs). In contrast, during the
timeframe 10/9/21 to 7/18/22 there were only 4 deaths in DMRs in the same room. On 7/19/22 an employee identified a
Damaraland mole rat with a “missing rear leg from a fight with other mole rats.” The animal was euthanized in consultation
with the attending veterinarian. On 8/1/22 an employee identified two Damaraland mole rats with problems- the first had a
back rear leg that was broken, and the other had a rear leg that was swollen and red and the animal was unable to bear
weight or walk normally. The second animal also had an eye that was swollen shut. The animals were euthanized after
prompt consultation with the attending veterinarian. On 8/22/22, two additional DMRs were euthanized per the instruction
of the attending veterinarian due to fight wounds on the head and face.
An animal care technician stated that subjectively, the animals had recently appeared to be agitated, and there had been
increase bullying and fighting between the animals. The Associate Director stated that the recent deaths were most likely
attributable to fighting between animals due to some environmental source of stress, and that they had done an
investigation and found that the most likely cause of stress for the animals was the addition of a dehumidifier to the room
which was generating a soft noise that might be bothering the animals. The Associate Director also recently discovered


that the light cycle for the room had been malfunctioning, resulting in 24-hours of continuous light in the room. Both of
these issues have now been corrected. Continuous light without periods of dark can cause increased stress and disrupted
sleep for animals, which may result in abnormal behaviors such as increased aggression. Noises and blowing air/wind
can be disturbing or disruptive to animals. Animals housed socially are especially susceptible to the aggression or bullying
caused by other animals as a result of stress from environmental sources. Correct by 9/1/22 by handling animals as
expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
2.38(l)

Miscellaneous.
The facility does not have a contingency response plan that addresses the events, personnel, resources, or actions
needed in the event of emergencies. Planning for contingencies that can reasonably be expected to occur is important for
ensuring that animals do not suffer or die needlessly in the event of an emergency or natural disaster. Correct by 10/1/22
by documenting a contingency response plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and
care of animals in the event of an emergency or disaster that could reasonably be anticipated to have a negative impact
on the health and wellbeing of animals in the facility’s care.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
One plastic hard-sided enclosure containing Damaraland mole rats has an approximately 1.5 inch diameter hole in the
side, directly under an area where a hollow tube/pipe is connected to the container. A large amount of bedding has fallen
out through the hole. An animal care employee who routinely works in the area stated that these animals occasionally
escape from their enclosures due to poorly fitting tubes and excessively worn tubes and enclosures. Enclosures with
holes or poorly fitting components may cause animals to become trapped or escape, causing the animals stress, injury, or


death. Correct by 9/23/22 by ensuring that animal enclosures are structurally sound and in good repair, to protect the
animals from injury and contain the animals.
3.126(b) Critical

Facilities, indoor.
On April 1, 2022 in the life sciences building, the HVAC unit broke down overnight, resulting in decreased ventilation,
increased ambient temperatures, and the death of 12 voles. At the time of the incident, the facility did not have an alarm
or monitoring system in place to alert personnel about ventilation problems. Animals without adequate ventilation may
suffer from heat, stress, lack of oxygen, and death. Correct by 8/23/22 by ensuring that animals have adequate ventilation
for health and to prevent discomfort. Corrected prior to time of this inspection.

This inspection was conducted with the Associate Director of Animal Care Facilities, the IACUC Chair, and the Lead
Animal Care Technician. The exit interview was conducted with the Associate Director of Animal Care Facilities, the
IACUC Administrator, the Senior Associate Director for Research Compliance, and the Attending Veterinarian.
