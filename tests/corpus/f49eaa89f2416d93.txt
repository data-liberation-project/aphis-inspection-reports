2.31(d)(1)(ii)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Section 2.31(d)(1)(ii) IACUC: The facility animal activity proposals (protocols) include the use of Complete Freund’s
Adjuvant (CFA) in animals. The use of CFA in animals may cause undesirable sides effects so its use is considered
a potentially painful procedure and requires a search for alternatives. The written search for alternatives provided
during this inspection was for the route of injection and not for the use of CFA. The route of injection used is not
considered the painful procedure, but the injection of CFA is considered the painful procedure. A search for
alternatives to the use of CFA must be done and include a written narrative description of the methods and sources
used to determine that alternatives were not available. Correct by May 7, 2017.
This inspection was conducted with the facility supervisors and the exit interview was conducted with the facility
chief science officer.
