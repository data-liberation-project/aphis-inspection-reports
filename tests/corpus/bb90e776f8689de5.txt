The written program of veterinary care is incomplete. The guidance included in the written program of veterinary
care is insufficient regarding the use of diagnostic testing, dewormers, vaccinations, and other methods to prevent,
control, diagnose, and treat disease, including both internal and external parasites. Currently the written PVC
contains no information regarding vaccination for any species listed. Additionally, the recommended treatments
consist only of a drug name (usually ivermectin or cydectin) without any guidance for doses or routes of
administration, which are necessary when drugs are intended for use in species for which there are no
manufacturer label instructions, or which personnel have been trained in proper administration. Regarding
frequency of administration the written PVC says "as needed" for the majority of the species. There is no guidance
elsewhere clarifying what "as needed" means. A written program of veterinary care is required when attending
veterinarians are employed on a part time basis to ensure that the licensee and facility staff understand the direction
of the Attending Veterinarian and provide a mechanism by which APHIS Officials can determine their compliance
with those directions. Failure to include complete written guidance regarding these topics does not ensure good
welfare of the animals maintained by the facility as miscommunications may lead to failure to provide measures for
prevention, control, and treatment of disease. Correct by working with the attending veterinarian to ensure that
complete guidance regarding the dose, route, and frequency of administration for all drugs listed for each species
that are not specifically labelled by the manufacturer are incorporated into the written program of veterinary care. At
a minimum guidance must include species-specific directions for vaccination, euthanasia, capture and restraint, and
the prevention, control, and treatment of internal and external parasites.
The attending veterinarian has given his authority for "farm personnel" to perform tail docking and castrations for
sheep, goats, Tahr, and Aoudad. This note does not provide adequate guidance to carry out these procedures:
there are no detailed instructions indicating how these procedures are to be done, on what ages of animals, the
location where they are to be performed, if any drugs are to be used and what dose, route, and frequency to give
them for each species, and any post-procedural care or complications to watch for. The licensee stated that he is
the only person who is doing these procedures, and he is only doing them on sheep and domestic goats. Tail
docking and castration can cause significant complications if performed incorrectly, including severe bleeding,
infection, retained fertility (if castration is incomplete), and non-healing wounds. Failure to maintain a written
program of veterinary care, including guidance for procedures to be performed by the licensee or facility staff, doesnot ensure adequate care for the animals on hand. The licensee must obtain adequate guidance including detailed
instructions from the attending veterinarian in order to perform these procedures in accordance with accepted
standards of adequate veterinary care. Correct by maintaining a written program of veterinary care that includes
specific written guidance for procedures to be performed by the licensee or other facility personnel.

A male buffalo exhibiting bilateral corneal opacity is reportedly blind according to facility representatives and as a
result has been housed in confinement in the giraffe barn for observation and intermittent treatment since at least
March. On 23 May 2015, the attending veterinarian re-examined this animal and documented that acute and
convalescent titers were evaluated for BVD1, BVD2, and IBR (bovine viral diseases). Results showed no significant
changes and the record stated that as a result it was considered an inconclusive diagnosis. The same treatment
sheet indicated that the buffalo will be euthanized. As of the inspection on 25 August 2015, the buffalo was still
being kept in confinement for observation, and had not been euthanized thus far. This is not ensuring that the
attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to provide adequate veterinary care for this animal. The licensee
must follow the attending veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions and recommendations regarding all aspects of animal care and
use. Correct by ensuring the attending veterinarian has the authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary
care by following his recommendations for treatments of animals examined. If the attending veterinarian has
reconsidered the proposed euthanasia and is recommending an alternate treatment, these changes must be
documented and maintained for future inspection by APHIS officials.

The following animals were identified in need of veterinary care during the inspection:
***A male brown white and black Nubian-type goat without identification had an injured area on its scrotum. The
bottom half of the scrotal skin was severely scabbed with hardened debris. Most of this affected skin appeared
necrotic and contaminated with dirt and grass. When examining the area to ensure that this was not surface debris
the gentle wiping caused the area to bleed and there was yellow-white pus localized in pockets. The upper half of
the more normal-appearing scrotum (above this tissue) was swollen and firm. The goat appeared abnormal when
running (wide legged stance and occasionally shaking a rear leg), although no gait abnormalities were detected at
the walk or when standing. There was no documentation available to indicate that facility personnel had observed
this abnormality or were providing any form of treatment. When asked, the licensee stated that the animal was one
of several purchased on 15 August 2015 and that all of them were normal at that time. On 27 August 2015,
documentation was provided by the facility manager from the seller (also a veterinarian) stating that he had
castrated the goats prior to sale. This documentation stated that 3 goats were castrated 3-4 weeks prior to sale and
one 10 days prior to sale using an open castration technique. Swelling, pain, and infection are all possible
complications of castration and post procedural monitoring is necessary to ensure that animals which develop these
issues are treated appropriately. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated
according to the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions.
***A female light gray mini-zebu had an approximately 1-inch by 3-inch area of ocular drainage and darkly stained
fur under the right eye. The drainage extended from the middle of the lower lid to the corner of the eye on the nasal
side and two-thirds of the way down the face towards the mouth. The zebu was seen squinting her right eye during
the inspection. Eye injuries can be extremely painful, and if left untreated can lead to additional complications such
as scarring of the cornea, rupture, or blindness of the affected eye. Correct by having this animal examined by alicensed veterinarian and treated according to the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions.
***A spotted fallow deer in the drive-through area near the entrance gate was lethargic and dull in mentation. Her
eyes were closed and she was neither eating nor chewing her cud (as all the nearby animals were). Initially her
head was extended with her nose nearly touching the ground though she periodically picked it up holding it upright
with eyes still closed. When stimulated by making noises like revving the engine of the truck, clucking/whistling, and
slamming the truck door, the fallow deer barely raised her head and failed to startle or open her eyes. Only when
the truck door was within feet of her and opened and slammed shut did this animal open her eyes fully and turn her
ears and head towards the source of the noise. Other fallow deer that were significantly farther away (had moved
as the truck approached) startled, turned, and /or moved a short distance farther away from the noise. Inspectors
observed this animal for more than 10 minutes when first encountered in the drive-through area. On exit of the
drive-through park approximately an hour later, the fallow deer was located again in a nearby area and was
observed for a similar period of time. Her appearance and reactions to the same stimuli had not changed.
Lethargy, dull mentation, and lack of cud-chewing in ruminant species are signs of illness and inappetence. This
animal(cid:25)s overall behavior is not normal and indicates that veterinary examination is necessary to properly diagnose
and treat this animal. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated according to
the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions. NOTE: At the conclusion of the inspection the licensee asked the Farm Manager to
go into the drive through to look for fallow deer that wouldn(cid:25)t move when approached. On the day of the exit
interview the farm manager informed APHIS Officials that facility personnel had driven through the park several
times and were unable to locate any fallow deer that were acting abnormally.
***A brown and white female Boer-type goat, #7016, in the Daughty Barn had a significant amount dark brown
material caked on the tail, peritoneal area, and hind legs that appeared to be loose stool that had dried on the fur.
This goat was housed with 5 other goats in the same primary enclosure. The licensee stated that this animal had
had a fecal analysis performed and had been treated for coccidiosis; however, there was no record indicating this
individual had a fecal analysis or was examined by a veterinarian. Additionally, a note documented in the farm's
treatment logs indicated that this animal and another individual were treated with Di-Methox and ProBios, but there
is no written authorization in the program of veterinary care on the use of these drugs in goats without additional
guidance from a licensed veterinarian. Diarrhea can result from many causes including several infectious diseases
that are easily spread between animals in close contact. Additionally, untreated diarrhea can cause excessive
dehydration, abdominal pain, inappetence, and weight loss. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed
veterinarian and treated according to the veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions including specific information regarding the
proper dose, frequency, and route of administration for all drugs that are to be used in an off-label manner.
***A female elk, #0119, was seen in the drive-through area with a large mass on the right side of her jaw. The
licensee stated that this animal is an older animal and the mass has been there for years. He indicated that he
would attempt to contact the attending veterinarian for any record of the initial evaluation of the mass; however, no
documentation of any examination taking place prior to the inspection was sent to APHIS Officials. There was no
written record that there has been any prior examination or documentation of the nature of this chronic condition,treatments if required, or instructions for what to do if the condition changes. Large masses may result from either
chronic or acute conditions and depending on cause may worsen causing degradation of normal tissue, infection, or
physical impairment. The location of this mass in particular can potentially cause discomfort while the animal is
eating. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian. If no treatment is necessary
documentation including the diagnosis, nature of the condition, the expected prognosis, and any complications to
watch for that may indicate the need for additional treatments.
***The licensee stated that the attending veterinarian has made one minor change regarding the chemical restraint
methods being used that did not significantly alter how they conduct chemical restraint. The licensee was unable to
describe exactly what that change was when asked by inspectors. The current program of veterinary care still
authorizes the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for (cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29) (without any drugs for anesthesia or
analgesia or equipment for respiratory support) for the majority of species including: Water Buffalo, Tahr Goat,
Aoudad, Axis Deer, Sika Deer, Grevy and Grants Zebra, Nilgai, Fallow Deer, Eland, and Elk. The veterinarian has
added an assurance that (cid:28)no invasive or painful procedures will be performed on any animal without a veterinarian
present or notified before doing so(cid:29). The veterinarian had signed the log book which includes the times and use of
tranquilizing drugs had been documented for each individual animal; however, the licensee stated he wasn(cid:25)t exactly
sure what the attending veterinarian(cid:25)s signature on that page indicated. He further stated that the attending
veterinarian was not present for all of the animals restrained using chemical restraint. According to the log
presented a total of 10 animals have been restrained using only a paralytic agent since the last inspection.
Although this log contains information regarding species, animal size, dose, and the time (cid:28)down(cid:29) and (cid:28)up(cid:29), there is
no information regarding staff involved in the procedure, the reason the animal was being restrained and/or
procedures that were being done, any monitoring parameters, or notations about recovery.
Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this
drug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered
distressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug
can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated
they can die of suffocation while they remain conscious. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities,
or training to intubate or mechanically ventilate animals in this event. It is likely that an animal experiencing paralysis
of respiratory muscles would suffocate. There are numerous alternative drugs and drug combinations available
which are able to chemically restrain animals (without causing paralysis) while providing anesthesia and analgesia.
Because of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or
neuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary administration, oversight and care (including the use of
general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent with providing adequate veterinary care.
The licensee must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries to comply with the provisions of adequate veterinary care
as required by the Animal Welfare Act. This lack of adequate care can compromise the health of these animals and
is likely to result in unnecessary pain and distress to the animals and/or death. Correct by working with yourattending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical immobilization protocol that provides
adequate care for all species being handled; this written protocol must address dose, frequency, and route of
administration of each drug for each species if not specifically labelled by the manufacturer. Documentation of all
changes or modifications to the current program of veterinary care including the plan for chemical restraint must
maintained by the facility and provided to APHIS Officials upon request.
This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
Note: According to the licensee, the five animals identified on the previous inspection as needing veterinary care
were not being housed on the premises at the time of this inspection. There are disposition records for the same
species of animals, though individual animal identification numbers were not included on this documentation. The
movement of these particular individual animals cannot be farther verified at this time.

discharge, a fallow deer in the drive thru that was lethargic, a Nubian goat in the walkthrough area that has a
swollen scrotum, and a female elk in the drive thru with a jaw mass. Although the facility currently maintains logs of
daily observations, all of these veterinary problems were identified by USDA inspectors during this routine
inspection and were not observed by the facility. All licensees must establish and maintain an adequate program of
veterinary care which includes daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being. Additionally, a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian (AV) is required so that timely and

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The following non-compliant items were noted in the records during this inspection:
*** Disposition information was missing for the following species / animals:
Sheep: There were 75 sheep present on the last inspection. There are 17 acquisition records for a total of 248sheep and 20 disposition records for a total of 192 sheep (a total of 131 expected sheep, a difference of 56
additional sheep since the last inspection). There were 57 sheep present on today(cid:25)s inspection (18 less total sheep
than the previous inspection, and 74 less than expected according to the transfer records up through 24 August
2015). The facility is missing records of disposition for at least 74 sheep. Failure to provide accurate records
impedes the inspection process and also inhibits the ability to successfully track animal movements. This is
especially important in the event of a disease outbreak.
Additionally, there are entries in the facility records stating (cid:28)sheep to Indiana from Ohio(cid:29) and (cid:28)ewes to Ura(cid:25)s house.(cid:29)
These entries do not fully disclose required information for animals purchased, acquired, owned, held, leased, or
otherwise controlled by the facility.
Accurate animal records regarding births, deaths, acquisition and disposition are used to help evaluate the facility's
animal care program and for animal tracking for ownership and health care concerns. Every exhibitor must make,
keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning animals
purchased, acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his
or her control, or were transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of by that exhibitor, including any
offspring born of any animals while in his or her possession or under his control. Additionally this must include:

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public continues to be permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of
animals. This includes camels, cows, sheep, goats, African porcupines, kangaroos, muntjac deer, and mini-zebucattle. These animals are housed in multiple areas including the pastures near the parking lot, the walk through area
of the zoo, the production barn, the dairy barn, the Daughty barn, and the camel pasture, all of which are open to
the public. There are no barriers or signs present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to
feed food sold at the entry gate. There are no attendants present during public contact and guests may walk directly
up to enclosures and pet the animals. Primary enclosure fences are made of material with spaces large enough for
the guests to reach through and touch the animals. Several members of the public were observed putting hands
and even entire arms in the animal enclosures. Unattended public contact continues to be a problem at this facility
and has been documented on many previous inspections. Continued unattended public contact does not ensure
safe public interaction with these animals. During this inspection, the licensee stated that he believes there is no
need for a barrier and that the animals and the public need only to take one step back from each other to break any
potential contact. A lengthy conversation about this non-compliant item took place during this inspection with the
licensee disagreeing that there is a need for barriers or attendants. He stated that if there were a reason this that
made sense, he would consider making changes to his current operation. Licensees must ensure that during
periods of public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the
general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent

*** A metal gate panel for the entrance to the pasture housing five 4-horn sheep has a space between the bottom of
the gate and the ground that measures at least 8 inches. Additionally, the fencing from this gate and running to the
left approximately 20 feet to the corner of the pasture has areas where the space between the bottom of the fence
and the ground was at least 8-10 inches depending on the location. The space under this gate and area of fence is
large enough for the sheep in this enclosure to escape should they be motivated to do so, or be injured if caught
under the fencing. The facility must ensure that all enclosures are constructed to protect the animals from injury and
properly contain the animals. This space is a potential escape and injury hazard. Correct this by repairing or
replacing this gate and section of fencing.
*** The fence gate at the top of the mini-zebu pasture has loose wires, a section of loose chain link fencing used as
a patch, and a section of loose metal fencing near the ground. These loose wires and fencing pieces are a potential
injury hazard for the animals in this enclosure and must be repaired or replaced to reduce the potential for injury.

*** The large heap of animal waste and bedding remains in the drive through area of the facility. Animals continue to
have access to this large pile and have been observed on previous inspections browsing and lying in the pile.
During today(cid:25)s inspection, no animals were observed in or on the pile, but additional spent bedding continues to be
added to the existing pile. When discussing this concern with the licensee, he stated that he will continue his current
practices until he is told that there is another process that makes sense. He maintains that the previous review of
his operation by a professor of poultry science who visited the facility to give recommendations and "strengthen the
composting plan" ensures that his current practices are safe for the animals. This previous review did not address
animal disease concerns or potential for disease transmission via movement of fecal material and/or potentially
contaminated spent bedding from animals in other areas of the zoo into the drive through area. The licensee stated
that depending on when the spent bedding is added, it could remain on the surface of the pile for up to a week
before being turned in. Continued animal contact with this waste pile has been a concern on many previousinspections (including 4/20/15, 3/2/15, 11/12/14, 6/4/14, 2/19/14, 10/22/13, 6/12/13, and 12/4/12) as this

*** Along the entire fence line enclosing the 14 goats in the pasture near the house / parking area there is an
accumulation of spilled feed on the ground. There is also abundant similar spilled feed along the fence lines for
pastures housing the camel, miniature zebu, kangaroo, and African crested porcupine. The feed appeared as
though it had become wet, expanded, and crumbled. In many places the deteriorated feed was also mixed with
feces. The animals in these enclosures have access to the feed both on the inside of the enclosure and by
reaching through the fenceline. Several goats were observed eating this spilled feed on both sides of the fence. It is
unclear how long this accumulation has been on the ground. Although public feeding is encouraged at this facility, it
is still important to implement a mechanism to prevent excess spilled feed from accumulating and deteriorating.
Accumulated food left on the ground and that mixed with fecal contamination poses a disease risk to the animals if
ingested. Food shall be placed so as to minimize contamination, and measures shall be taken to prevent molding,
