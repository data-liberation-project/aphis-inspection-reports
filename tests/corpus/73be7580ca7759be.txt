ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility lacks specific guidance for the care of animals. Several
species of animals are maintained by the facility but not listed on the PVC, including: the giraffe, bears, wallaby,
prevost squirrel, red squirrel, domestic pigs, and guinea pigs. It is difficult to determine which species are included
in guidance with broad terms of "equine" and "ruminants" listed on the PVC. There is also no specific guidance for
deworming of various species, only a list of dewormers to be used with guidance to rotate these wormers. Species
specific dosing and route is not included for any species or drug in the PVC. The guidance for euthanasia of
carnivores, hoofed stock, primates and elephants is "IV Pentobarbital or Gunshot". Although gunshot is acceptable
as an emergency means of euthanasia, it should not be listed on the PVC as a routine method and additional
direction regarding the species or circumstances under which it is approved must be included. Likewise, the PVC
states "xylazine sedation..IV Pentobarbital..Gunshot" as a method for euthanasia for camelids and equine.
Additionally, the PVC states that ketamine and xylazine or domosedan for equine will be used for capture and
restraint methods. There is no guidance for dosing various species with these drugs and no guidance for
anesthesia monitoring, recovery, or other pre or post procedural care. Specific guidance is required. Treatment
records provided by the facility state animals have been treated without written attending veterinarian guidance.
This includes a camel having an abscess flushed and cleaned, a newborn Sitatunga treated with "BOSE", a
newborn Kudu treated with (cid:28)"BOSE"(cid:29), and numerous dewormers given. Additional specific guidance is required for
the Program of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure the attending
veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does not ensure the facility has accurate
guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by developing and implementing a
complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care.

3 January 2015 to a Kudu) and Oxytocin (administered on 23 November 2014 to a Camel). The licensee stated that
drugs are purchased from the attending veterinarian but no other drugs were found on the premises. The use of
expired drugs can be dangerous or ineffective. Expired medications may not be used on regulated animals in the
facility. Correct this by disposing of these expired medications and only using medications in date.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Thirty five individual animals were identified by APHIS Officials in need of veterinary care at the time of inspection.
The licensee stated that he has been raising these animals for so long that many injuries and illnesses are treated
by the facility without calling a veterinarian. He further stated that they are in frequent contact with their Attending
Veterinarian and his partner (also another licensed veterinarian), however, they do not currently maintain written
records of treatments. At the start of the inspection the wife of the licensee (responsible for much of the daily care
for animals) stated that there were no animals currently receiving veterinary treatment. When asked about animals
that recently received treatment, she stated only a serval had been recently treated. The wife of the licensee stated
that she does keep some short notes in a personal journal, but that this was not available for inspection as it was
mixed with other personal information. When asked, the wife of the licensee did re-copy a list of animals reportedly
treated by the facility during the period of 20 October 2014 through 6 January 2015. These notes were reviewed in
determining compliance with this section.
*** Direct: Two Oryx had significant lameness at the time of inspection. This included:
- Oryx #1: A juvenile (still nursing) oryx was significantly lame on the right front leg at the time of inspection.
This animal was observed alternately toe-touching lame and non-weight bearing lame when moving at a walk on 6
January 2015. On 8 January 2015 this animal was observed consistently non-weight bearing even when runningand did not bear any weight on the limb at any point during observations that day. On 6 January, the licensee
stated that the facility first observed this lameness approximately 3-4 days prior to the start of the inspection.
- Oryx #2: A young adult oryx was significantly lame on the left front leg at the time of inspection. This animal
was observed consistently toe-touching lame when moving at a walk (both on 6 & 8 January 2015). The licensee
stated that the facility first observed this lameness approximately 6-7 days prior to the start of the inspection.
Following identification of these animals to the licensee (on 6 January), the licensee stated that oryx will
occasionally be lame as a result of sparring and also frequently become lame during the winter when the ground is
frozen. He stated that this typically resolves with time and that it is too stressful to the animal to remove it from the
herd for examination since it may not be accepted back into the herd. Although the licensee stated that he had not
contacted the Attending Veterinarian (AV) for advice regarding veterinary treatment for either of these oryx, he also
stated that he had previously discussed the issue of lameness in oryx generally with the partner of the AV (also
another licensed veterinarian). The licensee stated as long as there is not a compound fracture, the animal should
not be removed from the herd for further evaluation and treatment regarding lameness since it may just be a sprain
or similar minor injury. There was no record of any previous advice from any veterinarian and no written guidance
present in the program of veterinary care for lameness in oryx or any other species. No veterinary care was
provided to either oryx listed above. Lameness is a significant indicator of pain and failure to provide appropriate
methods to properly diagnose and treat the underlying cause in a timely manner may result in unnecessary pain
and suffering. Correct by having these animals evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and following all
recommendations including those regarding examination, diagnosis, treatment, and future recheck examinations as
needed. Additionally, the licensee must maintain record of these recommendations for evaluation by APHIS
Officials. If this is a recurrent problem the licensee may seek additional guidance from the Attending Veterinarian
for incorporation into the written program of veterinary care regarding recommendations for any future animals that
may develop lameness. This was first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2015.
*** DIRECT: Several guinea pigs (GP) were exhibiting varying amounts of hair loss at the time of inspection. Tubs
1& 2 were located on the patio outside the keeper area. Tub 3 was located in the storage trailer near the mouse
house.
- GP#1: A black and white juvenile guinea pig located in tub 1 had an area of hair loss on the right side of its
nose stretching 2/3 of the way to its eye. The underlying skin in this area was dry, crusty, and had several dark
spots that appeared to be scabs. Additionally, there was a small amount of crusted skin under the right eye. This
was first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2014.
- GP#2: A black and white adult guinea pig located in tub 1 had several small areas of hair loss on the left side
of its nose. The underlying skin was dry, flaky, and had several dark spots that appeared to be scabs. This was
first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2014.
- GP#3: A tan and white juvenile guinea pig located in tub 2 had several small areas of hair loss on the right side
of its face near its eye, on the top of its head, and at the base of the right ear. The underlying skin was dry and in
the area on top of the head it was flaky and had dark spots that appeared to be scabs. This was first identified to
the licensee on 6 January 2014. - GP#4: A brown juvenile guinea pig located in tub 2 had an area of hair loss on the right side of its nose
extending from the nose to the right eye and over the bridge of the nose. The underlying skin in this area was dry,
crusty, and had numerous spots of medium and dark red areas that appeared to be scabs. This was first identified
to the licensee on 6 January 2014.
- GP#5: A brown and white guinea pig located in tub 2 had a small area of hair loss on the bridge of the nose.
The underlying skin was dry and without significant crusts or flakes. This was first identified to the licensee on 6
January 2014.
- GP#6: A tan guinea pig with a white stripe between its eyes located in tub 1 has an area of hair loss on the
bridge of the nose. The underlying skin is dry, flaky, and has one dark spot that appeared to be a scab. This was
first identified to the licensee on 7 January 2014.
- GP#7: A brown and white guinea pig located in tub 1 has an area of hair loss extending between the left eye
and ear. The underlying skin is dry and flaky. This was first identified to the licensee on 7 January 2014.
- GP#8: A black and white guinea pig located in tub 3 has an area of hair loss and irregular skin just above its
right eye and a second spot just behind the nose on the right side. The skin surrounding the eye appears dry,
thickened, and leathery while the area near the nose is dry and flaky. This was first identified to the licensee on 7
January 2014.
- GP#9: A brown and white curly coated guinea pig located in tub 3 has a focal area of incomplete hair loss on
the bridge of its nose. The underlying skin is dry and flaky. This was first identified to the licensee on 7 January
2014.
- GP#10: A brown and white curly coated guinea pig located in tub 3 has areas of hair loss on the top of the
head and under the left ear. The underlying skin in both areas is dry and crusty. This was first identified to the
licensee on 7 January 2014.
All of the guinea pigs listed above appeared bright, alert, and reactive. None were observed actively scratching at
the affected areas, however, the dark spots present on several animals appear to be scabs and dried blood and are
consistent with scratching as a result of itchiness. These conditions were not reported to the attending veterinarian
prior to inspection and none of these animals were receiving any treatment for these conditions. Hair loss can result
from numerous causes including several infectious causes such as fungal and bacterial diseases. Given the
number of animals with similar lesions, the cause is likely to be infectious. When the attending veterinarian
observed these animals, on 8 January 2015, he stated that the lesions were suspicious for ringworm and would
make a diagnostic / treatment plan accordingly. Infectious skin disorders may be transmitted to other uninfected
animals in the same enclosure or enclosures nearby. Numerous animals which appeared normal were housed with
affected animals in each tub listed above. The licensee stated that he had not contacted the attending veterinarian
regarding these issues prior to the start of the inspection and there were no methods in place to prevent spread of
this condition. There was no previous guidance from the attending veterinarian for skin disorders in guinea pigs and
no written guidance in the program of veterinary care. Correct by ensuring that all animals exhibiting these skin
abnormalities are examined by a licensed veterinarian so that appropriate diagnostic testing can be completed and
a proper diagnosis can be made. Additionally, the licensee must seek guidance from the attending veterinarian
regarding appropriate treatment for the affected animals as well as prevention and control of this condition in theguinea pig colony. Records of these recommendations must be maintained for evaluation by APHIS Officials.
*** Three camels located in the camel exhibit area in the main zoo location showed signs of abnormal skin
conditions. These were identified to the licensee on 6 January 2015.
- Camel #1: A female camel had a significant swelling (at least 7 inches by 3 inches) located on the right side at
the base of the hump. Additionally, there is a large area of dark discharge (brown, red, and black) extending from
the swelling down the right side to the abdomen. This discharge appears dried and caked in the fur.
- Camel #2: A female camel had a significant swelling on the left shoulder area (approximately 3 inches and
roughly circular). The skin overlying this area is hairless and there is dried red-brown material caked in the fur
surrounding the lesion. This camel was later identified by the facility as "(cid:28)Lauren"(cid:29).
- Camel #3: A female camel (with an ear tag #5) had a swelling on the right mid-neck. There was a brown-red
discharge caked in the surrounding fur.
When asked about these lesions, the licensee stated that they are abscesses and that they occur regularly in the
camels. He stated that they are treated by the facility staff (typically his wife) whenever they are observed. He
further stated that typically they would not call the attending veterinarian for these issues since they are a common
occurrence and they have been treating them for years. When asked, the wife of the licensee stated that she had
cleaned the abscess on (cid:28)"Lauren"(cid:29) prior to the inspection (on 3 January 2015) by flushing it with diluted iodine and
spraying it with wound spray. There is currently no written guidance in the program of veterinary care which would
allow treatment by the facility without consultation from the attending veterinarian. Abscesses are often caused by
infectious agents and there are 5 additional camels located in this pasture and 1 housed so that it is sharing the
same barn (with direct contact). There were no methods currently in use to stop the spread of disease if it is
transmissible between animals. Correct by ensuring that all animals exhibiting these skin abnormalities are
examined by a licensed veterinarian so that appropriate diagnostic testing can be completed and a proper diagnosis
can be made. Additionally, the licensee must seek guidance from the attending veterinarian regarding appropriate
treatment for the affected animals as well as prevention and control of this condition in the camels. The licensee
must maintain records of the diagnosis and recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials.
*** The male cougar has an area on the right hind leg where the skin appears reddened and moist. The area is
approximately 2 inches wide by 4 inches long and is located on the back of the leg behind the right knee. This was
identified to the licensee on 6 January 2015 and at that time the licensee stated that he was unaware of this
condition. It was identified to the wife of the licensee on 7 January 2015 and she also stated she was unaware of
the condition but would make sure the attending veterinarian was called to examine it. Skin disease can result from
numerous infectious and non-infectious causes. Left untreated, it may progress resulting in unnecessary discomfort
or suffering. Correct by ensuring that this animal is examined by a licensed veterinarian for recommendations
regarding appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis and
recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials.
*** One female giraffe had hooves which were overgrown and a slightly abnormal gait when compared to the othergiraffes at the facility. When asked about routine giraffe hoof care the licensee stated that the giraffe will naturally
wear their hooves down in the yard since there is gravel present in the giraffe enclosure. This individual giraffe was
identified to the licensee on 6 January 2015 at which time the licensee stated that he was not sure of the individual
animal(cid:25)'s name although he thought it may be Vivian. When the animal with long hooves was pointed out, the
licensee assured inspectors that the hooves would wear to a normal length over time if left on the gravel. The
licensee further assured the inspectors that if that did not happen he would be able to transport the giraffe to North
Carolina when the weather warms to trim her hooves using a chute at another USDA licensee(cid:25)'s facility.
Additionally, he stated that they were in the process of constructing a giraffe chute to facilitate easier handling of the
giraffe and make hoof trimming easier in the future. There was no documentation at the facility that the licensee
has guidance from the Attending Veterinarian regarding the treatment of overgrown hooves in giraffe. Inspectors
did observe a partially constructed chute. Excessively long hooves can progress causing abnormal gaits,
lameness, unnecessary stress and discomfort to the animal. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed
veterinarian and following all recommendations regarding appropriate treatment for this condition. If transportation
of this animal is necessary for treatment, this guidance should include an appropriate timeline for providing this
care. Additionally, the licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis and recommendations for evaluation by
APHIS Officials. This was first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2014.
*** Numerous Capuchin Monkeys had hair loss to varying degrees and were observed scratching during the
inspection. This included:
- Capuchin #1: A Brown (Tufted) Capuchin monkey located in the keeper barn had significant hair loss over its
entire back extending over its sides and shoulders. Additionally there was a smaller area of hair loss on its tail. The
underlying skin appeared dry. This capuchin was housed with two other monkeys (one of which is capuchin #2
listed below). This animal was observed scratching during the inspection.
- Capuchin #2: A Brown (Tufted) Capuchin monkey located in the keeper barn had significant hair loss along the
length of its tail (worst at the tip) as well as hair thinning over the rump area and back. This animal was periodically
observed scratching during the course of the inspection. This capuchin was housed with two other monkeys
including capuchin #1 listed above).
- Capuchin #3: A White-faced Capuchin monkey located in the indoor/outdoor area near the mouse house
building (co-housed with 5 other Capuchin monkeys including Capuchin #4 below) had generalized patchy hair loss
(over the back, hind legs, tail, etc.). This animal was observed scratching.
- Capuchin #4: A White-faced Capuchin monkey located in the indoor/outdoor area near the mouse house
building (co-housed with 5 other Capuchin monkeys including Capuchin #3 above) had incomplete hair loss located
along the length of the tail and its left knee.
- Capuchin #5: A White-faced Capuchin monkey missing part of the left index finger located in the back room of
the mouse-house building had hair loss on both forearms and on the tail. The capuchin was observed vigorously
scratching at times during the inspection. This capuchin was co-housed with 2 others (#6 and 7 below) and in a
room with two other groups of capuchins (including capuchin #8) and a group of DeBrazza'(cid:25)s Monkeys.
- Capuchin #6: A White-faced Capuchin monkey located in the back room of the mouse-house building had
patchy hair loss on the tail. This capuchin was co-housed with 2 others (#5 and 7) and in a room with two othergroups of capuchins (including capuchin #8) and a group of DeBrazza(cid:25)'s Monkeys.
- Capuchin #7: A White-faced Capuchin monkey located in the back room of the mouse-house building had
patchy hair loss on the tail. This capuchin was co-housed with 2 others (#5 and 6 above) and in a room with two
other groups of capuchins (including capuchin #8) and a group of DeBrazza(cid:25)'s Monkeys.
- Capuchin #8: A Brown (Tufted) Capuchin monkey located in the back room of the mouse-house building had
extensive hair loss on its tail and several small patches on its back. This animal was observed vigorously
scratching at times during the inspection. This capuchin was co-housed with 2 other non-affected animals and in a
room with two other groups of capuchins and a group of DeBrazza(cid:25)'s Monkeys.
The hair loss in Capuchins #1 & 2 were first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2014. Capuchins #3 - 8 were
first identified to the licensee on 7 January 2014. There was no written documentation regarding the treatment of
these animals for hair loss and the attending veterinarian stated to APHIS Officials that he would generally refer
primates to another local veterinarian for treatment. Hair loss associated with apparent discomfort (evidenced by
scratching) can result from a number of causes including several infectious causes. Left untreated these conditions
may result in worsening of the condition, development of secondary infections, and unnecessary suffering. When
skin disorders are resulting from an infectious cause, they may be transmitted to other uninfected animals in the
same enclosure or enclosures nearby. Numerous animals which appeared normal were housed with affected
animals in nearby enclosures. Correct by ensuring that all animals exhibiting these skin abnormalities are examined
by a licensed veterinarian so that appropriate diagnostic testing can be completed and a proper diagnosis can be
made. The licensee must follow all recommendations by the veterinarian including those regarding diagnosis,
treatment, prevention, control of this condition, and recheck examinations. Records of these findings, treatment,
and future recommendations must be kept for evaluation by APHIS Officials.
*** A small Mandrill housed with the adult male Mandrill had hair loss over top aspect of both forearms. On the right
arm the hair loss extends from the elbow to hand and on the left arm it extends over a smaller portion of the arm.
The underlying skin appears dry. This was first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2015 at which time he stated
that this is probably due to stress because the female Mandrill in the adjacent enclosure (with limited tactile contact)
picks on and intimidates this animal. He stated that the female is a full-sister to this affected animal and that
negative interaction is the reason they are separated. He stated that this issue has not been evaluated by a
veterinarian and there was no record that the facility had contacted the attending veterinarian for any evaluation.
There was no direction in the written program of veterinary care or the Non-human Primate Enrichment plan to
address hair loss or hair plucking in primates. While hair loss in this area of primates often has an underlying
behavioral cause, guidance from the attending veterinarian must be sought to ensure appropriate diagnosis and
treatment and to prevent worsening of the condition. Correct by contacting the attending veterinarian and following
all recommendations including his direction regarding the diagnosis, care, and treatment. Additionally, the
enrichment plan should be amended to address non-medical causes of hair plucking in primates if the veterinarian
believes this to be an issue at the facility.
***A black and white pygmy goat located in the main zoo area has a creamy white vulvar discharge, crusteddischarge dried on the vulva, hair loss on flanks, and significant crusts around its nose. The end of the tail also has
a moderate amount of dried dark debris caked in the hair which appears to be contamination from the discharge
mixed with dirt. The goat was bright, alert, and active and ate a small amount of grain during the inspection. The
abnormalities were initially observed by APHIS Officials on 6 January 2015 and continued to be present on multiple
days during the inspection process. When asked about this goat, the wife of the licensee stated that this was an
older goat and that she looks ok. There was no record to indicate that the facility had contacted the attending
veterinarian about this animal and she was not on any treatment at the start of the inspection. This was first
identified to the wife of the licensee on 6 January 2015. Correct by having this animal examined by a licensed
veterinarian and following all recommendations regarding appropriate diagnosis and treatment for this condition.
Additionally, the licensee must maintain records of the diagnosis and recommendations for evaluation by APHIS
Officials.
*** All of the muntjac in the enclosure between the macaques and African crested porcupine (total of 6) had fur over
their rump area that was ruffled and standing on end. Two of these animals (one male and one female) had a large
amount of dark brown material under their tails consistent with caked on diarrhea. Diarrhea can be an indicator of
ill-health and can have many causes both infectious (parasites, bacterial disease, etc.) or non-infectious (problems
with diet, individual metabolic disease, etc). Ruffled hair in the area of the rump can be an indicator of several
problems such as skin disease or more generalized systemic problems. Failure to properly diagnose and treat this
condition may result in the worsening of the condition and possibly spread of disease between animals (if the
underlying cause is infectious). There was no documentation that the facility has contacted the Attending
veterinarian regarding these animals. Correct by having these animals examined by the Attending Veterinarian and
following all recommendations regarding diagnosis, treatment, control, and prevention of this condition. Additionally
the licensee must maintain record of these recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials. This was first
identified to the licensee on 6 January 2015.
*** A tan and white llama located in the llama paddock in the main zoo has a mass under the jaw on the left side
that has crusty debris overlying this mass. This animal appeared bright and alert. There was no documentation
that the facility contacted a veterinarian regarding this animal. Masses in this area can result from numerous
conditions both infectious and non-infectious (such as tooth root abscess, neoplasia, etc). Failure to properly
diagnose and treat this condition can result in disease progression and lead to unnecessary suffering. Correct by
having this animal examined by the Attending Veterinarian and following all recommendations. Additionally the
licensee must maintain record of these findings and recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials. This was
first identified to the licensee on 6 January 2015.
*** A miniature Zebu steer located in the petting area of the main zoo had long misshapen claws on both hind legs
with the right more affected than the left. The outer claw of the right rear foot appears to be partially twisted under
the foot so that the steer is partially weight bearing on the outer wall. The Zebu did not appear to be lame at a walk.
The wife of the licensee stated that this was an older steer and that he has always had bad feet as did his father. She also stated that the facility uses a good farrier to trim hooves, that he had trimmed the feet for this Zebu in
December, and that these are about as good as they normally look. There was no written documentation of any
prior hoof trims. Left untreated, long or misshapen hooves can progress and cause lameness, abnormal stress on
the joints, and discomfort to the animal. While there was no record of recent farrier care, if this animal(cid:25)'s feet were
trimmed in December, there is an increased reason to contact the Attending Veterinarian (AV) for recommendations
about whether additional treatment is necessary. Correct by contacting the AV and following all recommendations
regarding treatment and future monitoring of this animal. Additionally the licensee must maintain records of these
recommendations for evaluation by APHIS Officials. This was first identified to the wife of the licensee on 6 January
2015.
Each dealer and exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care to include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Adequate records of veterinary
care (including all treatments provided by the facility and communication of issues of health to the attending
veterinarian) are an integral part of an adequate program of veterinary care since they are necessary to ensure
communication between facility staff as well as between the facility and the attending veterinarian when animals are
exhibiting signs of medical problems or have a history of previous problems. Failure of the facility to establish and
maintain an adequate program of veterinary care (including record keeping) can result in delayed veterinary
treatment and prevent the attending veterinarian from making accurate diagnoses. Correct by ensuring that all
animals showing signs of injury, disease, or illness are promptly examined by a licensed veterinarian and
maintaining adequate records from this point forward.
All animals requiring veterinary treatment identified by APHIS Officials were communicated to the licensee as they
were identified. Additionally, APHIS Officials discussed a comprehensive list of animals requiring care at the
conclusion of 7 January 2015 with both the licensee and his wife. This discussion included both the necessary
corrective action and a timeline for correction (given to the licensee as noon on Friday 10 January 2015).

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** DIRECT: Thirty five individual animals were identified by APHIS Officials in need of veterinary care at the time of
inspection. Based on statements by the licensee, the majority of these animals had not been identified by the
facility prior to inspection. The animals that had been identified by the facility had not been reported to the attending
veterinarian. When the attending veterinarian visited the property at the request of the licensee on 8 January 2014,
he stated that he was not aware of the number of animals requiring veterinary care prior to the licensee calling that
week. *** In addition to the lack of observations above, the licensee stated that during the winter bears go into the den
area and are only able to be observed when they leave the den (which he indicated is very rarely). The den area is
constructed of concrete block and although there is an off exhibit access point to view the inside of the den, this is
boarded up for the winter for warmth. As a result, the bears are not able to be observed when they are in their den
area for the winter. When inspectors commented that they were unable to observe the animals the licensee stated
that he would need to make them leave the den, disrupting their hibernation, to be able to see them.
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care which includes daily
observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being. Additionally, a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian (AV) is required so that timely and accurate information on problems
of animal health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed to the AV. Correct by ensuring that adequate daily
observations are conducted and that information is conveyed to the attending veterinarian as required. Additionally,
correct by making necessary modifications to the bear enclosure or husbandry practices to facilitate daily
observations during the winter months.
Regarding the bear enclosure, correct by: 17 January 2014.
Regarding adequate daily observations of all other animals, correct from this point forward.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following non-compliances with euthanasia were identified during this inspection.
*** DIRECT: The refrigerator in the keeper building contained 10 dead guinea pigs that the licensee stated were old
breeders that had been culled from the colony to be fed to the big cats. While examining them for hair loss several
of the guinea pigs felt to have broken ribs and/or pelvic bones. When the owner was questioned he told the APHIS
officials that he killed the guinea pigs by hitting them against a hard surface. When the licensee was asked by
APHIS Officals to demonstrate using a dead guinea pig, he raised the dead guinea pig above his head and threw it
forcefully onto the concrete floor. The written facility Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not include guinea
pigs or their euthanasia method. APHIS officials informed the owner that is not an appropriate method to kill guinea
pigs. When the attending veterinarian came to the facility on 8 January 2015 to examine animals, APHIS officials
discussed the method used by the facility to kill guinea pigs. The attending veterinarian stated that he was unaware
that was the method the facility was using and agreed that it was not an acceptable method. The facility must seek
the guidance of the attending veterinarian for an appropriate method to euthanize the guinea pigs that is in
compliance with the current AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals. Also, facility personnel performing the
euthanasia must receive any needed training by the attending veterinarian regarding the use of the new method of
euthanasia. The facility PVC must be updated to include the guinea pigs and their method of euthanasia. Correct before any more guinea pigs are euthanized by facility personnel.
*** The facility PVC lists gunshot as a method of euthanasia with no further explanation of the acceptable
circumstances for its use. Gunshot is not an acceptable routine method of euthanasia. It puts both people and
other animals at risk. Depending on the proficiency of the user, animals may only be wounded by the bullet and
suffer pain and distress until a fatal shot can be executed. The use of gunshot is not an acceptable method of
euthanasia for small animals. The facility PVC must include the animals and conditions when gunshot may be
used. Additionally, if gunshot is to be used as a method of euthanasia, the licensee must seek additional written
guidance from the attending veterinarian regarding specifics for the method (such as circumstances for use, location
of bullet placement, and location for this procedure). Furthermore, the facility must maintain a list of the personnel
authorized to perform this technique and their training regarding this method to demonstrate proficiency. These
recommendations and records must be maintained by the licensee and available to APHIS Officials upon request.
Correct by 10 February 2015.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The following recordkeeping non-compliances were identified during this inspection.
1) The facility had no records of any kind, including number of animals on hand, births, deaths, acquisition or
disposition, for the following animals: 97 guinea pigs, 12 rabbits, 1 hedgehog, 1 zebu, 8 sheep, 4 flying squirrels and
1 Eastern grey squirrel.
2) The facility did not have the correct number of animals on hand in their records and there were no records for
births, deaths, acquisition or disposition for the following animals: 19 pigs observed and 20 were in the records and
11 Nyala observed and 10 were in the records.
3) The number of animals observed at the facility did not match the number of animals in the records for the
following animals: 20 muntjac observed and 17 were in the records, 17 oryx were observed and 18 were in the
records, and 24 zebra were observed and 5 were in the records.
4) The facility had no acquisition information for the brown Bennet wallaby acquired on 10/20/14.
Accurate animal records regarding births, deaths, acquisition and disposition are used to help evaluate the facility'(cid:25)s
animal care program and for animal tracking for ownership and health care concerns. Every exhibitor must make,
keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning animals
purchased, acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her control, or were transported, sold, euthanized
or otherwise disposed of by that exhibitor, including any offspring born of any animals while in his or her possessionor under his control.
(i) The name and address of the person form whom the animals were purchased or otherwise
acquired;
(ii) The USDA license or registration number of the person if he or she is licensed or registered under the Act;
(iii) The vehicle license number and State, and the driver(cid:25)'s license number (or photographic identification card
for nondrivers issued by a State) and State of the person, if he or she is not licensed or registered under the Act;
(iv) The name and address of the person to whom the animal was sold or given;
(v) The date of purchase, acquisition, sale or disposal of the animal(s);
(vi) The species of the animal(s).
(vii) The number of animals in the shipment.
From this day forward correct by maintaining accurate records regarding the correct number of animals on hand at
the facility, and all new births, acquisitions, deaths and sales. Additionally correct by reconstructing, as much as
possible, the missing information for the animals on hand that are now at the facility by 10 February 2015.
2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The following non-compliances with animal handling were identified during this inspection:

*** This facility used tiger cubs for photo shoots during the summer of 2014. During this inspection, the licensee
was asked about the facility(cid:25)'s handling of cubs from birth. He stated that the cubs are pulled from the female tiger
at birth and are cared for in a caretaker's home near the facility. These cubs are then brought to the facility at 2-3
weeks of age during the day and put on display to the public in the gift shop when the zoo is open. The licensee
stated that the cubs are never touched by the public during this time and they are on display behind glass in the gift
shop. The public is able to walk in the gift shop and up to the window, and the caretakers move in and out of the
tiger cub area to work with other species during the day. The facility then starts using the cubs as early as 3-4
weeks for photos shoots after their 1st vaccine.
*** Several photographs and videos taken during photography sessions show tiger cubs as young as 4 weeks old
being held by a member of the general public. The licensee was shown these pictures and videos on 9 January
2015. During this discussion, he admitted that his daughter, who is no longer at the facility, handled all of the cub
photo shoots and he was not aware of how the cubs were handled and never watched the photo shoots. Even
though the licensee previously stated that no member of the public is allowed to touch the cubs during photo shoots
at that point (though they were touched later during interactive play sessions) the photos show cubs as young as 4
weeks being held by members of the general public. Additional photos / videos show members of the public
holding, touching, and bottle feeding the cubs that appear slightly older. When showed the photos, the licenseestated there was no doubt the public was touching the cub and feeding it and that he was previously unaware that
his daughter was doing that. Exposure to members of the public by placing these animals in photo shoots and
housing them in areas where public foot traffic is present is a health concern for the cubs. Cubs of this age that
have not been adequately vaccinated do not have fully intact immune systems and are therefore susceptible to
many infectious diseases. The practices described above do not constitute handling these cubs as carefully as
possible and unnecessarily risks harm and discomfort. The licensee must ensure that if tigers are to be removed
from the mother, that handling must be done as carefully as possible and that exposure to members of the public
does not occur until the cubs are immunocompetent and vaccinated.
Correct from this day forward
*** The owner and the elephant handler informed the APHIS officials several times during this inspection that the
female African elephant, Asha, is regularly walked across the street to the 1600 hundred acre property owned by a
friend (The Virginia Conservation Legacy). When asked when she was there last, the APHIS officials were told by
the elephant handler that Asha went the day before the inspection started (5 January 2015). The APHIS officials
were told by the licensee that Asha is allowed to roam free to exercise and play and will come back to the handler at
least every half hour to make sure he is still there waiting for her. The elephant roaming free without being under
the direct control of the handler may result in physical harm or unnecessary discomfort to the elephant. While out of
view of the elephant handler, Asha may be physically injured by discarded material or natural hazards that may
exist on a property that large. Additionally she could easily ingest poisonous plant material or wander into the road
and get hit by a vehicle when not attended causing both a threat of physical harm to her and the public. Finally, the
elephant could easily encounter another animal or a person risking both harm to the elephant and/or the other
animal/person if not under the direct control of the elephant handler. The elephant must be under the direct control
of the handler unless the elephant is in a secured and safe area that can contain the elephant.
Correct from this day forward.
2.131(b)(2)(1) DIRECT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A video of a DeBrazza monkey in an undersized pet carrier showed an extremely agitated monkey exhibiting signs
of behavioral distress during attempts at providing a medical treatment by facility staff. The video shows the
monkey being repeatedly jabbed with sticks in an unsuccessful attempt to get the monkey to move from an
airline-type plastic pet carrier (which is small enough that the monkey cannot stand erect) into a small squeeze
cage. During this time facility personnel were making loud noises in apparent attempts to scare the monkey into the
squeeze cage as well as talking loudly about other things and joking (making comments such as we need to get a
cattle prod). During the approximately 6 minutes that this was occurring, the monkey was frantically moving back
and forth in the small carrier in an apparent attempt to avoid being jabbed with the sticks. At that time the squeezecage was removed from the front of the carrier and facility staff began an alternate method to transfer the animal. A
staff member (later identified by the licensee as his daughter) then inserted a net into the carrier and after an
additional minute removed the monkey from the carrier. At the point that the animal was removed from the carrier,
the monkey was partially out of the net being held primarily by its tail and jumps and flails around the room knocking
things over while being partially restrained by its tail.
The licensee was shown the video by APHIS officials on 09 January 2015 and was asked about his thoughts
regarding what he saw. He made several comments throughout stating "(cid:28)they should not be jabbing"(cid:29), "(cid:28)I am not
happy about it"(cid:29), and used descriptors such as "(cid:28)unprofessional"(cid:29), "(cid:28)primitive"(cid:29), and "(cid:28)inappropriate"(cid:29). The licensee
stated he did not know about this event, was disappointed in what he saw, and that he trusted his daughter be more
professional. When questioned about the treatment of non-human primates in need of veterinary care over several
days, he mentioned the use of a squeeze cage and said they have one on hand. The licensee asked his wife to
view this video and she also commented that she was also unaware of this event. She stated that the licensee'(cid:25)s
daughter was in the video and that she (the daughter)was responsible for the care of this animal which she (the
wife) believed to be a monkey that required daily treatment for a period of time. The licensee did comment that the
cage in front of the pet taxi in the video is a squeeze cage but when asked about the size of the squeeze cage and
whether this was one that an animal could be housed in for an extended period for treatment (which he previously
described as a method of treatment of primates) he stated that the facility has a larger one. Based on comments
made on the video and the statements by the licensee and his wife regarding the treatment of this monkey, this is
believed to have occurred on more than one occasion over the course of treatment for this animal. Jabbing at an
animal with sticks, yelling and talking loudly, and having unnecessary discussions while attempting to move a
primate from one enclosure to another are distressful to the animal and very inappropriate. The licensee agreed
and used the term (cid:28)"clowning around"(cid:29). This degree of intentional harassment of a primate on a recurring basis is
inhumane and sufficient to constitute abuse. Physical abuse is never appropriate when handling animals as this
can lead to injury or permanent psychological damage to the animal. Correct by handling all animals as carefully as
possible.
Correct from this day forward
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The following non-compliances with animal handling were identified during this inspection:
*** This facility used tiger cubs for photo shoots this during the summer of 2014. APHIS officials discussed the
methods used for these photos shoots with the licensee on 9 January 2015. Several photos and videos were
shown to the licensee where members of the public are sitting on a bench and the facility handlers place a cub inthe public(cid:25)'s lap for a photo. A bottle is used to keep the tiger cub'(cid:25)s interest and the handler gives the bottle to the
public. In all of the videos and photos, the tiger cub being used is too big and too strong for this type public
exhibition where there is not a public barrier in place. When showed each of the photos and videos, the licensee
made comments like "the cat is too big", "they should not be feeding it", and "the child it too close." In one video,
the members of the public were a man and woman with an infant that appeared to be less than a year old. When
seeing this, the licensee stated he was not happy about what he was seeing and that he was unaware this was
going on during these photo shoots. He also said that to him it looked dangerous and he was thankful that it was
being brought to his attention. The use of animals such as tigers in photo shoots can be dangerous if juvenile tigers
of this size are used. These animals, which appear to be 35-40 pounds, are clearly too strong and too fast to be
handled without a barrier. Any future photo shoots must be done with smaller cubs that can be adequately
controlled to minimize risk to the public (and have been adequately vaccinated to minimize risk to the cub) or a
barrier is required between the tiger cub and the public.
Correct from this day forward
*** The outdoor enclosure for the female African elephant consists of a double stranded electric fence surrounded
by a public barrier that is approximately 4 feet high and constructed of hog-panel type fencing. The facility was not
open to the public at time of the inspection. The elephant handler was also responsible for providing care to other
animals at the zoo in addition to the elephant. Caring for the additional animals takes him to other areas of the park
on a regular basis, leaving no handler to supervise the elephant at times when she is in her outdoor enclosure. The
electric wire fencing may not be a sufficient barrier to contain the elephant if startled or harassed by persons/events
that may occur when the public is present. During public exhibition, animals must be handled so there is minimal
risk of harm to the animal and the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the general viewing public
so as to assure the safety of the animal and the public. Correct by ensuring that the elephant is always adequately
supervised by a knowledgeable and experienced elephant handler while she is present in her current outdoor
enclosure (the electric fence) when the facility is open to the public.
Correct by: Prior to public admission to the zoo.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Two oval metal stock water troughs on the patio of the keeper building were housing numerous guinea pigs
outdoors. Tub #1 housed 22 adult guinea pigs and their offspring and tub #2 housed 28 adult guinea pigs with
offspring on 6 January 2015. The temperature measured with the Kestrel 3000 ranged from 36.4 to 37 degrees F at
approximately 11:00 a.m. On 7 January 2015 these same two oval metal stock water troughs housed 40 adultguinea pigs with offspring and 38 adult guinea pigs with their offspring. The temperature measured with a Raytek
MiniTemp MT-6 non-contact thermometer away from the heat lamp ranged from 15-18 degrees F and under the
heat lamp ranged from 40.5 (42 Max)-39.5(46 Max) degrees F at about 9:35 a.m.
An oval metal stock water trough in an unheated trailer (tub #3) housed 17 adult guinea pigs with their offspring on 7
January 2015. The temperature measured with the Kestrel 3000 was 36.9 degrees F at 10:19 a.m.
These temperatures are significantly below the required 60-85 degrees F for indoor guinea pig facilities. All three
oval metal stock water troughs housed guinea pigs with areas of hair loss. The attending veterinarian examined the
guinea pigs on 8 January 2015 and suspected ringworm. The stress of the low temperatures may be contributing to
the dermal problem in the guinea pig colony. The owner said he had a variance to house the guinea pigs, but could
only find his request for a variance. The description of the housing in that request is different than the current
housing and no reply to the request could be found. Housing guinea pigs outdoors when temperatures are near or
below freezing is not an appropriate climate for their health and well-being. Guinea pigs shall not be housed in
outdoor facilities unless such facilities are located in an appropriate climate and prior approval for such housing is
obtained from the Deputy Administrator.
The facility owner was informed on Wednesday late afternoon by the APHIS officials to have this corrected by noon
on Friday, 9 January 2015.
3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The enclosure housing the guinea pigs in the trailer is a metal stock water trough. The bottom edge of this trough is
rotted and rusted to the point that the facility has duct taped the area and placed cement blocks next to the trough to
secure this area. During this inspection, the brick was removed and an inspector's hand could be placed into the
enclosure from the outside through this rotted area. This trough is a potential injury hazard or route of escape to
the guinea pigs. This trough requires repair or replacement to ensure it adequately protects the guinea pigs from
injury and contains the animals.
Correct by: 17 January 2015
3.28(c)(1)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES. Adult guinea pigs with their litters were housed in oval metal stock water troughs that measured 31.5 inches wide in
the mid-section by 92 inches long with curved ends (decreasing the interior space of the enclosure). The area of
each oval metal stock water trough was 1905.75 square inches (60.5X31.5) plus 778.9 square inches
(3.14x(15.75x15.75)) to equal 2684 square inches. Each trough had 2 eight inch diameter water bowls that took up
100.5 square inches of floor space (2x3.14x(4x4)) and 2 ten inch diameter food dishes that took up 157 square
inches of floor space (2X3.14x(5X5)). The floor area for the guinea pigs in each of the metal troughs was
approximately 2428 square inches when the area of the bowls/dishes was subtracted (2684-(100.5+157)).
Each adult guinea pig and nursing female with her litter requires at least 101 square inches of floor space so each
tub can house a maximum of 24 of these guinea pigs. Weaned guinea pigs weighing less than 350 grams require
at least 60 square inches of floor space so when weaned guinea pigs are also housed with the adult guinea pigs
then less adult guinea pigs can be housed in the metal troughs. While inspecting the guinea pigs on 6 January
2015 the owner informed the APHIS officials that he thought he could house up to 22 adult guinea pigs in the metal
stock water troughs. On 6 January 2015 there were 22 adult guinea pigs and their litters in Tub #1 and 28 adult
guinea pigs with their litters housed in Tub #2. APHIS officials returned to these tubs to re-evaluate temperature the
morning of 7 January 2015. At that time, there were 40 adult guinea pigs with their litters in Tub #1 and 38 in Tub
#2. The troughs did not provide adequate floor space for the 28, 38 and 40 adult guinea pigs with their litters. There
were guinea pigs in each of these troughs with hair loss that were cited under veterinary care. Overcrowding can
be distressful and result in the animals being more susceptible to disease and health problems. Each adult guinea
pig and nursing guinea pig must be provided at least 101 square inches of floor space and each weaned guinea pig
weighing less than 350 grams must be provided at least 60 square inches of floor space for their health and
comfort.
Correct by 17 January 2015.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The three oval metal stock water troughs housing a total of 97 guinea pigs with their litters had excessively wet and
dirty bedding below a layer of clean bedding. The owner informed the APHIS officials that the personnel clean the
enclosures by removing the old bedding in half of the enclosure, put in new bedding, and then remove the old
bedding in the other half of the enclosure and put in new bedding. This is done while the guinea pigs were in the
enclosures. These enclosures are not being adequately cleaned or sanitized at least once every 2 weeks in the
manner provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. All three of these enclosures have guinea pigs with hair loss
that were cited under veterinary care. The accumulation of wet dirty bedding and lack of sanitization of the
enclosures may create an environment for the accumulation of parasites and/or growth of bacteria and fungi.
Additionally, the impact to the animals due to the presence of wet bedding is further exacerbated by the extremelycold conditions. Guinea pig enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent the accumulation of
excreta or debris and at least once every 2 weeks in the manner provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
Correct by 17 January 2015.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The 6 hutches housing 6 rabbits in the back breeder area had excessive debris accumulating on the wire mesh
walls and in the areas between the wire floors and walls. These enclosures did not appear to have been clean in a
long while. Additionally, the 2 rabbits housed in the chain link dog kennel directly on the ground had an excessive
accumulation of excreta mixed with the gravel floor. Bacteria and fungus may grow in the excessive debris and
grime and cause the animals to become ill. The enclosures must be cleaned to minimize disease hazards which
includes sanitization at least every 30 days in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Produce (fruit and vegetables) was stored in open boxes on the floor in the keeper building against shelves with
cans of paints and next to enclosures housing nonhuman primates. Paint/debris on the outside of the paint cans
may contaminate the produce. The primates housed in this area are close enough that they may urinate and/or
defecate on the produce and/or throw items out of the enclosure onto the produce. Additionally, normal cleaning
procedures for the enclosures may contaminate the produce with animal waste. Eating contaminated produce may
cause the animals to become ill. Supplies of food must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from
spoilage, contamination and vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor away from the walls, to
allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. Food requiring refrigeration must be stored accordingly and all
food must be stored in a manner that prevents contamination and deterioration of its nutritive value. Only the food
and bedding currently being used may be kept in animals areas, and when not in actual use, open food and bedding
supplies must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage and contamination.
Substances that are toxic to the animals must not be stored in food storage and preparation areas.

The padlock for the door of the outdoor black and white lemur area was found unlocked during this inspection. The
facility representative locked this padlock once APHIS officials pointed it out to them.

The glass partition between the gift shop and the snow macaque outdoor enclosure has an approximately 8 inch
vertical crack midway along the bottom of the pane upwards approximately 8 inches. There is also a circular
puncture-type damage about in the middle of the pane. This is a potential injury and escape hazard should this
damage worsen. This window requires repair or replacement to ensure it remains structurally sound and is in good
repair.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One female Spider monkey is being housed in a primary enclosure measuring 46" by 47" and 8' in height. This
equals a total floor space of 15.01 square feet. This primate is a brachiating species in Group 6 and requires 25.1
square feet of floor space. This animal was acquired this fall according to facility staff. This enclosure immediately
adjoins the enclosure with a group of Spider monkeys and this primate is in visual, auditory, and tactile contact with
the other Spider monkeys. This animal requires additional space to meet its minimal space requirements. Lack of
adequate space does not allow this brachiating specie to engage in normal species-type behavior including
swinging and may lead to physical and behavioral problems. A facility maintenance person informed the APHIS
officials that when he built the enclosure he was unaware of the space requirements and could easily enlarge the
enclosure. Correct this by providing this animal an enclosure meeting its space requirements.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The following non-compliances with the facility primate environment enhancement plan were identified during this
inspection.
1) The only primate environment enrichment proposal for the facility is dated August 24, 1992, and there is noindication that it was reviewed or approved by the attending veterinarian. This plan does not include the following
species currently housed at the facility: 7 DeBrazzas, 2 red ruffed lemurs, 4 black and white ruffed lemurs, and 2
greater bush babies. The facility proposal states: "The log book will be divided according to each individual or
family group and will be used to keep a written record of enhancement techniques, interactive periods and the
NHP's responses and behaviors to these stimuli. Care-givers will also note any aberrant behavior in this log." A
sample of the weekly enrichment log sheet for a species is included in the facility's primate environment enrichment
proposal. The facility personnel informed the APHIS officials that the log book is not being kept.
The development and implementation of environmental enhancement plans to promote psychological well-being in
nonhuman primates has promoted social housing and enriched the environment of the nonhuman primates resulting
in a decrease in stereotypic behavior. The facility must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for
environment enhancement to promote the psychological well-being of all their nonhuman primates. The plan must
be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or
reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian. This plan must be available to APHIS upon
request.
Correct by 10 February 2015.
2) The facility proposal also states: "SPECIAL CASES: Any NHP not housed within visual or aural distance of a
compatible species will receive regular interaction with humans (care-givers) in order to promote its normal
development and behavior&Interactive periods shall transpire no less than 5 days per week, for at least 15 minutes,
and a written record of each episode will be kept in a log book." A sample for listing of individually housed
nonhuman primates with date, animal identification and reason for individual housing and enrichment log is included
in the facility(cid:25)'s primate environment enrichment proposal. A DeBrazza monkey is being housed alone in a room
with no other nonhuman primates. The facility personnel had not done any of the documentation as indicated in the
facility proposal. At the start of the inspection facility personnel had informed the APHIS officials that there were no
nonhuman primates identified as special cases or needed additional/extra enrichment.
DeBrazza monkeys are social and being housed in a room without other nonhuman primates can be distressful and
cause stereotypic behavior. The DeBrazza monkey must be provided special attention regarding enhancement of
its environment, based on the needs of the individual species and in accordance with the instructions of the
attending veterinarian.
Correct by 17 January 2015.
3.84(a)CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Nearly every non-human primate primary enclosure at this facility is excessively dirty. The enclosures that are the
worst are those indoor enclosures in the Tamarin building. The Tamarin enclosures have been scent marked and
are covered with grime including all the strands of the wire mesh walls, the outside of all nest boxes, the climbing
branches and shelves placed in the enclosures, and the feed container holders in the enclosures. It does not
appear that these enclosures have been thoroughly cleaned in quite some time. The licensee commented on the
fact that these animals scent mark and cleaning too much of their scenting can be problematic. Even though this is
true, it is possible to clean thoroughly all areas of the enclosures on a rotating basis to ensure that all surfaces are
cleaned regularly.
Other primate enclosures were also found to be in need of cleaning including the indoor area for the tufted
capuchins, the indoor area for the spider monkeys, the indoor lemur area, the indoor white faced capuchin area, the
indoor Mandrill area, and the capuchins and DeBrazza monkeys in the mouse house building. All of these areas
have surfaces in contact with the primates that are covered with grime and require cleaning including the solid walls,
shelves, wire mesh fencing, and ceilings. The shelves in the tufted capuchin area are covered with a layer of feces
and grime. Many of the walls in these areas are dirty and stained from either animal hands or grease from fur.
Many ceilings in these areas are rust stained or covered with fly excrement markings. Failure to clean on a regular
basis exposes the animals to disease hazards and does not satisfy accepted cleanliness standards.
The facility must ensure that all primary enclosures housing non-human primates are cleaned on a regular basis.
Additionally, all indoor primate enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized at least every 2 weeks or as often as
necessary to prevent excessive accumulation of dirt and debris in accordance with section 3.84(b)(2). For those
primates that require special consideration for scent marking for their well-being, the facility may utilize a rotating
cleaning schedule that addresses this concern while also ensuring that their enclosures are kept sanitary and in
accordance with this section and 3.84(b)(2).

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Several areas housing non-human primates have miscellaneous items, trash, discarded matter, and unused items
that require removal and proper storage. These areas all also have dirt, dust, and cobwebs that require cleaning.
The area behind the mouse house building which houses Capuchin and DeBrazza monkeys has excess pet taxis,
plastic bins, caging supplies and plastic trash bins stored there. Inside the mouse house buildings, there are
cobwebs and dirt in the front keeper area that requires cleaning. Walls are stained and discolored with mold or
mildew damage near the DeBrazza monkey housed in that area. In the Tamarin building, there are items in thefront entry area that are being stored including an old weight set and other miscellaneous items. This building was
also dirty with the walls behind and next to enclosure having grime and build-up that require cleaning. There are
cobwebs throughout this building. The ceiling corners all have dust/cob webs that require removal. Several ceiling
tiles of the drop ceiling are either discolored or have water damage and require replacement. The area behind the
white faced Capuchin building has a deceased wild rabbit in a live trap. This rabbit needs to be removed.
All of these areas are in need of a thorough cleaning, removal of unwanted items, and proper storage of items still
needed. This clutter concern is compounded by the fact that there is evidence of a large rodent population at the
facility. Pest control and housekeeping significantly impact one another. These piles of excess material piled
throughout the facility and cob/dust webs in corners and near enclosures make monitoring for pests difficult to
impossible. The clutter is also a breeding ground for these mammalian pests. Additionally, excessive clutter and
general disorganization makes it difficult to maintain necessary standards for cleanliness of enclosures.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an overwhelming pest control problem at this facility. Numerous rodent holes were found throughout the
facility including by the lemur building, the tufted capuchin building, by the snow macaque enclosure and behind the
outdoor capuchin housing. Additionally, dead rats were found next to the lemur building, snow macaque enclosure
and behind the tufted capuchin building. Rodent bait boxes are present throughout the facility but significant rodent
activity is still present as evidenced by the excessive number of rodent holes both in and around the animal
enclosures. This facility also has a significant housekeeping concern with clutter and piles of unused or excess
items throughout the facility. These areas provide hiding places and are a breeding ground for mammalian pests,
contributing to the pest problem. The presence of rodents is a potential disease hazard to the animals as these
rodents can be carriers of disease and parasites. An effective pest control program must be established to ensure
control of these mammalian pests.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following non-compliances with food storage were identified during this inspection.
1) The walk-in freezer used to store meat to feed the animals is filthy and ice has accumulated on the back shelves.
Animal livestock carcasses for feeding were piled on the floor, uncovered and dirty. This food is not free from
contamination or freezer burn and its consumption could result in animal illness and discomfort. The freezer also
contains deceased animals previously exhibited at the facility such as a giraffe head and numerous bird specimens.
The licensee stated that these are being stored for later use as taxidermy specimens. Bodies of dead exhibitanimals must not be stored in the same freezer as food to prevent contamination of the meat from disease
organisms that may have caused or contributed to the death of the exhibit animals. The dead exhibit animals, the
piles of dirty uncovered animal livestock carcasses, and any other contaminated and/or freezer burned food must be
removed from the walk-in freezer. The freezer must be cleaned and the frozen food wrapped or stored in closed
containers to protect the food supplies from deterioration, contamination and freezer burn.
Correct by 24 January 2015.
2) The hay stored in the hayloft above the stalls by the keeper building is contaminated with bird feces, feathers,
alive and dead pigeons. A couple of old mattress infested with pigeons and multiple containers are also stored in
the hayloft. Bird feces, feathers and pigeons may contain bacteria and/or parasites. Hay that is wet with feces may
mold. The animals receiving this hay may become ill. The old mattress, containers, pigeons and contaminated hay
must be removed, and the hayloft cleaned for the hay to be stored in facilities that adequately protect it against
deterioration, molding and contamination by vermin.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
One Blesbok is being housed with muntjac deer in a pasture behind the barn near the keeper building. The muntjac
deer have shelters that are too small for the Blesbok to enter and there is no other shelter for this animal. The
licensee stated that the rear of the barn has stall doors to allow the Blesbok access to shelter but currently the stalls
are occupied by other animals and the facility would need to move animals to allow the Blesbok access to the barn.
One female white Dromedary camel is being housed in the elephant ride area without adequate shelter. The animal
is housed in a pasture with the elephant ride stand. The ride stand does have a roof but has no sides and does not
provide adequate shelter for this animal. The licensee stated that the camel is in this area so she has plenty of
space to move, is away from the other camels, and is easily accessible to staff as she is bred and due to calve
soon. This poses an additional concern as the newborn calf would also need shelter from the inclement weather.
Ambient day time temperatures were highest on the first day of the inspection (below 40 degrees Fahrenheit as
measured by inspectors in the morning) and significantly colder on in the subsequent days (in the single digits to 20
degrees F with a significant wind chill).
Both the Blesbok and the Dromedary camel require shelter to ensure their health and well-being. Failure to provide
adequate shelter exposes animals to the weather and is especially important for the expected newborn calf.
Correct this by providing these animals adequate shelter.The licensee and his wife were informed by APHIS officials on 07 January 2015 that these animals required shelter
no later than noon on Friday 09 January 2015.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The three outdoor yards housing 18 Sitatunga, 17 Oryx, and 5 Zebras, were excessively muddy on 06 January
2015. Even though the facility placed large round bales of hay in the shelters for the animals allowing them to have
a dry place to stand, these yards remained muddy enough that the front loader used to move hay bales into the
Sitatunga yard left ruts at least 4 inches deep. The zebra were muddy above all 4 pasterns. By 07 January 2015,
the ground was frozen due to weather. These yards require additional drainage or substrate to ensure the animals
can remain dry in all seasons. Correct this by providing proper drainage to these animal yards.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
This facility has an approved perimeter fence variance allowing the perimeter fence to also act as the primary
enclosure fence for some of the hoof stock. There are many areas where excess items including stock water
troughs, plastic furniture, rolls of fencing, transport enclosures, plastic pools, and other miscellaneous items are
being stored against the perimeter fence creating a potential "step" for animals to get over the fence. Several other
areas of the fence have trees growing through the fence or areas that are impossible to inspect because it has been
overgrown by brush. There are also 2 enclosures containing one spotted skunk each and one enclosure containing
3 red squirrels behind the mouse house building that are immediately next to the perimeter fence. Several empty
small animal enclosures have also been mounted onto the perimeter fence. In one area of perimeter fence by the
mouse house building, a chicken was observed walking underneath the loose bottom of the fence.
The perimeter fence is not functional in its current condition. The licensee must ensure that no items are stored
near or on the perimeter fence that could potentially act as a "step" for animals to get over, no trees or brush is
affecting the structural strength or the ability to inspect the fence, and that all primary enclosures not included in the
perimeter fence variance are placed at least 3 feet from the perimeter fence. The licensee should conduct a
thorough self-inspection of the entire perimeter to ensure that all areas of perimeter fence comply with these
requirements in addition to those listed above.Correct by: 10 February 2015 to remove items from fence, 10 July 2015 for all other items
3.129(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
The following feeding non-compliances were identified during this inspection.
1) Direct non-compliance: The 2 bears did not have any food in their enclosure. The facility owner informed the
APHIS officials that the bears were not provided water or food from the first of December until March to encourage
hibernation and not leaving the den. One of the bears walked out of the den and was observed in its enclosure by
two of the APHIS officials. Bears periodically leave their den during winter months and eat or drink. The bears
could become distressed if hungry and they do not have access to any food. The bears must have access to some
wholesome food to provide for their health and comfort.
The facility owner was informed on Wednesday late afternoon by the APHIS officials to have this corrected by noon
on Friday, 9 January 2015.
2) The 2 tigers, 2 puma and 5 servals are fed meat stored in the walk-in freezer. Animal livestock carcasses for
feeding were piled on the floor, uncovered and dirty. This food shows signs of desiccation, freezer burn, and
general contamination. Some of the whole deer (intended for feeding) show signs of scanvenging on the carcass.
Deteriorated meat (such as that with freezer burn) may have decreased nutritional content and feeding
contaminated meat may result in illness. These carcasses must not be fed for the health of the animals. Correct by
ensuring that frozen meat is properly stored when frozen and properly thawed at refrigerator temperatures in a
clean environment to prevent bacterial contamination and deterioration of the meat. Meat fed to the animals must
be wholesome, palatable and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain the
animal is good health.
Correct from this day forward.
3) According to the licensee the hoof stock is fed hay from the hayloft above the stalls by the keeper building. This
hay is contaminated with bird feces, feathers and dead pigeons. Bird feces, feathers and pigeon carcasses may
contain bacteria and parasites and cause the animals receiving the hay to become ill. Contaminated hay must not
be fed for the health of the animals. Hay fed to the animals must be free from contamination and of sufficient
nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.
Correct from this day forward.
4) There were 10 dead guinea pigs in the refrigerator in the keeper building that the owner informed the APHISofficials that were going to be used to feed the felids: 2 tigers, 2 puma and 5 servals. At least two of these guinea
pigs had patches of hair loss. There were also several live guinea pigs that were identified with hair loss which
appeared similar to these lesions and were cited under veterinary care. The attending veterinarian examined the
live guinea pigs on 9 January 2015 and said the hair loss was suspicious for ringworm. Ringworm is contagious
and animals with suspicious lesions are not considered wholesome to be offered as food and must not be fed.
Correct from this day forward.
5) The facility has a felid feeding plan. The original plan was written with a different vitamin supplement added to
the meat than is currently used. The new supplement was written onto the margin of the plan, but the directions on
the supplement container are different than what is directed by the plan and how the facility personnel are applying
the supplement to the meat. Both the plan and facility personnel have informed APHIS personnel that the meat is
dusted with the supplement. The directions on the supplement container are per weight of the animal and range
from 1/4 of a scoop for a 1-3 pound animal to 8 scoops for a 500 pound animal. Feeding the animals meat with the
wrong amount of vitamin/mineral supplement may cause preventable health problems. Also the facility hand raises
tiger cubs. There is no written guidance in the felid feeding plan for the hand rearing of tiger cubs. The licensee
stated that he really wasn't sure how or what cubs were fed, that his daughter was responsible for all aspects of cub
rearing. Proper nutrition is very important for tiger cubs. Cubs fed an imbalanced or nutritionally incomplete diet
can develop metabolic bone disease resulting in fractures or deformed bones. The feline feeding plan must be
updated under the direction of the attending veterinarian to provide a diet with the nutritive value to maintain all the
felids in good health.

WATERING.
The 2 bears did not have potable water in their enclosure. There was only dirty green water in a large metal pool.
The facility owner informed the APHIS officials that the bears were not provided water (other than this pool) or food
from the first of December until March to encourage hibernation and discourage animals from leaving the den. One
of the bears walked out of the den and was observed in its enclosure by two of the APHIS officials. Bears
periodically leave their den during winter months and drink water and/or eat and do need to be provided with
potable water during winter months. Drinking contaminated water may result in illness. Additionally, if the facility is
not providing fresh water on a regular basis, there may not be any water during long periods of significant cold
temperatures (ie. when the pool is frozen) which could farther compromise animal health. The bears must have
access to potable water to provide for their health and comfort.
The facility owner was informed on Wednesday late afternoon by the APHIS officials to have this corrected by noonon Friday, 9 January 2015.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The following non-compliances with cleaning of enclosures were identified on this inspection.
1) The 5 enclosures housing the 11 Prevost squirrels in the Tamarin building had excessive debris and grime caked
on the wire mesh walls of the enclosures and on all surfaces including perches and nest boxes and do not appear to
have been cleaned in a long while.
2) The enclosure housing 4 flying squirrels in the mouse house building had excessive debris accumulating on the
wire mesh walls and dirty hay on the floor. Debris and cobwebs are accumulating under the enclosure in the catch
pan. This enclosure does not appear to have been cleaned in a long while.
Bacteria and fungus may grow in the excessive debris and grime and cause the animals to become ill. The
enclosures must be cleaned to minimize disease hazards.
Correct both items by 24 January 2015
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
There is a significant clutter concern at this facility. The field area near the freezer contains excess items including
old caging supplies, metal barrels, fencing materials, tires, animal skulls, jaw parts and a pile of wooden pallets. In
the barn near the keeper area, there are freezers with excess caging materials, rope, pet taxis, and other
miscellaneous items stacked on top of them. Next to the fallow deer enclosure there is an old truck tire, spare
fencing and building materials being stored. Much of the perimeter fence has items leaning against it that also need
to be removed, discarded, or properly stored. In the keeper building, there are paint cans, various building supplies,
tools, and other miscellaneous items near the hedgehog enclosure. These items should be removed from the
proximity of this animal(cid:25)'s enclosure or the enclosure moved to another location.
All of these areas are in need of a thorough cleaning, removal of unwanted items, and proper storage of items still
needed. This clutter concern is compounded by the fact that there is evidence of a large rodent population at the
facility. Pest control and housekeeping work hand in hand. These piles of excess material piled throughout the
facility and cob/dust webs in corners and near enclosures make monitoring for pests difficult to impossible. The
clutter is also a breeding ground for these mammalian pests. The licensee must develop a plan to remove all unwanted items, clean the affected areas, and properly organize
and store items still needed for the husbandry and care of the animals.

SANITATION.
An overwhelming number of rodent holes were found throughout the facility including in the muntjac yard, behind
the porcupine enclosure, and inside the bottle fed muntjac yard. Additionally, 2 dead rats were found inside the
muntjac yard closest to the porcupine enclosure and several dead rats were found outside the perimeter fence.
Rodent holes were also found near the trailer housing guinea pigs and near the rabbits housed outdoors. Rodent
bait boxes are present throughout the facility but significant rodent activity is still present. In the guinea pig trailer,
bird eggs, droppings, and feathers were found in the vent on one wall. The hay storage in the loft of the barn near
the keeper building has a significant avian pest problem. All of the hay in this loft is covered with bird feathers and
droppings. Several pigeons were observed in this loft during this inspection. There is also an old mattress in this
loft that is now being used by the birds to nest in. Several dead pigeons were found on the floor of the loft. This
facility also has significant housekeeping concerns with clutter and piles of unused or excess items throughout the
facility. These areas provide hiding places and are breeding grounds for mammalian pests, contributing to the pest
problem.
The presence of these mammalian and avian pets is a potential disease hazard to the animals as these rodents and
birds can be carriers of disease and parasites. An effective pest control program must be established to ensure
control of these mammalian and avian pests.
