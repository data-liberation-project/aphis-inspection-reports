ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The exhibitor does not currently have a written Program of Veterinary Care.
The written Program of Veterinary Care is necessary in order to plan out preventive health care, emergency
provisions, oversight on husbandry, and other issues pertinent to the welfare of the animals. The veterinarian and
the animal exhibitor should review and approve this document at least once a year, and it should cover all regulated
animal species at the facility. Failure to maintain an updated Program of Veterinary Care on site could be
detrimental to the well being of the animals, since this plan outlines and clarifies standards of care.
The exhibitor should work with the attending veterinarian to create a written Program of Veterinary Care.
To be corrected by 4/1/17.
2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There was no Record of Acquisition and Disposition for the animals on hand. Records were incomplete.
Records should be maintained for at least one year following the departure of any animals. Acquisition and
Disposition records help to enable the inspection process, and to provide traceability of animals, which can help to
protect their welfare. Records should be created and maintained for all exhibited animals. APHIS Form 7005 has
been provided to the exhibitor for the purpose of documenting the cats at the facility.
To be corrected by 4/1/17.
