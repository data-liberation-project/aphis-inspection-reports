INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The ambient temperature in room #13 containing 120 cynomolgous monkeys was >85° Fahrenheit on four separate
measurements taken over a period of four hours. Four temperature measurements were taken in the room
approximately once every hour starting at 1:20 pm. These measurements were taken with a Kestrel handheld
weather meter, standing with the meter held at arms length from the threshold of the primate room door, and were
as follows:
1st measurement- Temperature: 86.0° F, Humidity: 64.9%, Heat index: 94.5
2nd measurement- Temperature: 87.3° F, Humidity: 57.8%, Heat index: 94.6
3rd measurement- Temperature: 85.7° F, Humidity: 68.5%, Heat index: 96.1
4th measurement- Temperature: 86.4° F, Humidity: 65.9%, Heat index 96.6
At approximately 5:00 pm a digital wall thermometer in the room read 86.9° F although a second temperature probe
on the wall placed by the door near this thermometer read 85° F. The Kestrel, held near the animal cages at the
back of the room, read 85.7° F at approximately this time. It was explained that the second thermometer (displaying
the 85° F temperature) is made to trigger an alarm if it detects temperatures above 85° F for more than 4 hours.
This did not occur during the inspection.
High temperatures for prolonged periods of time can stress animals, leading to discomfort and illness. Discomfort
from heat may be exacerbated by high humidity.
The ambient temperature in an indoor primate facility must not rise above 85° F for more than 4 consecutive hours
when nonhuman primates are present.

This was a focused inspection to assess the temperature in the primate rooms. The inspection was performed on 8/6/14 with the Operations Manager and Animal Care Technicians. The exit
briefing was conducted with the President and COO on 8/7/14.
