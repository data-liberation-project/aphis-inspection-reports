FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The primary enclosure fence for the drive-thru park has been damaged in several areas of the fence along the
road. The facility representative stated that the electric company contractors cut down several trees along the fence
line approximately two days ago which fell on the fence causing the damage. There are broken strands of barbed
wire along the top of the fence and a wooden post has been broken in half. Also damage to the actual fence
material has left a gaping opening in an approximately six foot section between two posts. The gap was temporarily
mended with an extra gate and a piece of welded wire material layered over the gap and attached to it by wires.
***The perimeter fence that is located between the mouflon primary enclosure and the Patagonian cavy primary
enclosure has a hole in the bottom of the fence approximately 31/2 feet in length by 9 inches in height.
*** One of the goat enclosures has a break running from the top of the fence down to the bottom of the fence which
has been patched but has left wires with sharp protruding ends present. The two mother goats have three baby
goats which could be injured by sharp the wires,
It is important to make sure all fences are in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to contain
the animals. The fences should also keep any unwanted predators from having access to animals.

FEEDING.
Feeding of the animals was being conducted during this inspection. The small white feed buckets containing the
rations for several species including the African crested porcupine and the wallaby included some overripe and
spoiled cut up cantaloupe. The orange fleshy part of the cantaloupe was overripe and mushy. The outer rind
contained white and green mold on it. A sour smell was present. A bushel basket next to the feed buckets contained
overripe and moldy whole cantaloupes and others contained spoiled apples that the facility representative stated
were being discarded. The facility representative stated that there was not enough refrigerator space available tostore all the produce used to feed the animals. Spoiled food should not be fed to animals as it may no longer be
wholesome or nutritious and may be contaminated with microbes that may make the animals ill. The overripe
cantaloupe issue was corrected during this inspection by removing the cantaloupe from the rations. Correct from
this day forward by ensuring that all food is wholesome, palatable and free from contamination and of sufficient
nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The drive through portion of the facility includes three large ponds. Two of the ponds have excessive amounts of
green algae floating on top of the water and the water in the ponds is bright green. Multiple species of animals were
noted standing or submerged in the ponds. One male Pere David deer was noted drinking from the water. Algae
overgrowth may lead to illness in the animals as some algae produce toxins and the water may contain
contaminants. The algae growth needs to be controlled to ensure the water is not hazardous to the animals.
Premises including the ponds shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury.
