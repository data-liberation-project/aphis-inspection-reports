3.6(a) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary Enclosures
-In the yard adjacent to the house where 2 greyhounds were living, there were rusty springs within a wire frame of a
mattress that had the potential to injure the dogs. On the gate to the same enclosure, there was chicken wire that
had been attached to the gate, but is now hanging loose and dangling off the gate. The greyhounds were jumping
up around the gate and there is a potential for injury if they get a paw or a limb tangled in the chicken wire.
-In the cat (cid:28)Taj(cid:25)s(cid:29) enclosure, the plywood board floors are warping on one edge and lifting up, which is starting to
expose rusty screws/nails. The junction /gap in the floor makes it difficult for the floor to be readily cleaned and
sanitized. An elevated platform in the enclosure has a loose board with 3 rusty nails sticking out where the cat can
rub on the sharp points.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could
injure the dogs or cats, protect the dogs and cats from injury, and enable all surfaces in contact with the dogs and
cats to be readily cleaned and sanitized in accordance with 3.11b, or be replaced when worn or soiled. There must
be a system of maintenance in place to ensure that primary enclosures are kept in good repair.Original Correction date 30 July 2014
