ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adequate Veterinary Care
***Three female Maltese and one male Poodle (ID #087340601, 003812574, 004039873, 072551323) had an
abundance of matting throughout the chest, legs, and rear areas.
***One male Bichon had discoloration of the fur, some matting, and a brown crusty discharge coming from the back
of its neck, through approximately half way down its back. The licensee stated that he had personally treated the
animal in the past, but it had not be diagnosed by a veterinarian.
Improper grooming can mask underlying conditions, or can cause harmful skin conditions. Veterinary Care Issues
such as unknown skin conditions that go untreated can become serious or harmful conditions that affect the animal
or other animals that may be exposed to that animal. The licensee must have the Bichon diagnosed and treated by
a veterinarian and document the outcome of this consultation. The licensee must have the four above mentioned
animals with an abundance of matting properly groomed and observed for any underlying skin conditions.
2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records
The facility records do not contain all required information including the following:
*The acquisition record for 1 male Bichon on loan for breeding (dog is not listed on APHIS Form 7005).
Incomplete records do not allow for proper tracking of the animals. Maintain records that are complete, accurate and
contain all required information.
3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.Surfaces--(1) General requirements.
***There were three occupied raised enclosures housing a total of 6 dogs where the metal wire mesh panels
constructing the sides of the enclosures have excessive rust leaving a rough surface to the wire. There were at least
two empty enclosures in similar conditions that must also be addressed before they can house dogs.
***The heavy metal paneling used on the two ground Corgi enclosures have areas of rust leaving a rough surface to
the metal. These enclosures housed three dogs in each.
Failure to maintain surfaces that can be readily cleaned and sanitized may increase disease hazards or affect
structural strength. Replace, cover or repair rusted surfaces in these enclosures to ensure structural strength and
cleaning and sanitizing of the surfaces. Correct by June 23, 2014.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces--(3) Cleaning.
An accumulation of hair, dust, and excreta is caught along the bottom edges of the wire panels and waste collecting
trays in behind the raised enclosures. Additionally, the ground enclosures had an excessive accumulation of wood
dust on the back walls with a majority being on the back wall ledge, as well as a brown organic matter smeared on
the while plastic side walls.
Inadequate cleaning can increase disease hazards, odors, pests and soiling of the animals. Remove waste from the
enclosures and maintain daily.
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage
Licensee had two open bags of dog feed inside a round plastic barrel. The barrel had a loose lid that was not
leak-proof and did not fit tightly.
Open feed that is not properly stored poses a hazard of becoming contaminated or spoiled, which can harm any
animals that ingest it. Store all feed in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids. Correct by April 25, 2014
3.2(d)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Interior surfaces.The concrete floor underneath the raised runs is no longer impervious to moisture. There were areas of the
concrete that were chipped or deteriorated and moisture is absorbing into the concrete.
Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture may harbor odors, disease hazards or affect humidity levels. The
concrete floor must be made impervious to moisture to reduce these risks. Correct by June 23, 2014.
3.3(b) REPEAT
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Ventilation.
The kennel building housing 18 adult dogs and 11 puppies had a prevalent ammonia smell. Although the facility is
equipped with ventilation methods such as fans and ceiling vent cap, no ventilation methods were in use at the time
of this inspection and therefore ammonia levels were not being controlled.
High ammonia levels may adversely affect the comfort of the dogs and increase health hazards such as respiratory
illnesses. Provide and maintain adequate ventilation to effectively minimize ammonia levels in the kennel and to
provide for the health and well-being of the dogs.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary enclosures. (a) General requirements.
An enclosure housing seven puppies with their dam had 1" by 1" plastic mesh flooring that were large enough to
allow the puppies' feet and legs to pass through the openings.
Having floor openings too large that allow their feet and legs to pass through could result in injury. Utilize methods
of temporary or permanent flooring or material to provide surfaces for these puppies that protect them from injury by
not allowing their feet and legs to pass through the openings. Correct immediately.
3.9(a)
FEEDING.
Feeding
The licensee is feeding food specifically labeled as for consumption by "Puppies, pregnant bitches, and lactating
bitches" to all animals throughout the facility regardless of age or gender. Although the licensee stated that his
attending veterinarian allows him to use this for all animals, he has no documentation from the attendingveterinarian stating that this is an appropriate diet for adults or males.
Using a product in ways other than what is recommended or described requires written confirmation from the
attending veterinarian. All diets fed to adults and puppies must be appropriate for the individual animal's age and
condition. Feed animals food which is appropriate for their specific needs, or obtain written instruction from the
attending veterinarian authorizing alternate forms of feed. Correct by May 1, 2014.
Dog numbers 074822044 and 074826565 documented under 2.40(b)(2) on the previous inspection report dated
4/3/13 have been addressed.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner.
