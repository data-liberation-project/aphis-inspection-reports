A male Yorkshire Terrier ID 4941517469 had a long unkempt hair coat with loose mats covering his face and body.
The hair surrounding his eyes was wet and a dark crust that held the hair close to his eyes. Matted hair can cause
discomfort to the animal. Long facial hair and facial matts are an irritation to the eyes that may result in injury or
infection of the eye. The licensee shall provide adequate veterinary care which includes routine grooming using a
proactive approach that prevents mats from forming. TO BE CORRECTED BY : 4/14/14
