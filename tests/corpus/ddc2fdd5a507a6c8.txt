ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1100 on
08-Sep-17.
I knocked at the door and called the phone number listed in our database. The licensee called me back. The
licensee stated he/she was no longer at the address and would contact the Regional Officer with the updated
contact information.
