CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
One enclosure in the whelping building with three young adult Pugs had an excessive amount of fecal material on
the indoor portion of the enclosure. The dogs were walking in the feces and had smeared it on a wall of the
enclosure. The licensee stated that it had been 2-3 days since the enclosure had been cleaned on the inside.
Fecal material can harbor organisms that can cause disease in dogs. The licensee must remove excreta from
primary enclosures daily.
TO BE CORRECTED TODAY, MARCH 20, 2014.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
