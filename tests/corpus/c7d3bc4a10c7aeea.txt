Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility representatives do not have an attending veterinarian (AV) employed under formal arrangements. As such,
the written program of veterinary care (PVC) from the previous veterinarian is not valid. Failure to employ an AV and
subsequent lack of a program of veterinary care, leaves the facility without direction to provide adequate veterinary care
to the animals and does not ensure regularly scheduled visits to the premises. The facility representative must employ an
attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part time or consultant veterinarian, these formal
arrangements must include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.
2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One of the ferrets has a large submandibular swelling. The swelling encompasses the entire width of the neck. The facility
representative states that they noticed the swelling had started a day ago and they have not yet contacted a veterinarian
regarding this problem. There is no mention of this ferret in the daily medical logs.

During this visit one of the white racoons appeared lethargic with an overall unthrifty appearance. Although racoons are
nocturnal animals, this animal did not appear as bright and alert as the other racoons in the enclosure. He also seemed


to be isolating himself from the other animals which is not normal for racoons. There were no records indicating that he
has been seen by a veterinarian or that the facility representative noticed there was a problem.

An old red fox previously diagnosed with chronic medical conditions continues to receive no veterinary care for these
conditions. This animal was examined by a veterinarian on Feb 20, 2021. During that visit the veterinarian tentatively
diagnosed prostate cancer and arthritis in the front legs. Instructions to the facility representatives were to “monitor
mobility on daily observation report, if improved on Metacam notify veterinarian and may continue to use long term.
Monitor for trouble urinating and defecating daily.” None of this has been documented in the daily observations. The
daily record for this animal states “will allow him to pass away peacefully when it’s his time”.

The bush baby has an area of hair loss on his right side that has exposed reddened skin. The facility representative has
documented this problem along with a decrease in the animal’s energy in the daily medical log and has been applying
Vaseline and coconut oil to the area of hair loss. According to the facilities' former veterinarian, she was never notified
about the bush baby having hair loss or acting lethargic.

The bobcat named Paulina has areas of hair loss on both sides of her neck about 1 by 2 inches in size. These areas of
hair loss were also present during the May 17-18, 2021 visit to the property. There is now also a small area of hair loss
by the ear with exposed reddened skin. The facility representative states that the hair loss is from breeding (she is housed
with a male). The daily medical log states that they have been using “wound coat spray” on her skin. There were no
records indicating a veterinarian had been consulted about this animal.





The male bobcat named Paul appeared thin and lethargic. He has noticeably lost weight since he was observed on May
18, 2021. There were no records indicating that he has been seen by a veterinarian or that the facility representative
noticed there was a problem.

Failure to provide adequate medical care can result in health issues that cause ongoing pain and suffering. The facility
representative must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary approved nutritional and medical care at all times
as directed by a veterinarian which includes appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and
injuries.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Three sheep, 1 goat, and 1 alpaca documented on the inventory at the previous inspection were not on the premises at
the time of this inspection. According to the facility representative, they were sold to a local farmer. There are no
disposition records available for these 5 animals.
At the time of this inspection the facility had 2 baby white racoons. There were no acquisition records for these baby
racoons indicating whether they were born on the premises or acquired somewhere else.
Missing acquisition and disposition records documented on previous inspection reports continue to be unavailable for
review.
Acquisition and disposition records, including for domestic farm type animals, are necessary to be able to accurately track
animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, and humane transportation.



Animals transferred to or acquired from other licensees must have disposition and acquisition records containing all
information required by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations available for inspection. This requirement applies to all
regulated animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased or otherwise in possession of or under control of
the licensee, and all regulated animals transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.
The record shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The environmental enhancement plan that was provided during the inspection has not been approved by an attending
veterinarian as there is no attending veterinarian for the facility. An inadequate plan of enrichment for nonhuman primates
can result in animals with high levels of stress and/or boredom that affects both their health and behavior. The facility
representative must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for the environmental enhancement adequate to
promote the physiological wellbeing of nonhuman primates. The Nonhuman Primate Enrichment plan must be in
accordance with professionally accepted standards and directed by the attending veterinarian.
3.82(a)

Feeding.
The food receptacle for both macaques contained what appeared to be dog kibble. The kibble was contaminated with
many flies. The facility representative stated that they were out of “monkey biscuits” but that they had been ordered. Dog
food is not an appropriate diet for nonhuman primates. The presence of flies indicate contamination and decreases
palatability. The facility must ensure that diet for the nonhuman primates be appropriate for the species and be clean,
wholesome, and palatable to the animals. To be corrected by: June 11, 2021
3.83

Watering.


Potable water must be provided in sufficient quantity to every non-human primate housed at the facility.
The water bottle provided to the bush baby was empty at the start of the inspection. When filled, the bush baby drank
immediately and eagerly for at least 30 seconds.
The water bottle for one of the marmosets was empty at the time of this inspection.
The water available for one of the macaques did not appear to have been cleaned recently. It was a dirty brown color
with pieces of orange peel floating in it.
Lack of potable water can result in dehydration and exacerbation of other medical problems. The facility must ensure that
potable water be accessible to the animals as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals and that all
water receptacles be kept clean and sanitary.

3.84(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The outside yards of both macaque enclosures needed to be cleaned. Old produce on the ground and in the food
containers appeared to have been there for several days. The old food was covered in flies.

Enclosures with dirt floors must be spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid
contact with excreta, or as often as necessary to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors. The excessive
number of flies covering the old produce indicates that the enclosures are not being cleaned as often as necessary. To be
corrected by: June 11, 2021
3.84(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


There is a bucket with old trash and very dirty water sitting right outside the macaque outdoor cages. This is an attractant
for flies, mosquitos, and other pests as well as a breeding ground for bacteria and disease. The facility must ensure that
buildings and grounds where housing facilities are located are kept clean so as to facilitate husbandry practices and to
reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents, pests and vermin.
To be corrected by: June 11, 2021
3.84(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Excessive flies were seen in and around the macaque enclosures. The pest control plan in place is to use bags of water
hung in the areas of the animals to control the flies. This is a non-traditional plan and as of the time of inspection, does not
appear to be effective. Flies provide an annoyance to the animals and can cause skin lesions. The facility must ensure
that a safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, avian, and mammalian pest is established and
maintained.

Facilities, general.
The dirt under the shelter structure in the fisher enclosure has been dug out, exposing a metal grate. There is a gap
between the metal grate and the dirt below and the fisher must sit on the metal grate in order to use the shelter. The gaps
in the metal grate could cause entrapment or injury to the animal.

There were nine adult raccoons on the last inspection inventory. During this inspection, there were five adult raccoons
observed (plus 2 new baby racoons). When asked about the difference in numbers on the inventory, the facility
representative stated that they have had to reinforce the enclosure walls due to raccoon escape. Animals that escape


their enclosures are no longer protected and cannot be cared for.

The porcupine pair have been chewing on the plywood floor of their enclosure and the plastic of their house. Neither of
these is appropriate for a porcupine to be chewing and ingesting. These materials can cause intestinal impactions or
other health concerns.

The facility representative must ensure all housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.129(a) Repeat

Feeding.
There was a limited amount of fresh produce and no food appropriate for the non-domestic cats on the premises at the
time of this inspection. There was dry bear, cat, and dog kibble. The facility representative stated that they planned to buy
fresh food later that day and that the day of the inspection was a “fasting day” for the non-domestic cats.

This is concerning considering the progressively decreasing body conditions seen in the bobcats, wolves, foxes, and the
Canadian Lynx. The facility must ensure that food be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient
quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The diet must be prepared with consideration for the
age, species, condition, size, and type of animal.
3.130

Watering.
The water tank for the camel contains brown water. The water is dirty enough that the bottom of the tank cannot be
evaluated for sanitation.



Lack of potable water can result in dehydration and exacerbation of other medical problems. The facility must ensure that
potable water be accessible to the animals as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals and that all
water receptacles be kept clean and sanitary.
To be corrected by: June 11, 2021
3.131 Repeat

Sanitation.
Excessive flies were seen throughout the facility, both on the animals and in the environment. Animals were seen
“flicking” their ears and heads in an effort to remove the flies. The pest control plan in place is to use bags of water hung
in the areas of the animals to control the flies. This is a non-traditional plan and as of the time of inspection, does not
appear to be effective. Flies provide an annoyance to the animals and can cause skin lesions and tissue damage. The
facility must ensure that a safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian
pest is established and maintained.
To be corrected by: Close of business on delivery day.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
There is discarded animal food and other trash on the property and around the animal areas. Some of the discarded food
has been swept out of the animal enclosures and has been left near the animal areas. This is providing an environment
that encourages the proliferation of flies. Flies are an annoyance to the animals and can cause skin lesions and tissue
damage. The facility must ensure that all buildings and grounds are kept clean to facilitate good husbandry practices and
to protect the health of the animals.
To be corrected by: Close of business on delivery day.
