2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
The pigs are currently housed on flooring that is not suitable for them. The flooring is a raised plastic platform that
is very smooth. The pigs are Yucatan so there is additional skin care provided. The oils applied twice a week add to
the floor being slippery. I observed two of the pigs feet slide a little while walking, they appeared hesitant in their
movement. The surface of the flooring does not allow for the pigs feet to get a grip while walking which can result in
injury. In addition, the platforms were observed bending under the pig's feet which also interfered with the pig's
ability to ambulate properly. Records indicate that this problem was identified in July 2015, but it has not yet been
corrected.
Appropriate housing conditions shall be provided for the species housed in the enclosure.
The transport cage used to transport the pigs to the main center is broken on the bottom left corner. The plastic has
left cracks large enough to easily allow an animals leg to break through which may cause injury. The crate shall be
removed or replaced to prevent injury.
Correct by October 31, 2015.
