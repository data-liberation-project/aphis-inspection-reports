2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The Program Of Veterinary care does not include all species that are housed at the facility. The document needs to

Attending Veterinarian is providing veterinary care for these animals.

2.35(a)(1)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
The most recent IACUC meeting minutes could not be located during the USDA inspection. The IACUC had a
meeting in 2016, however the most recent documentation that could be located was pertaining to IACUC meetings
that were held in 2015. The facility needs to maintain adequate IACUC documentation. The documentation was
located after the USDA inspector had left the facility.
