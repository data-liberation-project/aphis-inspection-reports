Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
***One adult female Nubian ibex is observed to be non-weight bearing on her left front leg. The animal is reluctant to
move; when standing she touches her left forefoot on the ground or raises it outward in front of her. When walking, she
carries that leg out in front and the gait is affected as she heaves her left forequarter forward. Lameness can be caused
by a variety of problems including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and
affect the health and well-being of the animal.

The veterinarian evaluated the animal on Aug 27, 2021. She prescribed meloxicam daily for two weeks. She advised the
licensee to come to her clinic to discuss weights of the animal so that the correct dose could be prescribed. The licensee
picked up the medications on September 2, 2021; however, as of September 3, 2021, the licensee has not begun
administration and is therefore not following the veterinarian’s recommendation. The licensee needs to begin
administration of the medications as prescribed by the veterinarian.

***Three adult female and two adult male white-tailed deer were observed to be thin to emaciated, with protruding hip
bones, spine, and ribs. The bones of their spines, hips, and long bones were visible, and each rib was easily seen by both


APHIS inspectors upon inspection. They have rough, unthrifty hair coats and overgrown hooves that are affecting the
angle of their feet.

The veterinarian evaluated these animals on Aug 27, 2021. She recommended increasing protein and fat in their diets,
deworming with ivermectin, and contacting a farrier to address the hoof problems. As of September 3, 2021, the
deworming has been started, but a farrier has not been contacted about the feet problems. The licensee has not followed
the veterinarian’s recommendations. Failure to begin all the veterinarian's directions delays the treatment, prolongs
medical issues, and can lead to worsened condition of the animals. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause
gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries.

*** At least five adult Nubian Ibex have overgrown hooves affecting the angles of their feet due to a lack of hoof trimming
and inappropriate substrate.

The veterinarian evaluated these animals on Aug 27, 2021. She recommended contacting a farrier to address the hoof
problems. A farrier has not been contacted, therefore the licensee has not followed the veterinarian’s recommendation.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries. The licensee
needs to follow the veterinarian’s recommendation.

***There is an oryx that has a dark, spherical growth on its brisket area measuring ~5-6” in diameter. The veterinarian
recommended this animal be started on meloxicam and antibiotics. She advised the licensee to come to her clinic to
discuss weights of the animal so that the correct doses could be prescribed. The licensee picked up the medications on


September 2, 2021; however, as of September 3, 2021, the licensee has not yet started administering it, therefore the
licensee has not followed the veterinarian’s recommendation. The licensee needs to administer the medication as
prescribed by the veterinarian.
3.80(a)(2)(iii) Critical Repeat

Primary enclosures.
In the lemur barn, there are two juvenile lemurs that are seen leaving and entering the cage of the parents by squeezing
through the metal squares of the enclosure fencing which are 2X4”. This gives the animals free roam of the barn, other
lemur enclosures, and potentially the outside areas of the facility through windows and doors opened in the barn to
facilitate ventilation.

Primary enclosures that do not contain the animals can facilitate escape and/or injury. Primary enclosures must be
constructed and maintained so that they contain the non-human primates securely.
3.85 Direct Repeat

Employees.
The facility owner states that he has insufficient staff to provide adequate cleaning, feeding, general husbandry and facility
maintenance for all of the non-human primates and other animals. This is evident throughout the facility, as noted in
numerous places throughout this report.
Without an adequate labor force, animals and facilities cannot be properly managed, leading to circumstances that
compromise the health and well-being of the animals.

Every person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations maintaining non-human primates must have enough employees to


carry out the required level of husbandry practices and care. The licensee must acquire sufficient help to manage the
animals and facilities according to the Animal Welfare regulations.
3.129 Repeat

Feeding.
In a sheltered food storage area, there is a wheeled bin containing a mixture of sweet feed and dried corn that is
uncovered, with flies seen in the food. The facility owner states that this feed is used for some of the USDA-regulated
species at the facility. Uncovered feed can become contaminated and/or lose nutrient value, leading to animal illness.

Food must be wholesome, palatable and free from contamination and of sufficient nutritive value to maintain all animals in
good health; adequate measures must be taken to prevent molding, contamination and deterioration of food.
3.132 Direct Repeat

Employees.
At the time of inspection, the facility owner states that he does not have sufficient help to facilitate adequate animal care
and husbandry, cleaning and maintenance of facilities. This is evident in numerous areas of the facility, as noted
throughout this report. Without an adequate labor force, animals and facilities cannot be properly managed, leading to
circumstances that compromise the health and well-being of the animals.

A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of
husbandry practices set forth in the regulations.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
