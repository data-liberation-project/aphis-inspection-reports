SANITATION.
***The rabbit enclosure toward the front entrance housing the single rabbit is constructed of wood and wire. The
enclosure has several days of excreta build up on the wire toward the corners and along the wood ledges. The
wood is splintering and appears to be saturated and stained with excreta. Wood that is not impervious to moisture
cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized allowing the growth of bacteria and other disease hazards that may
cause illness. The enclosure shall be cleaned and the damaged wood repaired or replaced. Correct by November
22, 2017.
***The large rabbit enclosure under the tree has not been cleaned recently allowing the excreta to accumulate in
excess on the floor. The excreta that was washed out of the enclosure in the past was not removed and has
accumulated behind and beneath the enclosure. Excessive accumulations of excreta attracts insects that may
cause discomfort and allow contamination of the food. The accumulations also allow the rabbits to become soiled or
contaminated which may lead to illness. The enclosure shall be cleaned at a frequency that will prevent
accumulations minimizing the risk of contamination of the rabbits. Correct by November 22, 2017.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The squirrel monkey enclosure, similar to a large bird cage, has a build up of a substance on all surfaces that
appears to be fly strike. Insects can transmit various types of diseases and cause contamination of surfaces and
food. I was able to scrape some of the material off with my finger. The owner stated that the squirrel monkey has
only been housed in the enclosure for 2 days. The excess amount of fly strike covering the cage appears to have
accumulated over a longer period of time indicating the enclosure was not completely cleaned and sanitized prior to
placing the squirrel monkey in it. The squirrel monkey is a scent marking animal which can cause some buildup of
material on surfaces but the majority of the material present on the surface of the cage does not appear to be from
the squirrel monkey. Introducing a new animal to an enclosure that has not been thoroughly cleaned and sanitized
increase the risk of exposure to possible disease hazard and contamination. The enclosure shall be cleaned and
sanitized to provide for the health and well being of the squirrel monkey. Correct by November 30, 2017.3.131(a)
SANITATION.
***The porcupine enclosure has an excessive accumulation of feces and excreta some of which is dried indicating it
is older and some more recent. There is excreta accumulating in the house provided for the porcupine as well. The
porcupine cannot utilize the house without laying on or coming in contact with the excreta. Excess accumulations of
excreta increase the risk of disease hazard and contamination. The house and enclosure shall be cleaned at a
frequency that will minimize the potential for the porcupines to come in contact with and become contaminated by
the excreta. Correct by November 22, 2017.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***The small mammal building has windows and doors that do not seal properly and gaps surrounding the wall unit
air conditioner. These openings allow the easy access of insects to the building. The room has numerous live and
dead insects accumulated in the light shields, on the walls, fly strike on the walls, cobwebs and spider webs
containing live spiders and numerous living insects. There is waste material (bedding, food, etc) on the floor and
under the enclosures. There is a large amount of hair stuck to the small mammal enclosures. The room and
enclosures shall be cleaned and maintained in a manner that will decrease the odors, minimize the presence of the
insects and provide for the comfort of the animals housed within. Correct by November 30, 2017.
