FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The temperature at the time of inspection was 21 deg. F. Two cavy live in a stall like enclosure under a three sided
barn like structure (three walls and roof). One long side of the structure is completely open to the elements. There
are two heat lamps present in one corner of the enclosure. Both cavy were noted going to sit underneath the heat
lamps during the inspection. One of the cavy was noted exhibiting occasional shivering of the hindquarters. There is
no shelter type structure or natural shelter in the enclosure where the cavy can go to escape the cold wind and cold
drafts and to protect them from the discomfort of the cold. Although the heat lamps do provide some warmth, the
cavy also need a warm shelter structure (natural or manmade) for protection from the cold. Correct by 1/20/16.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
