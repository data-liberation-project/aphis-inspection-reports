2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility did not have a written program of veterinary care for dogs at the time of the inspection.
A written program of veterinary care is required for each species housed at the facility. A written program of
veterinary care is necessary to convey the attending veterinarian's expectations for routine preventative medical
care and euthanasia for animals housed at the facility. The lack of a written program may result in inadequate or
inappropriate animal care and thus be detrimental to the health of the animals. The licensee should ensure that a
program of veterinary care is in place for each regulated species housed at the facility and that the document
contains sufficient detail so that they may follow the attending veterinarian's recommendations.

2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Appropriate methods had not been used to treat three sick and/or injured pigs observed at the facility. An expired
injectable antibiotic had been used to treat two of the pigs (#88928 and #88925) prior to the inspection. The
expiration date on the label of a bottle of injectable corticosteroid that was also used to treat the pigs had been
covered by a veterinary label making it impossible to determine the expiration date on this bottle. According to an
employee, treatment had been completed and the lameness exhibited by pig #88928 had not improved. An
employee also stated that pain medications had never been given to the lame pig.
A third pig (#90933) was found recumbent by facility employees at approximately 8:30 the morning of the inspection
and was recumbent and vocalizing at the time of the inspection. Several scratches were apparent on thehindquarters and a substantial amount of fecal material was also adhered to the animal's skin. According to an
employee the attending veterinarian had been called after the animal was found but had not called back regarding
treatment as of approximately 11:00 hours. The animal was isolated but had received no treatment. There were no
treatment records for any of the animals nor was there any record the attending veterinarian had been contacted for
any of the three animals. All three pigs were found in concrete stalls with no bedding.
Expired medications may not be effective and should not be used on regulated animals. Documentation of
communications with the veterinarian and animal treatments facilitates ongoing animal care and demonstrates that
the animals are receiving appropriate treatment of injuries and diseases. Housing seriously sick or injured animals
on bare concrete may exacerbate their condition and thus the pain and distress felt by those animals. The facility
should ensure that appropriate methods are used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
Correct by 17:00 hours for the above animals and from this time forward for all other veterinary care issues.
3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The bottom rails and metal mesh flooring of the dog enclosures were rusted.
Rusted metal prevents required cleaning and sanitation and may affect the structural strength of the surface. The
facility should ensure that surfaces with excessive rust are repaired or replaced in a timely manner.

3.8

The facility should develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for
exercise. The plan should be approved by the attending veterinarian.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
An excessive amount of feces were observed under the dog enclosures and fecal material was smeared on the
flooring of the enclosures. According to employees at the facility the enclosures were cleaned every other day, were
last cleaned on the previous Sunday, and were due to be cleaned the day of the inspection. The enclosures had not
been cleaned as of approximately 12:00 hours on the day of the inspection.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily, and from under primary enclosures as
often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the animals,
and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
Correct from this time forward.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
An excessive amount of excreta was present in the back portion of the pig primary enclosures. The trough-like area
at the back of the enclosures contained a black liquid mixture of excrement and water and was adjacent to the
spigots used by the pigs to obtain water. Pigs were observed drinking while standing in the liquid. Several animals
were observed to have large areas of feces adhered their skin, including one animal that was found recumbent and
sick the morning of the inspection. According to an employee the animal had been found recumbent in the trough.
An employee also stated that the enclosures were cleaned every other day.
Exposure to excessive amounts of excreta may negatively impact animal health. The facility should remove excreta
as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
Correct from this time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility manager.
