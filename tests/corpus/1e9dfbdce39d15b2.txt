3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The following structural items were noted during the inspection:
1) African crested porcupine enclosure: At the back of the enclosure, there is an area in which the dirt had been dug up
exposing the buried wire panel with 2x3 opening.
2) A section of fencing near the water troughs (closest to red barn) is detached from the support pole and held together


with rope. The bottom of the fence is bent inward leaving a gap and exposing sharp points.
3) The green shelter back panel (left corner) panel is detached. The front corner at the bottom of the back panel on the
left side of the shelter is detached. Three nilgai are present in the shelter at the time of inspection.

Failure to maintain enclosures and structures in good repair can lead to animal injury and escapes. The above items must
be repaired or replaced in manner that ensures structural strength and is appropriate for the animals contained within the
enclosure.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
The following housekeeping issues were noted within the enclosures or on the premises during the inspection:
1) Bale twine and bale wrap is scattered throughout the large front and adjacent property field. (Removed at the time of
inspection.)
2) Metal equipment rough or sharp points/edges, rusty equipment, old damaged gates, junk on a flatbed, a ladder, and
building materials are scattered in the large open field in which llamas, sheep, and pigs roam.
3) A stall door (moved out of the way at the time of inspection), an axe, plastic dog with roof detached, and a rodent trap
are in the walkway of the main red barn that serves as one of the shelters for the animals.
4) There is a wire panel with large openings in the enclosure for the African crested porcupine. (removed at the time of
inspection)

Leaving hazardous items in enclosures can lead to animal injury and illnesses. Grounds should be kept in such a manner
that protects the animals from injury. Accumulated trash, unnecessary equipment and other items must be removed from
the enclosures and kept in designated areas away from the animals for their health and safety.


3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
There is an eight-foot enclosure fence around the perimeter of the pastures that houses Asiatic water buffalo, zebras,
camels, nilgai, eland wildebeest, long horn, and highland cattle, and other domestic species. Electric wire is place on the
fencing along the road and the right side of the driveway. There is no perimeter fence 3 feet from the primary enclosure /
pasture fences. The gate at the driveway entrance, which is part of the perimeter fence, is only 5 feet and has spacing
between rungs that are large enough for a person and unwanted animals to pass through.

There is no fence but an area of trees along the left side of the driveway leading up to the house. There is no continuous
fence from the gate to the tree line on the left side of the driveway. Domestic hoof stock are allowed to roam in the area
along the left side of the driveway. The pasture where the domestic animals roam has a 4 foot fence.
The pasture fence also serves as the perimeter fence.

The current perimeter enclosure fence would allow the public to easily come in contact with the animals from the road and
driveway entrance. A perimeter fence, at least 3 feet from the property perimeter fence, is required for non-dangerous
wild and a exotic hoof stock if additional security measures are not in place to prevent the public from having direct
contact with the animals.

A six foot perimeter fence, 3 feet from the property enclosure fence, must be constructed at the entrance and along the
left side of the driveway to prevent unwanted animals and people from accessing the property and having direct contact
with the animals. Correct by October 31, 2021.



NOTE: Discussed variance requirements with the owner.
3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
At the time of inspection, the ground was saturated from a recent snow and ice melt. The area around the green shelter
was extremely muddy and a large area of standing water is present directly left of the shelter. Three nilgai are in the
shelter at the time of inspection. The animals can only access the shelter by walking through the the excessively muddy
area. Methods must be in place to rapidly remove water from enclosures to prevent disease hazards and for the safety of
the animals. A method to effectively remove water away from the shelter must be implement to ensure animals are not
subjected to muddy conditions that may affect their health. Correct by February 28, 2021.
