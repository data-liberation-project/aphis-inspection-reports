HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Upon my arrival at the auction site at 11:30 a rhesus macaque was in a kennel cab type carrier sitting on the auction
room floor where all members of the public were walking by and looking at the animals. Everyone who walked past
to go see the other animals in the barn area walked past this enclosure. There was a sign on the enclosure to keep
hands out, but the enclosure would have allowed people to stick their fingers in or the macaque to stick its fingers
out. Anyone could have put their face directly in front of the macaques face. All macaques are potential carriers
of Herpes B which is usually fatal in humans, and has been transmitted from macaque bodily fluids into a human
through eye tissue. Placing the macaque in a small area with potentially direct contact with the public caused risk to
the public and the animal. During public exhibition such as occurs during an exotic animal auction, there must be
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public to assure the safety of animals
and the public. The macaque was moved to an off exhibit location. To be corrected at future exotic animal
auctions.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE RABBITS.
Four rabbits in three cages were at the action wrapped in chicken wire baskets for enclosures. The wire made a
cylinder and was clipped shut at both ends. All enclosures used to transport rabbits must be of sufficient structural
strength to withstand the normal rigors of transportation. Chicken wire which offers no structural strength for
protection of the rabbits in transport and on location is not adequate. During the inspection the rabbits were placed
in wooden crates which although stronger than the chicken wire cage, still do not meet all the transport enclosure
requirements. In the future all rabbits brought to the auction to be sold are to be in primary enclosures which meet
the requirements stated in 3.61. To be corrected at future exotic animal auctions.
3.61(a)(5)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE RABBITS.
Many of the rabbits brought to the exotic animal auction are in wooden vegetable crates with slat sides and 1 inch
holes in the end boards. These crates have a built in rim (also used as handholds) on the two ends, but there areno projecting rims or other devices on the two sides of the outside walls with ventilation openings. Projecting rims
or some devices are required on rabbit transport enclosures to prevent obstruction of all of the ventilation openings
and to provide a minimum air circulation space of 0.75 inches between the primary enclosure and any adjacent
cargo or conveyance wall. Owner states they never place the enclosures to where the side openings are blocked.
To be corrected at future exotic animal auctions.
3.61(c)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE RABBITS.
During this inspection four rabbits were in three chicken wire enclosures which were so small the animals could only
crouch and not move. Primary enclosures used to transport rabbits shall be large enough to ensure that each rabbit
contained therein has sufficient space to turn about freely and to make normal postural adjustments. This includes
the ability to stand up on haunches without the ears touching. If multiple rabbits are contained in one enclosure it
should be large enough for all rabbits to move about freely. To be corrected at future exotic animal auctions.
3.87(a)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT NONHUMAN PRIMATES.
A rhesus macaque was presented for sale at the auction and was contained in a large dog kennel cab. The one
inch square openings of the side ventilations and the front door would allow this non-human primate to stick its
fingers out and potentially touch or scratch people. These openings needed to be covered with something which
would not allow any part of the animal to go outside of the enclosure. To be corrected with any future non-human
primate cages at the exotic animal auction.
