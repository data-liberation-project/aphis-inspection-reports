ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1300 on
06-Jul-18.
Arrived at facility and left a message on the contact phone number. Spoke with a ranch employee who let me know
that the facility owners were out of town and the exotics caretaker was not on the premise at that time. After the
attempted inspection, spoke with the facility representative and explained the attempted inspection report and
discussed optimal hours for inspection.
