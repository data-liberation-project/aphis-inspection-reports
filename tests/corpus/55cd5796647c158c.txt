Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30 AM on 26-
JAN-22.

The inspector arrived at 10:30 AM on 1/26/22 to conduct an inspection. The inspector contacted the Licensee by phone
and learned that they were out of town until next week. An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because
there was no other authorized facility representative available to accompany the inspector.

Unannounced inspections are used to evaluate compliance with the AWA Regulations and Standards. This is the FIRST
attempted inspection of the Licensee.
