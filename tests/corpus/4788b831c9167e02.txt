3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the time of inspection a gate in the perimeter fence that leads to the veterinary hospital and the expansion
construction zone was found left open and unattended. Another automatic gate further up this road was not
functioning properly, and remained open after a vehicle passed through. There were several gaps or openings
under the perimeter fence or its gates that measured up to eight inches.
The fence should prevent people and animals from passing under or through the fence, as well as providing
secondary containment in the event of an animal escape from its primary enclosure. The fence should consistently
meet the standards on both the inside and outside of the fence. Gates in the fence should remain closed if
unattended. The fence should be maintained in good repair so that it consistently meets the standards described
here. Failure to meet these standards could endanger the health and well-being of the animals in the facility.
This inspection was conducted on 9/12/17 and 9/13/17. An exit interview was conducted on 9/13/17 with the zoo
directors.
