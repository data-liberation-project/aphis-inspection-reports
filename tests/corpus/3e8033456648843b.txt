3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
****Two enclosures one containing two macaques and a baboon and the other containing two chimpanzees had
food waste that had accumulated on the feeding boards. The licensee stated that the waste had not been pick-up
for 3 days. The waste appeared to have a white-gray moldy appearance. Failure to pickup food waste can attract
flies, pest and vermin. The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in
contact with are spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.84 to prevent disease hazards.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee by Gwen Maginnis (Nonhuman Prirmate Specialist), Curt
McGruder (ACI) and Bill Heine (ACI)
