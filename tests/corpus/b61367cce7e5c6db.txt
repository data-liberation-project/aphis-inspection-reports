ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was no Program of Veterinary Care available to show a new attending veterinarian was obtained to provide
adequate vet for the 55 dogs at this facility. The current written Program of Veterinary Care provided stated the
attending veterinarian's last visit was on March 2016. As of December 2016, the attending veterinarian and animal
hospital listed on the written Program of Veterinary Care is not longer the attending veterinarian. The licensee
stated he obtained several veterinarians at his Miami sites, but having difficulties finding an attending veterinarian at
this site. Each dealer shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time
attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer. This non compliance was cited during
the last inspection on February 7, 2017.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are expired medications and supplements stored at this kennel. Expired drugs may lose their potency with
age and its effectiveness which could place these dogs in unhealthy situations if used. Furthermore, medications in
the liquid dosage form can actually increase in strength past the printed expiration date. Outdated eye and ear
drops may no longer be sterile and could possibly lead to an infection or irritation. Some expired medications like
antibiotics can become dangerous. For the health and welfare of these 55 dogs housed at this kennel, expired
drugs should not be used and discarded unless there is an approval from an attending veterinarian. It is not known
what supplements and medications are currently being provided to the dogs at this kennel and if they were
approved by a veterinarian. This needs to be addressed when obtaining an attending veterinarian at this facility.

1) The single housed adult female Bull Terrier is exhibiting abnormal repetitive (stereotypic) behavior.
During the inspection on June 28, 2017, & June 29, 2017, this dog was observed spinning in circles repeatedly in a
fast motion. The care takers were unaware of what care this dog has received from the last inspection. The care
takers stated during the previous inspections this dog was not able to exercise with other dogs due to its aggression
with other dogs. The licensee stated during the last inspection that he would place this dog in a new home. The
licensee now states this dog will be housed in a larger area of the kennel for more room and exercise, however
there is concern that she will have access to other dogs at the kennels. The licensee stated that this dog was seen
by a veterinarian and just does this when he is approached, however there is no written documentation or treatment
plan to address this issue available during this inspection.
This Bull Terrier needs to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian for diagnosis, the cause of this behavior and
development of an appropriate treatment plan to address this issue. There needs to be written documentation by
the Attending Veterinarian, recommendations regarding kennel space, exercise, enrichment and any other steps
necessary to address this abnormality. This shall be maintained by the licensee for review by APHIS Officials.
Additionally, the licensee shall maintain documentation of the implementation of these recommendations for reviewduring inspections. This non compliance was cited during the February 7, 2017 inspection.
2) During the February 7, 2017, inspection the adult female English Bulldog named Elizabeth (microchip
#900085000072610) had an injury she received about two weeks prior by going under some damaged fencing with
sharp edges. The wound was approximately 1/2'' deep and 3’' to 4'' long and an inch wide is located at the left front
rib area behind her shoulder appears to be healed. The wound now appears to be healed, however there was no
written documentation available to show this dog was seen by the attending veterinarian as cited during the
February 7, 2017, inspection.
3) During this inspection on June 28, 2017, and June 29, 2017, the adult French Bulldog named Madonna
(microchip #9000085000072632) and an adult female French Bulldog name Rima had an an occurrence of diarrhea
in their enclosures. Madonna was observed thin, dull coat, and ribs visible showing. The care takers were asked by
VMO Mario Mercado how long they had diarrhea and they stated about 2 weeks off and on. The care takers stated
they normally just feed and clean the kennel, medical issues are cared for by the licensees spouse. The caretakers
stated they told the licensee about the diarrhea and the licensee's spouse who usually visits on the weekends
treated these dogs. The licensee confirmed his wife was treating the dogs.. The written documentation provided
after the inspection show on March 17, 2017, Madonna was administered ivermectin each month but no day and
dosage listed and pyrantel with no dosage listed. Ivermectin tubes of 1.87% paste for Horses with an expiration
date of November 2015, and multiple brands of anti parasite medications were available, several expired during the
inspection. The licensee stated all the dogs were given pyrantel dewormer around the same date in March 2017.
The licensee was unaware of what ivermectin was provided monthly for all the dogs and no receipt purchasing
ivermectin was available. Expired ivermectin may not prevent these dogs from acquiring heart worm and if left
untreated can be fatal.
To ensure the health and welfare of these dogs at this kennel they need to be seen by a licensed veterinarian.
This facility has not provided adequate veterinary care for its dogs under this section 2.40(b)(2) during previous
inspections on 11/24/14, 7/16/15, and 2/7/17. There must be adequate veterinary care program establish and
maintained, including the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries,
and the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care; That the mechanism of direct and frequent
communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.3.2(a)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
On June 28, 2017, at 11:00 am, the indoor kennel was not being sufficiently cooled to protect the dogs from high
temperatures and humidity for their health and well being. The ambient temperature in the indoor kennel was 99.6
F, with high humidity level of 70%. Most all of the dogs during this inspection were panting, some heavier than
others. The kennels sliding door had only been open approximately 15 minutes prior as I was waiting to be let into
the facility.
During the inspection on June 29, 2017, at 1230 pm, the ambient temperature was from 98.7 F and 99.6, with a
high humidity level of 75%. Again most the dogs were panting some heavier than others. The adult female English
Bulldog Elizabeth (#9000850000072610) was panting laying down in the kennel with foam around her mouth and on
the floor from heavy salivation. The care takers were cleaning the enclosures using a pressure washer and the
sliding door and several windows were open. VMO Mario Mercado asked the care takers why the kennel was hot
and when the air is in use. The care takers stated that the doors and windows are open for several hours when they
are cleaning and at night only fans are used. Ambient temperatures outdoors during these summer months in this
area can reach over 120 F in the day and over 100 F at night. Although ambient temperatures must not rise about
85 (deg) F for over 4 hours, French and English Bulldogs in general, especially pregnant bitches and older dog may
need lower temperatures to keep cool and comfortable. The licensee stated that the air conditioning broke down
during the inspections and had since been fixed. I received photos from the licensee of two window air
conditioners and a dehumidifier he purchased for future emergency situations.
Indoor housing facilities for dogs must be sufficiently cooled when necessary to protect the dogs from temperature
or humidity extremes and to provide for their health and well-being. The ambient temperature must not must not
rise above 85 [deg]F for more than 4 consecutive hours when dogs are present. 'TO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The new resting wood platforms are not impervious to moisture. Several of them have been chewed and remain
stained from the excreta. Discussed using impervious material which could also comfort to these dogs living on
this hard wood and concrete. Surfaces in contact with the animals, must be impervious to moisture to prevent them
from being soiled from excreta.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: JULY 19, 2017.
3.9(a)
FEEDING.
During this inspection on June 28, 2017, and June 29, 2017, nearly all enclosures at this kennel had at from 3 to 5
occurrences or more of soft piles of stool. There are many dogs at this kennel appear to be slightly thin with dry and
dull coats and some were observed scratching. The soft stool and diet was discussed with the licensees during the
previous inspection and the licensee has changed the dog food. There was a supplement called Breeding Heat for
breeding bitches, expired Vitamin B Complex, expired multi vitamin Calysn Vitaminizado, and other supplements
that appear to be added to diets. The licensee stated that the previous dog food made the dogs gain weight and
the newer dog food made them lose weight. It is not known what supplements and vitamins these dogs are being
provided, including the quantity and frequency daily. To ensure this diet is of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain the normal condition and weight of the animal and appropriate for the individual animal's age and condition
it needs to be evaluated and approved by a veterinarian and or a nutritionist.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: JULY 14, 2017.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
During this inspection of this kennel on June 28, 2017, and June 29, 2017, there were excessive amounts of
excreta in most of the dog enclosures. There were from 3 to 5 occurrences or more of fecal waste in each
enclosure. I observed numerous dogs many in the smaller top kennels stepping in the excreta and on their wood
platforms. Due to the size of the kennels there needs to be additional cleaning and or bedding to prevent soiling of
the dogs and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pets and odors. The care takers started cleaning the kennel and
opened the front sliding door when I arrived, so I could not determine if there were strong odors as during the
previous inspection. During the inspection on June 29, 2017, the primary enclosures were observed being cleaned with a pressure
washer without the excreta being being completely cleaned first. This method of cleaning spreads excreta particles
throughout the kennel where other dogs could potentially spread infectious bacteria and viruses. When water is
used to clean the primary enclosure, whether by hosing, flushing, or other methods, animals in other primary
enclosures must be protected from being contaminated with water and other wastes during the cleaning by being
removed.
This noncompliance was cited during the February 7, 2017, inspection.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is a rodent bait station located inside an outdoor exercise pen housing a french bulldog which could cause
harm or even death if this dog came in contact with this poison. A safe and effective program to control mammals
that are pests must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals.
TO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY,.
This inspection were conducted with the care takers on June 28, 2017 and June 29, 2017 and VMO Mario Mercado
on June 29, 2017.
Due to the licensee being out of town and not residing at this kennel location the inspection findings were
discussed with this licensee by phone several times after the inspection and exit interview by phone on July 7, 2017.
