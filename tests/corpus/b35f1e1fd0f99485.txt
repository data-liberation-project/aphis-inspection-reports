FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There is a strong odor of ammonia at the far end of the dwarf hamster room this date. The ammonia odor was
strong enough to cause my nose and eyes to burn.High levels of ammonia may also be expected to cause irritation
to the animals housed in this room .Enclosures appear clean so the odor is likely accumulating due to inadequate
ventilation as there is no exhaust fan in this room.Ventilation must be increased in this room to provide a healthy
environment for the animals.
