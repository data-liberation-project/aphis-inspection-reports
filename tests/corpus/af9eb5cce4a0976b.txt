ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Exhibitors with part time attending veterinarians must have a formal arrangement with the veterinarian that includes
a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) and regularly scheduled visits to the premises. The written PVC needs
to be available for review during USDA inspections. The employee that accompanied me on this inspection did not
have access to the PVC. I requested he have the owner call me or email me the PVC. Neither of these occurred.
This facility needs to have a Program of Veterinary Care available for review during USDA inspection.

The small animal room had several open bags of food lying around with an accumulation of what looked like fruit
flies hovering around the bags. Food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination. All animal food
must be stored in containers with lids that protect the food from contamination.

SANITATION.
The small animal room was in need of a good cleaning. Buildings and grounds shall be kept clean and in good
repair in order to facilitate adequate animal husbandry. The small animal room had grain and seeds all over the
floor, excessive clutter, and open containers of food lying around. This type of situation is conducive to insects and
rodents which may carry disease and contaminate food. This room needs to be cleaned and maintained in a more
sanitary condition.

SANITATION.
The opossum enclosure had an excessive accumulation of ants on the top lid around the hinges. The small animal
room had an excessive amount of fruit flies hovering around open bags of food and the bottom of some animal
cages. Ants can cause contamination of food and injury to the animal. Fruit flies can cause contamination of food.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects and other pests needs to be established.
