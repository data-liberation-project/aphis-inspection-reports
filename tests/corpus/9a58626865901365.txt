FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The wood climbing structure for the two goats has a horizontal strip of wood
broken into two pieces on the ramp between the first and second platforms. Horizontal strips of wood are attached
to the top surface of the ramps to provide better footing for the goats. Animal enclosures must be structurally sound
and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. When the broken strip of wood on the ramp was
identified by the APHIS official, the ramp was repaired during the inspection. Corrected during the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility partner.
