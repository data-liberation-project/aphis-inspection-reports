FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*One goat housed by itself in a small enclosure was noted to have a splint on its left rear leg. The goat had been
housed in the large goat enclosure that includes the goat walk. Employees found the goat caught with its back foot
stuck in a damaged area of wood on the platform of the goat walk. The vet was called and the leg splinted. The goat
walk platform has been repaired by adding a large solid piece of wood over the individual wood boards. A regular
maintenance program should be instituted to maintain the outdoor housing facilities in good repair to protect the
animals from injury. Indirect.
*A humane trap with cut up vegetables at one end was noted next to the front side of the cavy enclosure. One cavy
was noted running loose in the grass outside of the cavy enclosure near the picnic area at the top of the hill. The
caretaker reported that both young cavy born earlier this year had escaped from the new large cavy enclosure. The
two young cavy had been caught in the old cavy enclosure and moved to the new one. They both got out of the
enclosure somehow. One was trapped and again placed in the large enclosure. It again got out. The caretaker
stated both escaped cavy were seen running around as recently as yesterday. All housing facilities shall be
structurally sound to contain the animals. This is a direct citation.
*New skirting of wire mesh has been added on top of the ground along two sides of the cavy enclosure. The wire
has not been covered with soil or other material and presents a hazard if a cavy were to get a limb caught in the
wire. All outdoor facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and contain the animals. Indirect.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
One enclosure housing two goats is situated on a slightly down sloping hill with the shelter at the lower portion of
the enclosure. It had rained the night before and the morning of the inspection. The entire enclosure including the
ground inside the shelter was noted to be very wet. The shelter structure is situated such that water runs downhill
into it. All other enclosures at the facility had dry shelters. The two goats both have feet and skin problems (hairloss,
areas of pink skin) on their lower legs. They have been under treatment for foot rot and secondary skin infections for
several months. The drainage issue is not only making conditions wet and uncomfortable for the animals but is alsohindering healing of the foot and skin problems. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess
water from the goat shelter and enclosure or the goats need to be moved to a more appropriate enclosure. Correct
by 6/25/14.

SANITATION.
There is an African crested porcupine enclosure which has a white moldy pile of excreta in one corner. The
inspectors noticed a strong odor coming from the African crested porcupine(cid:25)'s enclosure. To prevent disease
hazards excreta should be removed from primary enclosures. It is important to remove excreta as often as
necessary to prevent contamination and to reduce odors. Correct by June 13, 2014.
The previous vet citation 2.40b3 from May 13, 2014 has been corrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with facility representative.
