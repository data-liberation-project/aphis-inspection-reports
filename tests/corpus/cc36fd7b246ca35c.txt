The lack of barriers or safe distances from the animals can cause injury to people and animals. During public
exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so to assure the safety of the
animals and the public.

responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during
periods of public contact.This was a focused inspection of the handling of the animals during public contact.
