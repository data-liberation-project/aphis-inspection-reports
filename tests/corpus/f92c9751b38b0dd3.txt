FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The muntjac enclosure was heavily wooded. A large amount of small as well as large tree branches fell or were
leaning into the enclosure. The fence shared by the muntjac and the ostrich enclosures was leaning into the
muntjac enclosure under the weight of large tree limbs that fell onto it. This excessive amount of fallen tree
branches was damaging the structural integrity of the fence in some areas and presented a risk of injury to the
muntjacs.
On the fence in between the two muntjac enclosures, on the side closest to the ostrich enclosure, there was a
section with a detached bottom. The licensee explained that this opening was created to allow passage between the
two enclosures. A large metal part as well as multiple tree branches were placed there in order to obstruct that
opening and prevent passage. This accumulation was protruding into the space occupied by the muntjacs and
created an injury hazard for the muntjacs
Sharp points protruding into the muntjac primary enclosure could be seen in areas where wire fencing was laid over
the bottom portion of the primary enclosure fence. These may cause injury to the muntjacs contained within.
Excess tree branches must be removed from the primary enclosure in order to prevent injury to the muntjacs and to
prevent damage to the fence. All structures must be repaired or replaced in order to safely contain the animals. An
ongoing plan must be established in order to maintain the muntjac’s primary enclosure in good repair in a manner
that contains and protects the animals from injury.
To be corrected by Feb 7th 2020.
