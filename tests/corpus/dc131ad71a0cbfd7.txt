FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A no longer needed piece of a metal support bar at the front left side of stage next to the small pool is very rusted.
Although the sea lions cannot reach this bar, it is being sprayed by the pool water and can leach rust into the pool.
This bar also cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. It needs to be replaced or removed. To be corrected by
6-3-16.
3.104(d)(3)(1)
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Minimum surface area of a pool of water shall be at least equal to the dry resting or social activity area required. At
the start of this inspection at 3:00 pm all 5 sea lions were still contained in the smaller pool. There are 3 female
California sea lions (average body length 5.7 feet) and 2 female South American Sea Lions (average body length
6.6 feet). This means the total dry resting area needs to be a minimum of 184.59 square feet (6.6 x 6.6 = 43.56 x 2
= 87.12 square feet + 5.7 x 5.7 = 32.49 x 3 = 97.47 square feet). For these animals the pool needs to be at least
184.59 square feet. The small pool measures 22 X 6.5 = 143 square feet. Either fewer animals are to be
maintained in this small pool or while stopped the animals are to have access to the outdoor pool. To be corrected
by 5-25-16.
3.106(a)
WATER QUALITY.
During this inspection at least 3 of the 5 sea lions are exhibiting painful eye conditions. The pools were filled with
municipal city water. The chlorine levels in the water and the methods to correct it, along with the lack of salinity are
contributing to eye issues. The water is not being tested according to the written protocol, and nitrites are not being
tested, as according to their protocol. The monitoring records are not clear in diffentiating if a 2 is 2.0 or 0.2 . The
pH testing device only goes down to 7.0 and this is inadequate to monitor. Primary enclosures shall not contain
water which would be detrimental to the health of the marine mammals contained therein. Better water quality
control testing needs to be done. To be corrected 5-21-16.3.106(c)
WATER QUALITY.
The attending veterinarian has prescribed all of the sea lions have easy access to salt water. This is not being done
and was recorded as 0 during this inspection and at least 3 of the 5 sea lions are exhibiting painful eye conditions.
When salt is used, the salinity of any pool is to be maintained between 15 (cid:19) 36 parts per thousand. To be corrected
by 5-25-16.
3.108(a)
EMPLOYEES OR ATTENDANTS.
Five sea lions are under the care of two caretakers in a travel exhibit. The head keeper has worked with this
company for two years. Due to multiple items cited and noted during this inspection, this keeper does not appear to
have adequate training and knowledge to be the primary caretaker for these animals. Items seen include: serious
eye conditions are not recognized and reported; not recognizing the importance of shade in exhibiting marine
mammals; medical records are incomplete not indicating which eyes are treated when treated; pH monitoring is not
adequate; water treatments are added without using measured amounts and are not documented; and animals are
not released into bigger pools in timely manner. The caretaker does not have a copy of the USDA regulations and
has not read them. Old and newer bite slash wounds were observed on both arms and she stated Poonky will play
attack. During the inspection, the two oldest sea lions went off the stage and onto the grass by the public barrier.
The secondary caretaker needed the primary caretakers help to return them to the stage. All of these items show
the current caretakers have not been adequately trained and supervised to maintain the professionally acceptable
level of husbandry practices required by USDA. These employees need to receive additional training and
supervision. To be corrected by 6-3-16.
3.110(f)
VETERINARY CARE.
The medical records for the 5 sea lions do not show the attending veterinarian visually examined the sea lions at
least semi-annually. There were only reports for an annual physical examination at the first of the years in 2015 and
2016. If these animals were seen by the veterinarian, it needs to be documented. Since several of these sea lions
are exhibiting painful eye conditions, the veterinarian should be regularly consulted about these conditions. This
does not appear to be done. To be corrected by 6-1-16.
This is a partial report of an inspection conducted at the travel location at Heritage Park in Simpsonville, SC.
