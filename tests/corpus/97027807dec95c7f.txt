2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility has been using Iodine 10% solution to treat dogs with certain skin conditions. Two bottles of Iodine 10%
solution were present, one bottle expired January 2018 and the other did not have an expiration date. A bottle of
Safeguard dewormer expired March 2020 and a bottle of Metronidazole 250 mg expired September 2011 were also
found.

Expired medical products may lose their effectiveness and may not assist the animals in recovery from illness and injury
or could leave the animals without proper protection against parasites and other diseases.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and prevent diseases and injuries. The facility
must ensure that all medical products are current and have not expired in order to support the health and well-being of the
dogs.
3.1(b)

Housing facilities, general.
The facility has an assortment of clutter taking up a portion of the food storage area. The clutter consisted of dog kennels,
food bowls, heating boards and assorted plastic items.


Clutter stored in animal areas could accumulate dust and dirt and could attract vermin. Animal and food storage areas
inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter to ensure the animal’s overall health and well-being.

The facility must remove the clutter from the food storage area and must ensure that all housing areas remain free from
clutter at all times.

This was fixed at the time of inspection.
3.6(c)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The facility has one enclosure containing 3 adult Pomeranians with inadequate space. When the 1st adult dog was
measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail, it measured 20.5” and would require a minimum amount of 4.975
sq feet of floor space. When the 2nd adult dog was measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail, it also
measured 20.5” and would require a minimum amount of 4.975 sq feet of floor space. When the 3rd adult dog was
measured from tip of the nose to the base of tail, it measured 22” and would require 5.44 sq feet of floor space. For these
animals to be compatibly group housed in one enclosure, they would require a minimum of 15.39 sq ft of floor space.
When the enclosure was measured, the enclosure measured 60”Lx35”W and was currently only providing the three adult
dogs with 14.58 sq ft of floor space.

The facility has one enclosure containing 4 adult miniature schnauzers with inadequate space. When the 1st adult was
measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail, it measured 22” and would require a minimum amount of 5.44 sq
feet of floor space. When the 2nd adult dog was measured from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail, it measured 23”

and would require a minimum amount of 5.84 sq feet of floor space. When the 3rd adult dog was measured from tip of the
nose to the base of tail, it measured 18” and would require 4.00 sq feet of floor space. When the 4th adult dog was
measured from tip of the nose to the base of tail, it measured 19” and would require 4.34 sq feet of floor space. For these
animals to be compatibly group housed in one enclosure, they would require a minimum of 19.62 sq ft of floor space.
When the enclosure was measured, the enclosure measured 60”Lx33”W and was currently only providing the four adult
dogs with 13.75 sq ft of floor space.

Group housed dogs with an insufficient amount of space can easily become stressed and/or cause erratic or aggressive
behaviors towards one another.

The facility must ensure that all singly housed as well as group housed dogs are provided with a sufficient amount of
space in accordance with this sub part at all times. This applies to all enclosures while being used as a temporary
enclosure or an enclosure being used for long term housing.

The facility moved each group of dogs to larger enclosures at the time of inspection.
3.11(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Rodent droppings were found next to stored bags of dog food inside the food storage area. Other than the mouse poison
block located right next to a large pile of rodent droppings, the facility has no plan to control rodents.

Failure to control pests can cause contamination of food sources and increase the risk of disease hazards towards the
dogs.


An effective program for the control of insects, birds and mammals that are pests, must be established and maintained.
The facility must establish a program for the control rodents and ensure that the plan remains effective at all times.
3.13(a)(1)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care is missing the frequency in which the adult dogs will have the complete physical
examination from head to tail by the attending veterinarian. While the facility knew the dogs must have the exam every 12
months and the exams have been done, it was not documented in writing and approved by the attending veterinarian. The
physical examination is important to help identify dogs that may need veterinary care.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes the frequency of the physical examination from head to tail of the dogs.
The facility must consult with their attending veterinarian and add a schedule for the head to tail physical examination to
the Program of Veterinary Care.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility is missing information on the routine for heartworm testing and fecal sampling. There is no guidance currently
provided in their program of veterinary care for the percentage or total number of dogs to be sampled and the frequency
of which they should be tested for heartworm and intestinal parasites.

Heartworm disease is caused by a parasite that can cause significant damage to the heart before visible symptoms are
seen. Likewise, intestinal parasites can cause chronic disease that can be difficult to detect. Intestinal parasites can also

be spread from mother to puppies. Because of these risks to the health of dogs and puppies, regular testing in necessary
to ensure control and early detection.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian and includes sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests in accordance with
a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian. The facility must consult with their attending veterinarian and add a
schedule for testing for heartworms and intestinal parasites to the Program of Veterinary Care.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
