Feeding.
The metal feeders in all of the enclosures had a build-up of rust coating the outside surface of the feeder.
Rust on surfaces prevents adequate cleaning and sanitizing which can lead to disease spread.
Food receptacles must not contain an excess amount of rust and must be kept clean.

Watering.
There was a buildup of fecal material, debris, and wet greenish material in the waste water piping around the nipples of
the automatic waterers in all of the guinea pig enclosures.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.
