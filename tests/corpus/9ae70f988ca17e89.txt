2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has a procedure for declaw removal written up by his Attending Veterinarian. The procedure requires
the licensee to use hemostats when performing the dewclaw removal. The licensee has been using nail clippers
instead and doesn't have a pair of hemostats on site to perform the procedure as it is written up in the Program of
Veterinary Care. Not following the Program of Veterinary Care doesn't ensure that the dogs are receiving optimal
care. The licensee must consult with the Attending Veterinarian to have the nail clippers added into the Program of
Veterinary Care for the dewclaw removal procedure or he must start using hemostats when performing that
procedure. Correct immediately.
2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Golden Doodle (microchip ID #32002690399) born in 2014 died on 6-13-17. The licensee stated the dog
stopped eating and had loose stool a couple of days before dying. He did not document his observations, did not
provide treatment for the dog, and did not contact the Attending Veterinarian. Not Following the Program of
Veterinary Care or contacting the Attending Veterinarian and treating per his/her instructions when a medical
problem arises doesn't ensure that the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care. The Attending Veterinarian
must be contacted or the licensee must follow the instructions in the Program of Veterinary Care when any dog
exhibits any health issues or concerns. Correct immediately.
3.3(b)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Most of the dogs in the second and third rooms of the sheltered facility were panting pretty heavily. The
temperature was 79 degrees and the windows were open, but there wasn't much air flow going through the kennels.
No fans were being used to assist in the ventilation of the rooms. Despite the temperature being below 85 degrees
in the facility, the dogs appeared to be stressed out by the lack of air flow in the building. If the rooms aren't
properly ventilated on a hot day, it can lead to heat stroke or other medical complications. The licensee must set up
a fan or come up with some system for properly ventilating the kennels. Correct immediately.3.6(a)(2)(iii) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In November 2016, two German Shepherds dug through the sand in the outdoor play yard and were able to escape.
They ran away and killed a farmer's chickens (3 chickens total) six miles from the licensee's house. They were
then captured by the local police department and brought to a humane society where the licensee was able to
reclaim his dogs. A dog that is able to escape from its enclosure and leave the property risks being hit by a car,
exposed to wildlife, or contracting a disease. The licensee must ensure that the enclosures are constructed and
maintained so that the dogs are not able to escape. Correct immediately.
3.7 CRITICAL
COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
A tan male Poodle (ID #265, microchip ID # 0A01616708) was housed in an enclosure (outdoor play yard) with a
male Golden Retriever in January of this year. The two dogs got into a fight and the Poodle broke its jaw. The
licensee brought the dog to his Attending Veterinarian to get the dog treated. The Poodle required surgery and the
lower half of the left side of its jaw had to be removed. Two dogs that aren't compatible can result in a serious injury
like what happened in this situation. It can also in result in one or both of the dogs dying or having to be euthanized
as a result of the fight. The licensee must ensure that all dogs housed together are compatible with each other.
Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
