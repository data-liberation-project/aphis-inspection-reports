2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A male, tan and white Shih Tzu, born 7-July-2007, (ID number 097074063) has severely cloudy eyes. The center
part of both eyes was bluish white. The white of both eyes is mildly reddened. The condition of the eyes can be due
to infections, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful.
* This dog (ID# number 097074063) also has a severe build-up of a thick, yellowish to brownish tarter encasing all
of the upper cheek teeth and about half of the surface of the left canine (carnassial tooth). The majority of the
surfaces of the cheek teeth cannot be visualized due to the excessive build-up of the yellowish to brownish tarter.
The gums above the left canine tooth were dark red. The hair surrounding the mouth is wet due to the dogs
excessive drooling. The buildup of abnormal tater on teeth can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat
normally, and harm the health of the animal.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan concerning the teeth and eyes. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided
to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all
times.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Six enclosures, housing eight adult dogs, had plastic door inserts with plastic sliders fasten to the sides. These
sliders and some of the inserts along the bottom are excessively chewed and scratched. There was an
accumulation of brown grime in these chewed or scratched areas. These chewed or scratched areas prevent
required cleaning and sanitization. This could increase the disease potential for the animals.
For required cleaning and sanitization, all surfaces must be maintained and kept in good repair. Thus, this willdecrease the disease potential for the animals.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Nine enclosures, housing 11 adult dogs, have plastic dog doors with plastic dog inserts. These doors, door inserts
and some of the area around the door inserts had an accumulation of brown grime or debris on their surfaces. This
indicates that daily spot-cleaning is not taking place. As a result, this can increase the disease hazards for the
dogs.
In the prevention of an accumulation of brown grime or debris, all surfaces must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized
as necessary. This will decrease the disease hazards for the animals.
