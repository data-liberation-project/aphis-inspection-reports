INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol involving rabbits and goats did not contain an adequate rationale for the
appropriateness of the species or the numbers of these animals to be used. The protocol stated that two rabbits and
one goat are normally adequate but that in cases of larger needs then more animals may be required; however
there is no quantity or range provided which corresponds to how many more numbers of the animals this would
require. There is not an explanation given to justify the numbers of animals currently being used to make the
procedures valid.
The rationale approved by the IACUC should provide assurances for the appropriateness of the species and that
the appropriate number of animals is being used to obtain the information the activity is designed to provide.
It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that proposals to conduct activities involving animals contain
rationales that explain the appropriateness of the species and the number of animals to be used in those activities.
To be corrected for all future inspections.
2.31(e)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol involving rabbits and goats did not provide a complete description of the method of
euthanasia used. The protocol stated euthanasia would be by intravenous pentobarbital sodium. There is no
documentation of the dosage used for the covered animals (rabbits/goats) or a description of the procedure which is
followed for euthanizing animals. The IACUC should review proposed activities involving animals to ensure there is
a complete description of the method of euthanasia to be utilized that is in accordance with established standard
veterinary practices and regulatory requirements of the act.

To be corrected for all future inspections. 3.51(d)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In the rabbit barn, the majority of rabbit enclosures are moderately covered in rust. There was a section of new
cages and feeders which had replaced older ones. The presence of rust may prevent the required cleaning and
sanitizing of the enclosures, which may adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals.
The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that they are
substantially impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized.

SANITATION.
-Several empty rabbit enclosures had not been cleaned since last occupied by the animals. A large section of
enclosures were heavily covered with dust and cobwebs while others were soiled and contained what appeared to
be dried fecal matter and other mixed food/waste material. These enclosures were located in the same area and
directly adjacent to other rabbits. According to the facility representative, the cages are not cleaned until rabbits are
placed in them.
-Several overhead and ceiling areas of the barn had a moderate buildup of cobwebs with some being located
directly over rabbit cages.
-There was a heavy buildup of fecal matter and other waste material along the walkways between rows of cages,
underneath several of the rabbit cages, and in areas on the ground near the base of large building support beams.
Decomposing organic/waste material may create noxious odors, attract vermin, and potentially create disease
hazards thus adversely impacting the health and well-being of the animals housed nearby. Premises (buildings and
grounds) shall be kept clean in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
A system should be in place to ensure areas surrounding animal housing areas are cleaned as required to protect
the health and well-being of the animals.

SANITATION.
Several flies were observed in the rabbit barn at time of inspection. No functional flytraps or other fly control
products/methods are presently being used. Control of insects and other pests is needed to reduce contamination
and potential disease hazards and to promote the health and well-being of the animals. An effective program of pest
control must be established and maintained.
