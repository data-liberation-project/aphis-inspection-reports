2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****Thirteen Bassett Hound puppies (DOB 4/14/14 & 4/15/14) had received delayed veterinary care and their health
had deteriorated to the point that at least 3 puppies were in critical condition at the time of the inspection. The
puppies were picked up by the transporter on 6/18/14 and then returned to the owner on 6/28/14 because they were
rejected by the buyer due to kennel cough. The owner did not take any of the puppies to a veterinarian for diagnosis
and treatment at that time. The owner treated the puppies by adding Vicks 44 to their drinking water (2 capfuls per 2
gallon water). Two of the puppies died approximately 2 weeks after being returned. The owner finally took a puppy
to a veterinarian on 7/14/14 and it was euthanized. The veterinarian diagnosed kennel cough and prescribed
antibiotics for the remaining puppies. At the time of the inspection, the puppies were extremely thin with ribs, spinal
processes, and hips protruding. The puppies were gagging and coughing. The coughing was harsh and was so
forceful and lengthy that the puppies often had to stop and lay down afterwards. They would stand or lay with their
heads extended and their sides would heave with each breath. Several of the puppies had a yellow discharge from
their eyes and some of the puppies had visible third eyelids.
****An adult female Bassett Hound named "Big Girl" was thin, with her ribs being visible and her coat was rough and
coarse. She would occasionally cough during the inspection. She had been exposed to the puppies with kennel
cough. This dog had not been examined by a veterinarian and was not receiving any treatment.
****An adult female Beagle named "Sis" had a bloody discharge from her vulva. She had given birth to 9 puppies
about 4 weeks earlier. She was also thin, with her ribs being visible. This dog had not been examined by a
veterinarian and was not receiving any treatment.
Delayed and/or inadequate veterinary care can result in progression of the disease, secondary disease conditions,
and even death. The owner must ensure that all dogs receive timely and adequate veterinary care. The owner must
have the adult Bassett Hound and the adult Beagle examined and treated by a veterinarian and must make medical
records available to the inspector upon request.
The owner was verbally directed to have the 2 adult dogs evaluated by close of business July 19, 2014.On the day of this inspection, the owner surrendered the 10 Basset Hound puppies to the Missouri Department of
Agriculture.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
(2) Live puppies less than 16 weeks of age
Two litters of Bassett Hound puppies (DOB 4/14/14 and 4/15/14) were being housed together in the same
enclosure. The owner stated that the 10 Bassett Hound puppies had received microchips for identification by the
broker when they received the puppies. However, during the inspection, three of the puppies did not have
microchips or other forms of identification (the scanner used by the MO Dept of Ag verified this). The owner's
microchip scanner was not working because the battery was dead. The owner's scanner also was not capable of
reading the 15-digit chip used by the broker. Correct identification is required to ensure that the dogs receive correct
medication and to be able to track the dogs during shipping and transfers of ownership. The owner must ensure
that all dogs are correctly identified at all times. If a microchip is being used, the reader must be able to read the
frequency of the chips used and be in working order.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structure.
An adult female Boston terrier was observed outside of the kennel facility. The owner stated that this dog could
climb or jump out of its enclosure and run loose. The gate to the kennel facility had been left open and the dog was
in direct contact with the 10 Bassett Hound puppies that were suffering from kennel cough, a highly contagious
disease. The female Boston had a litter of puppies of her own and returned to her puppies after being in contact
with the sick puppies. Enclosures that do not securely contain the dogs can result in injury, escape, and contact
with other animals. The owner must ensure that all enclosures securely contain the dogs so that they can not
escape.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JULY 31, 2014.3.4(a)(1)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(a) Restrictions. (1)(iii) Sick, infirm, aged, or young dogs.
The 10 Bassett Hound puppies (DOB 4/14/14 and 4/15/14) with kennel cough were being housed in an outdoor
enclosure without approval from the Attending Veterinarian. The owner's Program of Veterinary Care states that
"All puppies and mothers kept in climate control building" and under isolation guidelines the attending veterinarian
wrote: ""sick animals are isolated from general public within kennel building". Not providing climate-controlled living
areas can cause stress to sick and young dogs and can affect their health and ability to heal. The owner must follow
the directions of her Attending Veterinarian and Program of Veterinary Care when housing puppies and sick
animals.
TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
The 10 Bassett Hound puppies with kennel cough were in an outdoor enclosure that had no shelter. Shelters are
required to protect the animals from the elements. Recent night time temperatures had been as low as 54F.
Shelters must have a roof, four sides, and a floor. The owner must provide one or more shelters in each outdoor
enclosure that are large enough to contain all the animals at one time and allow them to sit, stand, lie, and turn
about freely.
TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.
3.7(e)
COMPATIBLE GROUPING.
(e) Isolation of animals with a contagious disease.
The 10 Basset Hound puppies with kennel cough were in an enclosure outside the kennel facility. However, the
owner allowed her house dogs and some kennel dogs (some of which had litters of puppies) to run loose in the
yard, allowing them access to the sick puppies, which had a highly contagious disease. These dogs could then
enter the owner's house and directly contact 2 litters of puppies. Because the house dogs and kennel dogs are all
allowed to intermingle, there is the potential for most, if not all, dogs in the kennel to be exposed to kennel cough.
The owner's Program of Veterinary Care states that "new dogs or sick animals are isolated from general public
within kennel building." Not isolating dogs with a contagious disease can result in exposure of other dogs to the
disease. The owner must ensure that dogs having or suspected of having a contagious disease be isolated fromhealthy animals.
TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS DATE FORWARD.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(d) Pest control.
Two adult dogs were observed to be scratching and rubbing their sides and neck along the fence and scratching
their neck with their hind paw. When looked at closer, they had live and dead fleas on the armpit area, chest and
abdomen areas and between the hind legs. The dogs had been treated by dipping them into a tank of "flea dip".
This has been done twice, as stated by the owner, but fleas are still present on these 2 dogs. Fleas can irritate and
cause illness. An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting dogs, must be established
and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce illness and contamination by
pests. The owner must treat the dogs appropriately to remove and prevent fleas and other insects and pests.
