2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On 11 February, 2019 one of three skunks was found dead in their shared enclosure. The body was submitted to
the attending veterinarian for necropsy. The necropsy report stated that the animal had a body condition score of
four out of nine and that "Stomach and intestines empty, no ingesta or stool present." Histopathology findings were
consistent with a viral infection. An employee at the facility stated that the attending veterinarian had contacted them
after the necropsy and commented on the fact that animal caretakers had failed to notice that the skunk wasn't
eating. Both the curator and the skunk caretaker on duty at the time of the inspection stated that there was no
procedure in place to ensure that all animals in shared enclosures were eating.
Failure to observe animals to assess their health and well-being on a daily basis and failure to adequately
communicate health issues to the attending veterinarian can be detrimental to the health of the animals and cause
unnecessary pain and distress. Daily observation of all the animals to assess their well-being and direct and
frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding health issues is necessary to ensure that the
animals receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A system should be in place to ensure that all animals receive
adequate daily observation and that the attending veterinarian is notified when necessary.
3.132 CRITICAL
EMPLOYEES.
The records review revealed an uncharacteristically high mortality rate at this facility since 1 January, 2018.
Included among the deaths are one skunk that died with no food or feces in the intestinal tract and a fisher with a
severe flea infestation that was noticed but not treated, and that ultimately led to the death of the animal. A second
fisher living in the same enclosure died shortly before its cage mate (no necropsy was performed) and that death
was likely due to the same cause.
During interviews of facility staff members the animal curator stated that she has requested permission to hireadditional help but has not received permission to do so from the Superintendent of Schools. She stated that with
the current staffing level it is difficult for animal caretakers to adequately perform their duties.The attending
veterinarian was also contacted regarding the mortality rate and she stated that she agreed with the curator, that
staffing levels were not sufficient at times to provide adequate daily observation and care of the animals.
A sufficient number of adequately trained employees are needed to maintain a professionally acceptable level of
animal husbandry. The facility should ensure that they have a sufficient number of trained employees to care for
their animals.
