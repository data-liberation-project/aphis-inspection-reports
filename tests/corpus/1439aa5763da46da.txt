ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30am on
23-Aug-18.
Dr. Neafsey and myself arrived at the facility at approximately 11:30am. In deference to the no trespassing sign
posted we did not enter the property. We called the contact number and left a voicemail stating that we were at the
facility and wished to conduct an inspection. We waited 30 minutes and then left the property.
Additional Inspectors
Neafsey Michael, Assistant Director
