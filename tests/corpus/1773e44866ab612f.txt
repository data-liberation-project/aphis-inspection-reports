2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult male Chinese pug with tag number 36 has an abnormal right eye. The surface of the right eye (cornea)
appears to be dry and there is a large cloudy area on the cornea. The right eye protrudes from the socket more than
the left one and the eyelids do not fully close over the right eye when the dog blinks. The “white” of the right eye is
red and there are prominent blood vessels visible there. There was a crust on the upper and lower lids surrounding
the right eye.
An adult female Chinese pug with tag number 21 has an abnormal right eye. The surface of the right eye (cornea) is
dry and has a large area of cloudiness. The “white” of the eye has prominent blood vessels that are not present on
the left eye.
Eye problems can be a result of trauma, infection, and other medical problems. They can be painful for the dog and
have the potential to damage the eye. The licensee must have these dogs examined by a licensed veterinarian as
soon as possible in order to obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issue cited above.
The outcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation
should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by
the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar
and/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the animals.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each
animal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and
the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
The licensee must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated in a
timely manner by a veterinarian as part of the facility’s programs of adequate veterinary care and that the facility use
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases, and injuries at all times.
A female West Highland white terrier with tag number 61 and a Yorkshire terrier with tag number 30 had excessively
long nails that were causing their toes to be mal-positioned. Failure to appropriately maintain nails can cause
postural and gait abnormalities which could be painful for the dogs or lead to injuries. As part of the facility’s
programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate nail care in
a timely manner. The nails were trimmed by a facility employee during the inspection.3.6(a)(2)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were two live electric power cords used for heating pads where the cord protectors are no longer protecting
the cords. One cord was in the "Tot Spot" building being used for one litter of four puppies and one cord was in the
"Bassinet" building in use for one female and her litter of 7 puppies. Live electric power cords could cause injury to
the dogs if they are chewed by the dogs. All power cords must be installed in a manner that protects the animals
from coming into direct contact with the cords. These were corrected at the time of the inspection.
This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on 10 Jan. 2017.
The exit interview was conducted with facility representatives on 11 Jan. 2017.
