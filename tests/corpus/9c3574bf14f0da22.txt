Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On June 16, 2022, A Principal Investigator self-reported the use of a pretreatment medication that was not described in an
approved canine study protocol. The Principal Investigator consulted with the veterinary staff on the pretreatment
medication, but a protocol amendment was not submitted to the IACUC prior to administering the medication to study
animals.

Proposed activities and proposed significant changes in ongoing activities that have been approved by the IACUC may be
subject to further review and approval. Any changes in activity that involves the care and use of animals on study must be
approved by the IACUC to ensure research is being conducted in a humane manner.

This has been corrected before the time of inspection by an IACUC approved amendment.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
