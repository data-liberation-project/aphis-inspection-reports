Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The rear portions of the zoo (closer to the elk and longhorn enclosures) are overgrown with weeds and littered with large
piles of rubble/discarded materials, and general junk such as a dilapidated four wheeler vehicle, trailer and disassembled
playground equipment. Very tall, dense and thorny vegetation exists along several fence lines inside the perimeter and
begins at the fence and extends into the zoo grounds, sometimes as deep as 20’-30’ away from the fence; in some places
there is also rubble within the weeds.
The extent of the weeds and rubble prevents assessment of perimeter fence line integrity, and it cannot be determined if
the fence is sufficient in height or in need of repairs; dense and thorny brush and piles of rubble provide breeding and
living areas for rodents, pests and vermin.
The licensee must ensure that premises are kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste and discarded matter, and
that weeds, grass and bushes are controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control.

Facilities, outdoor.


The facility maintains one adult male cougar and two adult female bears on the premises. The perimeter fence enclosing
the facility is less than eight feet for nearly the entire perimeter and some places are less than six feet in height. Other
sections of perimeter fencing are inadequate because they are in poor repair and/or do not meet minimum height
requirements:

• Along E. College Boulevard: The height of the chain link perimeter fence, including the top barbed wire strands,
measures 80” at its greatest height; the public entrance chain link gate measures 75.5” in height and has a 6” vertical gap
between the post and gate and an 8” gap beneath it. The wooden loading entrance gate at the NW corner (N. Atkinson
Ave. and E. College Blvd.) has a 9” gap at the bottom, and the wooden fence adjacent to the gate has a 10”X7” gap at the
bottom.
• Along N. Atkinson Avenue: The wooden portions of the fence measure 7’4” in height at the lowest point; the gate to the
south lower parking lot has a gap at the right side that measures 11.5” at its greatest width; the chain link portion of
fencing east of the river gate is 5’6” in height at its lowest point and 6’2” at its maximum height.
• Rear Perimeter Fence, Bordering Trailer Park: The chain link fencing at the corner post on N. Atkinson Ave. (near the
point where the city water ties into the pond) is in poor repair, with a 12”X9” hole at the topline where the metal has been
pulled downward; the height of this section of fencing ranges from 6’2” at its lowest point to 6’8” at its greatest height, up
to the point of the newly constructed chain link fencing. Newly constructed chain link fencing sections have a vertical gap
measuring 5”-8” in width at the point where the new post ties into the older section. The remainder of the rear perimeter
fence separating the zoo from this residential area is in poor condition, with numerous places where trees have grown
through the fence line and multiple areas where the top barbed wire strands are detached or missing at the top; there are
long spans of chain link patching along the bottom of the majority of this fence line, some of which are detached or


sagging. There are multiple breaches at the bottom of the fence line where the fence is torn or pulled upward, resulting in
4”-12” gaps. The integrity of the remainder of this fence line cannot be assessed due to tall, very dense and thorny, dead
vegetation immediately inside the fence line.
• Side Perimeter Fence, Bordering Open Lot or Residential Area on south side of river: The condition and heights of the
perimeter fencing near the elk enclosure cannot be evaluated due to very tall, dense and thorny vegetation immediately
inside the fence line; the weeds extend approximately 20’-30’ deep from the fence and are over 5’ tall. The adjacent
fence sections are similarly inaccessible, with weeds over 6’ tall and piles of rubble/discarded materials preventing
inspection.
• Other Sections of Fencing: The fence line adjacent to the greenhouse measures 5’5” at its minimum height and 6’8” at
its maximum height. The south side perimeter fencing bordering a residential trailer park measures 5’7” at its minimum
height and ~6’ at its maximum height; there are weeds (estimated to be ~8’ in height) along this section that exceed the
height of the fence.
The fence is inadequate because it cannot serve as a secondary containment system for the animals housed in the facility
and cannot prevent other animals and unauthorized persons from entering. The licensee must assess all perimeter
fences at the facility for adequate height and structural integrity and modify the existing fence(s) or install a different
perimeter fence or fences of at least 8 feet in height (for the dangerous species noted above), and at least 6 feet in height
(for all other non-dangerous species inventoried at the time of this inspection). The perimeter fence(s) must be a
minimum of three feet from the primary enclosures and constructed so that the fence(s) protect(s) the animals by
restricting entry of outside animals and unauthorized persons from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the
animals in the facility.
