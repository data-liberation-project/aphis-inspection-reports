Notification of change of operation.
On Thursday, July 28, 2022, at 2:42 pm, I arrived at the address given by the registrant on her application. I knocked on
the door and no one answered. I tried calling the registrant at 2:44 pm and left a voicemail message. I left a "Sorry we
missed you" flyer with my contact information and left the property at 3:23 pm. The registrant called back at 3:42 pm when
I was driving so I did not answer the phone. Later, I pulled over and parked to return her call at 4:05 pm. I told her that I
attempted to do an inspection, but no one was home and that there would be a non-compliance on the inspection report. I
confirmed her e-mail address to send the inspection report. She did not mention to me that she had moved, however, she
did say she wanted to cancel her registration. Later, the current tenant at the known address called to ask about the flyer I
left. I explained to him what it was for, and he told me that he did not know the registrant and that she must have moved
at least 2 months ago because he has lived at the address for the past 2 months.

The registrant moved and did not provide a new address as required for an inspection to be conducted under the Animal
Welfare Act. Current address and contact information are essential to enforcing the Animal Welfare Act efficiently and
cost-effectively.



The registrant shall notify the Deputy Administrator of Animal Care by certified mail of any change in the name, address,
or ownership, or other change in operations affecting its status as an exhibitor, carrier, or intermediate handler within 10
days after making such change. Send to APHIS Animal Care, 2150 Centre Avenue, Building B, Mailstop 3W11, Fort
Collins, CO 80526.
