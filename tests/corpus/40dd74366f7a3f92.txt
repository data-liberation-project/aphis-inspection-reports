2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Three sheep, three goats, and one alpaca have excessively overgrown hooves. One of the sheep had toes that
were curling abnormally as a result of not having routine hoof trimming. One of the goats had hooves that were
curling in an upward direction due to lack of routine hoof trimming.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries.
As part of the facility’s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive
appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
These seven animals need to have their hooves trimmed by November 5, 2016.
