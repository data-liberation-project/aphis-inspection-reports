ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Dachshund (“Hershey”, #0A02513559, DOB 01-29-2015) is observed limping slightly on her right front
foot. Closer inspection of the underside of the foot revealed that the large pad has split open. The damaged area is
located near the front of the large pad and the split sections of tissue felt hard and thickened to the touch. The dog
has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for this condition.
This Dachshund also has areas of hair loss on her tail and ears. The hair loss on the ears is located on the outside
of the ear flap and along the edges of the ear flap. The skin feels somewhat thickened in these areas. The hair
loss on the tail is located along the entire length of the top side of the tail and two sections are covered in a round,
brown, scab-like material. The hair around the base of the tail has a flaky material trapped within it.
The licensee has documentation that this dog was evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and treated with a
medicated shampoo and Animax Ointment for ringworm from June 26, 2016 through August 20, 2016. The
licensee then self-treated the dog again December 8, 2016 through December 13, 2016, but did not have the dog
re-evaluated by a licensed veterinarian at this time. The licensee treated the dog once more on January 20, 2017
with Derma Vet Ointment, but did not have the dog re-evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and does not have
documentation from a licensed veterinarian approving the use of the Derma Vet Ointment, the dosage of this
product, how often it should be used, and for what duration.
A male Shih tzu (“Mighty Rocket”, 0A02261427, DOB 07-11-2014) is observed to have an abnormal appearance to
his left eye. The center of the left eye appears to be cloudy and blue in color. There is drainage around the inside
corner of the left eye that is yellowish in color and the hair above and below the corner of the eye is wet. The white
of the eye is slightly reddened. This dog has not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for the condition of the
eye.
Poor eye and skin health could cause the dog pain and discomfort as well as lead to possible further health issues.
The licensee must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and
to establish an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented and available to
the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.Correction date: End of business January 28, 2017

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The trash container located in the housing facility has no lid. Trash containers without lids could attract pests such
as flies. All trash containers located within housing facilities, food storage areas, and food preparation areas must
be leak-proof and have a tightly fitting lid on them at all times. The licensee must acquire a tightly fitted lid for the
trash container to ensure that the trash within does not attract any flies.

3.3(e)(1)(iii)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
One enclosure, containing one adult dog and five puppies, has a whelping box constructed of cardboard. The
cardboard is not impervious to moisture and will absorb fluids causing a loss of the structural integrity of the
cardboard. The cardboard is also not capable of being properly cleaned and sanitized which could increase the
disease risk towards the dogs.
All walls, boxes, houses, dens and other surfaces in contact with the animals must be impervious to moisture. The
licensee must replace the cardboard whelping box with a surface that is impervious to moisture and can be properly
cleaned and sanitized in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
