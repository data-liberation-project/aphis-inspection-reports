ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:50pm on

The licensee was exiting her driveway when I arrived. She was on her way to work and verbally informed me of her
new work schedule.
