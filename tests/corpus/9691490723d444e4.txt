3.127(b) Direct Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
-A female Holstein cow was standing in 10-12 inches of mud in its only shelter. There was little bedding in this shelter.
There is not enough bedding to allow the cow to lay down in a dry space. This was evidenced by a moderate
mud/manure on the cows legs and body.
-6 yearling cows shared a shelter with two sides that had holes in them, or were lacking boards. This shelter is inadequate
to allow these cows protection from the snow, cold, and wind. The hair coats of the cows appeared wet.
-2 dairy goats and 17 yearling goats are housed together. The largest shelters for the goats has a board missing at the
top allowing snow to fall on the animals using the shelter and onto their bedding. There are also 2 calf huts in the
enclosure and both of the calf huts have excessive urine and feces in them causing the bedding to be wet. The calf huts
were filled to capacity with goats showing the inspectors that the calf huts were preferred over the larger wooden shelter
due to the wooden shelter lacking boards at the top which did not allow the goats protection from wind and snow.
-3 adult cows housed together had very little clean dry bedding in their shelter. They had caked dry mud/feces on their
legs and body indicating that there was not enough dry area to lay down in their shelter.
-16 sheep in the front pasture had one shelter that is not large enough to contain all animals held in the enclosure at the
same time to allow protection of the sheep from the cold, wind, and snow.


Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all
animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.

Appropriate shelter and bedding must be made available to all animals in these extreme temperatures to afford them
protection and comfort. The temperature was 25.5 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind-chill of 14.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
These animals are suffering due to lack of appropriate shelter and/or bedding.
