2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
8 small ruminants were reluctant or unable to bear weight on some of their limbs or feet, and 2 additional small ruminants
had severely overgrown hooves. These animals are described below:
1) A dark brown adult neutered male goat was extremely reluctant to bear weight on the left front foot, right front foot, and
right hind foot. The animal was reluctant to get up and walk, and the right hind and left front feet appeared to be swollen.
The animal appeared to be in adequate body condition. The owner stated that he had treated the animal with LA-200
(antibiotic) and a pour-on (topical) treatment from the feed store, and that the last treatment had been given was on
Sunday (March 7th). The owner stated that the lameness just got bad this past weekend, and that the animal had been
treated for this condition before.
2) A black and white intact male goat, ear Tag #015, was reluctant to bear weight on both front feet, which appeared to be
swollen. The animal was observed to have difficulty laying down and was seen to balance on his front knees with his head
down. The animal appeared to be in adequate body condition. The owner stated that he had treated the animal with LA-
200 (antibiotic) and a pour-on treatment, and that the last treatment was administered 6 days ago (March 3rd).
3) A black and white intact male sheep was extremely reluctant to bear weight on the right front foot, which appeared to
be swollen. The owner stated that this animal had been fine on Sunday, when it had been used for a petting zoo, and he


had not yet treated this animal for the lameness. The animal appeared to be in adequate body condition.
4) A small light brownish red female goat had severely overgrown hooves on the back legs, and was reluctant to bear
weight on the right front foot. The goat was in thin body condition and had a tucked abdomen. The hooves on the back
legs were so overgrown they were curving upwards and causing the back feet to be in an abnormal position. The owner
stated that he had plans to trim the back feet and treat the right front foot for foot scald. The owner stated that this animal
hasn't been lame on Sunday.
5) A white Dorset adult female sheep had severely overgrown hooves on all four feet. The hooves were approximately
1.5-2x the normal length. The animal appeared to be in adequate body condition.
6) An adult white female sheep was lame on the left back leg. The animal had two lambs on her and a full udder and
appeared to be in normal body condition. The owner stated that he had not treated her.
7) A small male white and brown goat kid was reluctant to bear weight on the right front leg and the owner stated that he
had not been treated yet. The owner stated that this animal was not lame on Sunday.
8) A grey and white adult female goat was lame on the right front foot. The owner stated that she had been treated with
LA-200 (antibiotic) and a pour-on (topical) medication on Sunday.
9) A small young black male goat kid, the offspring of the grey and white female above (#8), was extremely reluctant to
bear weight on the left hind leg. The kid also had mild brown crusts around the nose and eyes. The owner stated that this
kid had been given a dose of LA-200 (antibiotic) on Sunday.
10) A black and white goat in the deer enclosure had severely overgrown hooves on the back legs. The animal appeared
to be in normal body condition.
The facility owner stated that the attending veterinarian had instructed him to treat foot scald in goats with LA-200
(antibiotic injection) and Copper tox (topical medication), but he had not been using Copper tox in part of concern about


copper toxicity in sheep. Instead, the facility owner had been using injectable LA-220 and a topical product for foot
disease from the feed store, the name of which he could not recall and which was unavailable at the time of inspection.
Animals that are reluctant or unable to bear weight on some of their limbs or feet may suffer from pain or discomfort, and
the condition may hinder an animal’s ability or willingness to walk or run, to rest comfortably, and to access food, water,
and shelter. The presence of severely overgrown hooves puts abnormal stress and strain on the hoof (foot) which can
cause injury, inflammation, or dysfunction.
Correct by using a licensed veterinarian to provide adequate veterinary care for the sheep and goats.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
Two adult red kangaroos are housed in an enclosure that is not enclosed by a perimeter fence. Along the west side of the
property there is no perimeter fence at the back of the pasture adjacent to the creek.
The enclosures containing the two African crested porcupines, 6 ring-tailed lemurs, and 1 macaque are surrounded by a
perimeter fence that is 6' tall, but the top two feet of the fence is composed of only two horizontal wires, each spaced 12
inches away from the other.
A perimeter fence is required to prevent unauthorized entry of people and animals which could steal, injure, sicken,
harass, or kill the captive animals. Non-dangerous exotic animals such as these, housed in sheltered and outdoor
facilities, require a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence around their enclosures. Correct by constructing a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence
of sufficient strength to prevent entry of unauthorized people or animals (the size of raccoons, skunks, or dogs), and that
is at least 3-feet away from any enclosures or structures. Alternatively, a variance may be requested in writing from the
APHIS Administrator.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
