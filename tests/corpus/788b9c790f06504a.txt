2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult, male Japanese macaque was observed to pluck at the hair/skin on the fronts of both legs during the
majority of time that he was observed during the inspection. He has a history of plucking hair and picking at the skin
of his arms. The first mention of plucking of the hair and skin of the legs in the animal(cid:25)s observation log was noted
on 11 April 2016. The observation log for this animal lists plucking hair on his legs numerous times after that initial
entry along with the ongoing arm hair plucking.
This animal was re-evaluated by the attending veterinarian (AV) on 5 April 2016 who at that time increased the
animal(cid:25)s dose of anti-anxiety medication. As noted above, the animal started plucking a new area on his body
shortly after this change. While the arm plucking appears to have decreased in frequency, the leg plucking suggests
a progression of the overall problem. As of the time of this inspection, the facility has not communicated with the AV
information regarding the animal(cid:25)s response to the new dose of medication and more importantly, the information
that the plucking has progressed to a new location.
Daily observation and direct, timely, and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is essential for the
heath and care of the animals. Lack of communication of ongoing problems might result in a delay of treatment if
severity of the problem is not known by the veterinarian. In this case, the AV has not been notified that the animal is
plucking at a new area of skin and cannot therefore alter the enrichment plan and/or medical treatment plan to
accommodate the progression of the skin plucking problem. The licensee must establish as part of the program of
veterinary care a plan of daily observation and a mechanism of direct, timely and frequent communication so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the
attending veterinarian.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
The two dog-wolf hybrids are being fed directly on a concrete slab in their enclosure. Feed not placed in a foodreceptacle may become contaminated and that surface may not be adequately cleaned and sanitized. Food for
dogs must be placed in food receptacles that protect the food from contamination of feces and pests and are easily
cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 14 June 2016.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is a large plastic tub in the dog-wolf hybrid enclosure that has water in it. There is dirt on the bottom of this
tub, green algae growing on the sides as well as floating clumps of green algae. Dirty water receptacles may
contaminate the water and may lead to an increase in disease transmission. All water receptacles must be
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks, or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food
waste, excreta and other disease hazards. Correct by 3 June 2016.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There were many pools of standing water and mud in the long-horn cattle enclosure. This covered up to 50% of the
available space for these cattle. The majority of the west bear enclosure was covered in mud. There was also a
pool of standing water along the west side of the bison's enclosure. There were also pools of standing water in the
pig's enclosure. The standing water was brownish in color and there was green algae growing in some of it.
Standing water and mud can cause odors, attract pests, and may lead to an increase in disease transmission. A
suitable method must be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. Correct by 6 June 2016.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
There are two metal food receptacles under the covered portion of the long-horn cattle enclosure. One has feces in
it and the bottom of the other is covered with contaminated hay. Uncleaned food receptacles may contaminate food
that is placed in it. All food receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary at all times. Correct by 2 June 2016.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There were numerous flies on the lower legs of the two long-horn cattle. These cattle were noticed stomping,
twitching their skin, swishing of the tail and head swinging to chase away the flies. Flies can transmit diseases and
can be a nuisance to the animals.
There were numerous flies on the porcupine food. Flies can transmit diseases and may decrease the animals
access to the food.
An effective method of pest control must be established and maintained. Correct by 2 June 2016.This routine inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives, Dr. Margaret Shaver, VMO
and Kendall Lundy, ACI.
