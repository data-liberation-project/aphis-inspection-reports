2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Shih Tzu #61 was observed to be in discomfort and have a wound to her right hindquarters. The wound appeared
to consist of three large lacerations approximately each 1 inch in length by ¼ - ½ inch in width. The area around the
wound was red and the leg was swollen. The licensee stated that he found her in her pen that way this morning (09/15),
he thinks she may have been attacked by the other dog(s) in the enclosure. He said that he put some ointment on it and
moved her to another enclosure. I asked if he had contacted or planned on contacting the attending veterinarian and he
stated that he was just going to see how it would heal using the ointment that he had. Failure to have the issue addressed
by the attending veterinarian can result in additional pain and discomfort to the animal as well as worsen the severity of
the injury. The animal must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian and the prescribed treatment must be
administered.
