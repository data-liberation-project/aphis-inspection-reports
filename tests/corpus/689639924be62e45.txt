HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The base of 5 support beams that hold up the west side of the kennel need repaired. The beams are wrapped in
metal siding that is protruding and sharp. These support beams are in the turn out area where the dogs could make
contact and get injured. Housing facilities for dogs must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
