-The following medication stored in the current drug storage area were past the expiration date:
Clavamox Expired 11-15
This medication was intermingled with other pharmaceuticals that are currently being used in the indoor facility and
are therefore ready for use. The use of expired medications is not an appropriate method to prevent, control, and
treat diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience pain
and distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or due to unexpected side effects. The licensee must
ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired and are labeled properly in accordance with standard
veterinary practices and manufacturer's recommendations at all times.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- There is a female marmoset housed with another non human primate that is limping on her left rear limb. The
licensee stated that this injury occurred just prior to parturition on March 3, 2016. The AV was at the facility on May
20, 2016 and noticed the animal limping. The AV requested the licensee bring the animal in for sedation and
radiographs. The licensee had not made an appointment at the time of the inspection and the animal was still
limping. Abnormal gait my indicate a limb injury, neurological deficits or neoplastic problems for the animal. The
female marmoset must be examined by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment administered.
- There is a female kinkajou with the distal aspect of her tail denuded. The denuded area was approximately 2
inches in length and appeared red, swollen, and inflamed. The licensee stated the injury occurred when she
introduced the pair to each other. The licensee stated the injury occurred overnight approximately 2 to 4 weeks ago.
Denuded areas can become infected and be painful. This animal must be seen by the AV for proper treatment of
the tail lesion. - There is a black and white rabbit with its entire left ear swollen and crusty. A crusty, swollen ear could be an
indication of the prolonged presence of ear mites or a bacterial ear infection and both are painful. The licensee had
not noticed the ear on this rabbit at the time of the inspection. The licensee must have this rabbit examined by the
AV to determine cause and appropriate treatment for this animal's ear.
All three animals are to be examined by the AV and the following information for each animal must be obtained and
available for the inspector. Documentation must be maintained for any health related problems and it must include
the following information:
- Identity of the animal.
- Descriptions of the illness or injury.
- Dates, details, and results of examinations, tests, and other such procedures.
- Dates and other details of all treatments, including the name, dose, route, frequency, and duration of treatment
with
drugs or other medications.
- Follow-up exams to determine resolution of problem

RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
- There is not a current animal inventory list present at the facility. The last list of inventoried animals was dated
2014. A female Kinkajou was acquired in April 2016 and not listed on the inventory. A Joey was acquired in August
2015, deceased Oct. of 2015 and was not on the inventory. An african deer mouse was still on the inventory and
deceased May 2015. A guinea pig was still on the inventory and it was also deceased. The records need to be kept
up to date so that the animals can be properly traced and accounted for.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- The primary enclosures for many of the marmosets have an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste on
the floor. Most the floor area was covered with feces and the resting surfaces were soaked in urine. The animals
were not able to avoid the excreta and urine in the shelter and enclosures. All surfaces must be cleaned daily and
maintained at all times to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- Numerous flies were observed on the floor, on food receptacles, and flying in the indoor portion of the enclosures
in the non-human primate buildings. The flies were also present in the non-human primate indoor facility. There was
no observable mechanism for fly control noted by inspectors at the time of the inspection and the facility
representative stated that no mechanism was in place. Flies carry diseases and may cause illness to the enclosed
animals. They can also contaminate food, water, and living areas. The licensee must have an adequate program to
control pests in the buildings and must ensure proper pest control throughout the facility at all times.
