2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
While there was a written program of veterinary care (PVC), it was broad and did not adequately provided the
appropriate methods of proper health care. Rather, the methods were listed for all species present and may not
have applied to them all. In addition, the rabbits were not included in the PVC. Failure to provide an adequate
program of preventative, routine and emergency veterinary care for the species housed can jeopardize the health of
the animals.
Exhibitors shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend,
and holiday care.

3.58 REPEAT
CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
A rabbits is being housed in an enclosure with other farm animals. Housing rabbits with other species may affect
their health and well-being and increase their risk of injury.
The facility should ensure the rabbits are not housed in the same primary enclosure with any other species.
3.130
WATERING.
Two automatic water receptacles within the primary enclosure housing farm animals were corroded. One of the
water receptacles also had an algae-like growth. Failure to maintain such receptacles prevents proper sanitation
and the provision of potable water to the animals, which may adversely affect their health and welfare.
A system must be utilized for monitoring the condition of water receptacles and the maintenance thereof to keepthem clean and sanitary.
