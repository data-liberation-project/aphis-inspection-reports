FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence around the llama pen is about 6 feet high not the needed 8 feet high. This section was
approximately 50 feet long. There are a cougar and black bear in the compound.
The perimeter fence should:
• Keep people and animals from going under or through the fence;
• Be at least 8’ in height for the “dangerous” (bear and cougar) animals currently present on exhibit;
• Act as a secondary containment in the event that an animal escapes its primary enclosure;
• Be at least 3’ from the “dangerous” animal’s enclosure to prevent unwanted contact through the fence. Failure to
maintain the perimeter fence as specified could put the animals at risk of unwanted contact with people or animals,
and / or at risk of escape. The fence should be maintained and updated so that it meets the specifications.
