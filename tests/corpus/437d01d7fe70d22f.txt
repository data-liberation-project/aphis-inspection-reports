INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Several incidences were identified in which significant changes were made by an investigator/study staff regarding
the care and use of animals on an approved proposal without the IACUC first reviewing and approving the proposed
significant changes:
*Multiple changes in anesthetic protocols used on gerbils were made by researchers on proposal M1600067. An
amendment was submitted for one of the changes but the new regimen was used prior to receiving IACUC
approval. No amendment was submitted for the other changes made.
*Twenty three gerbils were used on a pilot study within proposal M1600067 which only was approved for ten gerbils.
This significant increase in animal numbers was not reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to the use of the
additional animals.
*Twelve pigs were approved for use on proposal M1700129. Fourteen pigs were used by the investigator. The
increase in animal numbers was not reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to the use of the additional animals.
The IACUC, as an agent of the facility, shall review all components of activities related to the care and use of
animals to determine that the activities are in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations. The IACUC
shall review and approve, require modifications in to secure approval or withhold approval of proposed significant
changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities. Correct from this day forward.
2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Multiple incidences involving a lack of communication between researchers making observations about gerbil
anesthesia issues and gerbil deaths during study procedures (protocol M1600067) and the attending
veterinarian/veterinary staff were identified by the IACUC after an inquiry triggered by an observation made during
an IACUC semi-annual facility inspection. The gerbil deaths had also not been reported by the researchers to the
IACUC. Seventeen of the twenty three gerbils used in this pilot study during five separate sessions over a period of
10 months from June 2017 to April 2018 died.
Observations regarding problems of animal health, behavior and well-being may be accomplished by someoneother than the attending veterinarian but all such issues must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner to ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care. The facility shall maintain a program of
adequate veterinary care that includes a mechanism of direct and timely communication on problems of animal
health, behavior and well being to the attending veterinarian.
2.36(b)(3)
ANNUAL REPORT.
The facility’s Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Report includes a summary of exceptions to the Regulations and Standards
under the Animal Welfare Act. The report includes a description of an IACUC approved exception to the provision of
food fed to dogs in which dogs are fasted for 23 hours prior to performing a 4-10 hour metabolic study (for a total
fast of 27-33 hours). The report states that although the exception was approved, no animals underwent this
exception during the reporting period. In actuality, multiple dogs on several of the protocols identified underwent the
exception based on review of records and a discussion with research staff. To assure that the facility is adhering to
the standards and regulations under the Act the summary must also contain the species and number of animals
affected along with the brief explanation of the exception. Correct by revising the Annual Report and resubmitting it
to Animal Care by July 31, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned Attending Veterinarian, IACUC chair and other
facility representatives.
