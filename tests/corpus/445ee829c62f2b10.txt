HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing two Red Ruffed Lemur had peeling paint on the underside of the galvanized roof. The paint
chips appeared to be hanging on loosely in several areas. The facility has plans to replace the roof when the
animals are off exhibit. Paint chips could cause illness in the lemur if ingested. Correct by assuring all surfaces are
maintained on a regular basis to include repainting or replacing as needed. To be corrected by 11 November 2016.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(cid:9)There were two welded wire panels on the right side of the enclosure from the back of the den for the leopard
exhibit at the time of inspection. The panels were spot welded to the outside of the enclosure supports and the spot
welds were noted to be rusting to the point that they may be structurally unsound. No additional structural integrity
was provided by the enclosure supports since the panels were attached on the outside. Poor structural integrity
could allow the animal to escape or become injured. Correct by assuring the indoor and outdoor housing facilities
are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The facility welded angle iron to the outside of the supports during the inspection process but the structural integrity
was not fully corrected by this repair. To be fully corrected by 11 November 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with The VP of Animal Programs.
