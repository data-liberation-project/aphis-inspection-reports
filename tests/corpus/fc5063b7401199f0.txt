2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocol 201800091 includes a blood collection method requiring anesthesia in chinchillas. According to the IACUC
approved protocol, researchers are approved to collect blood twice per animal, a minimum of 5 days apart. Review of
records for 4 animals observed at the time of USDA inspection reveals that blood collection was conducted on 10/13,
10/17, 10/18, and 10/20. Increasing the frequency of blood collection constitutes a significant change regarding the use of
animals in an ongoing activity that was not reviewed or approved by the committee.

The protocol also describes a middle ear fluid collection procedure that includes 48 hours of post-procedural analgesia
after the first collection. The records indicate that for this same group of 4 animals, the first middle ear fluid collection was
conducted on 10/17, but analgesia was not administered on the second day post-procedure (10/19). No concerns of
animal health were noted on clinical observation of these animals by veterinary and lab staff on that date. Failure to
provide post-procedural care according to the protocol is a significant change regarding the care of animals in an ongoing
activity that was not reviewed by the committee.




The committee must ensure that all significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities are
reviewed and approved prior to implementation.
