3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In a cat housing facility, there are two uncovered fluorescent light fixtures mounted directly above the primary
enclosures. In the event of breakage, glass particles can fall into the enclosures and injure the animals.
Housing facilities for cats must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound and must protect
the animals from injury.
