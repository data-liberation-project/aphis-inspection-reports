Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility was missing acquisition information for 1 puppy and 1 adult. The facility uses cage cards as official
identification and inventory purposes for puppies under 16 weeks of age. The cage card for 1 Dachshund puppy for 16-
May-2022 did not have an official identification number. On the Acquisition of Dogs on Hand (APHIS Form 7005), a
female Dachshund #.038 "Glory" was not listed.
Accurate acquisition information is necessary for APHIS officials to make positive identification of animals during
inspection and to properly trace their movements. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain an approved method of
documentation which fully and correctly disclose all information concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired,
owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or
otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her
possession or under his or her control.
The licensee must record the acquisition information and ensure all required acquisition information is properly and
accurately documented at all times.
To be corrected by: This was corrected at the time of inspection.

Housing facilities, general.

On a table in the kennel, there was a jug of oxine sanitizer and oxine crystals stored right next to a bottle of Pyrantel.
Toxic chemicals stored next to medications creates a risk for contamination of products that the dogs ingest.
For safety of the dogs, toxic chemicals, like cleaning supplies, must be properly stored so they won't potentially
contaminate their medicine. All toxic chemicals must be stored away from medications and other products that the dogs
may ingest.
To be corrected by: Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.3(e)(1)(ii)

Sheltered housing facilities.
The concrete floor and an approximate 1 foot tall section of the wall on the outside portion of each dog's sheltered
enclosure is not impervious to moisture. There is a roof over these enclosures making it unexposed to direct sun.
Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized to prevent disease hazards to the
dogs.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of sheltered housing facilities that are in contact with animals must be
impervious to moisture so they can be readily cleaned an sanitized.

Veterinary care for dogs.
At least 13 adult dogs and 10 puppies have been due for their vaccines according to the schedule on the licensee’s
Program of Veterinary Care. The 10 puppies were also behind on their deworming schedule. The APHIS inspector called
the licensee’s veterinary clinic to confirm which dogs were due for their vaccines due to lack of medical records available
for inspection. The licensee was unaware of how many adult dogs needed their vaccines at the time of inspection. They
were aware of the puppies being behind on vaccines and deworming. They had just ordered more vaccines this week.

The licensee currently has the veterinarian give some vaccines and they give some vaccines. The program of veterinary
care states Parvovirus, Distemper, Leptospirosis and Bordatella are to be given annually. Rabies will be given at one year
and every 3 years after that. These dogs are due for the following vaccinations:
**Rabies: Breanna and Frisky
**Distemper, Parvovirus, Leptospirosis: Christa and Elsa
**Distemper, Parvovirus, Leptospirosis, Bordatella: Barb, Fluffy, Hallie, Muffins, Goldie, Chloe
**All vaccines: Chocolate Cluster, Dixie, Glory

2 Dachshund litters born 16-May-2022 and 14-May-2022 are behind by three Nobivac 5 way vaccines, a Nobivac Intra
Trac 3, a five day treatment of Fenbendazole/Metronidazole and a treatment of Toltrazuril treatment per the schedule in
the Program of Veterinary Care.
A litter of Pomeranians born 10-June-2022 are behind by 1 fecal check, two Toltrazuril treatments, a Nobivac 5 way
vaccine and a 5 day treatment of Fenbendazole/Metronidazole.
A pomeranian litter born 29-May-2022 are behind by a 5 day treatment of Fenbendazole/Metronidazole, a Toltrazuril
treatment, a Nobivac 5 way vaccine and a Nobivac Intra Trac 3 vaccine.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian. The facility must follow the schedule for Rabies, Distemper and Parvovirus vaccines
written in the Program of Veterinary Care to protect the dogs from these contagious and/or deadly diseases. The facility
must vaccinate all dogs in need of the vaccines listed above and maintain the vaccine schedule n all dogs from this day
forward.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee is missing written medical records including the identity of the 5 dogs that received dentals on 12-July-2022.
The date of the procedure was found when the inspector called the veterinarian whom performed the dentals. Several
dogs are behind on various vaccines and It was unclear how many dogs were behind due to the lack of up to date vaccine
records. There were several vaccine records showing dogs overdue for vaccines and there were dogs missing vaccine
records all together. An accurate list of dogs needed to be vaccinated was determined when the inspector called the
veterinarian.
The lack of medical records makes it difficult to determine if the animals are receiving the vaccines and preventative
medical procedures and treatments. This information is needed for APHIS inspectors to ensure the medical care is being
provided by the licensee. The licensee must maintain in writing complete and updated medical records including the
identity of the animal, including identifying marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s breed, sex, and age;
Provided, however, that routine husbandry, such as vaccinations, preventive medical procedures, or treatments,
performed on all animals in a group (or herd), may be kept on a single record.

information is needed for APHIS inspectors to ensure the medical care is being provided by the licensee. The licensee
must maintain complete and updated medical records including the dates medications are given to each individual animal.
