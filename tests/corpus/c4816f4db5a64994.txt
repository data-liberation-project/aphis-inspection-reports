2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
While examining the medications for the dogs, a bottle of Combi-Pen-48 that expired in February 2015 was found
and a bottle of Oxytocin Injection that expired in February of 2013 was also found. The use of expired medical
material is not considered to be acceptable veterinary practice and may not be effective. The expired medications
should either be properly disposed of or appropriately labeled as expired and moved to a physically separate
location from the non-expired medical material.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the back section of the barn at least six of the indoor enclosures, containing at least ten dogs, have a buildup of
feces in them. The inspector observed that the feet of two white dogs were soiled with a brown material. The feces
in one enclosure have become smeared and compressed onto the concrete flooring as the dogs ran over the top of
it. The facility representative explained that the feces are removed from the enclosures every Wednesday and
Friday. Buildup of fecal material can cause the dogs to become soiled and increases the risk of disease. All hard
surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized once every two weeks, or as
often as necessary, to prevent the buildup of feces and reduce the disease risk.
Correction date: Immediately
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the back section of the barn at least six of the indoor enclosures have a dark brown liquid pooling in the front
section of them. Some of the puddles have feces in them and have a foul odor. The affected enclosures contain at
least thirteen dogs. Puddles of liquid waste can cause the dogs to become soiled and wet and increases the
disease risk. Housing facilities for dogs must be equipped with drainage systems that are constructed and operated
so that animal waste and water are rapidly eliminated and standing puddles of liquid must be drained or mopped up
to ensure animals stay dry and disease risks are minimized. Correction date: June 16, 2015
