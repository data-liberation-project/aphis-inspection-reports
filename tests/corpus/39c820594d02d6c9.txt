Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two female French Bulldogs (#168 and #721) and a female Pomeranian (#407) were examined during the inspection
because they were scratching their sides and had abnormal skin. All three had hair loss along their backs and sides.
They had thickened, scaly skin in these areas with patches of reddened inflamed skin, crusts and scabs where they had
been itching. The French Bulldogs both had sores on the sides of their abdomen about dime to nickel size that were dark
red to brownish with some greenish to yellowish discharge. Many fleas were observed on both French Bulldogs. The
applicant said that she is having a flea problem in the kennel and that many dogs had been having problems. She said
she was giving them Frontline, but it didn't seem to be helping. She said she had not contacted her veterinarian about
these dogs or the flea problem.
Some dogs with fleas have allergic reactions that make them extremely itchy. If unrelieved, this scratching leads to hair
loss, damage to the skin, infections, and sores that are a source of constant discomfort and even pain in advanced cases.
Fleas can also harbor tapeworms that can cause disease in dogs if ingested.
Appropriate methods must be used to prevent, control, and diagnose diseases. Dogs with skin disease must be seen by
a veterinarian and a plan for eliminating fleas and preventing re-infestation must be documented and followed.
