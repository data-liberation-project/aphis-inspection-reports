2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The APHIS 7005 lists 25 adult dogs and the physical inventory of the dogs was 48. Acquisition and other required
information is necessary to know with certainty the identification for movement of dogs and medical treatments. The
APHIS 7005 must be maintained to fully and correctly disclose the required information on each dog purchased or
otherwise acquired, owned, held or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported,
euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. The records must be updated and maintained.

Outdoor housing facilities.
In the outdoor enclosures there are 8 enclosures that do not provide adequate shelter space for each of the dogs. The
shelters are approximately 24 inches in diameter. In 6 of the enclosures, there are 2 medium sized dogs (Shih Tzus) and
in 2 enclosures, there are 3 similar sized dogs. It was observed that when 1 dog was in the shelter, it occupied more than
1/2 of the space, indicating that there was not enough space for the other dog(s) to sit, stand, turn around and lay down in
a normal manner. Adequate shelter space is necessary for the comfort and welfare of the dogs. The owner must provide
more shelter space in these enclosures and maintain it at all times.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care does not provide the required information on testing for heartworm, coccidia and giardia.
There is no frequency of treatment described for intestinal parasites in puppies or adults. There is no information on the
PVC for maintenance of clean and healthy coats, ears, eyes, skin, toenails and teeth. A written preventative health care
program is necessary to ensure that all persons in the facility know with certainty treatment plans and frequency. This is
also necessary for APHIS officials to determine that adequate veterinary care is being provided.
