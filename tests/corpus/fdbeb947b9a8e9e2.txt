FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The Tropics building is in need of attention. Due to the high humidity and moisture that is ever present in this old
building there are sections of the ceiling that have been damaged. There are areas of peeling / flaking paint present.
There are also sections of the old plaster that have broken off the metal lathe. Due to the fact that there are free
roaming primates, and a sloth, in this building that do have access to these areas, the building will need to be
addressed.

SANITATION.
1. At the time of this inspection the North American porcupine was being housed in a stall, in the Bongo barn. The
metal sliding door was noted to have an excessive accumulation of rust along the bottom 6(cid:29). The metal was flaking
off in spots. Due to the fact that this animal was undergoing treatment, from the veterinary staff, it is necessary that
all surfaces need to be maintained in good repair and in such condition as to facilitate the prescribed husbandry
practices set forth in this regulation. Therefore, this door will need to be addressed. ***To Be Corrected By: October 31, 2014
2. The cement floor in the Commissary was also noted to be in need of attention. There are areas that have peeling
paint and some areas with chunks of cement missing. This does not allow for the floor to be readily cleaned. Due to
the fact that the majority of the diets, for the zoo collection, are prepared in this area, the floor will need to be
addressed.
