Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. There were no inventory
indicating the number of adults, weanlings, or newborn guinea pigs present or the number and type of guinea pigs that
died since the previous inspection. Licensee said that he threw out the 2021 calendar which contained this information.
Records need to be kept and maintained on guinea pig held including births and deaths to help keep track of animals and
for evaluating the animal care program. Licensee must ensure that records are kept for animals on hand, births, and
deaths. Correct by January 10, 2022.
