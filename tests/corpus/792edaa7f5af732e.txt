2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Pomeranian microchip #005-008-600 continues to have problems with her teeth and right ear. The upper
teeth remain covered in a dark hard material and her right upper first pre-molar (the tooth far back on the upper right
side just behind the large tooth) of the mouth is still loose to the touch. Though the licensee has been treating the
dog's right ear with an over the counter medication, her right ear continues to have a thick brown discharge matted
in the hair. Tooth problems can be painful and cause further health issues in dogs if not treated. The discharge
from the ear may be a sign of a problem in the ear and needs to be evaluated if it needs proper treatment. To
ensure that this dog is not in pain and receives appropriate treatment have the attending veterinarian evaluate it to
diagnose the ear and teeth problems and treat them per the veterinarian's instructions. Documentation of the dog's
diagnosis must be kept for future inspections.
3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Excessive rust development remains on the metal door flaps in the enclosures of the inside/outside building. The
presence of rust can prevent the surfaces from being properly cleaned and sanitized. Eliminate the rust from the
metal door flaps.
Note--licensee has initiated correction by purchasing paint, however is awaiting optimal weather for application.
3.3(e)(1)(3) REPEAT
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are 3 newly constructed primary enclosures housing 9 dogs in the side room of the whelping kennel where
the wooden supports that are in contact with the animals are not impervious to moisture. Areas that are in contact
with animals but are not imperious to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized to reduce disease hazards,
waste accumulation and odors. Place the wooden supports of these 3 primary enclosures in a condition that is
impervious to moisture. This is a focused inspection of the non-compliances identified at the previous inspection.
The left eye of the now 13 month-old female Pekinese/Pomeranian mix, now identified with microchip #838033045,
has been evaluated by the Attending Veterinarian and documentation of the dog's diagnosis has been provided.
A medication labeled for goats (Safeguard--Fenbendazole) is being used for deworming. The licensee has
consulted with the attending veterinarian on the safety of this medication for dogs and has obtained written
instructions from the attending veterinarian that describe the dose/dosage, route (such as oral, injection, etc), and
use for the medication.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee, Veterinary Medical Officer Debra Sime and Animal Care
Inspector Kimberly Miller.
