2.131(b)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
While conducting a walking inspection at the facility, I observed the hippopotamus keeper cleaning the enclosure by
himself with the animal roaming free in the enclosure. Also the 3 gates leading to the exhibit were left completely
open.
If the hyppo becomes aggressive or decides to walk out of the enclosure because the employee is cleaning or on
the other hand if a member of the public (children) decides to walk inside the enclosure area and there is no one
else with this employee watching the animal or the public, then the employee, the public, and the animal itself will be
put at risk.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible specially when we are dealing with
dangerous animals.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
