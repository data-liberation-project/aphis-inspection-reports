2.40(b)(3) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An 18 year old camel, Pretty Girl, would not rise from a kneeling position. She was also lifting her right forelimb off
the ground as if it were painful. She became agitated and moved away on her knees when the employee and then
the licensee attempted to encourage her to rise.
The licensee stated he had her on glucosamine, but not anti-inflammatories because he was told by some exotic
animal veterinarians and "Kentucky vets" (equine) that those medications were not useful. There are no written
instructions for the equine-formulated glucosamine product.
The Attending Veterinarian (AV) must be involved with plans for addressing chronic animal health conditions in
order to reduce animal discomfort and avoid suffering. Any medications or supplements given her that are not
labeled for use in camels must be used only with written instructions from the AV.
Correct by consulting with the AV as soon as possible and developing and implementing a treatment plan by close
of business on Friday, April 6, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
The inspection was also accompanied by a USDA APHIS VS VMO.
