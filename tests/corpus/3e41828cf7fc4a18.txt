On December 15, 2014 the attending veterinarian noted that an adult male Yorkshire terrier, USDA tag 90, had
grade 4 dental disease. According to the program of veterinary care, any non-pregnant animal noted to have grade
3 or grade 4 dental disease should have its teeth cleaned by a licensed veterinarian. The licensee indicated during
the inspection that the animals mouth had not been cleaned or otherwise treated by a veterinarian. The adult
Yorkshire terrier, USDA tag 90, was noted to have severe dental disease during the inspection. The animal had a
heavy buildup of tan material on the canine teeth, pre-molars and molars. Several teeth on both sides of the mouth
were loose and several others were missing. The gums appeared reddened and were receding from the teeth.
There was a small pocket of puss between the gum and the tooth one of the left upper cheek teeth.
The program of veterinary care as well as instructions from the attending veterinarian should be followed to ensure
adequate care for the animals. Untreated dental disease may lead to problems consuming food as well as several
conditions, such as cardiac disease, that affect the health and well-being of the animal. The licensee shall have
appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other
aspects of animal care and use.

that this female had weaned a litter of puppies two weeks prior to the inspection and he believed that this was the
cause for the hair loss. The licensee had noted that the animal had hair loss and indicated that the condition had
been improving, but had not treated the animal or consulted with the veterinarian. The current program of veterinary
care has specific instructions for the treatment of hair loss/alopecia. The licensee failed to provide care as written in
the program of veterinary care. Hair loss has many causes including inflammatory processes, trauma, and hormonal
imbalance. Without proper treatment or consulting a licensed veterinarian, the underlying issue may not be properly
identified and resolved.
The program of veterinary care as well as instructions from the attending veterinarian should be followed to ensure
adequate care for the animals. The licensee shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat
diseases and injuries.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were several areas throughout the entire inside adult area where raw wood was exposed on the framing of
the enclosures. There were several areas where the wood appeared to be saturated with waste or urine. In
addition the outside exercise area was primarily constructed of raw wood. These surfaces cannot be properly
cleaned and sanitized and contributes the strong odor within the facility. All solid surfaces within the facility must be
able to be readily cleaned and sanitized or replaced when they become warn or soiled.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
This facility has an outdoor area that is used for exercise. This area does not have a shelter structure for the
animals to get into during inclement weather. Without a shelter structure these dogs would not have a place to seek
shelter from the wind, rain or snow. The Licensee must ensure that all animals have access to a shelter structure
while the animals are housed in this area or the area is being used for exercise purposes.
