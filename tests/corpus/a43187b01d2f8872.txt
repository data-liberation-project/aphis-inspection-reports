2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has an attending veterinarian and a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for the rabbits and
guinea pigs; however, the written PVC is not complete.
-The PVC lists "(cid:28)Revolution"(cid:29) and (cid:28)"Fenbendazole"(cid:29) in the parasite control program. There is no other information or
directions such as dosage, route of administration, frequency, or concentration listed on the PVC for these
treatments.
-The PVC has no information describing the provisions of emergency, weekend, or holiday care provided at this
facility.
-The PVC also indicates (cid:28)"Euthanasia Solution"(cid:29) for the method of euthanasia without any other details regarding
dosages, route of administration, or information regarding the class of drug. This needs to be specified to ensure
that the solution used meets the requirements of the AVMA Panel on Euthanasia.
The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian and develop a complete and accurate written program of
veterinary care that reflects the practices at this facility. The written program of veterinary care will ensure that there
is accurate communication between the licensee and the attending veterinarian and ensure that all routine
medications provided to the animals by the licensee are done with the direction and knowledge of the attending
veterinarian.
