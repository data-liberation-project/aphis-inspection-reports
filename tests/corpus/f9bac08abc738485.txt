HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the fenced area between the kennel buildings, the grass has become overgrown. The area is where the dogs are
allowed to exercise. The weeds and grasses must be maintained so pests and other vermin, can easily be
controlled. High weeds and grasses provided potential breeding areas for these unwanted pests. The pest can
adversely affect the health and well-being of the dogs. To be corrected by 09-29-2016.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The drainage system needs to be repaired. The system has several open trenches around the outdoor portions of
the kennel building. The weeds have grown around the area where the standing water accumulates. These
accumulations of water and waste material can harbor vermin and other disease hazards that can adversely affect
the health and well-being of the dogs. Licensee must repair or replace broken pipe or other problems causing the
leaks. The drainage system should be sealed and the waste water and material removed from the area where the
dogs are kept. To be corrected by 09-30-2016.
