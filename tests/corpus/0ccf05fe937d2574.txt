Housing facilities, general.
One non-human primate housing area contained an excessive amount of unused materials, including cleaning supplies,
unused equipment, and research supplies. Cluttered animal areas can present sanitation challenges and confined space
hazards. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment, furniture, or
stored material. Corrected during inspection.

This inspection (February 1 - 3) and exit interview (February 3) were conducted with facility representatives.
