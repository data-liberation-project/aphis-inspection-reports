2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****On 2/16/2017 a Ewe delivered one dead lamb. Over the next four days this Ewe was not eating hay and very
little grain or treats. During this time period, the facility representative contacted the Attending Veterinarian who
recommended treatment with antibiotic and vitamins. The ewe was found dead 2/20/2017.
****On 2/21/2017 the facility representative noticed another ewe attempting to give birth. He contacted the Attending
Veterinarian who recommended antibiotic and vitamins. About nine hours later the facility representative observed a
lamb's nose protruding from the vagina of the ewe. He again contacted the Attending Veterinarian who instructed
him to reposition the lamb internally. The facility representative was able to deliver the lamb, but it was dead. About
twenty minutes later the ewe delivered a second dead lamb. Five to six hours later the facility representative
observed the ewe trying to deliver a third lamb. It was also malpositioned so the facility representative repositioned
the lamb internally. He was able to deliver the lamb, but it was dead. The facility representative did not know if the
ewe passed the afterbirths. For the next three days the ewe was weak, unable to rise on it's own and would not eat
hay. On 2/25/2017 the ewe was found dead.
Even though the facility representative contacted a veterinarian and provided treatment, neither of the animals were
examined and diagnosed by a veterinarian despite little or no improvement in the animals' conditions. The lack of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries can result in ongoing illness and
death. The licensee must ensure that adequate veterinary care is provided at all times including nights, weekends
and holidays.
TO BE CORRECTED: FROM THIS POINT FORWARD
