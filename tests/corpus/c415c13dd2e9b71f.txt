3.4(b) DIRECT REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
There were two adult, chocolate Labrador Retrievers in outdoor enclosures that did not have adequate shelter. At
11am on 5/8/14 the licensee had moved the dogs from two separate enclosures without shade or shelter into one of
the enclosures together. The licensee hung a black material over a corner of the enclosure to provide shade.
However, the licensee only provided one medium size dog house. This dog house was not large enough for both
animals to seek shelter in. The National Weather Service predicts rain and thunderstorms for the next 5 days.
Adequate shelter is necessary to protect the animals from the elements. The licensee shall provide one or more
shelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each outdoor facility, and that are large enough to allow
each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. In addition to
the shelter structures, one or more separate outside areas of shade must be provided, large enough to contain all
the animals at one time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun. Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs or
cats must contain a roof, four sides, and a floor.
.A focused inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee on May 8, 2014. The non-compliant item
was discussed with the licensee during the inspection. This inspection was limited to the direct item 3.4b found
during a routine inspection on May 7,2014
