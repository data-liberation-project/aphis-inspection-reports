ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The 18 year old white Siberian tiger identified as Niko was cited on 1/15/2014. Following that inspection the
licensee contacted the attending veterinarian(cid:25)s associate by phone who prescribed 7.5mg of Meloxicam (an
anti-inflammatory medication) once a day for pain associated with presumptive arthritis. The animal has been on
this medication for 14 days and was still displaying significant signs of pain and suffering at the time of inspection.
When initially approached Niko was laying down in the den box area. Both the licensee and inspectors
unsuccessfully attempted to coax the animal out of the shelter. Niko slowly and unsteadily attempted to stand
several times, however, with each attempt his hind legs were trembling and he quickly sat or lay back down. After
several attempts, Niko eventually was able to stand up; however, he would not move around or come out of the
shelter. The animal stood for a short period of time (less than 2 minutes) with hind legs trembling and then
appeared weak and unsteady when he was trying to lie back down. Later during the inspection Niko was observed
standing and briefly walking out of his den box to urinate. During this limited movement, he continued to appear
unsteady and had a significantly abnormal gait which appeared tender / painful (worse than on the previous
inspection). The current treatment (oral Meloxicam) is not effectively treating this condition. The Licensee stated
that the animal had no significant signs of improvement since the last inspection. He also stated that the animal
was not feeling very well and was even worse on the colder days. Despite the worsening of this condition the
licensee failed to contact the attending veterinarian or his associate to report that there was a continued decline of
the animal(cid:25)s condition despite the prescribed treatment. According to the accuweather forecast, today had a high of
43 degrees and is expected continue to drop down to a low of 6 degrees by the beginning of next week. This
animal is already exhibiting significant signs of pain and suffering. If the animal(cid:25)s condition is worsened with the
cold weather, the animal(cid:25)s pain and suffering will continue to increase as the temperatures decrease in the near
future.
Following identification of the worsening condition by APHIS Officials and instruction that the licensee needed to
contact the Attending Veterinarian (AV) to communicate regarding the health of this animal and ongoing treatment
plan, the licensee did contact the AV. The attending veterinarian later confirmed that the Licensee notified him that
Niko was not improving shortly after the inspectors left the facility. The inspectors showed the attending veterinarian
a video of the animal attempting to get up. He agreed that the animal is in pain and that Tramadol should likely be
given to alleviate some of the pain. He farther stated that Meloxicam should not be given for more than three daysbecause of the potential for causing kidney damage. The Attending Veterinarian later went to the property to
assess Niko and did prescribe Tramadol for pain relief.
Without proper methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat serious health issues, animals can undergo
unnecessary health risks that can cause pain, suffering and the potential for death.
Serious signs of pain and suffering must be addressed with the attending veterinarian as soon as they are identified.
Additionally, the Licensee must contact the Attending Veterinarian when a prescribed medication or treatment plan
does not appear to be effective or the condition worsens.
***An approximately six to seven year old male black leopard identified by the licensee as Backara appeared to be
significantly underweight at the time of inspection. Although this animal was lean at the last inspection, there
appears to have been significant weight loss in the past 2 weeks. The skeletal structure is now readily apparent
along the topline. Individual vertebrae are easily visible even from a safe viewing distance and despite the winter
hair. Additionally, the pelvic structure and hips are also now readily apparent. Skeletal structure becomes more
prominent as fat and muscle tissue are lost during periods of starvation. The licensee stated that he has been
feeding this animal 20 lbs of meat (chicken thighs) daily since the last inspection. Barring significant underlying
medical problems, this appears inconsistent with the significant decline in weight seen in this animal.
***An eight year old male black leopard identified as Jumonji is now severely underweight. Although this animal
was lean at the last inspection, there appears to have been significant weight loss in the past 2 weeks. The skeletal
structure is now readily apparent along the topline, pelvis, and shoulder. Additionally this animal has developed
significant hair loss and open wounds in several locations including the legs, tail, and face. Individual vertebrae are
now easily visible even from a safe viewing distance and the pelvic structure and hips are also readily apparent.
Additionally the skeletal structure of the shoulder is also apparent. Skeletal structure becomes more prominent as
fat and muscle tissue are lost during periods of starvation. The licensee stated that he has been feeding this animal
20 lbs of meat (chicken thighs) daily since the last inspection. Barring significant underlying medical problems, this
appears inconsistent with the significant decline in weight seen in this animal. In addition to the significant loss of
body condition, since the previous inspection Jumonji has developed several areas of hair loss on its front legs, hind
quarter, rear hock, face, tail and the back of the neck. The right front leg has an area of hair loss extending from the
toes half way to the elbow. The skin is generally moist, bright pink and red in some areas. Additionally, there
several areas with red tinged discharge. The left front leg has an area of hair loss on outside aspect of paw and leg
(approx. 3 inches in length) with 1 inch long moist red lesion. The back right leg has an area of hair loss that is
approximately three inches and has an approximately 2 inch red lesion centrally. On the left hip area there is a 4-5
inch long area of hair loss. Both the upper and lower corner of the left eye has one inch area of hair loss. Finally,
the last 3-4 inches of the tail has a large area of hair loss where the much of underlying skin appears to be missing.
The tissue is moist red and raw in appearance and much of the discharge appears to be fresh and dried blood.
The Licensee informed inspectors that this issue started about two days ago and that this animal has had this issue
several times in the past. He stated that he had not contacted the attending veterinarian and instead begantreatment similar to what he had used previously. This treatment consists of feeding 1cc of Ivermectin daily
(injected into the meat source that will be fed to the animal). The licensee stated that this treatment has been
successful in the past for resolving the issue within two weeks. The attending veterinarian later confirmed that a
combination of Ivermectin and Prednisone has been a successful treatment for the hair loss and lesions in the past
and that these lesions typically appear during the winter months. He also confirmed that they have previously taken
skin scrapings with no conclusive results for diagnosis. After identification of this animal by APHIS Official, the
licensee did contact the Attending Veterinarian who visited the property and prescribed Prednisone for the treatment
of the hair loss and wounds.
***The three year old female white tiger named Tamara that was cited on 1/15/2015 still appeared to be significantly
underweight at today(cid:25)s inspection. Although there appeared to be minimal improvement, the vertebral bodies were
still readily apparent and the pelvic structure is still readily apparent. The licensee reported that he has been giving
the animal 20 pounds of chicken and or deer meat every day since the last inspection on 1/15/2015.
When otherwise healthy young adult and adult underweight / emaciated tigers are offered appropriate feed for
several weeks significant improvement in body condition is expected. The lack of significant weight gain with
respect to Tamara therefore indicates either the animal is not receiving adequate feed or an underlying medical
condition exists which is increasing caloric demands or preventing adequate utilization of food. Additionally, the
rapid weight loss of the two black leopards Jumonji and Backara is a significant indicator that intervention
(modifications to feeding, appropriate veterinary diagnosis, etc) is necessary. Weight loss, or failure to gain weight
as expected, are significant indicators that additional veterinary care is necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of
any underlying medical conditions and / or re-evaluation of the feeding plan. Prolonged hunger from chronic
malnutrition and starvation are distressful to animals and results in unnecessary suffering. Correct by ensuring that
each of these animals are examined by a licensed veterinarian and that an individual treatment plan is made to
address any necessary diagnostic testing and routine monitoring of weight (or body condition) recommended by the
veterinarian that is necessary to rule out underlying disease and monitor future changes in condition. Additionally,
the licensee must seek specific guidance from the veterinarian regarding necessary changes to the feeding plan
and / or additional treatments that are necessary and maintain documentation of these recommendations and all
subsequent care provided by the licensee for evaluation by APHIS Officials.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection, the two black leopards and two tigers (described above) were in need of veterinary care
and were either not observed by the licensee or their conditions were not communicated to the Attending
Veterinarian prior to inspection. *** Regarding the 6-7 year old male leopard identified as Backara, when asked what the licensee thought about this
animal(cid:25)s weight, he stated that it was (cid:28)fine(cid:29). The licensee failed to properly identify that this animal is extremely
underweight and as a result did not report this weight loss to the attending veterinarian prior to today(cid:25)s inspection.
*** Regarding the leopard identified as Jumonji, although the Licensee stated that he had observed the weight loss,
hair loss and open wounds, he failed to communicate these observations to the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner. The licensee stated that he did not feel that the weight loss, hair loss or lesions were abnormal for this
animal. He farther stated that he would feed and feed the (cid:28)cat(cid:29) and it just wouldn(cid:25)t gain any weight. He also stated
that the hair loss and lesions were common in black leopards and was a consistent issue with this animal in the
winter. There was no written guidance from the attending veterinarian authorizing the use of ivermectin for hair
loss, wounds, or weight loss in leopards or directing whether this drug would be effective alone or only in
combination with prednisone as previously used.
*** Regarding the 18 year old tiger identified as Niko, the Licensee stated that he knew this animal was in pain and
showed no signs of improvement after 14 days of treatment with Meloxicam. In addition, the Licensee stated that
he had seen the animal(cid:25)s condition worsen in colder temperatures. Despite the animal(cid:25)s declining condition the
Licensee failed to contact the Attending veterinarian to communicate these observations even while knowing that
the treatment appeared ineffective the animal continued to show significant signs of pain and suffering.
***Regarding the three year old female tiger identified as Tamara, despite observing her failure to gain weight the
licensee failed to consult the attending veterinarian and establish an effective diet plan to achieve the animal(cid:25)s ideal
weight and body condition or determine if additional diagnostic testing is necessary to rule out an additional disease
process.
The Licensee failed to communicate timely and accurate information on the above listed matters of animal health,
behavior, and well-being to the Attending Veterinarian in an in a timely manner. Failure to accurately report these
conditions in a timely manner delays the provision of appropriate care and can prolong unnecessary suffering and
potentially allow for progression of disease. The licensee must provide an effective method of communication so
that problems are reported to a veterinarian in an timely and accurate manner.
*** A 1-year old female cougar identified by the licensee as Makhia was found dead by the licensee since the last
inspection. This animal was observed by inspectors during the previous inspection and was found to be in poor
body condition (significantly underweight) at that time. The licensee stated that he found her inside the den a few
days prior to this inspection and that he believed her death resulted from injuries sustained by the other 1-year old
female cougar housed in the same enclosure (identified as Abby). An accurate or precise date of the animal(cid:25)s
death could not be established due to conflicting statements made by the licensee and the attending veterinarian.
The licensee stated that the AV had examined the body of the dead cougar and determined her death was caused
by the cage mate. The AV later informed inspectors that the he had not seen the cougar(cid:25)s body and only heardabout the incident the day of inspection (29 January). Without a post mortem examination, it is impossible to
determine whether this death resulted from aggression / trauma from a cage mate (as suspected by the licensee),
the effects of prolonged malnutrition / starvation, or another disease process. Given the number of other large cats
present on this property in poor body condition and / or actively losing weight, determining a cause of death is
necessary to evaluate the continued risk to other animals in the population. Failure to communicate this death to
the attending veterinarian in a timely manner prevented them from providing adequate guidance regarding
necessary post mortem testing that could yield important information used to prevent disease progression (whether
from infectious cause or inadequate feeding) or provide guidance on other issues of animal welfare such as
appropriate segregation of aggressive animals which could be used by the facility to prevent future suffering of other
animals at this facility. Correct by ensuring that information regarding all unexpected animal deaths are
communicated to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner and ensuring that appropriate postmortem
examinations are conducted in order to provide adequate veterinary care.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The seven year old male cougar identified as Montana is housed in an outdoor enclosure constructed of 4x4 inch
cattle type fencing for both the walls and roof. This enclosure contained only two raised platforms and one standard
igloo dog house. This animal does not have an adequate shelter structure to be protected from adverse winter
weather common to the local climatic conditions such as the direct effects of cold wind, snow, and rain. The igloo
style dog house is too small to comfortably accommodate this animal and the only wind break consists of a lock-out
type cage which has no solid roof and does not protect the animal from rain, sleet or snow. The lack of adequate
shelter is exacerbated by insufficient drainage (described below) which prevents the animal from having a clean dry
location to sit, stand or lie down. The lack of shelter directly exposes this animal to all weather extremes and
conditions can cause significant suffering by impeding the animal(cid:25)s ability to maintain normal body temperature.
The Licensee must ensure that all animals have an adequate shelter structure that is large enough for the animal to
fit comfortably while being protected from adverse weather conditions that could cause discomfort.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor enclosure housing the 7 year-old male cougar identified as Montana does not have adequate drainage.
The entire floor space of the enclosure, the lockout, igloo style doghouse, and raised platforms were covered withmud and snow. There were several large puddles in the corners of this enclosure covering at least 30% of the floor
space. The cougar had mud covering the tail, all 4 paws, and lower portion of the legs up to the level of the carpus
and hocks. Prior to the inspection there was snow and warming temperatures had caused the snow to melt. The
licensee stated that the enclosure was muddy and the standing water was present only because of the snow. He
stated that the snow gets into the pen and as it melts the enclosure becomes wet. Additionally, he stated he covers
the enclosure with a 3 inch layer of mulch to ensure that the enclosure stays dry. When asked how frequently he
does that, the licensee replied (cid:28)a couple of times a year(cid:29). No mulch was evident on the floor of this enclosure.
Large feline carnivores must have access to a dry clean space. The inability to access dry housing area is
distressful and when prolonged, may lead to the development of husbandry and sanitation related illness such as
skin infections. Constant environmental moisture not only can promote infections but also affects the animal(cid:25)s
ability to thermoregulate. This lack of suitable drainage and dry housing conditions is exacerbated by cold winter
temperatures (recently below freezing and forecasted to be below freezing again in the near future) and lack of
suitable shelter. Correct by ensuring there is suitable method to rapidly eliminate excess water from the enclosure.

FEEDING.
The facility currently has an ineffective feeding program for big cats and is unable to maintain animals in good
health. All of the animals at this facility are still suffering from the effects of inadequate feeding by the licensee and
are at significant risk of farther deterioration if the feeding program is not quickly improved. Of the 8 large feline
carnivores at the facility, three (2 leopards and 1 tiger) were determined to be severely malnourished and are not
being provided with sufficient quantity or quality of food to maintain the animals in good health. The physical
condition of each individual animal is described in detail above. When interviewed following the inspection, the
attending veterinarian stated he thought the large feline carnivores were thin and he estimated their body condition
to be (cid:28)2 out of 5(cid:29). There was no meat or meat storage available for inspection. When instructed, the licensee did
produce two chicken thighs and when one was offered to the black leopard identified as Jumonji who appeared
ravenous snatching the chicken and running off to eat it. Based on conflicting statements made by the licensee
regarding his current feeding practices it appears that none of the large cats at this facility are receiving adequate
food.
According to the licensee, he does not store meat on the property and buys fresh meat every day or two. When
asked where he keeps stored meat the licensee stated he (cid:28)keeps it at Kroger(cid:29) and farther stated that APHIS
Officials could call them if we wanted. The licensee stated that he feeds two 40 lb cases of chicken thighs (80 lbs
total) each day to provide meat for all of his meat-eating animals (3 tigers, 3 leopards, 2 cougar, 3 bears, 1 bobcat,
3 foxes, 2 wolves). According to the feeding plan provided by the facility these animals should be receiving a total
of 147.5 to 179.5 lbs of meat daily (with no fasting days). When asked about individual animal feeding the licensee
stated that he is feeding approximately 20 lbs of meat each day to each of the tigers, leopards, cougar, and bear.
The licensee was asked for the amounts fed to each species and individual several times during the inspection andthe amounts described ranged from 16-20 lbs for all species (including the smaller cats). This is in excess of the
amounts specified by the feeding plan for the cougars and leopards. Feeding each of these animals 20 lbs per day
would require 220lbs of meat daily (not including that fed to the fox, bobcat, and wolves) and is inconsistent with
previous statements that he is purchasing and feeding 80 lbs total each day. When asked where he purchases
meat, the licensee stated that he obtains it from the local Kroger supermarket. The meat manager at this store
reported that the licensee has only picked up twice in the last three weeks (on 1/8/15 and a few days later). Both
pick-ups were for 4 cases (a total of 320 lbs in the last 3 weeks). According to the nutrition program signed by the
AV, this would provide enough meat for only 2 days. In addition to the purchased meat, the licensee also reports
feeding deer donated from Ohio Department of Transportation and other sources. The timing and quantity of the
donated meat is unpredictable and unreliable. The licensee has no records of the donated meat, so the quantity
could not be verified. The licensee indicated multiple times he was having money problems. He stated he wanted to
make improvements (cid:28)but everything cost money(cid:29). Based on the conflicting statements made by the licensee it is
unclear how much meat or what type is actually being fed to the animals. It is clear, however, based on the poor
body condition shown by several animals that the current feeding practices are inadequate to maintain all of these
animals in good health. Since the previous inspection the one cougar (the adult female cited on the previous report)
appears to have gained a moderate amount of weight, however, this animal remains underweight and several other
animals now have a noticeable weight loss. The animals currently most severely affected include the two black
leopards (Jumonji & Backara) and the female white tiger (Tamara). Prolonged failure to feed an adequate amount
(or appropriate type) of feed results in weight loss and chronic malnutrition. Additionally, prolonged hunger from
chronic malnutrition and starvation are distressful to the animals and results in unnecessary suffering. When left
uncorrected this is likely to result in death and one other cougar previously identified as underweight recently died
from an undetermined cause. During periods of cold weather, animals such as these with inadequate fat reserves
are at significant risk of farther discomfort, disease and death. All licensees must ensure that animals are fed food
which is wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain
all animals in good health. The financial concerns expressed by the licensee combined with the lack of food on the
property, the inability to store meat, and apparent underfeeding of all big cats show a clear immediate risk to all
large cats present at the facility. Purchasing food on a daily or alternate day basis (as described by the licensee) is
clearly not working to provide adequate nutrition in this case. The licensee must have adequate facilities and stored
food to continue to meet the nutritional needs of these animals during periods of time that meat cannot be
purchased (such as inclement weather or insufficient supply). Correct by ensuring that adequate amounts of
properly stored meat are present on the property to provide adequate nutrition to all animals even during periods of
inclement weather or insufficient supply. The licensee shall provide at least one week(cid:25)s feeding requirements for all
carnivores, maintained in appropriate facilities in which to properly store and thaw the meat for consumption in order
to ensure that all of the big cats have adequate quantity and quality of food to provide for proper nutrition without
compromising the nutritional needs of the other animals. To reiterate the current feeding practices are inadequate
to maintain these big cats and all of these animals are at risk of malnutrition, starvation, suffering, and death.
Additionally the Licensee must maintain receipts of all food purchased or donated and provide this documentation to
APHIS Officials upon request. Correct by: 8 A.M. on 31 January 2015 The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. No animals shall be removed from the
premises or location without prior approval from USDA, APHIS, Animal Care.
