2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On April 25, 2016 two groups of Japanese Macaque’s were introduced. One female identified as “Yoko” was injured
during the introduction and sustained more injuries overnight according to keeper records. The animal was
observed to have additional injuries on April 27 and on April 28 she was observed huddling in a corner and did not
eat her mid-day or pm diet. There were no daily observations made for this animal the next two days and on May 1,
2016 she had wounds apparent, her eyes were closed and she was shaking. On May 3, 2016 she was examined by
the vet and humanely euthanized due to extent of her injuries. There is no indication in the records that “Yoko’s”
condition was communicated to the vet in a timely manner. The facility stated that the veterinarian can access the
daily keeper logs for all animals and is sent a report for these issues but there is no follow up information indicating
the vet was aware of the extent of injuries. Given the number of animals at the facility and the severity of these
injuries reliance on checking daily logs is not considered adequate communication. Additionally there are no records
for three days when the animal was showing visible signs that she was in pain and potential distress. The facility
needs to address the mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that accurate and timely information for
problems on animal health and behavior is conveyed to the attending vet.

2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On April 25, 2016 two groups of Japanese Macaque’s were introduced. One female identified as “Yoko” was injured
during the introduction and sustained more injuries over the next several days, went off feed and began to separate
from the troupe. This lasted for a period of 9 days until she was examined by the vet and then euthanized due to
injuries. Records noted the animal was following the troupe but also staying away from the other animals. Two
animals in particular “Kathy” and “Debbi” were noted to be aggressive to “Yoko”. Despite observations that the
introduction with “Yoko” was going poorly and resulted in multiple injuries over the entire period, the facility made no
alterations to the introduction plan that could have minimized additional injury and stress. Additionally there were
multiple days for which no observations were recorded despite the seriousness of this issue. It is recognized thatnon-human primate introductions can be challenging due to the nature of the animals, however the handling of
these animals during introductions needs to minimize physical harm and unnecessary discomfort.

3.75(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The roof over the Vanishing South building which houses several species of non human primates still needs to
have one section addressed. There is one large hole in the ceiling that has not been patched up where water
damage is still evident. Housing facilities for non human primates must be kept in good repair for the safety of the
animals and to facilitate cleaning of the area.
