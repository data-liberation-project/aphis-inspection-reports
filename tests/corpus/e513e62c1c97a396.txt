3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The outdoor housing facility had gravel floors with excessive amount of fecal build-up. The licensee stated he
has not been spot cleaning the gravel in the enclosures. A build up of feces is a disease hazard and can attract
pest. The licensee must ensure all surfaces which come in contact with the dogs are spot cleaned daily.
Contaminated material must be replaced whenever this raking and spot-cleaning is not sufficient to prevent or
eliminate odors, insects, pests, or vermin infestation.

3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** The 2 outdoor enclosures housing a total of 10 dogs which had 6 shelters that did not have wind/rain breaks at
the entrance. Since it's a open, straight entrance into the shelters, with no flaps or doors, the dogs are not
adequately protected from the elements. The dogs need effective wind and rain breaks on their outdoor shelter units
to protect them from the elements and help keep them dry. The licensee must provide adequate wind and rain
breaks at the entrances of all the outdoor shelter units.
