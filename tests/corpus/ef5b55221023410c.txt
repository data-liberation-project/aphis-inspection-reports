HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the chimpanzee's indoor housing facility there was excessive paint chipping on the metal areas and on the
walls. The paint on the metal was separating from the surfaces and actively chipping off. This should be repaired to
prevent ingestion of chipped paint. All surfaces must be maintained regularly and the surfaces should be able to be
sanitized to minimize disease hazards. Correct by September 20, 2017.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the red river hog primary enclosure there was buried wire panel that had become exposed due to rain runoff.
The exposed wire with sharp pointy ends could potentially injure the animal. The wire in the outdoor housing facility
should be repaired and/or replaced to prevent injury. Corrected by exit interview.
** In the cheetah's indoor housing facility an exposed nail was observed due to a missing board. The exposed nail
could potentially cause injury to the animal. The nail should be removed and/or repaired to prevent injury of the
animal. Corrected by exit interview.
** The paint on the ceiling of the North American black bears indoor primary enclosure was peeling off and could
potentially be ingested by the bears. The housing facility should be kept in good repair to prevent harm and for the
good health and well-being of the animals. Correct by August 4, 2017.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the hay barn there was an abundance of loose hay covering the floor. There was evidence of feces from pests
observed in the hay barn. The contamination of the animal's hay could cause illness. The hay barn should be
cleaned out of excessive hay. The pest control management should be reevaluated and established to minimize
contamination of stored hay. Correct by August 4, 2017.3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the pygmy hippo primary outdoor enclosure an empty chip bag was observed floating in the water source. The
empty chip bag could potentially pose harm to the animal. Corrected by exit interview.
** In the black bear primary outdoor enclosure a juice box was observed floating in the water source. The juice box
could potentially pose harm to the animal. Corrected by exit interview.
** In the North America indoor housing facility latex gloves were improperly disposed of in the drain. The gloves
could pose as a disease hazard and prevent drainage function. Correct by July 28, 2017.
Trash and debris should be properly disposed of in order to protect the animal and prevent disease.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** Within the primary enclosures of North America and Asia's outdoor stalls there was an accumulation of standing
water that was not properly draining. Water was observed pooling with residue of green growth which resembled
algae. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water for the well-being of the animals.
Correct by August 18, 2017.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
** In the cheetah primary indoor enclosure ants were observed crawling on the ground where the animals were
being fed and up on the walls. In addition, ants were observed in other areas of the park such as the lion indoor
enclosure and in the Asia, Africa and North America barns. However, in the South America indoor and outdoor
primary enclosures there were no ants observed. The pest management program is effective in these exhibits and
its husbandry practices should be considered throughout the rest of the park.
Ants could potentially contaminate food sources and cause discomfort to the animals. A safe and effective pest
management program needs to be established by pulling food earlier in the day, cleaning earlier, and revising the
current pest control program. Correct by August 21, 2017.
