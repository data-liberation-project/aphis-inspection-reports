The available inventory of animals on hand was not accurate at the time of inspection, including animals that are located

3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
In the mountain lion enclosure, the divider for the lockout had a panel of damaged fence that created sharp points, and
the animal has access to both sides of the fence. Enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury.

Corrected at the time of inspection by removing the damaged panel.
3.131(c)



Sanitation.
The walk-in freezer where frozen prey diets are kept had an excessive accumulation of debris and dropped food items in
the floor slats. The accumulation of debris and other food items in food storage areas can attract pests as well as pose a
risk to the animals’ health due to contamination of food. Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.

Corrected at the time of inspection
