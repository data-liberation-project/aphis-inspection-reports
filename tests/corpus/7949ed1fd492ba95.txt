ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The registrant has documented in the facility SOP(cid:25)s that the attending veterinarian will visit once a week to assess
the health of the animals. At the time of this inspection the veterinarian had not been for a visit in at least a month.
Research facilities with part time attending veterinarians must have a formal arrangement with the veterinarian that
includes regularly scheduled visits to the facility. The regularly scheduled visits agreed upon between this facility
and the veterinarian have not been occurring. The registrant and the veterinarian need to agree upon a schedule
for visits and stick to that schedule.
