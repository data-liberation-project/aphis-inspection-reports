3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There is soiled bedding underneath the loose hay in the guinea pig enclosures. The bottom of the plastic tubs has a
stain buildup. Enclosures are not being cleaned adequately or often enough to remove accumulations of soiled
bedding and the stain buildup. The cleaning process utilized is not effective in removing this accumulation. Primary
enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and debris and
enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods described in section 3.31(a)(4).
Inadequate cleaning and/or sanitization can increase the risk of disease and cause the animals to become ill.
Licensee must establish a program to keep the enclosures clean to ensure the health of the animals.
