The licensee declined specific diagnostic procedures for the hedgehog as recommended by the veterinarian. The
hedgehog was presented to the veterinarian with ataxia and several quills missing. The veterinarian stated that she
recommended diagnostics because of the ataxia, but the license holder declined. As a result, no treatment has
been initiated for the ataxia. Untreated veterinary care issues can cause distress and suffering in animals.
The veterinarian must have the authority to ensure provisions of adequate veterinary care.
To be corrected: From the day forward.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Excessive feces are present in the older mountain coati enclosure. The coati is housed in a large black collapsible
dog crate with a clear Tupperware container with very little bedding inside. The bedding was soiled and the floor
had feces smeared and tracked around the enclosure. Feces can harbor and spread disease.
Clean and sanitize the coati enclosure. Repeat often enough to prevent buildup.3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Excessive amounts of flies are still present in the upstairs animal room housing the three juvenile Patagonian
cavies, the two mountain coatis, and the hedgehog. The license holder has placed several sticky fly traps around
the room; however, there are still excessive amounts of flies on the walls, in the animal enclosures, and on the
animals. Flies carry and spread disease.
Implement an effective program to control the flies at the facility.
