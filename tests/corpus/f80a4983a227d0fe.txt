2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The licensee had a litter of 9 corgi puppies. The licensee put a heat lamp on the puppies in an insulated dog house
at day 1. On day 2 the licensee docked the puppy tails and noticed them crying in the afternoon. The licensee
thought it was because of the tail docking. The puppies settled down at night when the sun went down. The next
day about noon the licensee went out to check the puppies and they were and were gasping for air do to being
overheated from the heat lamp. The licensee contacted the veterinarian but the 4 puppies died prior to any
veterinary intervention.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Heat lamps shall be used with caution to ensure that dogs and puppies are not overheated and that the use of the
lamp does not cause discomfort or death.
To be corrected from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
