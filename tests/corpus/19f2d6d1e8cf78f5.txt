Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee does not have records of disposition for any of the animals that were sold or otherwise removed from the
inventory, nor a current, written inventory of animals on-hand. Records containing the required information for animals on-
hand, animals disposed of or acquired for use in regulated activities, including those offspring born on premises, are
necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their humane care and use.
The licensee shall make, keep and maintain an inventory of animals on-hand, as well as records of acquisition and
disposition for all animals, that fully and correctly disclose the required information.

Sanitation.
In the metal enclosure containing three adult ferrets, there is an ~1/2" to 1" thick sheet of particle board between the
bottom of the enclosure and the shaved wood bedding. The board emits a very noticeable ammonia/fecal odor; it is damp
and discolored with urine and feces that penetrate the wood. Surfaces that cannot be cleaned and disinfected contribute
to an unhealthy environment for the animals because they can harbor harmful microbes, attract pests and vermin, and
release fumes that can be irritating or harmful to the animals.


The licensee must ensure that excreta can be and is removed from primary enclosures to prevent contamination of the
animals contained therein, minimize health hazards and reduce odors.
