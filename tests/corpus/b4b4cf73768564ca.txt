3.6(a)(2)(11)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** There is a female schnauzer in a whelping enclosure where the box is too short for her. When the dog is in the
box her head touches the top of the box and she does not have sufficient space to stand in a comfortable manner.
In addition the opening between the box and wire mesh is too small for her to comfortably move through. This
opening should also be enlarged for her comfort and well being. This box needs to be addressed for the larger dogs
breeding at the facility so that they have sufficient space to move comfortably.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** There is an accumulation of hair and debris hanging underneath the wire mesh enclosures. This hair can trap
urine and fecal debris causing a strong odor in the kennel area. In addition there is fecal material trapped between
the wire mesh and center support beams underneath the enclosures. Primary enclosures need to be sanitized at
least once every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to prevent this accumulation from occurring. This needs to be
addressed for the health of the dogs.
