ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:20 pm on
01-FEB-17.
** I arrived at the facility at 12:20 pm. The gate was locked and no one was available so I called the office. No one
was available so I called the operator. I was told that someone would be contacted. A maintenance crew tried to
contact the caretaker but was unable to get them. I waited until 1:00 pm and then left the premises.
