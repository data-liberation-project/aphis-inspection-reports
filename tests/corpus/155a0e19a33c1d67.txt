The right eye of an adult male Panda hamster is shut and the globe is unable to be seen. Some swelling, redness
and discharge is evident around the eye. The veterinarian has not been notified of the ocular problem the hamster is
experiencing.
This animal must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain a diagnosis and appropriate treatment given to resolve
the eye problem. Untreated ocular injury, disease or infection can cause discomfort and distress to an animal.

WATERING.
During this inspection it was noted that an enclosure housing 12 male hedgehogs did not have water available for
the animals. A facility representative subsequently provided water and a large male hedgehog immediately began
drinking greedily and continued drinking without stopping for 90 seconds. Two other hedgehogs also drank greedily
for approximately 60 seconds each. Water must be provided as often as necessary to ensure the health and
comfort of the animals. Animals demonstrating extended drinking times when offered water can indicate the
amount, accessibility or frequency of watering is not sufficient for the animals contained in the enclosure.
The licensee corrected this non-compliance by removing 6 hedgehogs to another enclosure and providing ample
water sources in both enclosures.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the store manager.
