3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Sharps.
Throughout the facility there were sharp points in at least 6 enclosures affecting approximately 16 dogs. These
sharp points were wires used for fastening and had sharp ends that were protruding into the enclosure at the dogs'
level. The sharp points from the tie wires can injure the dogs. The licensee did fix the sharps that were identified
during the inspection. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures have no sharp points or edges that could injure
the dogs.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest control.
The outdoor facilities called the "Dirt Shed" and the "Castle", housing large breed dogs, have dog shelters with a
heavy amount of spider webs inside the shelters covering many corners and most of the top edges. There were
spiders noticed in these webs and shelters. Also inside the shelters there were several wasp/mud dauber nests
along the walls. These webs and mud dauber/wasp nests, were adjacent to or in close proximity to where the dogs
would normally be while inside the shelters.
Also the outdoor enclosures at the "Dirt Shed", have a large amount of mud dauber and/or wasp nests on the
building ceiling covering the back half of the enclosures. The nests were about 6 feet off the ground and a average
of 10-12 nests were noted in each enclosure. Some wasp-like flying insects were noticed in the same area. These
insects could injure or cause harm to the dogs. The licensee must safely remove the webs and nests and establish
a program to control these pests.
