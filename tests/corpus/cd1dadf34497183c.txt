2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One female kangaroo had an injury to her footpad, the facility treated the kangaroo’s injury for approximately 9 months
without consulting the attending veterinarian about the treatment plan. The kangaroo’s quality of life deteriorated and the
attending veterinarian was called to euthanize the kangaroo.

Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being can be discussed and a treatment plan can be made.

The facility must communicate any animal health concerns with their attending veterinarian so that an effective treatment
plan can be put in place.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
During the review of paperwork and records it was found that The Record of Animals on Hand was missing 3 red
kangaroos and the updated death record of one red kangaroo.

Incomplete records interfere with our ability to identify individual animals and trace animal movements.


Facility representative corrected at the time of inspection.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
Along the north fence line, closest to the road, there is a tarp tied to the fence with baling twine to serve as a wind break
and visual barrier. The twine comes through the fence and is tied on the inside of the enclosure housing 5 red kangaroos.
There are approximately 15 knots tied and the ends of the knots are approximately 2-6 inches long and frayed. Materials
not kept in good repair could cause entanglement and other injuries.

Along the primary enclosure fence line there are two areas where the kangaroos have dug out resting areas. One was
approximately 1 foot long along the fence line and the other was approximately 2 feet along the fence line. Both areas the
inspector could easily slip a foot under the fence.

The enclosure must be structurally sound and the materials used to construct and maintain the enclosure must be kept in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to prevent entry of unauthorized animals and persons.

The facility must keep the outdoor housing facilities in good repair.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
5 red kangaroos are enclosed in an outdoor primary enclosure that is made of 6 foot chain link fence. There is no
perimeter fence surrounding the primary enclosure.


Perimeter fences are important to prevent contact or entry to the enclosure by predators and unauthorized persons. This
could potentially cause injury or illness to the animals.

The facility must have a perimeter fence appropriate for the species being housed or have an approved variance by the
Administrator.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
The shed that serves as a shelter for the kangaroos also houses their food bins. Inside the shed there was a moderate
amount of wild bird feces on top of the food bin lids and surrounding fixtures. 5 red kangaroos are in contact with the
affected areas.

Bird feces can create unsanitary conditions, spread disease and contaminate food supplies. The facility must create and
maintain a cleaning schedule that promotes the health and well-being of the animals, reduces contamination by pests in
the animal area, and minimizes contact between the animals and pest animal feces.
