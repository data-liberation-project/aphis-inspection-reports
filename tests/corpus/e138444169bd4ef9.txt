2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
During the review of paperwork and records it was noted that the acquisition records were incomplete. The acquisition
records for a newly acquired tiger were unavailable at the time of inspection. Appropriate documentation of acquired
regulated animals is essential for proper identification, tracing forward and trace back of the animals. The applicant must
correctly document records of acquisition for all regulated animals, including animals born on the premises, and assure
that all records are kept as required. To be corrected by next re-license inspection.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
At the time of inspection, numerous felled trees and debris from the aftermath of hurricane Ian were observed throughout
the facility. While efforts were made to clear pathways to the individual enclosures, much of this debris could still be
found on and around the enclosures, public barriers, and surrounding areas. This accumulation of trash and debris could
affect the integrity of the enclosures and lead to the escape or injury of some of the animals. Premises (buildings and
grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. To be corrected by next re-license inspection.



This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by December 20, 2022, or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
