ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following was noted concerning the nail and skin care of two pigs:
Two pigs were in good flesh but appeared to have moderately, dry flaky skin. The facility representative stated both
pigs have been checked by the veterinarian and the facility has tried various vitamin and supplements including
essential fatty acids to help resolve the issue. They have also modified their diets during the winter months.
The pigs displayed no apparent skin lesions or irritated areas secondary to scratching or rubbing, or other signs of
discomfort at this time.
Although the veterinarian has examined both pigs, a treatment plan for this chronic condition should be in place,
documented, and periodically re-assessed for effectiveness. Frequent communication between the licensee and
veterinarian is needed to ensure information concerning the condition of their skin is conveyed to the veterinarian
accurately and in a timely manner in the event the plan needs to be modified.

One of two pigs had overgrown hooves. The facility representative stated that the pigs receive hoof care every 3 to
5 months. The pig with overgrown hooves showed a mild to moderate degree of lameness in the hind quarters. The
facility representative stated, and it is also noted in the medical record, that this pig was prescribed Rimadyl in
December of 2016 for her arthritis. Medical records indicate in August and November of 2016 the pigs had their
hooves trimmed.
Although the facility has a system in place to trim hooves, the current frequency does not meet the needs of both
animals. Frequent communication between the licensee and veterinarian is needed to ensure the condition of the
pig with arthritis and the status of the hooves are conveyed to the veterinarian accurately and in a timely manner in
the event the treatment plan needs to be modified.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Dogs are housed in runs in which each is provided with a covered back shelter area. The sheltered areas are large
enough for the dogs to make normal postural movements. They are made up of 4 sealed cinder block walls andhave a wooden roof. There is an approximate 2 ft. by 2.5 ft. entry way through one wall of the cinder block for dogs
to enter into this back area.
The shepherds and other large breed dogs are provided with a platform in their covered back shelter area. The
facility representative stated that the German Shepherds are prone to chew the bedding so they do not like to put in
blankets.
It was noted that the smaller breed dogs were provided with plastic kennel shelter boxes with blankets. The facility
contained a number of dogs that appeared to be aged.
During the winter months, temperatures in Acton, CA, on an average, can range from the mid-40s to 60 degrees F.
Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs must contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below
50 degrees F. Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees F or lower.
Additional measures, such as dry bedding, solid resting boards, or other methods of conserving body heat must be
provided when temperatures are below 50 degrees , should be taken to ensure those breeds that cannot tolerate
lower temperature without stress and discomfort (such as short haired breeds) and for sick, aged, young, or infirm
dogs or cats, or as approved by the attending veterinarian. Additionally, the ambient temperature must not fall below
45 degrees F for more than 4 consecutive hours when dogs are present.
A system should be in place to ensure these requirements are met for the health and well-being of the animals.
