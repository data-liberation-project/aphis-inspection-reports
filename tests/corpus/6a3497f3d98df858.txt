Sec. 3.125 Facilities, general. (a) Structural strength.
* The high tinsel divider fence between the two enclosures, used to house one camel, two llamas and four alpacas,
had a wood post that busted off. The wood post and attached fencing were lying on the ground. This can allow for
the animals to step onto the fence getting their hoofs stuck or entangled. As a result, this could injure the animals.
The fencing must be repaired. All housing facilities and fences must be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
To be corrected by, 10-July-2014.
