2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two deer have conditions which the facility needs to have the attending veterinarian evaluate:
-The buck has a swelling on his left lower cheek that the facility said appeared within the past 6 months. While he was
observed to eat normal during inspection, the cause of this could be painful or the condition could worsen if not treated.
-The youngest doe has a varied lameness and doesn't have complete use of her left front leg and holds it up at times.
When she trotted the lameness wasn't as noticeable. The facility reports that the injury occurred in the fall and
conversation with the veterinarian was to monitor it. While at times the limp wasn't noticeable, an evaluation by the
veterinarian can help determine if any treatment is necessary for her condition.
The facility must ensure to promptly communicate with the attending veterinarian about abnormal health conditions and
injuries and to follow the veterinarian's treatment plan.
