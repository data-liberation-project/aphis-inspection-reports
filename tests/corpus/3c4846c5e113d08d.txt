ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The surgery suite which is used for survival surgeries on swine was not being maintained appropriately. Although
the surgery suite was used three days previously, and a procedure was planned for the day of inspection, the floor
and counter surfaces did not appear clean. Dried blood was found on one metal table. There was some clutter,
including items stacked on the floor in a corner, an oxidized battery, cardboard boxes, one of which contained a
large number of discarded glass bottles, and a large black plastic trash can that was partially filled with trash.
Failure to provide an appropriate environment for surgical procedures could be detrimental to the health and
well-being of the animals. Appropriate facilities should be available and maintained appropriately for aseptic
procedures, such as those performed at the facility. The facility should ensure that steps are taken to maintain the
surgery suite in appropriate condition.
To be corrected immediately.

RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) has not been keeping meeting minutes. Although
Semi-Annual Program Reviews have occurred, records of the committee meetings including attendance, discussion
items, and deliberations have not been created.
Failure to create records showing IACUC activities and deliberations makes it extremely difficult to ascertain
whether the IACUC is functioning as intended; providing oversight regarding the welfare of the animals to be used
for research purposes. Meeting minutes should be created for all IACUC activities form this time forward.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
