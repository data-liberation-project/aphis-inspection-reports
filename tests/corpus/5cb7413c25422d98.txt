ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
While in the facility, a young guinea pig was seen to have wet hair under its jaws. It was seen eating and nibbling
on food. A closer look revealed it had overgrown lower incisors (front teeth). The licensee said that sometimes little
ones have teeth that grow incorrectly and explained ways they try to correct or treat them. The program of
veterinary care does not approve any methods for correcting or treating animals with tooth problems. Tooth
problems can be painful and not allow an animal to eat well. To ensure the welfare of this animal and future
animals, ensure that the attending veterinarian sees this guinea pig and follow the veterinarian's treatment
instructions. If the facility is going to treat any animal for tooth problems, those methods must have detailed
instructions in the program of veterinary care and must be approved by the attending veterinarian.
Correct by 5/14/17.

Pest Control (For Guinea Pigs)
The licensee said pest control means were ordered a few weeks ago from a supplier but that it appears they are lost
in shipping. Lacking any pest control in the building could allow pests to remain in the building. Pests such as wild
rodents (like the mouse seen last inspection) could cause guinea pigs to get sick. Take action to ensure that safe
and effective pest control methods are in place.
