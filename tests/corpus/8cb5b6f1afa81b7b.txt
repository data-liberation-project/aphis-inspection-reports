Section 3.127(d) Perimeter fence: The following areas of the perimeter fence must be repaired:
1) In the area behind and to the right of the compost pile there is a lose fence post leaning outward.
2) There is a tree leaning against the fence pushing the fencing outward to the right of the fence post described in
item 1.
3) A tree has fallen against the fence behind the enclosure housing three alpaca.
4) There is a lose fence post behind the wolf enclosures.
5) There is a tree leaning against the fence to the right of the fence post described in item 4.
6) There is a tree leaning against the fence behind the bear enclosure.
7) The fencing is not secured to a post to the right of the tree described in item 6.
8) The wire fencing has been bent down to 6-7 feet in several areas to the left of the North American porcupine
enclosure.
Leaning and fallen trees on the perimeter fence may cause structural damage to the fencing and may be used by a
lose animal to get over the perimeter fence. Bent wire and damaged fence posts decreases the structural strength
and integrity of the perimeter fence, making it less of a deterrent to keep out unauthorized animals and persons, and
to act as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.

The perimeter fence for dangerous animals must be constructed and maintained at least 8 feet high to protect the
animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having
contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animal
in the facility.

Correct by repairing the perimeter fence and by removing the trees that are leaning and/or fallen against the
perimeter fence. Correct by November 5, 2016. This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility vice president.
