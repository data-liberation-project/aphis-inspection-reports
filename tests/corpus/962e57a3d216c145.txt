2.31(d)(1)(2) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Several of the teaching activities involve the spay and neutering of dogs and cats which involves a degree of pain
and/or distress. The protocol does not address the principal investigator's consideration of alternatives to the
potentially painful or distressful procedures nor does it provide a written narrative of the methods used to determine
alternatives were not available.

The IACUC must ensure that the principal investigator has considered alternatives to procedures that may cause
more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals, and has provided a written narrative description of
the methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available.
2.31(e)(2) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The teaching protocol does not provide a rationale for the animals to be utilized nor does it give a rationale for the
appropriateness of the species and numbers of animals to be used in the protocol. A proposal to conduct activities
using animals must contain a rationale for the species and numbers of animals to be used. It is the responsibility of
the IACUC to review proposed activities involving animals and ensure the proposal contains a rationale for the
appropriate species and numbers of animals to be used.
