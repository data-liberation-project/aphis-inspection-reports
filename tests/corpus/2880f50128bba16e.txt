MISCELLANEOUS.
According to facility records, November 12, 2014, while performing a routine procedure, personnel discovered that a
female, cynomolgus monkey had sustained injury to her right forelimb. Her condition was assessed and measures
were taken to relieve any pain and/or distress. Upon being notified of the animal(cid:25)s condition, the veterinary staff
conducted an investigation. It could not be clearly determined exactly how she got injured. Based on a review of the
facility(cid:25)s records, the animal was recently handled on 3 November 2014 for routine procedures and 11 November
2014 for enclosure changes.
As per 2.38 (f) (1), handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that
does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
The research facility acted to address this item by conducting an investigation and further implementing appropriate
corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. There have not been any additional incidents since the corrective
actions were implemented.

According to facility records, September 1, 2015, personnel discovered a male, cynomolgus monkey outside of his
primary enclosure. The animal was recaptured and evaluated by veterinary staff. He sustained injuries on the third
and fourth digits on his left foot and received immediate veterinary care. At the time of inspection, the animal did not
appear to be in any pain or distress.

proper procedures had been followed by personnel. It could not be determined exactly how the animal was able to
escape from his enclosure.
