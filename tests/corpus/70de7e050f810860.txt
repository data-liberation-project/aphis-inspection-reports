Facilities, outdoor.
The climate-controlled building, which houses 18 guinea pigs, has a small doorway that allows the guinea pigs free
access to an outdoor public viewing enclosure. At the time of inspection there were seven guinea pigs observed in this
outdoor area.

Guinea pigs are sensitive to temperature extremes and outdoor housing of guinea pigs may lead to discomfort or physical
stress to the animals.

The guinea pigs shall be housed in an indoor facility that provides adequate climate control to support the health and well-
being of the animals. To be corrected by September 21, 2021.
3.81(c)(4)

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The facility has a ring-tailed lemur that is housed alone. The current environment enhancement plan does not address
special considerations for individually housed nonhuman primates.



Individually housed nonhuman primates that are unable to see and hear non-human primates of their own or compatible
species require special attention within this enrichment plan in order to promote psychological well-being.

The facility must develop and maintain a written enrichment plan that provides special considerations for NHPs requiring
special attention. To be corrected by October 15, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
