TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Examination of APHIS form 7005 Record of Acquisition and Dogs and Cats on Hand, revealed there was no official
identification number for any of the dogs. Licensee stated that none of the dogs have an official identification
number. Licensee also stated that some dogs may have a microchip, but no scanner was available to determine
this. Official identification is required in order to complete the required record keeping. Licensee must provide
these dogs with proper identification using either approved microchip, approved tattoo, or approved collar tag.
Official identification numbers for each dog must be added to APHIS form 7005, as well as, any other APHIS form
that requires it. All subsequent dogs acquired by licensee must be given proper official identification. Licensee must
ensure that all dogs have proper identification at all times.
