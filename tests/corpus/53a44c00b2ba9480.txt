3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The enclosure for the guinea pigs has a wooden structure that has significant deterioration. The wood on the
outside base has large holes, measuring two inches wide, one inch deep, and over a foot in length. This wood rot
threatens the structural integrity of the structure, and impedes cleaning, creating poor sanitation.
Enclosures should be structurally sound and maintained in good repair in order to promote adequate husbandry.
To be corrected by 1/8/16.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the enclosure for the goats there are multiple hazards. Plastic-coated wire fencing has been cut on its edges in a
manner that has left sharp, pointed metal wires protruding into the enclosure. These wires could injure the animals.
The chainlink fence that is also the perimeter fence was a solid barrier, as it had wood inserts and heavy foliage.
Recently these elements were removed, and large wood panels have been propped against the fencing to prevent
contact with the public. The wood panels are not securely supported, as they are propped up by a large log. The
goats could easily push behind the panels and topple them, possibly becoming injured in the process. Also there is
a wooden bridge structure that has frayed cable-tie ends that are sharp.
The enclosure should be free of hazardous items in order to protect the animals from injury.
To be corrected by 12/20/15.
3.126(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Two sheep are housed in a barn at night where the run-off from other animals flows into their section of the
enclosure. Although the sheep had been recently shorn, increasing the comfort of the animals, the drainage
situation in the barn had not improved at the time of inspection. Additionally, at the time of inspection the animalswere all still in the barn in the morning, prior to turn-out, and their section of the enclosure did not provide any dry
floor space, due to the presence of feces and urine.
Drainage in the indoor housing enclosure must be adequate to facilitate good husbandry. Animals should be
maintained well-groomed, clean and dry, in order to ensure their comfort and good health.
This issue was previously cited on 11/2/15.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
This inspection was conducted by Veterinary Medical Officers Dr. Pamela L. Smith and Dr. Katharine Frank.
