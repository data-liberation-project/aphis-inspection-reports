3.6(c)(1)(i)

Primary enclosures.
Three adult dogs are housed together in an enclosure that has a total of 8 square feet of floor space. Two of the dogs
measured 17 inches long and one of the dogs measured 16 inches long which requires an enclosure with a total minimum
floor space of 10.70 square feet. Failure to provide the dogs with the required amount of minimum space could have a
negative impact on their health and well-being.

Each dog housed in a primary enclosure must be provided with a minimum amount of floor space as required by this
section. The licensee must house these three dogs in an enclosure that provides them with the minimum amount of
required floor space in order to support their health and well-being. The licensee must ensure that each dog has the
required amount of floor space at all times.

Corrected at the time of the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell and the facility representative.
