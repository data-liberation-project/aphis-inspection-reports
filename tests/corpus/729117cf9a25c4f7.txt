FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the room called the "warm room", there is a metal chain-link fence housing one African Crested Porcupine
called Thistle. The bottom of the chain-link door to the enclosure has been pushed out of the metal frame and three
of the wires to the door have come undone and are sticking inside the enclosure. A wooden board was placed at the
bottom of the door to block the animal from escaping but there are still metal wires sticking inside the enclosure.
This not only exposes the animal to three sharp wire ends but also does not safely contain the animal. The sharp
edges are dangerous to the enclosed animal. The primary enclosure must be structurally sound and protect the
animal from injury.

SANITATION.
In the room called the "gift shop", there is a metal enclosure with a Large-Spotted Genet called Simba. The
enclosure has a significant amount of rust along with a thick layer of hair attached to the sides of the cage. There is
a hanging cloth sheet used as a hammock inside the enclosure. The hammock has a greasy appearance with
brown debris adhered to the cloth. A large wood stick inside the enclosure has an excessive amount of attached
hair. There is also a wooden platform inside the enclosure with an adhered layer of brown and black debris. There
appears to be a mound of food pellets that has dissolved and dried together to form large brown clump on the
platform. The debris and hair can function as a suitable environment for bacteria to grow and can serve as an
opportunity of infection for the animal in the enclosure. Proper cleaning removes all sources that promote bacteria
growth thereby minimizing disease hazards. The primary enclosure must be free from all dirt and debris in order to
remove all hazards to animal health.
