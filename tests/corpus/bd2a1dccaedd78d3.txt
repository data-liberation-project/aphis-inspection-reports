According to the National Weather Service, the low temperature last night was 22 degrees Fahrenheit and the low
for tonight will be 14 degrees Fahrenheit. There are a total of 54 dogs in the affected enclosures. Failure to provide
clean, dry bedding within dog shelters does not ensure the animals can remain warm and dry during low
temperatures which can lead to health hazards for the animals. Shelters for dogs must contain clean, dry bedding
material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Additional clean, dry bedding is required when
the temperature is 35 degrees Fahrenheit or lower.The licensee needs to provide sufficient bedding for all outdoor
shelters.
