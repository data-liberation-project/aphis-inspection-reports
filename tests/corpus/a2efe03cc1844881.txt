2.31(d)(1) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) has not reviewed proposed animal use activities in order
to determine if those activities are in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations. Currently, all animal
use activities have no protocols assign to them, only SOPs; however, there is no SOP or any written instructions for
injecting adjuvants in goats. The current SOP has an accurate summary of the animal use activity, but is still
missing required information listed in 2.31(d) and (e). Some of these adjuvants can cause severe inflammatory
reactions and acute pain such as the Freund(cid:25)s complete adjuvant used by the facility. Because of the potential for
pain and/or distress, a search for alternatives for animal use is also required. The protocol for blood collection from
goats are missing the approximate number of animals to be used, the rationale for involving animals, the rationale
for species, the rationale for the number of animals to be used, and the provision for the use of analgesic,
anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs where indicated to minimize discomfort and pain to the animals. It is necessary
for an IACUC to review and approve the proposed activities for the care and use of animals and to provide the
proper oversight of the use of animals by the research facility. Lack of supervision by an IACUC often leads to
non-compliances with the Animal Welfare Act and this decreases animal welfare. Correct by ensuring all animal use
activities have been approved by the IACUC before any animal procedures are begun, and ensure all required
information listed in 2.31 (d) and (e) is made available to the IACUC.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Superintendent.
