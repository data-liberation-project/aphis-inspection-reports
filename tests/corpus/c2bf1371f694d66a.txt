ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female tiger, either Buffy or Talullah, was noted to be squinting her right eye, barely opening the eye, and a
clear discharge was coming from the corner of the eye. There is a documented corneal abnormality for one or both
of the cats in this enclosure that is chronic in nature and has been noted by the AV. The staff had not noted the
squinting and discharge and no contact had been made with a veterinarian to notify her of this acute presentation
and change in the eye condition.
Eye conditions, particularly chronic conditions that become more active, are serious, often painful to the animal,
and, if not treated quickly, may result in loss of vision.
A male tiger, Caprichio, was noted to have an abnormal gait on the right hind leg and is in thin body condition,
particularly in the back leg muscles. The right hind leg seemed to rotate inwards when the foot was placed and the
knee and hip were at an unusual angle as compared to the left hind leg. The owner claims this tiger has been noted
to be thin and that the Attending Veterinarian (AV) had been notified but no records were made or available for
review at the time of the inspection and the right rear leg problem had not been noticed by staff.
An adult female tiger, Nanda, was noted to have muscle loss and an abnormal gait in her hind limbs. When she
walked along the fence, her back end swayed and her hind feet appeared to cross in front of each other, a gait often
described by veterinarians as ataxia. This is an older cat (mid-late teens) and the facility representative did state
that the AV was aware of the thin condition of her hind legs and attributes this to old age but the licensee had not
noted this gait and no contact had been made with a veterinarian regarding the condition at the time of the
inspection.
Lameness and/or abnormal gait with muscle or weight loss may be indications of injury or underlying illness and the
tiger needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to properly diagnose the cause and provide a plan for treating and/or
monitoring these conditions.
These animals should be evaluated by a veterinarian by 9/27/2014 with documentation of a diagnosis, appropriate
treatment, and plan for follow-up to ensure these problems are resolved.2.131(b)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- An 8 week old tiger cub, Milo, was being exhibited and handled for pictures with the public when we arrived at the
park at approximately 10:25 AM. The cub exhibited distress by vocailization numerous times throughout the day and
one of the handlers was seen at least two times to pull back the cub prior to allowing customers to hold him due to
squirming and vocalization by the cub. The same cub was still being handled for pictures with the public when we
left for the day at approximately 4:30 PM, 6 hours later. The line to wait to have pictures taken with this cub
remained long and steady for as long as the APHIS officials were able to observe the activity. According to the
licensee there were no other cubs at the facility young enough to be used for picture taking with members of the
public to allow alternation in the handling of this cub. The licensee stated that the cub did receive breaks but these
were not being documented nor could the APHIS officials see whether handling was suspended and, if so, for how
long.
Handling of animals, particularly young animals, shall be done in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
To be corrected on all subsequent handling of animals.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
- The plan for the environmental enhancement to promote the psychological well-being of the nonhuman primates, 2
ring-tailed lemurs acquired in July 2014, is not adequate. The plan, at a minimum, must address social grouping,
environmental enrichment, special considerations, if applicable, and restraint devices and their use. The plan and
environmental enrichment must be approved by the attending veterinarian (AV) and documented when provided to
the animals on the environmental enhancement plan. At the time of this inspection, there was no written plan
denoting any enrichment and no log book or calendar showing that enrichment takes place. The animals have
different items in their enclosures, but there is no schedule of rotating or changing the items in the pens.
Nonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs that need to be addressed when in captivity. A
written plan that is directed by the AV, guided by current professional standards, and available for review by APHIS
officials is required to ensure that the psychological well-being of these animals is being appropriately addressed.

Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environmental enhancement of nonhumanprimates that is in accordance with currently accepted professional standards and as directed by the AV.
To be corrected by 9/30/2014.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The west wall of the veterinary hospital indoor enclosure housing 1 tiger cub, "Donner", had the vinyl coated
surface torn which exposed the drywall. This wall is in disrepair and cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized.
A rusty wire, securing a metal panel to the keeper entrance of this enclosure, had sharp ends protruding into the
enclosure. Both of these areas in this enclosure pose a risk to the health of these animals. The wire was corrected
during the inspection.
Enclosure #8 housing 2 juvenile black bears, Holly and Lolli, and 1 juvenile brown bear, Huggy, had the chain link
fencing pulled up at the bottom of the enclosure on the southeast corner. There are sharp ends protruding and the
chain link is loose, posing a risk of injury from entanglement in the fencing or from the sharp ends.
Enclosure #46 housing 2 adult tigers, Kodiak and Kasper had a broken board on the ground under the wooden
platform and there appeared to be splintered and broken wood on the southwest support post which may affect the
structural strength of the platform.
Enclosure # 23 housing 2 adult tigers, Tutt and Nefertiti, the doorframe around the den (shelter) has chewed and
ripped wood leaving exposed nail heads which could cause an injury to the animals and is not in good repair.
Enclosure # 24 housing 3 tigers, Shenandoah, Aphrodite, and Harley, the chain link fencing on the west side of the
enclosure adjacent to the den is pulled and unsecured which could cause an injury to the animals and is not in good
repair.
Enclosure #19 housing 2 adult tigers, Sumadi and Eragon, had the underside of the deck of the wooden platform
shredded with broken pieces of wood so is not in good repair and poses a risk of injury to the animals.
Enclosure # 65 housing 2 tigers, Phoebe and Toni, the chain link fencing on the south side of the den is pulled and
is not in good repair.
Enclosure #12 housing 1 adult tiger, Sabre, had broken cattle panel wires with sharp ends protruding, posing a risk
of injury to the animals.
Enclosure #13 housing 3 adult tigers, Seth, Tabitha, and Gabrielle, had a hole in the chain link fencing with sharp
ends protruding on the west side of the enclosure near the keeper entrance, posing a risk of injury to the animals.Enclosure #61 housing an adult black leopard, Sinbad, the elevated resting platform has 2 of 4 posts that are
excessively shredded and chewed to a point that the structural strength to support the cement structure is at risk
and may pose a risk of injury to this animal if they should fail.
Enclosure #28 housing 1 adult lion, Zazu, had a nail or wood screw head protruding from underneath the resting
platform, posing a risk of injury to the animal.
Enclosure #36 housing 2 juvenile black bears, Cody and Pebbles, had shredded wood on the den box and several
holes near the southeast corner and on the east side near the junction with the roof. Two elevated wooden resting
platforms were in disrepair with most of the surface appearing to be splintered. These structures are in disrepair.
Enclosure #37 housing 1 adult leopard, Anthony, had a broken wooden step on the ramp up to an elevated den box
and nail heads protruding from the top most and bottom step so are in disrepair and pose a risk of injury to the
animal.

Enclosure #38 housing 1 adult cougar, Clyde, had deteriorated wood falling from the ceiling of the wooden den box
so is in disrepair, may no longer be structurally sound, and poses a risk of injury to the animal should the ceiling
collapse.
Enclosure #40/41 housing 3 adult bobcats, Talon, Taji, and Bobbie, had the east side of the wooden den box
separating from the structure so is in disrepair.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.
The walk-in refrigerator used to store perishable food items had a leak of unknown origin. There was an
accumulation of water and food debris on the floor of the refrigerator. Several boxes of mixed produce was covered
in mold and the cardboard cartons containing eggs appeared to be molded all the way through the container and
onto the eggs. None of these items are safe or appropriate to feed the animals and pose a risk of contamination of
the other food items stored near and around these spoiled food items. The leak in the refrigerator may becontributing to the deterioration and spoilage of the perishable food items and the refrigerator cannot be considered
to adequately protect the supplies.
There were uncovered or unsealed bags of chicken and meat in this refrigerator adjacent to uncovered containers
of prepared diet for the animals. This poses a risk of contamination of the diets by the meat above and adjacent to
it.
Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin.
To be corrected by 9/20/2014.
3.127(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Several outdoor enclosures housing tigers did not have adequate shade to protect them from direct sunlight:
*Enclosure # 43 housing 3 adult tigers: Lazarus, Diablo, and Twinkle
*Enclosure #44-45 housing 2 young tigers: Baxter and Maverick
*Enclosure #46 housing 2 adult tigers: Kasper and Kodiak
*Enclosure #47 housing 2 adult tigers: Elijah and Jezebel
*Enclosure #48 housing 2 adult lions: Mona and Daniel
*Enclosure #32 housing 3 juvenile tigers: Synder, Waldo, Mohan
*Enclosure #33 housing 1 adult tiger: Willy
*Enclosure #29 housing 3 adult tigers: Billy, Jake, Chepe
*Enclosure #27 housing 2 juvenile tigers: Pancho and Montana
*Enclosure #22 housing 1 adult tiger: Pandora
*Enclosure #19 housing 2 adult tigers: Sumadi and Eragon
*Enclosure #65 housing 2 adult tigers: Phoebe and Toni
*Enclosure #64 housing 3 adult tigers: Eva, Natasha, Juanita
*Enclosure #54 housing 2 adult tigers: Grumpy and Shirkhan
*Enclosure #59 housing 5 adult tigers: Shival, Mugale, Bana Bibi, Rani, Sultan
Inadequate protection from direct sunlight may lead to overheating or discomfort from squinting.
Shelter from sunlight is required when overheating or discomfort of the animals is likely.
3.127(d)FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There were fence panels and posts stacked against the fence on the inside of the perimeter fence on the south side
near Enclosure #43 for 3 tigers, Lazarus, Diablo, and Twinkle, and behind Enclosure #40/41 housing 2 tigers,
Baxter and Maverick.
These panels were stacked in a manner that would allow animals to easily climb over the perimeter fence should an
animal escape from its primary enclosure. These materials may also cause damage to the perimeter fence which
could reduce its effectiveness to keep unwanted persons and animals from entering the facility or to act as a
secondary containment should animals escape from their primary enclosures.
The perimeter fence must be maintained so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals
in the facility and to prevent the entrance of unwanted persons or animals.
Corrected during the inspection.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
The following enclosures had an overgrowth of weeds such that animals could not be properly observed, cleaning of
excreta and food debris would be made difficult, and provides places for pests such as mice and ectoparasites to
accumulate and hide.
#52 Binturong, Chip--throughout the outdoor enclosure and the indoor enclosure has been known to have a rodent
problem
*Enclosure #50 Cougar, Boo--throughout enclosure, especially around the entrance to the den
*Enclosure #39 Serval, Vannah--throughout enclosure and totally obscured the animal from observation during the
inspection
*Enclosure #40/41 Bobcats, Bobbie, Talon, Taji--throughout enclosure
*Enclosure #38 Cougar, Clyde--throughout enclosure
*Enclosure #22 Tiger, Pandora--throughout enclosure
*Enclosure #61 Leopard, Sinbad--throughout enclosure
*Enclosure #3 Leopard, "Thunder"--very thick throughout enclosure and very aggressive cat so dangerous for care
staff as well
*Enclosure #4 Cougar, Charlie--throughout enclosure
Rodent feces had accumulated on the sill inside the den box window in Enclosure #48 housing 2 lions, Mona and
Daniel. Numerous holes around this den box, around the den box and within the Enclosure #37 for 1 leopard,
Anthony, and around the outside of Enclosure #36 housing 2 black bears, Cody and Pebbles, appeared to be signs
of rodent activity. Accumulation of rodent feces was found in the veterinary hospital on the floor and surfaces around the 2 enclosures
housing juvenile tigers, Milo and Donner.
A dead, desiccated mouse was found in the room adjacent to the food prep area. Numerous dead flies were found
on the surface of the table used for food preparation below an automatic fly spray dispenser.
Rodents and other pests may carry and transmit diseases to the animals and a more effective method of monitoring
and preventing their presence in/around primary enclosures and around food storage/preparation should be
implemented.
The licensee shall establish and maintain a safe and an effective pest control program which should include limiting
the growth of weeds in and around the enclosures and cleaning of areas to remove rodent feces, dead rodents, and
dead flies.
To be corrected by 10/1/2014.
