FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the north outdoor rabbit pen, a dog house being used as shelter had an approximately 1 foot diameter hole in the
roof. The bedding and floor of the dog house were visible through the hole. Structures not maintained in good
repair cannot properly protect the animals and allow them to remain dry during rain and snow. This could increase
the possibility of illness and adversely affect the health and well being of the animals.
Shelter must be repaired or replaced by 2/1/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
