Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 569 adult guinea pigs, 928 weanlings, and
378 newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no records for the number of adults, weanlings, and
newborns present since January. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary
by identifying guinea pig additions and losses by death or decreasing numbers of animals born or animals kept for
replacement. The licensee must maintain records on the number of guinea pigs held, owned, births, deaths, and sold.

3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The 3 new weanling enclosures have bare wood on the sides. All guinea pig enclosures must be constructed of smooth
materials that are substantially impervious to moisture and liquids. Wood surfaces that are not maintained and kept
sealed will allow the absorption of fluids and make it difficult to properly clean and sanitize. Licensee must ensure that
wood surfaces are sealed or replaced with a material that is impervious to moisture and liquids. Correct by May 8, 2022.
3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.

The stack of white guinea pig enclosures have a buildup of brown scale and debris on the walls. The accumulations of
brown scale and debris exposes the guinea pigs to disease hazards and can lead to bacterial and fungal infections.
Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of
brown scale and debris. Correct by April 11, 2022.
