FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** At the time of the inspection, the park was closed to guests but the inspector accessed the animal care building
which was unlocked and was able to wander around the building with no personal present for over 15 minutes prior
to locating an employee. The inspector had access to bobcats and educational animals at this time. Additionally one
section of the perimeter fence was open and anyone could have had access to the park with no employee
knowledge. Although the park is closed during winter months, these doors and gates should be closed and locked
to prevent unauthorized persons from entering the facility and for secondary containment should an animal get out
of a primary enclosure. This needs to be addressed for the safety of the animals.
