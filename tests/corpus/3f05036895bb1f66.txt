Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
**While conducting a review of records, the IACUC approved protocol did not contain a description of the method of
euthanasia to be used on the animals under study.

Per this section of the regulations, a proposal to conduct an activity on animals must contain a description of the method
of euthanasia to be used when needed. The IACUC needs to address this item as identified for this protocol.

Correct from this date forward.
