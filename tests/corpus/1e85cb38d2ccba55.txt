3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 2/22/18, a new yearling bull elk was being introduced and was released into the elk trail area enclosure.
The fence between the elk and adjacent bison pen had an approximate 2 foot gap beneath the fence to the bed of a
stream that flowed through the enclosures. The new elk crawled through this gap into the bison pen. A bison cow
charged, injuring the new elk. The animal was humanely euthanized by the veterinarian. Immediately large
boulders were placed in the stream at the fence line to close this space.
Enclosures must be constructed to safely contain the animals housed in them.
Corrected by the time of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
