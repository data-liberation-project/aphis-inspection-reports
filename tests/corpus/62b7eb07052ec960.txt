3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1) The dry food storage shed near the kitchen area has evidence of small holes in the building walls and mouse
droppings throughout the shed. The holes need to be covered or filled in to stop mice and other pests from getting
into the shed and contaminating the feed.
2) The produce refrigerator had several containers with overripe or moldy fruits and vegetables. These items need
to be removed from the storage area and disposed of to minimize contamination of the produce that is still edible for
the animals.
