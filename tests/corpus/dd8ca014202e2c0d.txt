2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Expired pyrantel (Exp 3-2022) was stored with other medications and reportedly used with some dogs last month. The
storage of expired medications could allow them to be used and the use of expired medications might not be effective to
treat/prevent conditions and some expired medications might harm animals. Ensure that expired medications are properly
disposed of and not stored with medications that are ready to be used.
Correct by Aug 25, 2022.
2.50 Repeat

Time and method of identification.
Identification was assigned to each dog except one new adult (per 7005 form) however, 10 adult dogs were observed to
not have their tags. The licensee reported that all had tags put on each dog since last inspection, however it appears that
light chain was used for tags and many have broken off (some broken chain with tags were found during inspection). For
husbandry tracking and health tracking purposes each adult dog must have official identification. Ensure that each adult
dog has its tag attached with a generally acceptable and safe material such as a smooth collar.
3.6(a)(2)(i) Repeat

Primary enclosures.


A divider in one enclosure is made of metal and the edges and holes in it had sharp edges exposed to the dogs in it
(divider was removed from enclosure prior to exit interview). Also, a broken feeder edge had sharp and rough metal
edges exposed to dogs in it. Sharp and rough edges could injure dogs. Ensure surfaces dogs can contact do not have
sharp points or edges.
3.11(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Two enclosures had more than a day's worth of excreta/waste on the floor of the outdoor deck floor that dogs walk on.
Excessive waste and excreta can cause conditions that can cause sickness and reproduce pests such as flies. Ensure
that excreta and waste in all areas of enclosures is removed daily.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
