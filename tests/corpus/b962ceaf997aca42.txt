guard must be added to this heat lamp in order to protect the dog from potential injuries. Licensee must ensure that
all heat lamps have protective guards on them at all times when used in dog enclosures.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the sheltered housing building, there is one open sack of dog food sitting on a wooden pallet and one open sack
of dog food sitting on the floor. There is also dog food that has spilled onto the floor and wood pallet. Open sacks
of food and spilled food can attract pests which could contaminate the food supply and increase disease hazards
towards the dogs.
All open supplies of food must be kept in a leak proof container with a tightly fitting lid to prevent pest contamination
and spoilage of the food. These two open sacks of food must be placed in a container with a tightly fitting lid and all
spilled food must be cleaned up. Licensee must ensure that all open food is stored properly at all times.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.In the outdoor enclosures east of the house, each enclosure contains a shelter for the dogs. In two of these
enclosures, containing five dogs, the shelters have no wind and rain break at the entrance. In the outdoor
enclosures north of the house, one enclosure, containing three dogs, has no wind and rain break at the entrance of
the shelter. A lack of wind and rain break on the shelter may not fully protect the dogs from weather extremes.
Outdoor facilities for dogs must include one or more shelters that are accessible to each animal and must be
provided with a wind and rain break at the entrance. A wind and rain break must be added to the entrance of each
of these shelters and the licensee must ensure that all shelters have a wind and rain break at all times.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the outdoor enclosures that are east of the house, the first enclosure, containing three dogs, has an excessive
buildup of dirt and grime on the front of the shelter. This dirt and grime buildup could increase the risk of disease
hazards towards the dogs.
All used primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized once every two weeks, or more often if necessary to
prevent the buildup of dirt, grime and other disease hazards. This shelter must be cleaned, sanitized and
maintained in a way to prevent any further buildup of dirt and grime. Licensee must ensure that all enclosures
remain free of accumulations of dirt and grime in order to promote the health of the dogs.
