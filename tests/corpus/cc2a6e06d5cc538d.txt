2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care (PVC) on file is no longer valid since the veterinary practice recently went out
of business. Facility is in the process of finding a new attending veterinarian.
Lack of an attending veterinarian with a detailed veterinary care program and regularly scheduled visits to the
premises can lead to lack of delivery of adequate veterinary care to the animals. Each exhibitor shall employ an
attending veterinarian. In the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal
arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the
exhibitor. Licensee must ensure a new written program of veterinary care is established and that regularly
scheduled visits to the premises are conducted by the attending veterinarian. Correct by July 7, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the president.
