3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are seven enclosures with bent wires or flooring surfaces turned in to the enclosure space exposing metal
points. Sharp metal points can cause injury to dogs. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures be
constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs. To be corrected
by 5 March 2020.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are at least four water receptacles that have black debris coating the interior surface and floating in the water.
Failure to keep food and water receptacles clean and sanitized can play a role in disease transmission. The
licensee must ensure that used food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least one every 2
weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. To be corrected by 5 March
2019.
