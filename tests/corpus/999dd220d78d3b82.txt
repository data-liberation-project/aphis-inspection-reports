FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***There was an enclosure containing four adult North American Black Bears. Inside of this enclosure, there was a
platform constructed of steel pipe and wooden planks. One of the steel legs (2 1/2" pipe), holding up the platform
was rusted completely through on one side. The framework for the steps up to the platform area was constructed
out of metal tubing and angle iron. The framework for the steps was rusted completely through on some of the
tubing and flaking on the angle iron. The boards of this platform and other platforms within this enclosure had been
chewed and scratched. One board had been chewed to the point that it did not completely reach across the width of
the platform anymore, leaving a hole in the platform floor and two screw heads exposed. Structures that are not
maintained can leave sharp edges or points and could cause structural failures that can injure the animals. The
licensee must repair these areas and assure that enclosures and structures within are maintained as required.
To be corrected by January 1, 2018.
