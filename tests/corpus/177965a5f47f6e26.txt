2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The metal fencing barrier located at the left side of the indoor ring where animals are exhibited has a 1' opening at
the bottom. During the inspection I observed small children on the floor near this barrier where it is possible they or
others could become injured if they they went under this barrier and had contact with potential dangerous animals.
Although the metal fencing barrier in front of the exhibit ring has a distance of 4', during this inspection I was able
touch the ring leaning in front of the barrier. The front barrier being to close was verbally discussed during a recent
visit. There were several roaming attendants available during the public exhibit, however there is not a minimal risk
of harm to assure the safety of the public at these areas while exhibiting the tigers and chimpanzee. During public
exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and to the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of
animals and the public.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: IMMEDIATELY.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Curator.
