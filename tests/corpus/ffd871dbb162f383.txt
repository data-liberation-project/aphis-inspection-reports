ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female Bichon with ID tag #69 was noted to have dental tartar with a portion of the gum-line receding on the
left upper cheek tooth. The Attending Veterinarian (AV) had examined the dog and noted that it had Moderate to
Severe Dental Tartar at that time but did not mention the receding gum-line and stated that no treatment was
needed at that time. It appears that the condition may have progressed at this time. Licensee must assure the use
of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, to include follow-up on
animals that may have progressive conditions. This follow-up assures that the animals do not suffer from worsening
of conditions. Correct by having this animal reexamined by the AV and treated as appropriate. To be corrected by: 1
