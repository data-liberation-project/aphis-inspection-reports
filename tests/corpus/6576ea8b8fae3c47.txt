FEEDING.
Sec. 3.9 Feeding. (b) Food receptacles
**** There are two food bowls being used instead of the metal self feeders. These bowls are dirty in appearance
both inside and out. The dirty bowls allow for the feed to become contaminated. The bowls must be cleaned and
sanitized to protect the feed from molding, deterioration and caking.
