2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:12 pm on
04/07/2015.
No one was home. I called the licensee and he said that he was currently exhibiting in South Carolina and would be
there until October. He had not submitted an itinerary to the Regional Office.
Itineraries are required whenever exhibitors are doing performances that require overnight travel so that inspectors
do not make unnecessary trips to do inspections. Itineraries must be submitted in writing to the Regional Office no
fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel. The itinerary must include the name and license number of the
exhibitor; the name, ID number, species, sex, and age of each animal being exhibited; and the names, dates, and
locations (with addresses) where the animals will be exhibited.
