ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:44AM on
12-Aug-20.
Arrived and waited outside the property gate. Left message identifying myself as USDA VMO and requesting a call
back on primary contact phone number. Attempted to call additional two phone numbers, however both lines were
disconnected. Waited 30 minutes for licensee to call back. No contact was made & followed COVID-19 Attempted
Inspection SOP from that point.
