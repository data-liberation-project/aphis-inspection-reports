2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 7:55-8:32 am
on 03/27/2015.
The inspectors knocked on the door and honked the car horn. No one was home so we called the house phone
and the cell phone and left messages with no reply.
Additional Inspectors
Heine William, Animal Care Inspector
