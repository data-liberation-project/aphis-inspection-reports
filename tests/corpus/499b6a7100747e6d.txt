3.8(c)(1)

Exercise for dogs.
Several of the primary enclosures in building 3 are not large enough to meet the exercise space requirements based on
the size of the dogs in the enclosure. To address this, the facility is providing the dogs an opportunity to exercise for 15
minutes during the day in the runs outside their primary enclosure. Multiple dogs were circling in a repetitive manner
during the inspection process (id # 6615538 and id #Cly-9). Cly-9 was also noticeably overweight and her repetitive
circling included an additional head circle as she rounded the enclosure. The current frequency and duration of exercise is
not sufficient to reduce or mitigate these abnormal behavior patterns. An exercise plan needs to be developed to address
these issues for the health and welfare of the dogs.

3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In building 3, the pans underneath the primary enclosures contained feces and debris that are not being removed and are
accumulating. This is causing a strong ammonia odor that permeates throughout the building that was notable upon entry.
This excess feces must be removed and cleaned as often as necessary under these enclosures to prevent this
accumulation and reduce odors in the building for the health of the animals.
