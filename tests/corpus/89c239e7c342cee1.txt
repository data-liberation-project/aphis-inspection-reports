ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult female yellow Labrador retriever named Shamie with microchip number 108360097 has a swelling on
her right front leg wrist joint. The swelling protrudes approximately 0.5 inches more than her left wrist, and is mainly
on the front and left side of the joint. The dog was observed to shift her weight off the affected leg every 15-20
seconds. She limped very slightly. Upon palpation of the swelling, it felt hard to the touch like bone. The licensee
stated the dog has always been like that as long as she could remember. She stated the veterinarian has never
mentioned it during kennel inspections.
Swelling of a joint could be a sign of an underlying health issue, may be painful and could affect the well-being of
the dog.
***An adult red and white female shiba inu named Mia with microchip number 086842345 has toenails that are too
long.

Toenails that are too long can affect the dog's gait, be uncomfortable or painful, and could cause its feet to be
caught in the flooring and could injure the animal.
The licensee must have the above yellow Labrador retriever evaluated by the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and
possible treatment, and provide the inspector the documentation of this visit upon request. The licensee must
ensure that as part of a program of veterinary care, dogs are groomed and toenails are trimmed. The licensee must
ensure all animals are given proper veterinary care at all times.

3.1(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are places in the large dog enclosures where the metal pipes are still rusted. This rusting has left some pipejoints unsecure and in other places the rust has resulted in jagged metal edges.
Jagged edges may cause injury to the dogs. The rusted joints may affect the structural strength of the pipes.
All surfaces must be constructed in manners that are free of excessive rust that affects the structural strength of the
materials or that results in jagged edges.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor enclosures, the entryway edges of two plastic shelter structures are chewed with a jagged,
roughened surface. In one indoor enclosure, the plastic or fiberglass wall boards are scratched on approximately
fifty percent of the surfaces.
Chewed, scratched and/or roughened surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized to prevent disease hazards.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis. All surfaces that cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized must be repaired or replaced when worn or soiled.
