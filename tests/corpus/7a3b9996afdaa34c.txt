INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A complete documentation review indicates that SOPs are not reflecting current practices being performed at the
facility. There were multiple documents in the SOP book with conflicting information. It is unclear which ones are the
current approved versions. This is also evident in protocols that reference the SOPs. There are also some SOPs
that are clearly outdated such as the sanitation SOP 3400.001, since a new sanitizing agent is being used that is
not reflected in the SOP. The IACUC must ensure a complete program review, including review and revision of
SOPs which relate to animal care and welfare.
*****Correct by next semi annual IACUC review.
2.33(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
1) The facility has been using utility rooms for major operative procedures on regulated species. These areas were
not equipped according to current professional standards. Specifically, there were no inhalant anesthesia machines
and no provisions for emergency resuscitation. During surgical procedures, the accepted standard of care is to have
the capability of providing supplemental oxygenation or anesthetic if needed, and to provide resuscitative measures
if necessary. Failure to provide this equipment constitutes a lack of availability of appropriate facilities and
equipment to ensure the veterinary care regulatory provisions. The facility may not perform any major operative
procedures without the appropriate facilities and equipment.
******Correct before the next operative procedure.
2) From the review of medical records, the extent of the attending veterinarian’s involvement in examinations and
diagnoses is unclear for several animals, including #16JAD4, #1410806, and #1412203. While several records
contained physical examination and diagnostic notes from the veterinarians along with their signatures, these
particular records failed to indicate veterinarian involvement in physical examination and diagnoses. It appears at
times this facility has inadequate veterinary personnel, and veterinary technicians may be the only ones directly
involved in diagnosis and care of medical issues. There are two licensed veterinary technicians responsible for
approximately 3000 animals. Although there is a full time attending veterinarian, along with a consulting veterinarian
and a back-up small animal practitioner, availability is hampered by biosecurity procedures so that it may be difficultfor the veterinarians to address simultaneous health issues at the different locations where animals are housed.
Corroborating evidence for lack of veterinary staff is evident from a video in which a staff member states that the
veterinarian should not be called to examine an animal because of a biosecurity issue. Adequate personnel
numbers and availability are essential in order to provide appropriate veterinary care to all animals that may need it
at the facility.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In building "Iso five", Pen # 2 housed 18 cats. The dimensions of this pen measured 130 inches long x 76 inches
wide for a total of 9880 in.² or 68 ft.². The body weight ranges for this group of cats was greater than 8.8 pounds.
Floor space requirements for cats in this weight range would be 4ft.² for each cat, for a total of 72 ft.². This pen does
not adequately provide the required amount of floor space for the number of cats being housed within. The facility
needs to review its’ space requirements for animals, and ensure that appropriate floor space is provided for all
animals within an enclosure. The facility removed one cat from the pen which resulted in an appropriate amount of
floor space for the amount of animals housed within.
*****Corrected at the time of inspection
3.6(b)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In building "Iso one, "Room 4, there is an enclosure group housing 12 intact adult male cats. A cat with ID number
16JCV2 was found with a lacerated abrasion of approximately 2 cm on the dorsal aspect of the neck, with an
additional 1 cm wound on the ventral aspect of the neck, and a small scab on the muzzle. In addition, cat ID number
15KIMI was observed with multiple scratches on it’s nose. Inspectors observing the animals in this room noticed a
black cat exhibiting aggressive behavior towards the others (chasing). Other cats exhibited lesser types of
aggression including hissing and growling. Several cats appeared to be thinner than other cats in that grouping,
which may indicate food guarding or other forms of incompatibility. Incompatibility of animals which are being
housed together can result in unnecessary distress and injury. While the facility addresses incompatibilities for
dogs, there are no SOPs addressing incompatibility in cats, and groupings do not take into consideration
temperament or behavioral factors. Incompatibilities can negatively affect both physical and behavioral health. The
facility must relocate incompatible cats immediately, and assess and address compatibility issues for all cats in light
of individual and species typical behaviors.
