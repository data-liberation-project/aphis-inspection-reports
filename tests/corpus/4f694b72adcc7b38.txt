Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
**The research facility utilizes a local veterinarian to address veterinary care and emergency issues on a part time basis,
however, there was not a written program of veterinary care in place. The research facility has an attending veterinarian
but they are not easily accessible geographically requiring the use of a local veterinarian. The facility needs to have a
written program of veterinary care that has been reviewed by the local veterinarian to ensure the animals are provided
timely and appropriate veterinary care in addition to regularly scheduled visits.
