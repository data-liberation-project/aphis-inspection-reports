3.25(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Although the side walls of the enclosures measured approximately 7 inches in height, during the inspection, there were 2
guinea pigs observed to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The enclosure must contain the animals. The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times
and does not allow them to escape.
3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
One of the guinea pig enclosures (Pen 34 housing 14 guinea pigs) had an approximately 5 inch area of the side wall
where the wires were bent creating an opening with sharp points.
Wires with sharp points along enclosures can cause injury to the guinea pigs and can lead to escape if the enclosure
walls are not high enough to contain the animals.
Primary enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.
