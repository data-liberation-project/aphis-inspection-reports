2.31(d)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An adverse event resulting in the death of an animal occurred in Dec 2016 under protocol 2016-100051. Although
this protocol had been approved by the IACUC, it was a blanket protocol that appeared to cover all procedures the
investigator might want to do with animals. There were at least 7 different procedures listed, ranging from delivering
topical eye drops to awake animals to multiple procedures requiring anesthesia. There was a list of multiple
anesthetics and analgesics but no specific anesthetic protocols linked to specific procedures.
Per the facilities’ SOP’s, prior to beginning a project a study design outlining in detail specifically what is to be done
is supposed to be submitted and approved by the IACUC. A study design was not submitted or approved by the
IACUC prior to the start of this project.
The IACUC is responsible for reviewing those components of the activities related to the care and use of animals
and determining that the proposed activities are in accordance with regulations prior to those activities occurring.
Had a study design been submitted for IACUC and attending veterinarian approval new animal welfare concerns
introduced by new variables may have been identified. At least the veterinary staff and the post approval monitoring
staff would have known this project was being done and would have had the opportunity to ensure activities were
being conducted according to protocol.
The facility has since revised their protocol format requiring protocols to be project specific and retrained personal
involved in the adverse event.
The facility needs to ensure study designs and/or protocols with specific details for each procedure are reviewed
and approved by the IACUC prior to the procedure beginning.
To be corrected by Aug 28, 2017This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
