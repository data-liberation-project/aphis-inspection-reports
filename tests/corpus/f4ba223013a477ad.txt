ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
According to the licensee a fox with hair loss on the tail was sold at a discount price without seeking appropriate
guidance from the attending veterinarian (AV) regarding the tail condition.
Once an animal is under possession of the licensed facility, it is the responsibility of the facility to insure appropriate
veterinary care when a condition like hair loss or any other condition is identified.The facility should also follow the
instructions of the attending veterinarian as written in the program of veterinary care. The PVC did not have
instructions regarding any of the animal species under the facilities inventory and according to the licensee the AV
was not contacted for the condition observed on the fox tail.
Dealers shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care.which include appropriate methods to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
To be corrected by the next inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
