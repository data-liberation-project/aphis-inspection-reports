ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One black, tan and white adult male Papillion ( microchip number 0A01487051 ) was observed placing no weight
on the right front foot. The dog was observed holding the foot up 100 percent over a two to three minute period.
The right front foot was painful when touched. The foot was slightly swollen and has a circular hairless area on the
top of the foot by the toes. This area is reddened and has a moist appearance. The licensee stated that this was
the first time the limp had been noticed. At the time of inspection, the attending veterinarian had not been
consulted. Foot problems can be painful when the dog has to place weight on the foot which affects the mobility
and daily activity of the dog. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate
treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct by
end of business 6/11/15.
*********************************
* One white colored Bichon ( Microchip number 097 343 820 ) has a crusted surface with a cream colored fluid
discharge on the right side area where the ear would be located. No odor was detected coming from the ear at time
of inspection. The licensee stated that she had noticed the condition and had treated the area with peroxide and
Neosporin. At that time of inspection the attending veterinarian had not been consulted nor had any treatment
been provided at the time of inspection. Ear infections can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to
potential health issues, tissue damage or inflammation of the ear canal.
The upper muzzle was offset to the left of the lower jaw of the same Bichon listed above. The dog was repeatedly
licking the side of its mouth. The dog displayed signs of pain by being non cooperative, head-shy and refused or
was unable to open its mouth when the inspector and owner tried to examine the mouth. At that time of inspection
the attending veterinarian had not been consulted nor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection.
Mouth issues can be painful affecting the ability of the animal to consume feed, water and be able to vocalize. The
licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate treatment plan administrated. The
outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct by end of business 6/11/15.********************************
* The following medication available to treat the dogs at the facility was past the labeled expiration date. The
recorded expiration date on one 169 fluid ounce container of Vetrimec was 11/2014. This medication was
intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and is therefore ready for use. The
usage of expired drugs on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not
constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired
drugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure
that all medications used on the dogs have not gone past the recorded expiration date. Correct by 6/15/15.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* Computerized records ( Easy Kennel ) have incomplete information on eight dogs housed at the premise. No
official identification was listed on these dogs at time of inspection. Complete and accurate records are needed to
ensure each animal(cid:25)s identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace dogs. The licensee
must maintain records which fully disclose all information concerning each dog in their possession. Correct by
7/8/15.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* An enclosure containing two dogs had an two to three inch gap between the side panels where the panels were
no longer attached to each other to create the corner. An enclosure containing one dog had a side panel that had
become detached from the side support structure. An enclosure containing two dogs had flooring portions that had
become separated and created an approximate 1/2 to an 1 in. (depending on weight/activity of the dogs) gap.
These gaps are indicative of disrepair and can cause injury to the feet, legs and heads of the dogs if they are caught
and/or pinched between the two opposing structures. Licensee must ensure that all structures are constructed and
maintained to be in good repair and protect the dogs from injury. Correct by 6/22/15
* Facility inspection and exit interview was conducted with the representative, Angela DePoe ACI and Robert
Bacon ACI.
