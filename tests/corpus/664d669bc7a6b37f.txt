3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Outside Room", the enclosures are framed with metal pipes. On at least three enclosures, affecting at least
seven dogs, the metal pipes along the bottom of the frame are showing excessive rusting. The rust causes pitting
and flaking of the metal and it cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. The rusty metal pipes must be replaced or
altered in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization of the metal every two weeks.
3.1(c)(1)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "East Whelping Room", two enclosures, affecting at least five dogs, have flooring constructed of wire and the
wire has broken and bent upward towards the dogs. In one enclosure, affecting one dog, the sides of the enclosure
are constructed of wire and the wire has broken along the bottom and twisted inward towards the dog. Sharp points
and edges pose an injury risk to the dogs. Licensee must establish a maintenance plan to ensure that all
enclosures remain free of sharp points and edges and eliminates the injury risk to the dogs. During the inspection
the licensee removed and/or covered all broken wires from the three enclosures.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the "Outside Room", at least three self-feeders, affecting at least six dogs, have a buildup of excess hair in them.
Also, in the same room, the fronts of the enclosures are made of chain link fencing. At least six enclosures,
affecting at least ten dogs, have an excessive buildup of hair on their fronts. The buildup of hair on the self-feeders
and enclosure fronts can pose a disease risk to the dogs. The self-feeders and enclosure fronts must be cleaned
and sanitized once every two weeks, or as often as necessary, to reduce the accumulation of hair and disease
hazards.
In the "West Whelping Room", the whelping boxes are made of a hard, plastic material. Three of these boxes,
affecting at least three adult dogs and fourteen puppies, have been excessively chewed by the dogs. In the "East
Whelping Room", one enclosure, affecting one dog, has two bowls made of a hard, plastic material that had been
excessively chewed by the dog. The licensee removed these two bowls from the enclosure during the inspection. The damage caused by chewing allows dirt and grime to penetrate the surface of the bowls and whelping boxes
and does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization to occur. All damaged whelping boxes and bowls must be
replaced or altered in manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization to occur every two weeks.
The female Maltese, microchip #087057013, cited under 2.40 (b) (2) on September 9, 2014 has been evaluated by
