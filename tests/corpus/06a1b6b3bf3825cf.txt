There is a sheet of plywood which divides the lynx enclosure into 2 sections. A small portion located on the upper
surface, adjacent to the pass through, has deteriorated leaving a hole and splinters. The rest of this plywood
appears wet/damp and may no longer be structurally sound.
The splinters pose a risk of injury if this animal shall have contact with it. All enclosures shall be structurally sound
and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
