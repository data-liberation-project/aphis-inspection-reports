CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Around each of the facilities there were weeds and or grass growing up and into the enclosures. The Wheaton
building had a rear enclosure that had wood surfaces that were not impervious to moisture, and areas with green
and black coloration. In that same enclosure was a metal item with sharp corners that could cause injury to the
animals. Soiled items, such as carpet pieces, were placed outside and not disposed of properly. These conditions
cause areas for rodents, and other pests and vermin. The licensee must keep premises clean and in good repair to
include removal of trash, junk, waste products and other discarded matter. Weeds, grasses, and bushes must be
controlled.
