3.6(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
It was observed that 1 dog, Nevada, was in an enclosure that did not provide adequate space. Nevada measured21 inches
(nose to base of tail), and would therefore require 729 square inches of floor space, but only had 432. All dogs and
their enclosures should be measured, and changes should be made as needed to ensure that all dogs have
adequate floor space in their primary enclosures. Adequate floor space is required in order to promote the health
and well-being of the animals.
This was previously cited at their 002 site.

3.6(c)(1)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
It was observed that two dogs, Nevada and Deusa, were in enclosures that did not meet the height requirements for
primary enclosures: they did not provide at least six inches of space above the heads of the dogs when they are
standing normally. Not all dogs were observed in their enclosures. All dogs and their enclosures should be
measured, and changes should be made as needed to ensure that all dogs have adequate height in their primary
enclosures. Adequate height is required in order to promote the health and well-being of the animals.
This was previously cited at their 002 site.

3.8(c)(1)(1)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
The group housing pen for exercising the dogs during the day does not provide at least 100 percent of the required
space for each dog if maintained separately under the minimum floor space requirements of Sec. 3.6(c)(1) of this
subpart. Although the facility provides the dogs with additional exercise on a regular basis through walking and
conditioning sessions, the floor space available when they are housed together does not meet the minimum space
requirements.

3.8
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.The exhibitor did not have a written exercise plan approved by the attending veterinarian. According to the owner,
the dogs are in the exercise pen each day and are regularly given walks and receive positive physical contact with
the owner during conditioning sessions. The exhibitor must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to
provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. This plan must be approved by the attending veterinarian. The plan
must be made available to APHIS personnel at time of inspection.
