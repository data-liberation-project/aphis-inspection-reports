ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adult, female Shih Tzu/Yorkshire Terrier with tag number 09 has a recessed gum line over the upper right
"cheek-teeth" (pre-molar teeth). One of the small upper right premolar teeth is loose when touched. The large tooth
in this area (4th premolar) has exposed roots. Dental disease can be painful as it can cause damage to the gum
tissue, teeth, and the bone of the jaw supporting the teeth. Dental disease can also impact the ability of the dog to
eat normally and affect the overall health of the animal. This dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian by 17
May 2017 in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed
and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be
documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
A bottle of injectable oxytocin was stored with other medications in use in the sheltered building. There were no
instructions from a licensed veterinarian for the use of this medication on dogs in this facility. Lack of directions
from the veterinarian can impact the care of the animals through incorrect use, unintended side effects and
ineffective results. The licensee must ensure that all medications are used in a manner consistent with the provision
of adequate veterinary care to protect the health of the animals. This includes written instructions from a licensed
veterinarian for medications used on animals in the facility. To be corrected 17 May 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
