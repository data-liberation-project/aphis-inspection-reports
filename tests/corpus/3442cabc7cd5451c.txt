2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee has changed attending veterinarians and has no documentation from the new attending veterinarian.

Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and
regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor.

Written documentation from a veterinarian is required to be kept on hand to ensure adequate veterinary care is provided
to all animals at the facility.
