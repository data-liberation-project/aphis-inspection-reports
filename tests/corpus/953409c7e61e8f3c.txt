*** Several of the outdoor wire mesh enclosures need to be addressed. Some of the wire between runs is no longer
securely attached to the base and is creating gaps between enclosures. This could allow an appendage to get
through and cause potential injury. Several of the metal doors have flaking paint and are rusted, potentially
affecting the structural integrity of the door. Lastly there is a section of the wood beam underneath the mesh floor at
the end of the run that is rotted out with sections of wood missing. These outdoor sections of the primary enclosure
must be maintained in good repair for the safety of the dogs.

*** Several feeders in the kennel are rusted along the lip of the feeder. Once rust develops the feeders can no
longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. These feeders need to be replaced to facilitate cleaning of the feeders
for the health of the dogs.
*** Several areas of wood inside the shelter boxes are chewed at the top and the area is no longer impervious to
moisture. These areas of wood need to be sanded and resealed to keep the area impervious to moisture to facilitate
cleaning and sanitizing.
