2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
On the day of inspection an adult male lion “Cesar” had yet to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian for an ocular
issue in his left eye. Approximately 2 to 3 days beforehand, the keeper noticed the left eye was tearing up and the lower
eyelid had swollen up noticeably. The keeper commented that perhaps Cesar had gotten dirt in his eye. It was decided by
facility staff to monitor the progression and possibly flush the eye with a hose if the condition did not improve. On the day
of inspection, the globe appeared sunken, and the iris and pupil could not be visualized. At this time, the attending
veterinarian had yet to be contacted concerning Cesar’s eye. Furthermore, Cesar has a history of arthritis. He appeared
hunched over and moved stiffly when approached by one of the facility managers. Currently, he is receiving supplements
for his joints but not any pain medication.
The facility must maintain a program of veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. Untreated ocular issues may lead to unnecessary pain or discomfort for the
animal and ultimately possible loss of the eye.
Correct by having a licensed veterinarian evaluate the animal immediately.

Sanitation.
On July 2nd, 2019, a tree fell onto an enclosure and damaged the primary enclosure fencing. The tigers “Rajah” and
“Rory” subsequently escaped their enclosures and were euthanized via gunshot by the licensee.
On August 7th, 2020, a tree fell onto an enclosure and damaged the primary enclosure fencing. The tiger “Kimba”
subsequently escaped its enclosure and was euthanized via gunshot by FWC officers.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices set in this subpart. Currently, the population of older trees on the property poses a significant risk to
the structural integrity of animal enclosures. At the time of inspection, the facility had contracted a tree service to identify
and remove problem trees quarterly. Additionally, the president of the board is contracting more frequent visits from the
tree service.
Correct by creating a plan to identify and remove problematic trees located near animal enclosures. Include a schedule
for their removal as well as a plan to continue routine monitoring thereafter.

Feeding.
The facility is currently thawing their frozen meats by removing it from the freezer in its original packaging 2-3 days prior
and leaving it outside (not in a fridge). The day before feeding, the food is then removed from its packaging and left to
thaw in a metal sink outside. The sink is covered with a large plastic Tupperware cover; however, the cover does not
provide a complete seal to prevent access to the meat by the elements or pests. Any supplementation to the diets is
added while the meat is still slightly frozen. This process is continued year-round. At this time, the meat is not thawed in a
refrigerator prior to being fed to carnivores on the property.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to


maintain all animals in good health. Currently, the facility’s thawing procedures do not keep the food free from
contamination and ensure meat is not adversely affected by outdoor temperature variations. Additionally, the carnivore
supplements may melt away during the thawing process and lose their efficacy.
Correct by thawing the meat in a refrigerator at least 2 to 3 days before feeding and applying the supplements to the
thawed meat.

A shelf in the food storage area that stores an assortment of canned food for the capuchins and lemurs also stored
cleaning supplies and engine oil.
Substances that are toxic to the nonhuman primates that are required for normal husbandry practices must not be stored
in food storage and preparation areas.
Correct by removing any cleaning and husbandry supplies from the food storage area.
