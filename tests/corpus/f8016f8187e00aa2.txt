RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records of acquisition and disposition for all covered species must be available for review by USDA officials during
inspections. During this inspection records of disposition/death were not current. Some of the requested
information was unable to be reviewed. This facility needs to implement a better method of record keeping that
allows all required information to be reviewed within a reasonable time.
