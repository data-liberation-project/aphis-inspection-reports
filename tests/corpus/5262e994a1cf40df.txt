INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Sec. 3.2 Indoor housing facilities(b)Ventilation.
The indoor whelping facility did not have sufficient ventilation and smelled of ammonia. The ammonia burned the
inspector(cid:25)s eyes and throat. The facility has an auxiliary vent fan in the ceiling that was partially covered with a
metal plate. The licensee struggled with the controls to get the fan to turn on. Breathing air with high ammonia levels
can lead to health complications. The licensee shall provide sufficient ventilation to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia
levels, and moisture condensation and to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.
