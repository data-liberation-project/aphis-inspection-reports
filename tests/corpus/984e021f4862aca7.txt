2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**While reviewing records it was noted that the written Program of Veterinary Care was not complete. A hedgehog
that was acquired on October 21, 2014 had not been added to the list of animals on the Program of Veterinary
Care. The Program of Veterinary Care should reflect the correct inventory of animals. The Program of Veterinary
Care should be modified to accurately reflect the species housed at the facility. Lack of a complete Program of
Veterinary Care does not ensure that proper veterinary care is being provided in accordance with currently accepted
veterinary medical standards.
