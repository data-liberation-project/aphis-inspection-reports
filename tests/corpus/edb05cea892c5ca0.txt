A male beagle with no identification tag, had a buildup of a brown substance on his teeth. The buildup on the back
teeth was so excessive that the teeth were no longer visible to the inspector. The licensee explained that the dogs
do not get their teeth cleaned. Poor dental health can result in discomfort and an increase in disease risk to the
dog. This beagle must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and the inspector advised licensee to have all of his
dogs checked by a licensed veterinarian for dental problems.
