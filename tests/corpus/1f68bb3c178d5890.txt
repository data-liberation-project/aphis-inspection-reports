ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:10 on
10/07/2015.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 12:10 and knocked on the door, there was no answer. I called both of the
phone numbers I have for the licensee and left a message. I waited at the facility for 30 minutes before leaving.
