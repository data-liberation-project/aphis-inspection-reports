--In the main building an adult, female Shar-Pei #106 named “Aris” had a red, fleshy protrusion covering almost her
entire right eye to the point where the pupil was not visible. It was a moist looking, reddish in appearance, 1”
prolapsed growth of tissue protruding from the lower corner of the right eye. It was inflamed, had a milky-green
discharge, and was impairing her vision in that eye. This could be caused by infection, allergies, injury, irritation or
other medical conditions that could be painful. The licensee stated that this mass of skin had been on her eye for
about a year. The licensee also stated that Aris had been seen by a veterinarian within that year, but no
improvement had been made to the condition of the eye and there was no documentation proving that a visit to the
veterinarian had been made. The licensee scheduled an appointment for Aris to go to the veterinarian the following
day (10/27) at 2pm.The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis
and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
