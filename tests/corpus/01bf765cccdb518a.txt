ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:54 AM on
26-Oct-16.
Called the exhibitor's cell phone upon arriving on site, and left a voicemail stating that I was on site to do an
inspection, and requesting a return call. Not able to access actual residence, due to security gates, and uncertainty
as to where his domicile at this harbor is located. Waited for 30 minutes, did not receive a return call.
