RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
The minutes of IACUC meetings did not include all activities of the Committee, and Committee deliberations as
required. Specifically, adverse events reported to the IACUC were not outlined and there was no indication that the
members concurred with the proposed corrections. The Training and Compliance staff generally gives a verbal
report to the IACUC. This report is not outlined in the minutes, not formalized and approved, and not available as a
written document to reviewers. Omissions of this type do not assure that the IACUC members are provided the
proper notification and oversight for the members to assess the research facility's animal program, facilities, and
procedures as required. Additionally, failure to include information regarding deliberations of events with significant
animal welfare impacts prevents APHIS Officials from evaluating the facilities response and adherence to the
Animal Welfare Act. Each research facility shall maintain IACUC records that include minutes of meetings, records
of attendance, activities of the Committee, and Committee deliberations. Correct by ensuring that records contain
required information from this point forward.

MISCELLANEOUS.
A rabbit died after being left in its cage which was sent through the autoclave for disinfection prior to regular cage
washing. The autoclave begins with a prolonged vacuum cycle that the facility veterinary staff determined caused
the animal to die by asphyxiation. The animal caretaker had failed to notice that an animal was present in the cage.
The incident was reported immediately and the following corrective actions were taken: The individual responsible
was given a warning, the light levels in the room were increased during cage changes, cages must now be slid out
of the rack when transferring animals, and a second person will now check each cage with a light before placement
in the autoclave. Staff has been trained on the new procedures. The person handling the cage, and therefore the
animal, was in the process of handling. All research facilities must ensure that handling of animals is conducted as
expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma , overheating, excessive cooling,
behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Corrected by facility before this inspection as
indicated above.
3.76(b)INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
A room containing four owl monkeys had a relative humidity reading of 21% on Kestral reading during inspection. A
review of the January 2015 room log indicated that humidity had been below 20% every day of the month to date (3
weeks). A paper posted at the room boldly showed the target humidity to be 40% with a range of 30 to 70%. Indoor
housing facilities as defined in 9CFR section 1.1 must be capable of maintaining humidity levels of 30 to 70%. Due
to the small size of these animals, and their native habitat, a 20% relative humidity is not consistent with a level that
ensures the health and well-being of the animals housed and is not consistent with generally accepted professional
and husbandry practices. Failure to provide appropriate humidity can result in the development of clinical signs
including coughing, dehydration, and nose-bleeds. While the facility is currently monitoring for these signs,
intervention would only be provided after the animal had felt the effects related to low humidity. Indoor housing
facilities for non-human primates must maintain the relative humidity at a level that ensures the health and
well-being of the animals as directed by the attending veterinarian. Additionally, humidity must be maintained at
levels in-keeping with generally accepted professional and husbandry practices. Correct By: 13 February 2015

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Five of the 34 primary enclosures for macaques at location 13 had perches added to them for enrichment. These
extra perches (each cage had a fixed perch) were hung by four(4) chains. Two(2) chains on one end of the perch
were 7 links long and the two on the other end were 13 links long. Each link was approximately one inch in length.
One of the perches had been flipped over by the primate so that the chains crossed and created four triangular
holes. The triangles on the 13 link side were large enough to accommodate the head of the primate. All four
triangles could accommodate an appendage and might cause entrapment if the perch was flipped again. This
facility had two primate deaths that appeared to be by strangulation in chains and were confirmed as asphyxiation
on necropsy. Both of these deaths were reported to OLAW. The first was closed with them 15 January 2014 and the
second was closed with OLAW 26 September 2014. Based on this experience, the facility took measures to remove
or redesign chain structures in or on primate cages. Long chains were removed or covered in PVC pipe throughout
the facility but the Five(5) perches supported by chains at location 13 were not removed or modified. Primary
enclosures for non-human primates must be constructed and maintained in a manner so that they adequately
protect the animals from injury. While enrichment is important for the behavioral health of primates, chains that can
form loops are known to cause injury to appendages and death by strangulation. Although the facility recognized
the ongoing risk of chains, they failed to identify potentially hazardous chains in all housing areas for NHPs. The
facility removed all identified potentially hazardous chain devices at the time of inspection. Additionally the facility
must ensure that all primary enclosures are maintained in a manner to prevent injury to the animals from this point
forward.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives and the IACUC Chair.Additional Inspectors
