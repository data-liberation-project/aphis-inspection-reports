Miscellaneous.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:10 AM on 2/6/23.

The inspector arrived at 10:10 AM on 2/6/23 to conduct an inspection. This date/time was one of the days/times during
this semester when a facility representative was scheduled to be on campus. No one was in the office on arrival and
according to the schedule posted on the door, there was a class in session on campus for another half hour. The
inspector waited 30 minutes and then tried to reach the facility contact by phone and email. The contact subsequently
replied via email that he/she was off campus and unavailable. An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted as
there was no other facility representative who could accompany the inspector.

This is the FIRST attempted inspection of the research facility.
