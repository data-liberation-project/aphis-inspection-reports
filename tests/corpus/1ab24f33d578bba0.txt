3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The area housing four steers lacks adequate drainage. There is a large amount of mud on half of the enclosure
and the other half is wet soil. Lack of access to dry ground or bedding can cause animals to get sick. Provide
adequate drainage or provide free access to dry ground/bedding for animals at all times to protect their health and
well being.
