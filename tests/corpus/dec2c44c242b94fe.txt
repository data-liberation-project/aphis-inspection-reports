ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female ferret is laying in the corner of her enclosure and closer inspection of the animal revealed that she is
lethargic, appeared weakened, and has numerous engorged ticks located on her head and body. Ticks attached
and feeding off the animal could be detrimental to the animal’s health and a lethargic attitude could indicate an
underlying health issue.
This ferret must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. This diagnosis
and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspectors upon request.
At the exit interview the inspectors verbally instructed the licensee to have the ferret evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian by noon on August 23, 2017.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the “Ferret Building” at least seven enclosures, containing a total of at least fifteen ferrets, have broken wires
creating sharp points at the level of the animals. The affected enclosures have broken wires in the back corners
along the enclosure flooring or broken wires in the center of the floors creating holes that an animal’s foot could
pass through.
At least thirteen enclosures, containing at least sixteen skunks have broken wires creating sharp points at the level
of the animals. Several of the affected enclosures have sharp points located around the entry door of the nest box.
One affected enclosure has a nest box that has been pulled apart and the sharp end of a nail is exposed. Another
affected enclosure has broken wires in the floor creating a hole that an animal’s foot could pass through. One
affected enclosure has a long, loose wire hanging through the enclosure and another enclosure has a piece of
metal attached to the side wall and the twisted wire holding the metal onto the enclosure has a created a sharp
point. In two enclosures, containing a total of four foxes, the wooden frames have rotted away leaving exposed nails at the
level of the animals. In two enclosures, containing a total of four foxes, the wooden floor supports under the
enclosures have broken and are no longer fully supporting the wire floors. In another enclosure, containing one fox,
there is a broken wire creating a sharp point around the water receptacle.
In one enclosure containing at least two raccoons, there is a long piece of loose wire creating a sharp point at the
level of the animals. In at least three more enclosures, containing a total of at least six raccoons, there is a broken
wire creating a sharp point around the water receptacle.
In the “Ferret Building” one enclosure, containing three ferrets, has a gate that is loose and easily moved. The gate
could be opened far enough that the foot and leg of an animal could pass through.
Sharp points and holes in the flooring could cause injury to the animals. Broken structural supports could cause the
enclosure to be unsafe for the animals. The licensee must eliminate all the sharp points and holes in the flooring, as
well as, ensure that all housing including the wooden framework is constructed of material appropriate for the
animals housed and is maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals safely.
Continual monitoring and maintenance of cage and housing is an ongoing process.
3.130
WATERING.
In one enclosure, containing two foxes, the inside of the water receptacle is coated with green algae and the algae
is floating in the water. In one enclosure containing one fox and another enclosure containing at least one raccoon,
there is an excessive number of flies floating in the water. Water sources contaminated by algae and insects could
have a negative effect on the health of the animals.
If potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health
and comfort of the animals. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary. The licensee must ensure that
the water source is free of algae and flies to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
Correction date: By noon on August 23, 2017
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
At least nine enclosures, containing at least eighteen raccoons, have an excessive buildup of old excrement located
in front of the den box or at the front of the enclosure. Some of the excrement is dried and covered in a graymaterial that has the appearance of mold.
In one enclosure, containing one skunk, the nest box has an excessive buildup of dried, dark colored organic
material inside it.
Failure to remove excreta, food waste and other organic material from the enclosures can lead to contamination,
disease hazards and odors, which can affect the health and well-being of the animals.
The licensee must ensure that excreta and organic material is removed from all primary enclosures and nest boxes
as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards
and to reduce odors.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The animals are fed a raw ground meat mixture that is placed on the top of their wire enclosures. In the “Ferret
Building” at least two enclosures, containing at least six ferrets, has a heavy accumulation of flies on the food and
one of these affected enclosures has a large number of insects on the walls of the enclosure. In this same building,
one enclosure containing one fox, has a large accumulation of flies in the food receptacle. In the “Raccoon
Building” one enclosure containing at least three raccoons has a heavy accumulation of flies on the food. In one
enclosure containing one skunk there is a heavy accumulation of flies on the food.
Beneath numerous enclosures in the “Ferret Building”, “Raccoon Building” and at least one skunk enclosure there is
an excessively large number of maggots mixed in the excreta and organic material.
The presence of pests can cause contamination of the food supply and also lead to health hazards for the animals.
The licensee must establish and maintain a safe and effective program for the control of flies and other pests.
