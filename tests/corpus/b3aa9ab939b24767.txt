3.101(a)(1)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal back wall of the outside quarantine area for the marine mammals has peeling and flaking paint. This wall
needs to be scraped and painted to prevent flaking paint from falling on the floor and/or into the quarantine pool.
Flaking paint could contaminate the pool and possibly be ingested by the marine mammals when contained in the
quarantine area. A regular schedule of enclosure review and maintenance needs to be in place and followed.
