Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Surfaces in multiple non-human primate enclosures in both buildings housing marmosets and tamarins are in need of
cleaning and sanitization. The hard surfaces including the flat plastic perches, plastic tire swings and the plastic baskets
along with the fleece cubes are caked/covered with excreta both dried and fresh. In several of the enclosures excreta has
built up on some of these surfaces to the extent that the non-human primates cannot avoid coming into contact with the
excreta when they use these items/move around the enclosure. Numerous insects dead and alive including gnats and
roaches were noted in the two animal buildings and in and on some of the enclosures. Excreta and food debris must be
removed regularly to prevent the nonhuman primates from becoming soiled and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests
and odors. All hard surfaces must be spot cleaned daily. Correct by 1/19/23.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Dead and live insects including gnats and roaches were identified in both animal buildings. Live insects were seen
crawling on the bars of and items within some of the non-human primate enclosures. Insects can affect the non-human
primates by spreading disease and by causing irritation. The facility has a pest control company treat the outside of the
building and glue traps were seen containing a lot of dead insects inside one of the buildings. The facility needs to


increase cleaning/sanitization levels and work with their attending veterinarian and pest control company to establish a
pest control program that is more effective. The facility shall establish and maintain a pest control program so as to
promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. Correct by 1/27/23.

Space requirements.
Two wire enclosures were identified as housing 20 sugar gliders each. These sugar gliders arrived at the facility last
week. The current enclosures measure 23inx17in wide and 15in tall. The enclosures included only three small fleece
pouches lying on the floor of the enclosures in which the gliders were huddled. The enclosures were too small for the
number of gliders within to make normal postural and social adjustments. There were no other structures such as perches
or climbing structures in the enclosures. Gliding animals need sufficient vertical and horizontal space to move about with
adequate freedom of movement and make normal postural and social adjustments. In addition they should have elevated
areas to climb, launch from and stretch out their limbs. Correct by 1/22/23.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
