2.33(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Over half of the goat herd (24 out of 42 animals) was afflicted with various ailments and severe medical problems to
include emaciation, diarrhea, lameness, overgrown hooves, coughing and upper respiratory disease. Low body
weight and emaciation can indicate a parasite problem, dental issues or overall poor health. Diarrhea can also
indicate a parasite problem or other diseases. Overgrown hooves can lead to lameness and make movement
difficult and extremely painful. It can stress ligaments and joints from the abnormal movement. Coughing may
indicate respiratory disease, parasites or other diseases.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Over half of the goat herd (24 out of 42 animals) was afflicted with various ailments and severe medical problems.
These medical issues were not reported to the attending veterinarian. Prompt reporting and discussion of animal
health issues with the attending veterinarian is essential and must occur to prevent diseases and other medical
issues from worsening, thus leading to undue suffering by the animals. A mechanism of direct and frequent
communication must be established and maintained so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal
health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. To be corrected immediately.
3.131(a) DIRECT
SANITATION.
The barn for the animals was full of fecal material and wet throughout, so that none of the animals had a clean or
dry area they could access. Lack of a clean, dry facility will lead to severe discomfort and disease in the animals.
Areas included the sleeping and feeding areas, and also the walkways for the animals. To be corrected by close of
business on March 7, 2016.
Note: This inspection report includes only the direct non-compliances. A subsequent report will be prepared to
document all other non-compliances noted at the time of inspection.
An exit interview was conducted on March 4, 2016 with the facility representative, Dr. Carolyn McKinnie, SACS, and
