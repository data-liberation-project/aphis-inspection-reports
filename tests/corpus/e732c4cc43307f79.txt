Primary enclosures.
At time of inspection the elevated flooring in the whelping house was constructed of hard plastic with 1" openings and a
"tender foot" style with large openings. The feet of the puppies housed, newborn to approximately 6 weeks old, pass
through the openings of both floorings. Additionally, some of the puppies were reluctant to move from the mat/blanket
provided to walk on the primary flooring. The safety of the animals is important to avoid injury. The licensee shall repair or
replace the flooring of the whelping building to ensure that the feet and legs of the animals housed do not pass through
the openings in the floor.
