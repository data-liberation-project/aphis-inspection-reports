PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One of the wooden perches in the Ring-tail lemurs outdoor enclosure is rotted to the extent that one end is no
longer completely attached. This perch is in danger of falling and could cause injury to the animals. The perch
needs to be removed or replaced. Correct by 22 March 2014.

FEEDING.
The following problems were noted with the primate feeding practices:
1. Monkey bisquits are being offered in black, rubber based bowls. The bowls have deteriorated and been
chewed by the animals such that the majority that were examined are no longer considered sanitizable. Sanitizing
food receptacles is an important part of a disease control program. Deteriorated bowls must be removed from
service by 4 March 2014.
2. There was a stack of bowls in the kitchen that had been washed and were ready to be used for the next day's
feeding per the farm manager. Upon examination, it was noted that several of the bowls had food material still
present on the outside. Used food receptacles must be completely washed and santized after use. Correction to
occur immediately and ongoing.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The facility's pest control program appears to be inadequate. An accumulation of rodent feces was found in the
kitchen in the old primate building and also in the farm office where the food is being stored. The unchecked
presence of rodents in an animal facility can lead to contamination of animal feed and other items and cancontribute to disease transmission. All aspects of the rodent control program should be reviewed and
improvements implemented where necessary. Recommended steps to be taken include (but are not limited to) the
following: Spilled food should be swept up immediately, all opened food stored in containers with tight lids.
Harborage should be limited by removing accumulated unused items, and by sealing up holes in walls. Access
should be limited by sealing openings around entrances. Correct by March 4, 2014
An exit interview was conducted with the farm manager and the owner.
