SANITATION.
The facility doesn't have an effective program for the control of mice. The facility does have live mouse traps
present, but they are not effectively controlling the mouse population. Excessive mouse feces were observed along
the perimeter of the room containing the hedgehogs, the gerbil, the hamster, the chinchilla, and degus. Additionally,
a mouse was observed inside of the chinchilla enclosure during the inspection. Mice can carry and spread disease.

Implement provisions that effectively control the mouse population at the facility.
