2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*The attending veterinarian has last visited the facility for a regularly scheduled visit on 5-5-15. The written program
of veterinary care states that visits shall be done annually. Five animals were identified during this inspection as
needing immediate veterinary care.
*The current written program of veterinary care is not up to date. The parasite control section drugs as written do
not match what the owners state they are currently administering and need to be updated.
A written program of veterinary care discussing all preventative and routine treatments to be administered by the
owners along with regularly scheduled visits to the premises by the veterinarian are necessary to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals. Correct by Oct. 4, 2016.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following animals are in need of veterinary care and have not yet been seen by a veterinarian for a diagnosis
and treatment recommendations:
*One white alpaca named Lorelei was noted to be very thin on the previous inspection. She has more hair during
this inspection but is still visibly thin. The spinal vertebrae protrude with no muscle covering. The hip bones are
protruding and very visible. Upon palpation no muscle or fat was present between the ribs and the skin. A second
tan male alpaca “Jax” is also thin based on appearance alone. The spinal vertebrae are prominent and the ribs
appear to have minimal covering over the bones. The facility states they have been deworming regularly because of
parasitism problems. Other alpaca and llamas have died of parasites over the last year. The owner stated his vet is
obtaining a new deworming medication for the alpacas and llamas.
*One brown approximately six month old dairy cow named Clementine appears very thin. The ribs are readily visible
with no fat or muscle covering. The vertebrae and hip bones are more prominent than typical of dairy cattle.
*One adult male black sheep was noted limping while walking and then lowered himself to the ground resting both
front legs down onto the elbows to graze. This position is indicative of the sheep taking pressure off his painful feet.
He remained in this position rather than standing. The owner reports they have been treating for hoof rot with
Coppertox but the vet has not seen this animal. *One young grey goat acquired last week is isolated from the other animals due to coughing. The animal has
accumulated yellow tan discharge at both nostrils and a small amount of watery discharge from the eyes. The
owner has been treating with a one time injection of penicillin and additional injections of LA 200. The bottle is not
labeled for use in goats. The owner reports the dosage being administered was obtained online.
A veterinarian needs to see these animals to determine an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan to ensure their
health and prevent painful conditions and suffering. The facility shall have the five animals listed seen by a
veterinarian to ensure the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Five animals were identified during this inspection that require veterinary care. The owners have identified these
animals are in need of care and are treating them with medications they have on hand however there is no
documentation available to show that a veterinarian has been contacted regarding the problems identified by the
owners. A call to the veterinarian’s office confirmed that the animals have not been seen by the veterinarian. Daily
observation of all animals is being conducted but the facility has not developed a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication with the veterinarian. Such a communication mechanism shall be instituted so that problems of
animal health, behavior and well-being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. Correct by
Oct. 4, 2016.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The acquisition and disposition records are not complete and available for review. The records available list names,
ID numbers, sex and age for some of the animals but not all the animals present are listed and some listed are no
longer at the facility. In addition, the records do not include the required information regarding from where the
animals were acquired. Accurate records are necessary for health and ownership tracing. The facility shall make
and keep up to date the following information for all animals: name and address from whom they were acquired,
USDA number or drivers license number/state and vehicle plate number/state of person from whom they were
acquired, date acquired and species. APHIS form 7019 or other equivalent methods may be used to keep this
information. Correct by Oct. 15, 2016.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A large amount of accumulated excreta was noted in the pasture directly behind the house housing goats and
camelids (alpaca/llamas). The accumulation of wastes can attract flies and lead to spread of disease such asparasitic infections. The owners report they clear out the piles monthly. Based on the number of animals in the
pasture, the size of the accumulation, and a history of endoparasite problems, this clearing out needs to be done
more often. Provision shall be made for the removal and disposal of animal wastes regularly to prevent
accumulations. Correct by Oct. 15, 2016.
3.127(b) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*Several goats and camelids (llamas and alpacas) currently do not have access to shelter from the rain and other
inclement weather as newly obtained animals are being kept isolated/quarantined in the area with the shelter
structure. There are trees along the sides of the pasture that provide shade but they are not near enough to provide
protection from rain, wind and other weather.
*Three camelids (llamas and alpacas) in another pasture two of which are very thin have one tree that could provide
protection but the weeds have formed a thick covering underneath the tree such that they animals may not feel
comfortable getting to and underneath the tree. In addition there is no shelter from strong winds, blowing rain and
very cold weather. These thin animals require extra protection from the elements due to their body condition.
Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to local climatic conditions for the species concerned must be provided for the
animals kept outdoors to provide protection and prevent discomfort. Correct by Oct. 21, 2016.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The enclosure housing two alpacas and one llama has an overgrowth of dense weeds/shrubs some of which are 5
ft high. They form a dense thicket that the animals must go through to reach their natural shelter under the tree at
the back of the pasture and shade along the back treeline. Snakes, ticks and other pests may hide in the weeds.
Weeds also make it difficult to clean the pasture. The animals also may choose not to use the shelter as it may be
difficult/uncomfortable to wander through the thick shrubby weeds. In addition, a metal T post was standing by itself
in the weed area and may lead to animal injury. The enclosures must be kept clean and clear of weeds and excess
materials. Correct by Oct. 15, 2016.
Inspection and exit conducted with owners.
