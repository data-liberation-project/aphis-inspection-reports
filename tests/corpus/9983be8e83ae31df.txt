HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an enclosure, inside of the garage, which the wolf-hybrids have access to. The wooden panel, around the
exterior of the entrance into the garage, has jagged edges that appear to have been chewed. Additionally, the 2 x
4, which serves as a wall support adjacent to entrance, is no longer secured to the base of this garage wall. These
damaged areas could cause injury to the wolf-hybrids that utilize this space. The jagged edges of the wooden
panel, as well as the detached 2 x 4, must be repaired to protect the wolf-hybrids from injury.

3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The entire gate, on a mid-sized transport enclosure, is severely rusted. This transport enclosure was being utilized
to transport a wolf-hybrid to the veterinarian for surgery. Surfaces that come in contact with wolf-hybrids must be
free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitation. This transport enclosure gate must be
replaced to ensure that all surfaces that wolf-hybrids come in contact with can be readily cleaned and sanitized for
their health and well-being.
