2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Shetland Sheepdog (microchip #004520301) was observed repeatedly shaking her head. The inside of the
dog’s right ear is a pink color with areas of darker red throughout. The affected area appears moist and inflamed.
There is also dark brown material located within the affected area. The hair around the ear appears to be wet.
The licensee stated that this dog was older and was not easy to handle. The licensee did attempt to touch the dog,
but the dog growled at her so she was not able to catch the dog, therefore, the inspectors were not able to examine
the ear more closely. Poor ear health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment
plan. The licensee must ensure all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell, ACI Corbin Ranslem, and the facility representative.
Female Shih tzu (#104076110) cited on the previous inspection report under 2.40 (b)(2) has been evaluated by a
