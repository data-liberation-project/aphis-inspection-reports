2.40(a)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility does not currently have an attending veterinarian who is capable of providing adequate veterinary care
for the animals. Animals can become sick or injured and require immediate veterinary care. An attending
veterinarian is also required to provide health care checks and husbandry advice. The facility should ensure that a
veterinarian with marine mammal experience is employed and available to perform the necessary functions of an
attending veterinarian.

2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Appropriate methods were not used to diagnose and treat a male California Sea Lion in December 2014. The
animal was found dead on December 30, 2014.
Facility records show that the animal first exhibited signs of diminished appetite on December 18 and refused to eat
the following day. Calls were made to several veterinarians on 12/20 and the attending veterinarian dispensed an
oral antibiotic recommended by a consulting veterinarian on that day. On 12/22 facility staff contacted the attending
veterinarian to ask about an injectable form of the antibiotic, however no change in medication was made at that
time despite the fact that the animal would not eat and thus was not able to take the medication. Additional calls
were made to both the attending and consulting veterinarians over the next several days regarding the facility's
inability to administer the medication, but no action was taken beyond trying to feed a different type of fish on 12/26.
There is no record that a veterinarian observed the animal during the 11 days he was sick. No physical examination
or diagnostic tests were ever performed to determine a cause for the illness or provide an appropriate treatment. Anecropsy was performed and the report stated that the animal died of severe, chronic pneumonia.
Animals with health concerns should receive prompt veterinary care that is appropriate for their circumstances. In
this case, while treatment was attempted, the animal ultimately did not receive any treatment. Appropriate treatment
in this case may have prevented the death of the sea lion. The facility should ensure that prompt and appropriate
veterinary care is provided for the remaining animals.
Correct immediately for any future animal health concerns.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
