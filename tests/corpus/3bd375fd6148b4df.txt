2.32(b) Critical

Personnel qualifications.
In July 2019, during work on a protocol involving GI stents, the principal investigator (PI) used a stent from a different
manufacturer than listed on the IACUC approved protocol. This stent was implanted in two pigs, one of which developed
signs of adverse effects and received appropriate veterinary care but did not respond to treatment and was humanely
euthanized. The second pig developed some adverse effects two days after the procedure and responded to veterinary
treatment. The PI must receive written notification of approval from the IACUC before modifications in procedures may be
implemented. The facility must provide continued training and instruction to personnel involved in animal use with
sufficient frequency to fulfill the requirements of AWA 2.31.
This item has been corrected and addressed by the IACUC by multiple measures, to include retraining the involved
research staff.
3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
In September 2019, a woodchuck was found on the floor by animal care staff due to its enclosure failing to contain it.
Although the animal was provided veterinary care, it died from the incident. While the facility already had routine
maintenance checks in place to ensure proper functioning of the enclosure mechanics, the door may not have been


adequately latched and since this incident, the IACUC has implemented additional security measures to ensure that
enclosure doors will remain closed despite animal movement or laxity in the latching mechanism. Housing facilities must
be structurally sound to contain and protect the animals from injury.
At the time of inspection corrective actions and preventative measures had been implemented and an incident of this type
has not recurred.

This inspection was conducted from 09/10/2020 to 09/14/2020.

This inspection was conducted by the inspector and exit interview was conducted with Supervisory Animal Care Specialist
Tonya Hadjis and facility representatives.
