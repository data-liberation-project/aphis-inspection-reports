fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of
excreta, dirt and grime and must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary
enclosures are kept clean to prevent an accumulation of dirt and grime and that enclosures are sanitized at least
once every 2 weeks.
