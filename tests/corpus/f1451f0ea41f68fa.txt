ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two dogs had veterinary care issues that were not observed prior to inspection. A female black and white
Japanese Chin (#13) had its right eye clouded over. In addition there was a crusty material surrounding the eye. A
brown and white female Cavalier mix (#28) had a tear on its lower left eyelid. There was also a clear discharge
surrounding the eye.
Not thoroughly observing all the animals on a daily basis does not ensure that veterinary care issues will be
immediately recognized and reported to the Attending Veterinarian. Thorough observations must be conducted on a
daily basis. Any health issues identified during daily observations should either be reported to the Attending
Veterinarian or the licensee must refer to the Program of Veterinary Care for any treatments written up and
approved by the Attending Veterinarian. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
