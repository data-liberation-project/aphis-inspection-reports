3.3(a)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The temperature inside of the sheltered building was recorded at 88.0 degrees Fahrenheit at 1:26pm, 86.0 degrees
Fahrenheit at 1:45pm. After inspecting the outdoor dogs the inspector and the licensee returned to the sheltered
building and the temperature was recorded at 89.4 degrees Fahrenheit at 2:14pm. Some of the dogs were
observed panting and the puppies were not huddled together which could indicate that the temperature inside of the
building is getting too hot. The temperature for the remainder of the day is forecasted to continue to be above 85
degrees until well into the evening hours.
Some of the dogs and puppies housed in this facility are a (flat-faced) brachiocephalic breed. Brachiocephalic dogs
have a higher risk of being negatively affected by the high temperatures. Puppies cannot thermoregulate their body
temperature efficiently and can overheat from the higher temperatures. The licensee does have an air conditioner
running in the building but it does not seem to be able to keep the temperatures down. The licensee must find an
additional way to cool the building down so that the dogs and puppies do not overheat. The licensee must ensure
that the temperature inside of the sheltered building does not rise above 85 degrees Fahrenheit for more than 4
consecutive hours.
