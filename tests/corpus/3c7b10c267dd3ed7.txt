Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The semi-annual reports to the IO dated 5/1/21 and 10/28/21 were reviewed. Both semi-annual reports did not contain all
of the required information as described in this Section. The two semi-annual reports were not signed by a majority of the
IACUC members, and they did not contain a specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each of the minor
deficiencies identified by the IACUC during the facility inspections. In addition, during the review of the semi-annual
reports and the minutes for the IACUC meetings when the semi-annual evaluations were conducted (4/28/21 and
10/22/21), it was noted that there were discrepancies between the two sets of documents for the deficiencies identified
during the facility inspections.

Per this Section, one of the functions of the IACUC is to prepare semi-annual reports to the Institutional Official following
the Committee’s review of the program of animal use and the animal facilities. The report shall be reviewed and signed
by a majority of the IACUC members and must contain a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for
correcting each deficiency. The content of these reports should describe the nature and extent of the research facility’s
adherence with the AWA Regulations for the Program and animal facilities to provide the Institutional Official with
accurate information on the status of all aspects of the research facility. Correct from this date 5/13/22 forward.


2.31(d)(1)(iv)(A)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Review of Protocol 22-01: The protocol includes major operative procedures on sheep. The dose and frequency of
administration of the post-operative analgesic included in the protocol approved by the IACUC is not adequate to avoid or
minimize discomfort, distress, and pain in the animals. The post-operative dose for Buprenorphine in the IACUC
approved protocol was 0.18 mg once a day for 3 days.

Per this Section, the IACUC shall determine during the review of the proposed animal use activities or significant changes
to ongoing activities, that procedures that may cause more that momentary pain or distress to the animals will be
performed with appropriate sedatives, analgesics, or anesthetics unless withholding such agents is justified by the
principal investigator for scientific reasons. The IACUC needs to address this deficiency that was identified for this
protocol. Correct by 5/27/22.
3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs was incomplete and does not address the details required for the
preventative care and treatment for the dogs. There was no information about the preventative care and treatment to
ensure healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin, and teeth of the
dogs.

Per this Section, the written Program of Veterinary Care for dogs must address the requirements for adequate veterinary
care of the dogs and must include information regarding preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy and unmatted


hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin, and teeth, unless otherwise required by a
research protocol approved by the IACUC at research facilities. Correct by 6/12/22.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted 5/10/22 with facility representatives.
