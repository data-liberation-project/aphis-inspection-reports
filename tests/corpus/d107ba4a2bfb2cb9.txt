REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.
The facility, acting as an intermediate handler for air carriers at the Miami International Airport (MIA), was found to
be operating and transporting regulated animals without a valid USDA certificate/registration.
Each carrier and intermediate handler, and each exhibitor not required to be licensed under section 3 of the Animal
Welfare Act (AWA) and the regulations of this subchapter, must register with the Secretary of Agriculture by
completing and filing a properly executed registration form; registration form already provided by this inspector.
The registration form must be filed with the USDA-APHIS-AC Regional Director for the State in which the registrant
has his or her principal place of business, and should be updated every 3 years by the completion and filing of a
new registration form which will be provided by the AC Regional Director.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL AN USDA REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE IS
ISSUED.
