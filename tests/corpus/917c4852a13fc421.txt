3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two holes of sufficient width and depth to cause potential injury to an animal were observed in the ground of the
mule deer enclosure.
Holes in the ground of hoof stock enclosures have the potential of causing catastrophic injuries when a hoof
inadvertently falls into the hole while the animal is moving. The surfaces of enclosures should be routinely
monitored for defects and repairs should be made in a timely manner.

3.131(d)SANITATION.
Rodent droppings were observed on the floor of a hoof stock feed room.
Rodents may carry diseases that are transmissible to other animals and their presence in food supplies may
adversely affect the palatability and quality of food. A safe and effective program for the control of pests should be
established and maintained to prevent infestations.
