The licensee stated that he shot and killed Squirrely the adult, gray, female Japanese Chin-poodle cross with a
9mm handgun. The dog was shot by the licensee between approximately 1:30 pm-8:00 pm on May 12, 2015. The
licensee stated his girlfriend held the dog on the ground while he shot the dog one time in the back of the head. The
licensee stated a dirt hole was dug in a field that is adjacent to the west side of the property. The licensee also
stated the deceased dog was placed in the hole and covered with dirt. The licensee did not have the dog examined
by a veterinarian prior to shooting it.
Gunshot is not an appropriate humane method of routine euthanasia for dogs according to the AVMA Guidelines on
Euthanasia. Inappropriate methods of euthanasia can result in distress and or pain to the animal and can be a
safety hazard. The licensee must follow his Attending Veterinarians instructions in the Program of Veterinary Care
regarding euthanasia, and the licensee must ensure all methods of euthanasia are appropriate and consistent with
the provision of adequate veterinary care.
To be corrected this day forward.
