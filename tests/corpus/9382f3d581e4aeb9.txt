2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
While reviewing the Program of Veterinary Care form it was noted that the newly acquired animals were not
documented. This facility has recently acquired Patagonia cavies, patas monkeys, kangaroos, sheep, goats, vervet
monkeys, binturong, zebra, and a coatimundi. To ensure that the attending vet is aware of what species are on the
premise and they have the knowledge to treat these animals, this form will need to be updated.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
While conducting this inspection we noticed the capuchin, across from the "Tiki Bar", had access to the asphalt, roof
shingles of his enclosure. He was picking at the edges and breaking off pieces. To ensure that he does not ingest
any pieces or get injured on rough edges, this roof line will need to be addressed.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Since the last inspection this facility has acquired patas monkeys, another capuchin, and vervet monkeys. However,
the Primate Enrichment plan has not been updated to reflect these new additions. All primates need to be
documented on the Enrichment plan to ensure that they are provided appropriate enrichment. This plan will need to
be amended, reviewed by the attending vet, and signed by the attending vet.

FACILITIES, GENERAL. This facility has recently decided to create a food storage room. At the time of the inspection containers of grain
were in this room. However, the wallboard has not been completely finished. Insulation was exposed, the ceiling on
the right side had exposed rafters and boxes of supplies, and there were a variety of power tools present. The
house cats also have access to the cat litter box in that room. This litter box had an accumulation of feces present.
This entire room needs to be cleaned and the construction needs to be completed to ensure that the food supplies
are protected from contamination and deterioration.

SANITATION.
This facility has recently acquired 4 goats and 14 sheep. A new enclosure was constructed for these animals.
However, they now have access to large fiberglass tubes / culverts, portable enclosures, and building materials. To
ensure that they do not injure themselves on these items, the area will need to be addressed.
