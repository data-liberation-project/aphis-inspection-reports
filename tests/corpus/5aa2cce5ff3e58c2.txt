3.101(a)(1)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The concrete (pebble rock) pool edge at one of the six Dolphin Harbor pools was observed damaged and with sharp
point/edges. These sharp points/edges are an injury hazard to any dolphin that is housed at that pool. Indoor and
outdoor facilities for marine mammals must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury. To prevent injury to regulated animals, the establishment should repair and/or replace the
damaged pool edge as soon as possible.
