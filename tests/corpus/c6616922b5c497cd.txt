3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
One shelter structure in an outdoor enclosure is without a wind and rain break. Failure to provide a barrier from the
elements can result in a dog that becomes wet and uncomfortable. In some weather, a dog that does not have a
barrier from the elements is unable to maintain a safe body temperature. All dogs must be provided with shelter
from the elements which includes wind and rain breaks at the entrance to shelter structures in outdoor enclosures.

kept clean and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 b of this subpart. To be corrected by 9 Nov 2015.
