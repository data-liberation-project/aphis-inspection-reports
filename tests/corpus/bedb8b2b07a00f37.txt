Facilities, general.
The metal trim, around the entrance door of the shelter portion of a rabbit hutch, is broken with sharp edges present.
These sharp edges could harm the rabbit upon entering or exiting the shelter portion of the hutch. This damaged trim
leaves the hutch in disrepair and serves as a means to cause injury to the rabbit housed therein. Housing facilities shall
be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

Facilities, general.
The fencing around the goats and sheep is composed of wooden planks and chainlink on the front and sides but only
chainlink on the back. The chainlink has been detached from the wooden fence in the right, rear corner. Also, the rear
chainlink fence fabric is no longer attached to the fence posts. The fence fabric has been stepped on by the goats thus
lowering it half way down towards the ground. These damaged areas leave the fence in disrepair and it no longer fully
contains the animals. Damaged fencing should be repaired in order to maintain structual strength and to fully contain the
animals housed therein.
