The facility was no longer at the approved site address at the time of this inspection. APHIS Officials were informed
by a new resident that the licensee had moved to a new location. APHIS Officials were able to locate the licensee
at a new site, at which time the licensee confirmed that he was nearly moved to the new facility, but had not yet
informed Animal Care. The licensee must notify the Animal Care Regional Director in writing by certified mail of any
change in sites within 10 days of such change. Notification of changes in sites are necessary to facilitate timely
inspection and approval of the new site in order to ensure that animals are provided with appropriate care as
required by the Animal Welfare Act. Correct by promptly notifying the Regional Director of this change in site.
