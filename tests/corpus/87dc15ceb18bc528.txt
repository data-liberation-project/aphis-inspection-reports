** The male patas monkey is having some kind of moisture issues and there is an active leak. It is damp and there
is still some areas of wood above the entrance that are exhibiting signs of moisture. There is a slight smell of mildew
and there are insects that favor moist and damp conditions present in the night house. There is a leak coming from
an unknown source that needs to be addressed to alleviate the moisture and dampness. There was a fan put in
place to move the moisture but could not operate properly due to unreliable electricity. The male patas monkey's
night house does have some patch work but there may be another issue contributing to the moisture issue. The
facility must be repaired or replaced, and maintained to ensure that the building is structurally sound and kept in
good repair.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** While inspecting the 4 patas monkeys enclosure it was cold so we turned the space heater temperature up. We
then moved to the male patas monkeys enclosure where we turned the lamp and fan on. A few seconds later the
electricity went out. Also there were fans in the enclosure that could not operate at the same time. There were too
many hook ups to the electricity and it tripped the breaker. It was cold that day and the low was below 45 degrees F.
The housing facility must have reliable electric power adequate for heating, ventilation, and lighting, and for carrying
out other husbandry requirements. Correct immediately to provide adequate heat to the animals before night fall
when the temperature is below 45 degrees F.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
** In the one female ring-tailed lemur's night house there was rat feces on top of the blanket and bedding. Beneath
the night house in a chamber holding the heating lamp and the bait box there was an abundance of ants. Insects
and rodents can be a disease hazard and could contaminate the bedding. The facility must establish an effective
pest control program to control insects and rodents to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce
contamination.3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** The perimeter fence has several deficiencies along the west side that could potentially allow unwanted animals
access to the park. These areas of the fence were fixed by using horse panels to bridge the gaps between the old
fencing and the ground. The horse panels' openings are large enough to allow a small mammal to gain access to
the premises. These small animals could potentially carry and spread disease to the facilities animals. These areas
of deficiencies should be thoroughly checked and repaired to ensure good health and the well-being of the animals.
This was a focused inspection of the items cited on the previous inspection report.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the Conservation Program Coordinator.
