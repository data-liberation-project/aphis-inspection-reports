2.75(a)(2)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
According to the licensee, no 7006 forms had been kept for animals that were sold in April and May of 2021. Likewise,
according to the licensee, approximately half of the facility’s dogs were sold or otherwise transferred elsewhere from
January through May of 2021, but nearly all of the 7006 forms reflective of those dispositions were missing. A 7005 form
was provided, but it had not been updated to reflect the dispositions of most of the dogs that were transferred elsewhere.

The lack of records does not allow for accurate tracing of animals. Accurate animal records regarding disposition are used
to help evaluate the facility's animal care program and for animal tracking for ownership and health care concerns.

Each dealer shall use Record of Acquisition and Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS Form 7005) and Record of Disposition
of Dogs and Cats (APHIS Form 7006) to make, keep, and maintain required information concerning each dog.

Housing facilities, general.


An open supply of bedding, which was currently being used within the facility, did not have a lid covering it.

Open containers of bedding can be spoiled, contaminated, and/or infested with vermin, creating potentially hazardous
situations for dogs.

Supplies of bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and vermin
infestation. All open supplies of bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent
contamination and spoilage.

3.11(c) Critical

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
During the inspection, various accumulations of clutter were observed throughout the fenced-in yard that is used for the
dogs' exercise. According to the licensee, on April 14, 2021, an approximately 1.5-year-old female intact Goldendoodle,
“Goldie,” found and ingested a sock from the fenced-in yard, which then necessitated emergency treatment by a
veterinarian. No signs of injury or illness were observed with “Goldie” at the time of the inspection.

Serious injuries can occur when dogs have access to injurious and/or hazardous materials that have accumulated at
animal housing facilities, including the surrounding grounds.

Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in
good repair to protect the animals from injury. Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste products,


and discarded matter.
