The licensee was unable to find disposition/acquisition records for 13 sheep,3 goats, and 2 pigs. It is important to
maintain acquisition/disposition records for all animals to assess the welfare of the animals. The licensee shall have

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee stated that an itinerary had been submitted to the Eastern Animal Care office however an itinerary was
not located.The licensee was unable to provide a copy of the itinerary to the inspector at the time of the inspection.
It is important that an itinerary be submitted in order for inspectors to conduct traveling inspections. The Animal
Welfare Act states: Any person who is subject to the Animal Welfare regulations and who intends to exhibit any
animal at any location other than the person's approved site (including, but not limited to, circuses, traveling
educational exhibits, animal acts, and petting zoos), except for travel that does not extend overnight, shall submit a
written itinerary to the AC Regional Director. The itinerary shall be received by the AC Regional Director no fewer
than 2 days in advance of any travel and shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the
whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. If the
exhibitor accepts an engagement for which travel will begin with less than 48 hours notice, the exhibitor shall
immediately contact the AC Regional Director in writing with the required information. APHIS expects such
situations to occur infrequently, and exhibitors who repeatedly provide less than 48 hours notice will, after notice by
APHIS, be subject to increased scrutiny under the Act.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The nonhuman primate plastic dens that house several primates are dirty and dusty. Clean all hard surfaces that
nonhuman primates come in contact with in order to prevent disease. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be
cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. Correct by

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The rhesus macaque, pig-tailed macaque and three lemurs had only a few wood branches in their enclosures for
enrichment. The brown capuchin had a few wood branches with a few plastic water bottles on the floor. The pig-
tailed macaque has a swing in the primates primary enclosure. The animal handler stated that the toys are in the
process of being washed and unavailable at the time of the inspection. All the primate enclosures had white plastic
feeding tubes that are used for foraging. When care takers were asked what types of enrichment the primates are
receiving the answer was "they play." The inspector noted that four of the primates are singularly housed. It is
important for the well being of the nonhuman primates to follow the recommendations from the Attending
Veterinarian to allow primates to forage for food, manipulate toys, and have swings.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The brown Capuchin primary enclosure had a pile of brown feces in the left hand corner of the enclosure close to
the chain link fencing. It is important to make sure all feces are cleaned up daily in order to prevent accumulation of
excreta or disease hazards. Excreta and food waste must be removed from inside each indoor primary enclosure
daily and from underneath them as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food
waste, to prevent the nonhuman primates from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and
odors. Correct by December 6,2016.

animals in order to prevent injury.
