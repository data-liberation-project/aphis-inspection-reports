2.31(b)(3)(i)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The current voting membership of the IACUC does not include an attending veterinarian. The facility’s attending
veterinarian has been a non-voting member of the IACUC since June 2020.
A veterinarian with responsibility for animal activities at the facility is one of three mandatory members of the IACUC, and
their active participation is vital to ensuring the proper care and treatment of animals. If a mandatory position is unfilled,
the IACUC is not properly constituted and cannot perform required functions.
All required IACUC positions must be filled prior to conducting any future IACUC activity.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
