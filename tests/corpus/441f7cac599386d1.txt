PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
The Licensee purchased 4 puppies on 5/31/16, purchased 5 puppies on 6/7/16, 3 puppies on 6/9/16 and 6 puppies
on 7/18/16 from different breeders that was not USDA Licensed. On all four purchases, the Licensee did not obtain
a certification that the animals were born and raised on that breeders premise. In addition, he did not obtain a
certification that each of the breeders maintained less than four breeding females. Without obtaining a certification
from each breeder at the time of sale, there is no verification being made by the dealer to ensure these facilities do
not require a USDA License to sell the puppies.
No dealer shall knowingly obtain any dog from any person who is not licensed without obtaining a certification that
the animals were born and raised on that persons premises, that person has not maintained more than four
breeding female dogs.
Correct: From this day forward

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On today's inspection there were multiple enclosures throughout the facility that had too many dogs in the areas
provided as primary enclosure. One enclosure in particular held a Male Dalmatian "Patch" 16-2346 and two other
Dalmatians of the same size. Patch was 22" from nose to tail and his two littermates were of the same or very
similar size. Their enclosure measured 24"x36" or 6 square feet. (cid:28)Patch(cid:29) needs 5.3 square feet of floor-space. With
all three puppies in this enclosure, the appropriate floor-space would be 16 square feet. Within the facility at least 25
of the 37 enclosures were overfilled and the enclosures did not meet the minimum floor-space requirements. During
discussion with the licensee there have been medical issues in the recent past that may have been compounded by
housing animals in below the minimum space requirements. All enclosure must be constructed in a manner that
allows each animal to have normal mannerisms and posture. The Licensee must ensure that all enclosures are
large enough for the size of the animal that it will contain.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On today's inspection there were two enclosure that each contained a total of four Dalmatian puppies (Puppy
#16-2350, #16-2343, 16-2349 and 16-2345). Each of these enclosures measured 24x36x18". These puppies did
not have 6" above their heads when they were sitting or standing fully erect. All enclosure must be constructed in a
manner that allows each animal to have normal mannerisms and posture. This includes allowing each animal to
have at least 6" above its head while in its primary enclosure. The Licensee must ensure that all enclosures are
large enough for the size of the animal that it will contain. The Licensee must ensure that all dogs are placed in
primary enclosures that allow the animal to have 6" above its head while sitting and standing fully erect.
