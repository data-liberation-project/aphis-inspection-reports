is approximately 6.7 square ft. The floor space of the enclosure is 16 square feet and does not meet USDA
minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosure.
Enclosure J contains 6 spaniels with one measuring 23”. The minimum floor space required for one dog of this size
is approximately 5.8 square ft. The floor space of the enclosure is 16 square feet and does not meet USDA
minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosure.
Whelping Building – East Room
There are 4 enclosures (5,6,8,9) along the east wall with floor space measurements of approximately 48” x 80”
(26.7 square ft).
Enclosure 5 contains 4 spaniels of approximate same size, with one measuring 27” from tail base to nose. The
minimum floor space required for one dog of this size is approximately 7.6 square ft. The floor space of the
enclosure does not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in
the enclosure.
Enclosures 6 and 8 each contain 4 spaniels of approximate same size as the one measured from enclosure 5. The
minimum floor space required for one dog of this size is approximately 7.6 square ft. The floor spaces of these
enclosures do not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in
the enclosures.
Enclosure 9 contains 4 spaniels of approximate same size with one measuring 27” from tail base to nose. The
minimum floor space required for one dog of this size is approximately 8 square ft. The floor space of the enclosure
does not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the
enclosure.
Nursery Building -
Nursery Building Room 1 – There are 6 open top enclosures located on the north wall containing a total of 27 dogs
at the time of inspection. Twelve of the dogs are spaniels and appear to be of the same age and size. The open top
enclosures allow dogs to freely jump from enclosure to enclosure and this was observed multiple times during the
inspection. The enclosures measure approximately 36” x 36” in floor length and width. The calculated floor space
for these enclosures is approximately 9 square feet. One of the spaniels from the first kennel on the NW side
measured approx. 28” from nose tip to base of tail. A dog this size requires approximately 8 square feet of floor
space to meet USDA requirements. The floor space of these enclosures do not meet USDA minimum space
requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosures. Additionally, three 24” x 36” wire
enclosures located in the southeast corner of the room were observed to be overcapacity.
Nursery Building Room 2 - There are 5 open top enclosures located on the north wall containing a total of 28 dogs
at the time of inspection. These enclosures measure approximately 36” x 48” in floor length and width. The
calculated floor space for these enclosures is approximately 12 square feet each. The open top enclosures in room
2 also allow dogs to freely jump from enclosure to enclosure and this was observed multiple times during the
inspection. Twelve of the dogs observed in the enclosures were spaniels of approximate age and size as the
spaniel measured in Room 1. A dog this size requires approximately 8 square feet of floor space to meet USDArequirements. The floor space of these enclosures do not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number
and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosures.
Nursery Building Room 4 (South Room) – Along the south wall of the room there are four enclosures with floor
space of each enclosure measuring approximately 36” x 60”. Each enclosure currently houses 3 adult spaniels.
One of the enclosures also contains a Scottish Terrier. Additionally, there is one enclosure located in the southeast
corner with floor space of approximately 36” x 96” that contains 4 adult spaniels. The floor space of these five
enclosures do not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in
the enclosures. Additionally, there are two enclosures located along the north wall of the room that also appear
overcapacity.
Nursery Building – Northeast Room - There are three stacked wire enclosures along the north side of the room that
each have a floor space measuring 24” x 24” (4 square ft). The top enclosure contains two Scottish Terrier puppies
and the middle enclosure contains four Scottish Terrier puppies. Tail base to nose measurement of one of the
puppies is 19”. Each puppy this size requires a minimum floor space of 2.5 square feet to meet current USDA
requirements. The floor space of the enclosures do not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number
and size of dogs currently housed in the enclosures.
Nursery Building – Northeast Room - There are six enclosures located on the top row of banked enclosures on the
west wall of the room. The top left enclosure floor space measures 24” x 24” (4 square ft) and contains three
puppies. One puppy measures 20” from nose to tail base and requires approximately 4.7 square of space to meet
USDA requirements. The enclosure immediately to the right measures 24” x 24” and contains four puppies. One
of the puppies measures 18”. A puppy this size requires 4 square ft of floor space to meet USDA requirements. The
top right enclosure floor space measures 24” x 24” and contains 5 puppies. The floor space of the three enclosures
do not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs currently housed in the
enclosures.
Inadequate enclosure space can cause undue stress to dogs occupying the enclosures. Overcrowding may lead to
fighting, increased competition for food, inadequate food intake, inability to make normal postural adjustments, and
increased susceptibility to disease and disease spread. Each dog housed in a primary enclosure (including weaned
puppies) must be provided a minimum amount of floor space, calculated as follows: Find the mathematical square
of the sum of the length of the dog in inches (measured from the tip of the nose to base of tail, plus six inches) then
divide the product by 144. This is the required floor space per dog in square feet.
The facility needs to formulate a corrective action plan and schedule for reducing stocking density in all enclosures
that do not meet USDA minimum space requirements for the number and size of dogs being housed. The plan and
schedule should be submitted to the USDA no later than 7 days from the date of receipt of this report.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Six plastic water receptacles (1 - west whelping building, 4 - west barn building, 1 - nursery building) in active usewere found to have an accumulation of dirt/grime/debris on their exterior. Exterior surfaces were also roughened
with debris/grime deposits accumulating in the roughened areas.
Accumulations of dirt and grime on water receptacles make them more difficult to adequately clean and sanitize.
Water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent
accumulation of dirt, debris. food, waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
Correct this date forward.
