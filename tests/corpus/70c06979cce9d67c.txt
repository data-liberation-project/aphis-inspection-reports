ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A young Boston puppy, in an enclosure with 2 of its litter mates, was observed with a yellowish discharge from both
eyes and the tissue around and in the inner corner of the eyes was reddened. It was also noted that this puppy also
had several small puncture like wounds on its muzzle and ears. The licensee was not aware of this puppies
condition until it was pointed out to him by the inspectors. The licensee must have this puppy examined by a
veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.
In the outdoor enclosures there are 11 Labrador Retrievers with varying degrees of open wounds, from
approximately 1/4 to 2 inches in diameter and generally located on the back side of the ear flaps. 1 male #5863 and
8 females #1522, 5607, 7116, 5535, 1901, 0011, 6B6C, 2223, and 2 females with no IDs found. The licensee was
treating these dogs with a medicated spray which included written instructions to apply it every 48 hrs. When
questioned by the inspectors as to when the dogs were last treated the care taker stated it was "Last Friday", which
would be closer to 72 hrs since treatment was given to these dogs. The licensee must follow the labeled instructions
on the medications at all times to ensure it works as intended.
Inside of a medicine cabinet there were 2 unlabeled bottles of medicine, When questioned the licensee said that
the blue liquid was "Ivermect" and the other yellow liquid was "Albon".
An expired bottle of Pyrantel (05-14) was found intermingled with the other medications in the cabinet and therefore
ready for use.
Expired medications may be contaminated, may not work as expected, and could harm the animals. Proper
information and dosage is essential information so the animals are not undermedicated or overmedicated. All
medications used on the animals must not be expired and all bottles need to have the proper labels as to what the
product is and the expiration date on the bottle in order to protect the health of the animals. Licensee must ensure
that all medications maintained for and used on the animals are properly labeled and not expired at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning
The sheltered building, along most of the underside of the north run of enclosures on the outside, effectingapproximately 57 dogs and 24 puppies there is a buildup of hair, feces, and grime. Approximately 6 divider walls on
the inside area of the sheltered enclosures had a buildup of a brownish grime covering about 30% - 50% of the wall.
The accumulation of the dirt and grime can cause diseases and attract pests. Cleanliness is important to the health
and well-being of the animals. The build-up of dirt and grime on these surfaces does not allow for sanitization to
occur. The licensee must clean and sanitize these surfaces, develop and maintain a program that ensures all hard
surfaces with which the dogs come into contact with are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two
weeks or more often if necessary, and all other surfaces within the housing facility are cleaned and sanitized when
necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In 3 enclosures, affecting 14 puppies, there is not an at least 6 inches of space above the tops of their heads. This
additional space is required so that the dogs/puppies can perform normal postural movement within their
enclosures. The licensee must provide these puppies, and ensure that all dogs/puppies, are provided with and an
enclosure that gives them at least 6 inches of space above the tops of their heads at all times.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Space
There are two Boston Terriers housed in an enclosure that does not provide them with enough floor space. The
enclosure was measured at 30.5 inches x 30 inches which gives these dogs 6.35 sq. ft. of available floor space.
Both dogs were measured to be approximately 16 inches in length. The minimum required floor space for these
dogs is (16+6)(16+6)/144 x 2 = 6.72 sq. ft. Adequate floor space is required in order to ensure that the animals can
make normal postural adjustments and for their health and well-being. The licensee must provided these dogs with
an enclosure with adequate space and ensure that each animal is provided with adequate floor space for the health
and well-being of the animals. Licensee must ensure that all animals are provided with adequate floor space at all
times.
3.9(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
Food
Within sheltered building and outdoor facility, at least three self-feeders affecting 4 dogs contained food which wascontaminated. The contaminated food in each of these self-feeders was located where the dogs had access the
food. These feeders contained food that had a grayish-white, mold-like material, some of the contaminated food
was caked. The outdoor self-feeder also had bird droppings in the opening where the dog eats. The dogs in these
enclosures could not eat the food without eating the contaminated food. Contaminated food can decrease the dog's
acceptance of the food and can increase the risk of disease and health hazards. The licensee needs to remove the
current caked, moldy and contaminated feed to protect the health and well-being of the dogs. The licensee needs
to establish and maintain a program to ensure that food is protected from contamination and that measures are
taken to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration and caking of feed at all times.

FEEDING.
Feeders.
Throughout the facility approximately 19 self-feeders affecting 38 puppies and 32 dogs had an accumulation a
brown or black dirt and grime inside them. The dirt and grime was mostly covering the bottom half of on the inside
walls of the feeders and build-up on the metal ledge inside the feeders. In eight of these self-feeder the licensee
adds powdered milk which collected on the dirt and grime. When opening the lids on the feeders with the powdered
milk, many flies where present inside. This dirt and grime comes in contact with the dogs’ food, which can
contaminate the food and harm the dogs. The licensee must ensure self-feeders are cleaned and sanitized at least
once every two weeks or more often if necessary.

3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an accumulation of fecal material caught in between the two different types of flooring inside of the
sheltered enclosures affecting 8 dogs. Some of this fecal material had a dried appearance to it indicating that it was
not fresh. Fecal material must be removed at least once daily or more often if necessary to prevent the dogs from
becoming soiled and to reduce disease hazards. There is an accumulation of fecal material underneath the outdoor
section of the sheltered enclosures affecting 50 adult dogs and 31 puppies. There is a distinct odor and many flying
insects present. The licensee must clean the fecal material from the enclosures, and remove the fecal material from
under the outside sections of the sheltered enclosures.The licensee must ensure that fecal material is removed
daily from the primary enclosure, or more often if necessary, and from under the primary enclosures as often as
necessary to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. 3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Premises.
Around the sheltered building, there were tall weeds (approximately 2-4 feet tall) growing all along the outside
portion of the enclosures and on the west side. There was also clutter (Wood piles, metal and plastic barrels, and
metal piles) accumulated in this same area. Tall weeds, grass, bushes and clutter can harbor insects, pests, and
vermin. The insects, pests and vermin can bite and irritate the dogs, contaminate the environment, food and water,
and increase the risk of potential disease to the dogs. The licensee must remove the clutter and weeds and
maintain them to prevent or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest Control.
The outdoor building had a heavy coating of what appeared to be bird droppings on the enclosure divider walls,
affecting 36 dogs and 20 puppies. The dogs' self-feeders where directly below the area with the bird droppings, and
self-feeders had bird droppings on them. Birds and bird droppings can transmit diseases and parasites to the dogs.
The licensee must establish and maintain a safe and effective pest control program to protect the health of the dogs
and puppies.
