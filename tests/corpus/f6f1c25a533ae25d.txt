2.8(h)
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
The licensee moved on May 30, 2016 without notifying the Regional Office of a change in address; therefore, an
inspection could not be performed. Notification of a change in address to the Regional Office within 10 days of the
change is necessary so that inspections of the animals can be conducted. The licensee must notify the Regional
Office with his new address as soon as possible.
