wire had been mangled and sharp points were protruding inward. Sharp points can cause injury to the animals
within the enclosure. The chicken wire needs to be fixed and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury. Correct by 9/22/16.

contaminated with various types of parasites which could cause illness or disease for the goats. All watering
receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary. Correct immediately.
