2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee did not have acquisition records for the pigs purchased this year. She stated that the records were being
held by her accountant and would not be available for the inspection.
It's important to maintain records, which fully and correctly disclose the acquisition information for all animals purchased,
in order to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities and to ensure their humane care.
The licensee must maintain records which include the required acquisition information and have them available for review
during inspection.

Contingency planning.
The facility does not have a documented contingency plan.
If an emergency or natural disaster were to occur at the facility, the lack of a written contingency plan could impact animal
health if the licensee is not prepared to respond to the situation appropriately.
Dealers must develop, document, and follow an appropriate contingency plan to provide for the humane handling,


treatment, transportation, housing, and care of their animals in the the event of an emergency or disaster.
