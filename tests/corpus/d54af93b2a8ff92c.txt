Facilities, general.
An adult female two-toed sloth was being housed in an indoor enclosure with sheetrock walls that have peeling rubber
trim along the floor with a piece of 2x4 wood in front of the trim. Sheetrock is not an appropriate material for animal
enclosures. Sheetrock can be easily scratched and gouged by an animal and cannot be adequately cleaned and
disinfected. In this case the sheetrock was scratched in spots and the area behind the pealing rubber trim is stained and
dirty and cannot be adequately cleaned.

The off-exhibit area for the small-clawed otter has a rotting wall and a piece of plywood being used as a door with an area
of whitish staining along the bottom that appears to be mold. The door area on the exhibit side has exposed insulation
and a gap between the piece of plywood being used as a door and the cinder block wall. This gap is large enough for the
otter to stick his front legs through the gap in front of the cinderblocks. The rotting wall cannot be adequately cleaned and
exposes the otter to possibly harmful materials behind the wall. The plywood door cannot be adequately cleaned as
indicated by the mold along the bottom. The exposed insulation has the potential to cause the otter harm if ingested .
Additionally, the 1-inch gap between the plywood door and the cinderblocks is large enough to allow the animal to slide an
arm or leg between the space which has the potential to cause the otter harm.



Facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals and the facilities shall
be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The sloth enclosure needs to be constructed of materials appropriate for housing animals or the sloth needs to be moved
to a more adequate enclosure. The otter holding area and door needs to be repaired so that it can be adequately cleaned
and is safe for the otter or the otter needs to be moved to an enclosure that is structurally sound and can be adequately
cleaned.

Sanitation.
The front wall of the Bengal cat enclosure consists of a sheet of plexiglass and 1x1 inch coated wire separated by about
six inches. The coated wire is on the inside of the enclosure. The area between the plexiglass and the wire has a large
accumulation of dirt and other debris. Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from
injury and disease and to facilitate adequate husbandry practices. The area needs to be cleaned or the cats need to be
moved to an area that can be cleaned.

Handling of animals.
Over the past two months the facility has had two incidents where an animal has bitten a guest. On Dec 2, 2020 a child
was bitten by an adult capybara when the child was able to reach over the side of the capybara enclosure. According to
the facility employees the bite wound was on the palm of the child’s hand and caused bleeding.



During public exhibition animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of injury to the animals and the public, with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the public so as to assure the safety of animals and public. A
method to protect the animals and the public from injury and to prevent unsupervised access to the animals must be
implemented.
2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
On Jan 20, 2021 an adult visitor was bitten by an adult sloth during an “animal encounter”. According to facility
employees, while the attendant’s back was turned to monitor a different sloth in the enclosure, the adult disobeyed
instructions and attempted to pet the sloth on the head and was bitten.

Currently there are 2 adult Kune Kune pigs and a rabbit behind a two-foot tall fence with no barriers separating the
animals from the public. The Kune Kune and the rabbit are not continuously monitored by an employee.

During public contact a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all
times. The facility needs to have enough attendants to adequately monitor all visitors that have contact with the animals
at all times.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Acquisition and disposition records from the June 19, 2019 inspection through this inspection were requested and
reviewed. Several records appeared to be missing.



On June 19, 2019 the facility had 5 Asian Small Clawed otters. At the time of this inspection the facility had 1 Asian Small
Clawed otter. Acquisition records indicated 3 otters were acquired on Nov 8, 2019. Disposition records for otters from
June 19, 2019 through this inspection indicate 7 otters have been transferred to other facilities and 1 otter died. This
information indicates there should be no otters currently at the facility.

On June 19, 2019 the facility had 1 capybara. Acquisition records showed the facility acquired 4 capybara between June
19, 2019 and this inspection but only had disposition records for 2 of these capybara. According to acquisition and
disposition records there should have been 3 capybara at the facility for this inspection. There was only 1 capybara
present during this inspection.

information concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or

Records containing all of the above information must be available for review by USDA personnel at the time of inspection.
This information is required so that USDA can accurately monitor animal movements.
