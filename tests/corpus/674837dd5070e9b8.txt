Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult female French Bulldog named Mercedes (m/c 941000022874920) was shaking its head. Both ears had a rough,
crusty, thickened appearance with a leathery feel. The inside of the left ear appeared swollen and reddened. The
licensee said that the ears had been this way ever since she purchased the dog about a year ago. The dog was not
examined by a veterinarian until August 11, 2021 during the annual Attending Veterinarian's visit to the kennel. The
veterinarian's record stated that the dog had bilateral chronic otitis and that the right ear had scar tissue from a
hematoma. The veterinarian prescribed ear flush, topical otic medication, oral cephalexin, and ketoconazole. The
licensee stated that she gave these treatments, but the ears did not seem to improve. However, she did not follow up
with the veterinarian for further examination or treatment. Delayed examination and treatment can result in worsening of
medical problems and pain. Unresolved medical problems following treatment can result in continued pain and possible
worsening of the condition. The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis, must follow
the veterinarian's treatment plan, must maintain a medical record, and must follow-up with the veterinarian if the problem
does not resolve in a timely manner.

TO BE COMPLETED BY APRIL 15, 2022.


2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
***The licensee was not able to produce a Record of Acquisition (APHIS Form 7005) for the dogs on hand. Properly
completed acquisition records are necessary for identification of dogs to facilitate record-keeping requirements for
inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare. The licensee must record acquisition and identification information for all
dogs on hand on Form 7005 and must be able to produce these records upon request by the Inspector.

***Three Records of Disposition (APHIS Form 7006) with a total of 28 dogs did not have any information regarding the
buyer or receiver of the dogs. Also, a Form 7006 for 4 dogs sold did not have any information regarding the method of
transportation or the name of the carrier. Properly completed disposition records are necessary to facilitate record-
keeping requirements for disposition, transport, and tracing of the dogs. The licensee must complete the proper records
for disposition of adult dogs and puppies.

TO BE CORRECTED BY APRIL 20, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
