FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor rabbit enclosures lacked a thermometer in the area.
A thermometer is necessary to monitor the temperature around the rabbits.
The facility must have a thermometer in place in this area to ensure a sprinkler system or other means of artificial
cooling will be used when the temperature reaches 90 degrees.
To be corrected by September 29, 2014.
Exit interview conducted with a facility representative.
