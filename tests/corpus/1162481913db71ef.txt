ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1630 on
08/05/2014.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the front door. I also called the contact number available to me. The
licensee answered and stated that she was out of state on a family vacation and would not be available to conduct
an inspection.
End of report.
