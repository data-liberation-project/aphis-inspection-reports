3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
In building #2 one enclosure had a whelping box that contained a carpet surface. The edges of the carpet were frayed
and had long threads. This could allow the dog and puppies to become caught up and tangled and possibly become
injured. In addition, the dogs can chew and ingest carpet material. Any carpet material that dogs may come in contact with
must be replaced as often as necessary in order to maintain it in good condition and keep it sanitary. The licensee must
address this issue.
