3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the shed located in the veterinary treatment there are three rabbits housed individually and temporarily in
suspended rabbit cages while there primary enclosure is under construction. The hanging cages are very rusty and
the surface of the wire is roughened and flaking. These cages cannot be adequately cleaned and pose a disease
and/or injury risk. rabbits.
In the rabbit pen toward the beginning of the walking trail there is a portion of buried chain-link fencing that was not
covered up. The loops of wire protrude from the ground in such a way as to pose a potential leg/foot entanglement
hazard for the three rabbits housed in the enclosure.
Primary enclosures for rabbits must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. Excessively rusted cages
must be repaired or replaced and all fencing and/or wiring must be maintained in a manner that does not pose an
injury hazard for the rabbits.To be corrected by: April 26, 2016
3.56(d)
SANITATION.
There is an excess of flies hovering just under the hanging rabbit cages in the shed of the veterinary area. Insects
may carry disease and contaminate food posing a health and welfare risks to the animals. An effective program for
the control of insects and pests must be established and maintained. To be completed by: April 15, 2016.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the bear enclosure one of the main upright metal posts has corrosion leaving holes in the lower portions of the
post which may compromise the structural strength of the caging.
In the coyote enclosure there are several deep burrows excavated near the edges of the primary enclosure fence.One of these burrows is angled in the direction of the enclosure fence. On the outside of the enclosure near the
access tunnel and in very close proximity to this burrow, there is a hole or depression in the ground that may have
occurred from the dirt collapsing or possibly another animal digging near the enclosure. These holes could create
an escape route for the coyote.
The goat pen housing the single goat next to the turkey pen has a small gap at the base of the chain link fencing
between the enclosures. There are sharp points on the wire. The enclosure containing 15 goats on the other side of
the singly housed goat has a large gap at the base of the fence along the back side. On the other side of the path
the dirt has eroded primarily at the back side of the enclosure housing about 14 goats creating large gaps between
the bottom of the fence and the ground. These gaps may allow an animal to get out of the enclosure, become
trapped, or allow other animals to enter.
There are sharp points of wire in areas the goats can access, such as at the front of the enclosure where there are
fence panels connected together with a piece of wire and an area on the left back portion of the fence where a
supplemental layer of fence was attached by a piece of wire. The wire used was cut and twisted leaving sharp
points pointing into the enclosure. These sharp points are an injury hazard.
At the sheep pen containing 17 sheep, next to alpacas there are gaps along the back fence between the fence and
the ground. In the area behind the old blacksmith shop there is a wooden platform that is broken along the edge
close to the cross fence. The broken platform combined with the erosion of the dirt beneath the platform has created
a narrow drop-off that could potentially cause leg injury.
The access pass-through tunnel for the bobcats has small rusty holes in the side compromising structural strength.
On the rectangular pen side there is erosion that has exposed sharp wire points protruding upward from the floor
that may cause injury.
At the left front corner of the bison enclosure a large hole/gap was visible in the bottom of the chain link fence.
There are sharp points protruding from the bent fencing. There is a gap at the bottom of the fencing under the railing
toward the back of the enclosure and a long loose metal cable dangling loosely toward the back of the enclosure.

In the pen for the fox by the river there are thin wires wrapped at the bottom of the fence enclosure with several
sharp ends pointing inward into the enclosure. The gray fox pen has a raised platform where the fox was sleeping
during the inspection. There are two of the wooden cross supports that are falling off/displaced and in poor repair.
There is also a metal rung at the bottom of one of the front enclosure panels that has broken and is pointing into the
cage.
Poorly maintained enclosures with wire structure that has been compromised by rust, gaps in the fence and/or
sharp edges and points pose an injury hazard. The structural integrity of the fence is compromised which will
interfere with the capability of the fence to adequately maintain the animals within their enclosure and fail to preventother animals from entering the enclosure.

All housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals. They shall be constructed of material of such strength as appropriate for the
animals involved. The licensee must verify containment features such as buried wire are in place and adequate.
The licensee must secure, repair or remove all dangling or exposed wires or cables that may pose an entanglement
risk in all animal enclosures. The licensee must ensure that in all facilities there are no sharp wires or other sharp
edges or pointed objects on which animals can injure themselves. The licensee must ensure that the supplemental
structures inside any enclosure (such as platforms, shelters, supports, or any other item that the animal comes into
contact with) are in good repair and do not pose an injury hazard.
3.125
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The food storage facilities are in disrepair. The styrofoam insulation of the ceiling in the primary feed storage
building is falling and there is debris, cobwebs etc. present on the ceiling and walls. The feed is currently stored in
covered barrels but when the lids are removed the feed could potentially become contaminated by falling styrofoam
and debris. The old freight container in the off exhibit area being used to store bagged dry food has bagged food
stacked on pallets. Several bags have been torn and there are holes in the bags where rodents have shredded the
packaging. There is food spilled and scattered on and around the bags and pallets also indicating the presence of
rodents. There are several holes in the walls at the junction between the wall and floor (some of these holes been
filled with a foam filler to prevent rodent access) but others are still present. There is lawn care equipment (mowers,
weed wackers, trimmers, etc.) stored at the back of the container. These items contain gas and oil which could spill
and contaminate the food.
All food shall be stored in a manner that will protect them from contamination and deterioration. To be corrected by
April 15, 2016.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
There is a public feeding tube provided at the bear enclosure housing the 4 bears. The tube is a white PVC pipe
though which the public is allowed to drop food to feed the bears. The inside surface of the pipe has a build up of
food residue or grime that will contaminate food delivered through the tube. Contamination poses a health risk. All
food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary to prevent contamination and protect the health of the bears. To
be completed by: April 15, 2016
3.130WATERING.
The suspended water dish in the bear enclosure is rusted and not operational. Currently the only water source for
the bears is their pool which becomes contaminated during play. Another source of clean water is being added, but
at this time the only source is the pool water. An appropriate source of potable water must be provided. To be
corrected by April 8, 2016.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Housekeeping. The fenced in "off exhibit area" is very cluttered. There is equipment, building materials, crates,
pallets, old housing structures, trailers, trash, etc. creating clutter. Extreme clutter encourages the presence and
nesting of vermin and rodents thereby increasing disease hazard. There are open feed carts being filled with
vegetables, bread, fruits, etc. for the animals present in this area which could become contaminated. The two dry
food storage units (building and freight container) are located in this area as well. In addition, animals being
transported to the veterinary area must pass through this location. The area shall be cleaned and organized to
minimize the presence of vermin and protect feed and animals from exposure to contaminants. To be corrected by:
