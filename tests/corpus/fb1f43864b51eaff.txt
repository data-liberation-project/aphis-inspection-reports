2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** When I arrived at the facility I was greeted by the Assistant Director. At that moment he was attending the public
feeding in the front of the petting zoo area. As we started the inspection he called a public attendant up to relieve
him. Once he was relieved the attendant stood watch in the center of the larger petting zoo area. There were
currently two groups that were feeding the animals in which one group went down and around the corner to feed the
large group of llamas. These llamas were out of the public attendants viewing range and the public interactions
were not being monitored. This area was previously blocked off from public contact in the past but for some reason
was reopened without enough public attendants to cover said area. If there was one other attendant then the facility
would have had an adequate number of attendants to properly monitor all the animals during public contact in the
petting zoo areas. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at
all times during periods of public contact for the safety and well-being of the animals and the public. Correct by

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Assistant Director.
