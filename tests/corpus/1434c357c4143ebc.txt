animal care program and for animal tracking of ownership and health care concerns. Every exhibitor must make,
keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning animals
purchased, acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her control, or were transported, sold, euthanized
or otherwise disposed of by that exhibitor, including any offspring born of any animals while in his or her possession
or under his control. Complete and detailed information for animals acquired for use in exhibition needs to be
complete to ensure that all animals are acquired legally as well as transported and handled humanely.
