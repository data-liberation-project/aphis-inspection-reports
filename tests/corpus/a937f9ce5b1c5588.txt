2.4 Direct

Non-interference with APHIS officials.
The licensee interfered with the inspection process. During the course of the inspection at the facility, the licensee
became verbally abusive to the inspector and began cussing and yelling in an aggressive manner. The inspector felt the
licensee's manner was threatening and tried to leave the facility for safety concerns. He followed the inspector to her
vehicle and continued cussing and yelling at the inspector.
When licensees choose to engage in regulated activity under the Animal Welfare Act, they agree to abide by the
regulations and standards set forth. They are required to allow inspection by APHIS and have their facilities and animal
care evaluated. Licensees shall not interfere with, threaten, abuse (including verbally abuse), or harass any APHIS official
in the course of carrying out his or her duties.

2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two groups of Frenchie puppies from 2 different litters (11 total puppies) had mucous diarrhea. According to the licensee,
their mom’s milk was giving them diarrhea, so they were being weaned. When I asked why both mom’s milk would be
causing diarrhea, the licensee explained " the pups had been together, so they probably gave each other something”.


According to the licensee the diarrhea had been occurring for about 48 hours and the veterinarian had not been
contacted.
Young puppies can easily become dehydrated or hypoglycemic when experiencing prolonged diarrhea. The licensee is
responsible for communicating animal illnesses or injuries to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. The licensee
needs to contact the attending veterinarian about the diarrhea in these puppies.

Housing facilities, general.
Most of the water bowl holders in the kennels were rusty and dirty. Surfaces in which the dogs come in contact must be
constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized or removed and
replaced.
Rust cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. The rust needs to be removed from the bowl holders or the bowl
holders need to be replaced.

3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
There was an excessive amount of hair and dirt accumulated along the bottom rails of many of the runs. Further, the odor
of ammonia was overwhelming to the point that the inspector nose and eyes were burning and irritated. When the
licensees were asked when the last time the kennel was thoroughly cleaned/sanitized, their answer was “maybe 2 weeks
previously”.
The accumulation of hair and dirt on the run rails is an excellent place for insects to hide and multiply and bacteria to
proliferate. The strong odor of ammonia further indicates that cleaning is inadequate. All housing facilities must be


cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent or eliminate odors, insects, pests, or vermin infestations and to
minimize disease risks for the animals. The kennel needs to be thoroughly cleaned/sanitized more frequently to reduce
debris accumulation and ammonia buildup.

3.2(b)

Indoor housing facilities.
The odor of ammonia in the kennel was overwhelming to the point that the inspector nose and eyes were burning and
irritated. According to the licensee, the drains had not been flushed that morning and that was the cause of the ammonia.
Prolonged exposure to ammonia can be irritating to the dogs’ nose, eyes, and throat, and can lead to breathing problems.
Indoor housing facilities must be sufficiently ventilated at all times when dogs or cats are present to provide for their health
and well-being and to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia levels, and moisture condensation. The licensee must assure that
the facility has adequate ventilation and take measures to reduce the buildup of ammonia levels.
