ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
On Wednesday June 11, 2014 at approximately 11:50 a.m., the licensee did not have a responsible adult available
to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 11:50 a.m., I did not notice anyone around so I knocked on the door of the
house and there was no answer. They do not have a phone so I could not call. I went two houses down where
family members of the licensee live. I spoke with a gentleman at that location and he told me that the licensee was
at work and his wife was visiting her sister. He told me that he would let them know that I stopped by.
The licensee was not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations and standards
and to ensure for the health and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be made available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct from this date forward.
