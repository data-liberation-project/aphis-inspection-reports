HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The Raccoon Building has a high ambient temperature and humidity. The building is constructed of metal and is
only partially insulated. There are sixteen fans running throughout the building and there are windows that are open
along the sides. The temperatures taken in the building by the Kestrel at approximately 3:50 pm is 100 degrees F
with a heat index of 119 degrees F at the north end of the building and 100 degrees F with a heat index of 120
degrees F along the east enclosures in the middle of the building. At 4:32 pm the temperature taken is 100.4
degrees F with a heat index of 122.1 degrees F along the west enclosures in the middle of the building. At 4:24 pm
near the south end of the first room the temperature is 100.1 degrees F and 100.2 degrees F with a heat index of
120.1 degrees F. Twenty-six raccoons are in severe heat distress and are suffering from the temperatures inside
the building.
The behaviors observed in these 26 raccoons include panting, drooling and increased respiratory rate.
The raccoons are lying on their sides, backs, and abdomens with their legs splayed out demonstrating they are
uncomfortable with the temperature and are trying to cool off. These 26 raccoons are also reluctant to move,
lethargic, and not alert to activity in the building around them. These signs are indicative of the elevated temperature
inside the building not allowing the animals to regulate their core body temperature properly. The inability of these
26 raccoons to cool off has caused them to suffer. There are approximately 290 raccoons housed in this building.
The high temperature and humidity is having a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals.
The following animals have been identified as suffering from severe heat stress:

When climatic conditions present a threat to an animal's health and well-being, appropriate measures must be taken
to alleviate the impact of those conditions. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature,
humidity and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being. The licensee must reduce the temperature
and humidity inside this building to a level that is comfortable for the raccoons in order to support their health and
well-being.(cid:9)
