OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Some marmoset enclosures did not have adequate shade. One example of this included a cage that had no
covering over the top at all. Another cage had only a loose aluminum pan on the top of the cage which covered a
limited area and was not attached and could blow away. The lack of shade could cause the primates to overheat or
to sustain sun damage. Facilities for nonhuman primates must provide adequate shelter from the sun and other
elements.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an accumulation of dried and decaying food and fecal waste in an enclosure housing a marmoset.
Perches, toys, and other surfaces in this cage were dirty. All the other nonhuman primate cages also had multiple
dirty surfaces with dark greasy appearing staining. Dirty surfaces included ropes, perches, pass through tunnels,
and some walls. Numerous cockroaches scurried away when a nest box was opened. Soiled surfaces and
accumulation of food and fecal waste may cause a risk of diseases, odor accumulation, or pest infestation that
could affect the health and well-being of the animals. Food and excrement must be removed more frequently, and
as often as necessary to prevent excessive waste accumulation, pest infestation, and disease hazards. An effective
pest control program must be established. Surfaces must be kept clean and replaced when worn.

SANITATION.
The primary enclosures for the kinkajous were dirty with accumulations of feces and food wastes, inside, under and
around them. Excreta and discarded food debris shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary
to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein, to avoid attracting pests and to minimize disease
hazards.

SANITATION.
Two of the kinkajou enclosures were located in a shed. The shed was in disrepair with a damaged roof beam and
sagging of the metal roof. There were tools, equipment and debris all around the enclosures. One of the kinkajou
pens had a wooden leg that was bent. The disrepair of the shed, the accumulation of clutter around the enclosures,
and the warped leg under the cage all create concerns about the safety of the location for the animals. The
premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury.
The shed where the kinkajou were housed should be cleaned and repaired or the animals should be moved to
enclosures in a safer location.
