OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Outdoor facilities must protect dogs from direct sunlight. The outdoor housing enclosures, most of the tarps are
missing allowing direct sunlight. All dogs in this area have no adequate shade. Even when temperatures are
cooler, shade must be available. Shade must be added to all these enclosures to ensure dogs are properly cared
for and comfortable. The breeder must put into place a good maintenance program that promptly addresses
concerns that can affect the good health and well-being of dogs in outdoor facilities. Correct by 10-01-2017.
