ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** In the main kennel building a five year old female Schnauzer named Miss Lynn (chip# 0007097B8A), had an
area of swelling between the two middle toes of her front left paw. The left paw had a reddened, raised lesion on
the dorsal surface between digits two and three causing the two toes and pads to separate. This lesion/area of
swelling was approximately 0.5 inches wide. Swelling and wounds can occur as the result of injury, illness, or other
medical conditions that could be painful. Miss Lynn had a normal gait and stance. She placed equal weight on all
four limbs. She didn't display any signs of pain when the injured paw was palpated and the injury appeared to be
quite recent. The licensee stated that the injury hadn't been there in the last few days. Foot problems can be
painful causing discomfort when the dog has to place weight on both feet. It can affect the mobility and daily activity
of the dog. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administrated. The
outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
