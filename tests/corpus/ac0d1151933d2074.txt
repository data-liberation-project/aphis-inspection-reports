A USDA, APHIS, AC license must be obtained to exhibit animals to the public.
2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility employs a veterinarian under part-time or consulting arrangements. The written program of veterinary
care does not include guidance on the two cavy that are present. Written veterinary guidance for the care and well
being of the cavy at the facility has not been provided by the applicant. Animals may be mishandled and mistreated
without current applicable guidelines for their care and treatment. For example, two Patagonian cavies died last
December at the facility when they were housed outdoors without a heated nest box. Each exhibitor shall employ
an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements, which shall include a written program of veterinary care in the
case of a part-time or consulting veterinarian. A written program of veterinary care, including appropriate guidance

2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Since June, 2013 the applicant has been in charge of animal care at the facility and there have been numerous
deaths of animals in their care. The list includes one ringtail lemur, 1 bobcat kitten, 2 adult watusi, 2 cavy, 1 fox,
one peacock, one Chinese pheasant and two fallow deer. The applicants husband stated that the technician that
was hired this spring supposedly had wild and exotic animal experience but they found out she had only worked at a
dog kennel which is also the only experience that the applicants husband has with animals and the applicant also
has not stated that she has any experience with wild or exotic animals. Since the previous inspection a rabbit hashad a back injury due to poor handling practices.
All licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the
species they maintain.
The applicant must gain the appropriate knowledge and experience of any species of animal prior to acquiring the
animal or hire someone with the proper knowledge and experience with the species involved.
2.131(b)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The 18 fallow deer on exhibit are very uneasy and nervous. The animals pace the back of the enclosure and hide in
the off exhibit area. The public is allowed to enter the deer enclosure. Signs are posted to not proceed beyond this
point but there is no physical barrier, leaving the deer an area where the public is not allowed but the food and water
for the deer is in the area where the public is allowed. The public access further exacerbates the animals
nervousness and may cause them to injur themselves.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Measures must be taken to reduce the stress and anxiety of these animals when on exhibit to the public.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public is allowed hand feed animals on exhibit including: six pigs, two llamas, one alpaca, five goats, two
cavies, one rabbit, a watusi, and eighteen fallow deer. The public may contact the animals during feeding.
Employees or attendants are not present during these times of public contact. Guests may enter the fallow deer
enclosure unattended. The deer run back and forth across the back of their enclosure when they see people. One
of the rabbits present at the last inspection was seen by the attending veterinarian for a back issue that was causing
lameness. The care takers are not aware of how the injury happened because there are no attendants present at
times of public contact. Unattended public contact may result in physical injury to the animals by trauma or them
eating unapproved items. The animals experience mental harm when they are subject to ignorant and inappropriate
human contact. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all
times during public contact.
3.52 DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. The rabbit enclosure has cement sides that are approximately 3 feet tall and an open top. One rabbit was seen by
the attending veterinarian for a back injury with an unknown cause.
Outdoor housing facilities for rabbits shall be fenced or otherwise enclosed to minimize the entrance of predators.
Ensure that the rabbit is in an enclosure that provides it protection from predators with appropriate fencing.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing 2 adult pigs and 4 piglets, the enclosure housing the 3 llama/alpaca and the enclosure
housing the Watusi have numerous areas of wire fence that are broken and in disrepair. The shelters for the fallow
deer in the off exhibit area have two wood boards on the ground with large nails sticking out from them and there is
a roof support that is falling down and also has nails sticking out of it. There is a rusty, deteriorated piece of metal
along the bottom of the shelter for the bobcats. The door for the rabbit shelter is chewed and in disrepair. There
are old, non-functional automatic waterers in the deer enclosure that are very rusted and have jagged edges.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
All animals must be contained in an enclosure that is appropriate for the species to prevent injury and/or death of
the animals.Replace or repair the fence so that it does not cause injury and so that it contains the pigs, llama/alpaca
and Watusi. Repair the shelters in the off exhibit area for the fallow deer to prevent injury. Remove or replace the
rusty metal at the bottom of the bobcat shelter to prevent injury and maintain the structural strength of the shelter.
Replace or repair the door so that it does not cause injury to the rabbit inside the enclosure. Remove or repair the
automatic waterers inside the fallow deer enclosure to prevent injury.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The storage shed which used to store the bags of all purpose sweet feed and deer pellets has spilled feed on the
floor. There is evidence of mice in the form of mouse droppings on the floor of the shed. The bobcat shelter has a
storage area attached to it. The facility is keeping bird food in this area and it is spilled on the floor. During
inspecion the inspector had a mouse run over her foot in this storage area. Open bags and spilled food draw
rodents into the area. The bobcat food is thawed in a refrigerator in the storage area where the bobcats are
housed. There is a large amount of dried chicken juice on the rungs of the refrigerator shelves and the bottom of
the refrigerator. There is an odor coming from the refrigerator.Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. Refrigeration shall be provided for supplies of perishable food.
Any open bags of food must be kept in a container with a lid to prevent infestation and contamination by mice any
spilled feed must be cleaned up so that it does not attract rodents. The refrigerator where the meat is thawed must
be cleaned regularily to eliminate the possibility of contamination of the food and reduce odor and disease hazards.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The Watusi is housed in an enclosure that does not have a shelter with 3 sides and a roof .
Shelter from inclement weather. Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the
species concerned shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent
discomfort to such animals. Individual animals shall be acclimated before they are exposed to the extremes of the
individual climate.
The shelter provided is not a sufficient shelter for the watusi. It does not protect the animal from wind and rain in the
summer and wind and snow in the winter. A shelter with at least three sides and a roof must be constructed or
walls added to the current structure to protect the animals and prevent discomfort.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The two cavy are in an enclosure that does not have a perimeter fence.
On or after May 17, 2000, all outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a
perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 6 feet
high for other animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it
protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent
physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such
fences less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must be approved in writing by the Administrator. A perimeter fence must be errected around any enclosure housing a wild or exotic animal to act as secondary
contaiment and to prevent death of the animal by a predator.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
There was no edible hay in the fallow deer enclosure and according to the attending veterinarians instructions hay
must be fed ad lib to the deer. The cavy diet consists of one day of pig feed and one day of rabbit pellet. This diet
for the cavy has not been recommended by the attending veterinarian. There was no pellet or grain in the fallow
deer enclosure and no deer pellet on hand. There was no food dish or rabbit pellet in the rabbit enclosure.
The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health.
Provide all animals with a sufficient amount of appropriate food and hay daily to maintain the health of the animals.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
Excess algae, dirt, and leaves are present in the water container for the Watusi. A layer of green/brown material is
covering the insides of these containers, contaminating the animals' water. Dirty water may harbor disease hazards
which pose a health risk for the animals. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There is a lot of debris piled behind the cavy enclosure and outside the barn where the hay and some of the grain
are being stored. These areas are great grounds for rodent infestation.

Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed
in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
Remove all trash and debris from the premises and grounds to protect the health of the animals.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION. There is mice feces in the sweet feed and deer pellet storeage shed. A mouse ran over the inspectors foot in the
storage area connected to the bobcat enclosure.
A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained.
A program to eliminate mice must be developed and maintained.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
With the number of husbandry citations it shows that there is not a sufficient number of employees on staff to care
for the animals on hand. The applicants husband stated that everyone was complaining about him working with the
animals and that he has nothing saying he can't and admits working with the animals regularily.
A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level
of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Such practices shall be under a supervisor who has a background in
animal care.
A sufficient number of employees must be utilized to maintain a professional level of animal husbandry for the
animals' optimal health and well being.
