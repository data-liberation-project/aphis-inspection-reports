FEEDING.
In the cow enclosure, hay is placed in a rack inside the shelter. The rack has a mild-moderate amount of bird
droppings on it. The hay could become contaminated with bird droppings and pose a health risk to the young cows
in that enclosure. The facility must ensure that food receptacles are placed so as to minimize contamination and
are kept clean and sanitary at all times.
