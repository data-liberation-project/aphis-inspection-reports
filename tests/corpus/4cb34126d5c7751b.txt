Sanitation.
There is an accumulation of dust and cobwebs on the ceiling beams in the lambing barn.
Approximately 20 small buckets, used for lambing pens, and excess hay were also found scattered on the floor
throughout the barn.
Failure to clean animal facilities regularly can adversely affect the health of the sheep and can potentially attract pests.
The facility must maintain the premise by keeping it clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
