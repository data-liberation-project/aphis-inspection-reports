HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. The puppy maintenance room is in need of attention. This is the room behind the 6 puppy rooms. The puppies
are allowed access to this area on occasion, this is where the diets are prepared, the medications are administered,
and overall care takes place in this area. However, the tiles behind the wooden steps, into each puppy room, have
begun to show damage. Several of the tiles are cracked, pieces are broken off and some tiles are missing. This now
exposes jagged edges, unsealed areas, and the area cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized. To ensure that the
area can be readily sanitized all tiles in the room will need to be addressed.
