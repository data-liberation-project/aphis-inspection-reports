PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Item Primary Enclosures 3.80 a 2 ii
In June of 2016 most likely during the night of the 8th or early morning of the 9th a non human primate was able to
unlock the mechanism that holds the squeeze back portion of the cage in place. With the mechanism unlocked the
primate was able to move the back panel forward thus creating a space between the side wall of the cage and the
opening for the automatic watering device. At this time the primate was able to get her head caught in this space
and was found dead the following morning by husbandry staff.
Facility has started adding additional locking measures immediately and is also looking at other measures to
prevent any reoccurrences.
Facility needs to continue its monitoring of its cages to prevent further injury
Corrected by facility before end of inspection
Inspection of Upper Merion East and West sites as well as the Upper Providence site took place on June 13-14
