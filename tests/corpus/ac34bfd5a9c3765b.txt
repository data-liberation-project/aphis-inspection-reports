Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A current/updated written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available for inspection; PVC presented for
inspection was from calendar year 2017. In order to comply with this section of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), a recently
updated written PVC by the Attending Veterinarian (AV) must be in place and available for inspection at all times. Also,
the facility must ensure the AV conducts regularly scheduled visits to the premises where regulated animals are kept. To
ensure adequate veterinary medical care to regulated animals, the facility's PVC must be regularly updated.

Facilities, general.
Several areas of extremely damaged/rotted wood were observed at the opossum's enclosure; frame boards and plywood.
Also, a protruding screw and exposed sharp wires were observed on the inside of the enclosure. Primary enclosures for
regulated animals at the facility must be free of jagged wood splinters or sharp metal/wire points and edges that might
injure the animals; these are potential injury hazards for the animals. Housing facilities for regulated animals must be
structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury while containing the animals.


To prevent discomfort, unhealthy conditions and potential injury to the animals, the damaged wood, protruding screw and
exposed wires must be repaired/replaced.
