EMPLOYEES.
The licensee was alone at a fair performing shows, taking care of the elephant and other animals husbandry
(feeding, cleaning, etc.) and taking care of a minor under 10 years of age for 24 hours 7 days a week.
In case the licensee has to step away for a while there is not another person traveling with the licensee who could
watch over the elephant.When we arrived the elephant had been put inside the trailer in order for the owner to leave
the area and get something to eat. While we were at the site the licensee left to get a circus employee that could
potentially take care of the elephant in case of an emergency and whenever the elephant was left alone and was
not chained. The circus employee is willing to help take care the elephant but he is also busy watching over the
circus that and may not be available when needed.
It was considered that there was a lack of employees for the activities in which the licensee was involved.
The owner acknowledge that he will be correcting this from today forward.
To be corrected immediately from this day forward by the owner.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative at the NJ (Augusta) state fairgrounds along with
AC-VMO's Dr. Luis A. Navarro Dr. Paula Gladue and Dr. Denise Sofranko. One African elephant (Nosey)
inspected.
