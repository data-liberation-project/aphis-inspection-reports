3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The shelter for the camel had a tin roof with multiple small rusted holes of approximately 1-4 inches in diameter,
and the two sides of the roof extended to a ridgeline gap of several inches in the center that was open to the sky.
Gaps in the roofing material permit entrance of rain and snow, and can result in wetting of the animal, potentially
leading to stress, discomfort and in cold temperatures, hypothermia. Animals require adequate shelter from
inclement weather.
