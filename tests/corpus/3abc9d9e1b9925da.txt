Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male wirehaired dachshund "Riot" official identification #325 was examined and found to have light to medium brown
tartar buildup on approximately 50% of the teeth surface of all upper and lower canine teeth, front teeth and cheek teeth.
On the left upper cheek tooth, there is dark grey in color buildup covering the whole tooth. The gum line is receding,
reddened and there is a gap between the gums and the base of the tooth. The tooth next to it, has light grey organic
material buildup covering approximately 50% of the tooth's surface. The gums are inflamed, and receding and a gap is
present at the base of the tooth at the gum line. This dog was examined by the facility's veterinarian in October 2021 and
the dog was marked "OK" by the veterinarian. The facility states they clean the dog's teeth when they are groomed twice
a year. No records were found on when this dog received its last teeth cleaning.

Poor dental health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as lead to further health issues. This dog must be
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and
treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that
all dogs receive adequate veterinary care.

The facility is providing "Dyne" a high calorie liquid supplement to nursing moms for additional calorie intake. Currently it
is being given to one nursing Shih Tzu dam. The bottle of "Dyne" is expired with an expiration date of February 2022. The
facility is also providing a calcium and vitamin d3 supplement to dogs before they whelp or while they are nursing. The
facility states they have given it recently but unsure of when and to which dog. The supplement is expired with an
expiration date of June 2021.

Expired supplements may lose their effectiveness and may not effectively give additional calories or help with health
problems. Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and prevent diseases and injuries.
The facility must ensure that all supplement products are current and have not expired in order to support the health and
well-being of the dogs.

Primary enclosures.
There were 5 wire enclosures containing 8 adult dogs where the door to the enclosure did not fully close leaving gaps
ranging from 1 to 2 inches in depth and at least 5 inches wide. This gap is large enough for a dog's foot or leg to be
caught in. Enclosures that do not contain the dog and all their limbs in the enclosure may cause injury to the dog’s feet or
legs.

Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the dogs from injury. The facility must ensure
that the enclosures are constructed and maintained so that the enclosures can safely contain the dogs and their limbs at

all times.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The facility states they clean the primary enclosures, self feeders and water nipples twice per year with water or more as
needed. At least 3 enclosures housing a total of 3 adults and 7 puppies between the enclosures, had a buildup of hair and
organic material on the plastic coated wire caging. A buildup of organic material on the enclosures could increase the risk
of disease hazards towards the dogs.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and
more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. Hard
surfaces must be sanitized using one of the following methods: live steam under pressure or washing with hot water (at
least 180° F) and soap or detergent. The licensee must clean and sanitize the primary enclosures, self-feeders, and water
nipples and ensure that all aspects of the enclosure are maintained in a clean and sanitized condition in order to support
the health of the dogs.
