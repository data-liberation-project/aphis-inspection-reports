3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two rabbits are being housed in the covered barn area in a blue plastic kiddie pool surrounded by a movable, short
(approximately 1 ½ ft high) wire segmented/folding fence. A third unconfined rabbit was seen hopping around in the
covered barn area and outside the barn near an enclosed rabbit hutch housing an additional two rabbits. The height
of the kiddie pool is such that the rabbits can easily put their front feet on the top of the edge and slide over the
edge then go through the openings of or under the short barrier fence and escape. Rabbits are susceptible to injury
and predators when not appropriately housed in a protected environment.
The escaped rabbit needs to be recaptured and housed in an appropriate enclosure. All rabbit enclosures shall be
structurally sound to protect the rabbits from injury, to contain them and to keep predators out. Correct by 10/10/19.
3.75(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor portion of the ringtail lemur building is being used for the lemurs and for storage. There are stacks of
materials stored on the floor along all walls not part of the lemur enclosure. Some of these materials are in plastic
tubs; others are just stacked on top and around each other. Some of the stacks are up to four feet high. Dirt, loose
shavings and lots of cobwebs were noted on the floor, walls and stored items. The items are decorative items and
currently unused materials. Cleaning and routine husbandry procedures cannot be easily accomplished around or
behind these stored items.
Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter including equipment, furniture or
stored materials that are not being used/necessary for cleaning and proper animal husbandry practices. Correct by
10/30/19.
3.84(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The primary enclosures for the single vervet monkey and the two macaque monkeys need to be cleaned. In both
enclosures the perches/sitting structures and enrichment items are dirty with adhered brown material. In the vervet
enclosure there is a mound of accumulated fecal material (from multiple days) and a large wet urine spot on the dirt
floor just underneath the perching branch that the vervet sits on. There was a large amount of dried food present onthe ground both inside and just outside the macaque enclosure. Many flies were noted in and around both
enclosures at ground level. Rodent holes were noted nearby (the facility has instituted a rodent pest management
program). Accumulations of exceta and food waste can lead to the attraction of insect and mammalian pests and
the spread of disease.
The enclosures and dirt floors should be spot cleaned regularly to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and
odors. All perches, bars and shelves must be kept clean. Correct by 10/10/19.
3.84(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outdoor portion of the ringtail lemur enclosure has been overtaken by thick green weeds, grasses and some
bush like weeds that are up to four feet tall. The ground could barely be seen. In the one area where the ground
was visible two rodent type holes were noted-one with a small 1 inch opening and the other with a larger 2 ½ inch
opening with loose soil around it evident of recent digging. The weeds/grasses act as breeding/living areas for
pests, rodents and vermin and make it difficult to perform daily husbandry practices such as cleaning.
Weeds, grass and bushes must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control. Correct
by 10/15/19.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The hedgehog enclosures (plastic Rubbermaid like tubs) used for the breeding hedgehogs are in need of cleaning.
The shavings were excessively wet and dirty. The walls of the enclosures were dirty/greasy. There was a strong
odor of ammonia present in the building near the shelving holding these enclosures. The odor became much
stronger from each enclosure when each was pulled forward for evaluation. Lack of cleaning can lead to odors,
contamination and spread of disease. Wet shavings can be uncomfortable for the hedgehogs. Excessive ammonia
odors can lead to respiratory issues.
The hedgehog enclosures shall be cleaned and excreta removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of
the animals, to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. Correct by 10/10/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative on 10/8/19.
