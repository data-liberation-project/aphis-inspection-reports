ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 on
15-May-18.Upon arrival, I called and texted the phone number listed. The licensee informed me she was away and
could not return in time for the inspection process.
This is the first attempted inspection.
