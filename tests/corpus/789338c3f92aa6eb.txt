ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The squirrel has not had its' annual Leptospirosis & Rabies vaccination. The program of veterinary Care indicates
that it should be vaccinated against these two diseases annually.
Two African Crested porcupines were acquired on June 4, 2015. The program of veterinary care does not address
this species of mammal.
The squirrel shall be vaccinated according to the recommendations set forth by your attending veterinarian as
outlined on the program of veterinary care. The African Crested porcupines shall be examined & addressed on the
program of veterinary care as soon as feasible after arrival to ensure that they receive the appropriate quarantine,
vaccinations, & external/internal parasite control (if any) as well as any other recommendations that your
veterinarian might have.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several pieces of large white plastic type chips that were observed floating on top, as well as, on the
bottom of the show stage pool. These pieces of debris appear to be coming from a deteriorating alligator prop that
sits submerged in the pool and is no longer being used.
During a portion of the show, the otters slide down a slide into this pool of water and then exit. These pieces of
debris can potentially be ingested by the otter during the time that they are in this pool and pose a risk to their health
and well-being.
The housing facilities shall be structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

interview was conducted on-site with the Animal Show Manager.
