CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Food preparation area: An accumulation of rodent feces was noted on the inside shelves of a storage cabinet and
also on the top surface of the refrigerator. Currently, there is no pest control program in place which addresses
rodent pests. Rodent feces may contaminate food and present a potential disease hazard to the animals. A safe
and effective program for the control of rodent pests must be established and maintained in order to promote the
health and well-being of the animals.
