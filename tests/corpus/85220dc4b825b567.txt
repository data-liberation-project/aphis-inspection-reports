FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the food storage room(cid:25)s receiving door, two gaps were identified at its floor junction. The gaps were large
enough for vermin to go through and unrestricted under the door. Evidence of the presence of rodents was
identified in the dry-food area. Supplies of food and/or bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect
such supplies against contamination by vermin. The door(cid:25)s gaps should be eliminated/closed/repaired as soon as
possible to eliminate contamination by vermin at the food storage room.
