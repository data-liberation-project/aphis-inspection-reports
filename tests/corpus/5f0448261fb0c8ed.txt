2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The majority of the goats present are severely undernourished, with prominent spines, hips, and ribs. One goat was
found to have difficulty standing and walking. The African leopard was repeatedly licking and shaking both of its
front paws. It had been treated by the veterinarian previously for a foot infection, but the current problem had not
been noted by zoo personnel. On closer exam it was found that all of the hair was missing from the area around the
toes of the front paws. The veterinarian had not been on site since June 2014, and was unaware of these current
problems.
Failure to notice problems with the animals can be detrimental to their health and well-being. Adequate Veterinary
Care should include daily observation of the animals by zoo personnel, in order to assess their health and
well-being, and frequent and timely communication with the Attending Veterinarian regarding any problems or
concerns noted, so that appropriate evaluation and treatment can be provided.
To be corrected immediately.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There are inadequate barriers and / or staff present to prevent physical contact between the animals and the public
for the following animals on exhibit: rabbits, monkeys, bobcat, coatimundi, goats, genet cat, kinkajou, and deer.
Additionally there is a passageway that is easily accessible to the public by stepping down about four feet into the
passageway, and from the passageway a person could have direct contact with the tiger through the fence. The
tiger enclosure is in front at the entry to the zoo, and less visible to staff.
Steps should be taken to prevent contact with animals in order to ensure the safety of the animals and the public.

3.127(d) REPEATFACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The majority of the premises is enclosed by an eight foot perimeter fence, as required, but there are still some areas
where the fence falls below the eight foot requirement. Recently new fencing has been installed in some sections,
and new cyclone fencing is on hand to continue fence repairs, but in some areas due to sloping terrain the eight foot
height requirement is not met on both sides. Additionally the gate is not eight feet in height.
Perimeter fences must be constructed and maintained in such a way that they prevent animals and unauthorized
persons from going through or under the fence, and so that they can also act as a secondary containment for
animals in the facility. Since this facility houses potentially dangerous animals the fence must be at least eight feet
in height. The perimeter fence should be improved and maintained so that it meets the requirements specified in
this regulation, so as to protect the health and well-being of the animals on exhibit.

An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
