2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
According to the record of animals on hand, one Syrian hamster was lost in the store and never recovered. The facility
representative stated that in May 2022, a customer was holding the hamster and dropped it. The hamster escaped into
the store and was not located, even after continued searching. The facility no longer allows customers to handle animals.
Inappropriate handling of animals or handling done by inexperienced individuals can lead to escape, injury, and even
death. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
To be corrected from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
