2.1(b)(1) Repeat

Requirements and application
Two white Bengal Tigers, originating from Texas, were exhibited at the Georgia State Fair. The Texas site has not been
approved for regulated activity. Multiple times in the past, the exhibitor has been cited for conducting regulated activity
from this unapproved site yet continues to do so. Without inspection and site approval prior to the conduct of regulated
activity, animal welfare as well as compliance with the Animal Welfare Act cannot be ascertained. The Texas site must be
inspected and approved by an APHIS official prior to conducting any further regulated activity.
2.126(a)(4) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
The transport trailer is comprised of two parts with a connecting door in between. The front part is used for human living
quarters and the back part is where the tiger enclosures are maintained during travel. When examining the empty animal
section, inspectors noticed a small roof vent fan but did not find side windows or AC vents. When asked how the
temperature was regulated in this section, the exhibitor explained that the AC is turned on in the human living quarters
and the door between the two sections is maintained opened to cool the animal compartment. When asked to
demonstrate this by turning on the AC and opening the door, the exhibitor refused. As a result, APHIS officials were not
able to evaluate compliance with the transportation handling regulations describing specific temperature parameters


needing to be maintained during travel. Traveling exhibitors must allow APHIS officials to inspect temperature control
systems, such as heaters, fans, and air conditioners of transport vehicles. Exhibitors must allow APHIS officials to inspect
the areas considered necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act and the regulations. To be corrected by May 5, 2022.
2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
During inspection, groups of varying sizes, between 2 and 6 people, were allowed a group at a time to enter the general
public barrier at the far corner of the exhibit. The group stood near a bike rack metal barrier where each member in turn is
given stainless steel tongs holding a piece of chicken. The tongs are then extended into the enclosure in order to deposit
the food in the tiger’s mouth. At that time, the attendant stands back to take a picture of the interaction. When the
inspectors took part in the interaction, they found that the bike rack fence reached to the bottom of their bust area, a
height of 47 inches, about 4 feet. By extending an arm, with the elbow at the level of the bike rack and the hand covering
half of the tongs, the inspector was able to reach the tiger enclosure. The tongs are 16 inches long per the licensee and
the length between the inspector’s elbow and hand is 15 inches. When adding it together, the distance between the bike
rack barrier and the tiger’s enclosure was approximately 23 inches, about 2 feet. The way in which public feeding is being
conducted by this exhibitor poses significant public and animal safety risks. Even with metal flaps placed one third of the
way down from the tips of the tongs, approximately 5 inches could still penetrate the enclosure. The tigers could suffer
injuries from the scalloped edged tongs. In such close proximity, the public could be injured from accidentally coming into
contact with the tigers. During public exhibition, animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal
and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public to assure the
safety of animals and the public. To be corrected by May 17, 2022.

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.


Both traveling enclosures for the tigers were not marked on top and on at least one side with the words 'Live Animal" or
'Wild Animal' and with markings to indicate the correct upright position of the enclosure. Lack of the markings, especially
during emergency situations, may lead to improper handling of the enclosures and potential injury or discomfort of the
animals. All enclosures must be marked on top and on one or more sides with the words ``Live Animal'' or ``Wild Animal'',
whichever is appropriate, in letters not less than 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in height, and with arrows or other markings to
indicate the correct upright position of the container. To be corrected by May 31, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
