PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
The transport truck doors have glass paneled windows that can be readily opened to allow for air flow.These
windows are protected by wire mesh covers as they are in an area where animals have access to and food and
bedding are stored. Two windows on one side of the truck are missing their wire mesh safety covers. An additional
window on the opposite wall has a wire mesh cover that is separating from the window, and an opening has formed.
These window covers should be repaired and/or replaced to minimize the risk of injury to the animals in the event of
breakage.
The animal cargo space of primary conveyances used in transporting live animals shall be constructed and
maintained in a manner that protects the health, and ensures the safety and comfort of the animals contained
therein at all times.
