PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In many of the outdoor enclosures there are exposed metal grates along the edges of the fence. The grates are
present to prevent dogs from digging out. However, these grates are exposed along the edges and multiple
"dig-holes" are present against the fence where dogs have dug. The numerous "dig-holes" and the exposed 6 inch
metal grate holes create possible limb injury threats to the enclosed animal. Applicant needs to remove the grating
or replace dirt in the "dig-holes" and on top of the metal grate to ensure the animals are safely contained and
protected from potential injury.
