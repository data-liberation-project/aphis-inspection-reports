2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The black bear "Rick" was reluctant to move and took a long time to get up. He was first on his back and had to rock
to get up. Once sitting upright he scooted to reposition himself. He then got up on all fours but pivoted to turn
around but did not walk. He sat down carefully and slowly and did not attempt to get up again. He also has an
abundance of winter coat that has not shedded yet. There seemed to be discomfort in getting up and sitting down
which needs to be addressed by the attending veterinarian. The veterinarian had not assessed the animal since the
previous inspection. The facility must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. The
facility was instructed to have the attending veterinarian come out during the inspection.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures for the ligers have pools with green and brown water. They had a thick green frothy consistency andit needs to be flushed and cleaned. The dirty pool water needs to be flushed and properly disposed of to minimize
vermin infestation, odors and disease hazards.
In the grizzly bears enclosure the dog food is being fed on the ground and not removed but instead pushed out to
the outer edge of their primary enclosure. The leftover food on the ground can attract pests. Food waste needs to
be properly removed and disposed of to minimize vermin infestation, odors and disease hazards.

In the black bear enclosure there was an excessive amount of old feces throughout the primary enclosure and the
den. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. Correct by September 21, 2016
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
In the feed room there was rodent feces present and flies. Some bags had tears in them that may indicate that
