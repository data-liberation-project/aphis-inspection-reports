3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter fencing:
-Back gate of the compound was closed, with a combination lock on the gate but was not locked. We called out
loudly several times at the gate and there was no one close enough to respond, so we called the posted number.
Any person could have walked in through the back gate and the perimeter fence must keep unauthorized persons
out.
-The perimeter fence adjacent to the tents had a dirt berm built up next to it, with occasional tree trunks stored on
tope of the berm. The combination of berm and tree trunk has reduced the effective height of the fence to less than
8 ft in specific locations. Fences must be greater than 8 ft high to act as secondary containment system for
potentially dangerous animals in the facility.
The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the
facility.
