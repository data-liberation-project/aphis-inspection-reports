Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility has a written program of veterinary care (PVC) signed and approved by the attending veterinarian and records
of deworming and vaccinating of adults were available, however the program of veterinary care does not clearly describe
the adult vaccines and adult dewormers to be used and on the schedule to follow. An approved schedule for deworming
and vaccinating dogs (including adults) with indicated products is now required to ensure optimum health of dogs. Ensure
that the PVC for dogs now has the required information approved the attending veterinarian.
