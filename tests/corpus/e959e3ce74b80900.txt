Facilities, general.
The shed in the pen housing 12 goats, 1 yak, and 3 fallow deer has two large gaps at ground-level. Each gap, one on
either side of the shed opening, is approx 1ft x 1ft and these gaps have multiple sharp edges resulting from broken wood
bordering the openings.

Outdoor housing facilities need to be structurally sound and maintained in good repair. Failure to do so can lead to injury
of the animals if the animals get caught up in these gaps or on a sharp piece of wood. Correct by repairing the gaps in the
shed and maintaining it in good repair.

Sanitation.
In one of the bobcat enclosures, the weeds and vegetation are significantly overgrown and encompass the entire
enclosure.



Premises need to be kept clean and in good repair in order to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices. Overgrown
weeds in an enclosure inhibits proper cleaning and can be a harborage area for pests. Correct by cutting back and
maintaining vegetation in the bobcat enclosure so as to prevent overgrowth.
