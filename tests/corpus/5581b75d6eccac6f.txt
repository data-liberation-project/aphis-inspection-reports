ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown goat was noted by the inspectors which appeared to be having difficulty walking. The goat moved stiffly
and seemed hesitant to move. This goat had long toes on both of the rear feet. These hoofs are in need of
trimming. Long overgrown hoofs can cause conformation issues and joint problems. Trim this goat's feet. This
goat also requires evaluation by the attending veterinarian to determine if it has any other problems resulting in its
stiff gait and if any other treatment is required. This goat is to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian by close of
business on 12-19-14.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown goat was noted by the inspectors which appeared to be having difficulty walking. The goat moved stiffly
and seemed hesitant to move. This goat had long toes on both of the rear feet. These hoofs are in need of
trimming. Long overgrown hoofs can cause conformation issues and joint problems. No one at the facility had
noticed the condition of this goat. Failure to observe health issues and promptly report them to the attending
veterinarian will lead to unnecessary suffering and in extreme cases even possible animal death. Thorough daily
observations of all animals should be made. Animals with known problems should receive extra scrutiny. Report all
health issues promptly to the veterinarian.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Two domestic cats are housed in an enclosure that contains one litter box. Three domestic cats are housed in an
enclosure also with one litter box. These litter boxes had excessive feces in them. Primary enclosures are to be
cleaned of fecal material daily. Excessive feces in litter boxes can lead to odor problems. It can also be a potential
source of disease and pest control issues. Excessively dirty litter boxes can be a source of discomfort to the cats as
they will hesitate to use the boxes when they are overly soiled. The cats in the enclosure housing three cats were
defecating outside their litter box. This could result in soiling of the cats and ingestion of feces as they groom
themselves. This can lead to parasite and other potential infections. Clean litter boxes daily.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The primary enclosure housing three foxes still has an area of the wire lining the enclosure exposed by the digging
of the foxes. Some of this wire has broken with exposed points and is an injury hazard. It is possible that a fox
could escape or become trapped or injured by the broken wire while attempting to escape. This enclosure needs
immediate repair to contain and protect the foxes housed in it.
The skunk escaped while its enclosure was being cleaned. It is now loose in the warm room and is thought to be
hiding under the pools set up for alligators in the warm room. The skunk is hiding amongst the plumbing and
electrical wiring for these pools. The inspectors observed at least one electrical wire in this service area. This
skunk must be captured as soon as possible to prevent any possible injury. This animal needs to be contained
while its enclosure is being cleaned in order to prevent any possible injury or a possible escape from the warm room
area.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The produce cooler contains spoiled produce. Cucumbers covered with white mold spots, deteriorating broccoli
with dark spots, softening tomatoes, brown and discoloring pears and apples along with other spoiling produce were
all present in the produce cooler. Spoiled produce must be removed promptly to prevent contamination of food
intended to be fed to the animals. Sort and remove spoiled produce promptly. This cooler needs to be cleaned and
have spoiled and deteriorating items removed in order to prevent contamination of food items that will be fed to the
animals.
The produce sorting area of the produce cooler contained two gallons of bleach placed on top of a pail of food
intended to be fed to the bears. Some brown liquid could be seen on top of the lid to this pail. Chemicals stored
directly on top of food items are a hazard to animal consuming these food items. Accidental contamination of food
items could lead to serious injury to the animals ingesting them. Bleach can cause severe injury if ingested.
Chemicals must not be stored in the produce cooler. Remove all chemicals from the produce cooler.
The meat cooler had a horrible ammonia like odor mixed with the odor of rotten and decaying meat. This odor
makes it very hard to determine if the meat items stored in this cooler are fit for animal consumption. Clean the
cooler, identify the source of the odor and eliminate it.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food receptacle box for the enclosure housing two housing two Asian black bears contained a large amount of
rotting food debris. Any food fed in these areas is going to be contaminated by the rotting material present. Thesefeeders need to be cleaned and made sanitary to ensure that the food fed to the bears is wholesome and free from
bacterial or pest infestation which could result in health issues for the bears.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was excessive feces in the enclosures housing the tigers, Xena, Sher Kahn and Sundar. The Asian black
bear enclosure contained excessive fecal material. The enclosure housing three alpacas contained excessive fecal
material. Excessive fecal material was also present in the shelter for this enclosure. The lama enclosure contained
excessive fecal material. The shelter for the cougar enclosure contained a large amount of rotting food waste.
These enclosures need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis. Uneaten food must be removed in a timely
fashion. Rotting food debris can contaminate the animal enclosures. The fecal material and rotting food present in
these animals'(cid:25) enclosures can contaminate these animals as they lay in their enclosures. The animals can ingest
this material when they groom themselves. Ingesting this fecal and rotting meat material can lead to potential
health problems. Clean these enclosures more frequently to prevent a buildup of fecal material and rotting food
waste to minimize odors and prevent potential health problems.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The alleyway leading to the butcher area as well as the buildings along this alleyway are filled with various trash,
debris, fencing, pipe and old equipment. The building next to the butcher area is also filled with various debris, old
equipment, boards, trash, buckets, tires and fencing. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other
pests. Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Rodent feces was noted at the facility. Mouse
feces was seen in the warm room area. All this material must be removed to help control the rodent infestation of
this property.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Rodent holes were noted in the service area and an
animal enclosure located on leopard row. Rodent holes were noted outside the shelter area for the tiger JJ's
enclosure. Numerous rodent holes were seen near the white tiger and Asian black bear enclosures. Rodent feces
was seen near the white tiger enclosure. Rodent holes were seen going under the den for the cougar enclosure. A
rodent hole was also seen inside the den area for the cougar enclosure. Mouse feces was seen by the inspectors in
the warm room. Rodents can be carriers of disease which may be harmful to the animals housed in these areas.
A more effective means of pest control must be established for the facility.
3.132 REPEATEMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. The president of the facility stated to
APHIS inspectors that there was no formalized scheduling of workers at the facility. A lack of properly trained
employees can result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Animal numbers
must be reduced or more properly trained workers need to be added. Workers need to be trained in the basic
needs of the animals at the facility. Topics should include at a minimum: the importance of adequate water, the
need for adequate bedding during times of extreme weather, the importance of cleaning and good housekeeping
procedures, proper diet for different species of animals and observation of animals for abnormal conditions and
behaviors. This training should be done in conjunction with the attending veterinarian or his designee. A list of
topics covered and attendees must be documented for review by APHIS. A facility schedule needs to be developed
that allows for adequate employee coverage in order to address all animal husbandry needs. Also the facility
president is the only one authorized to work with the dangerous animals at the facility. All animal work must be
done with the dangerous animals under his direct supervision. This limits the amount of time that is available to
service the dangerous animal enclosures as the facility president is often offsite. This leads to poor sanitation in the
dangerous animal enclosures. The facility president needs to find a way to be onsite more or hire trained staff to
help run the facility.
This inspection was conducted with the facility president on 12-16-14. An exit interview was conducted at that time
and all non-compliant items were explained to the president. APHIS expectations regarding the goat were made
clear to the facility president at that time. The president stated that the goat would be seen by the facility attending
veterinarian by the close of business on 12-19-14. A formal exit interview was conducted with the facility president
on 12-18-14.
