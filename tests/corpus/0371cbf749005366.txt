ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1020 on
14-Jun-18.
I arrived at the facility at 10:20am. I knocked on the door and the owner's wife answered. She stated that the owner
was away from the home. I stated that I would be in the area all day and asked if he would be back later in the day.
She answered that he would be gone until late evening, outside of inspection hours, and that she had nothing the
do with the business. I left my business card.
