Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility does not have an attending veterinarian nor a written program of veterinary care. Each dealer or exhibitor
shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that includes having appropriate facilities, personnel,
equipment, and services to comply with the regulations; appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat
diseases and injuries, including emergency and weekend care; daily observation of all animals to assess their health and
well-being; guidance by the attending veterinarian to personnel in animal care and use techniques, including the use of
pain relieving drugs and euthanasia; and adequate pre-procedural and post-procedural care. An attending veterinarian
and a written program of veterinary care are vital to ensure health needs of animals are addressed.
