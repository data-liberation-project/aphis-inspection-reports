2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***I arrived at the facility at 5:00 pm. I called the partner and left a message that I was at the facility to conduct an
inspection. Someone at the facility stated he was unavailable at the time. I waited in the area until 6:00 pm and
called the partner letting him know that I had to leave and that this visit would be an attempted inspection. Before I
left I checked to see if anyone was available and no one was able. I left the premises at 6:15 pm. A responsible
adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:00 pm on 07/14/2014. A
responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
