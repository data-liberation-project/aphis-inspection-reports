2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) does not address any of the animals other than the dogs. Licensees'
with part time attending veterinarians must have a formal written arrangement with a veterinarian (PVC) that
addresses the preventive care for all regulated species. This is required so that USDA personnel can confirm that
the licensee is working with a knowledgeable veterinarian and is following the recommendations from that
veterinarian.
A program of veterinary care needs to be developed by the attending veterinarian that addresses all regulated
species owned/exhibited by this licensee .
Topics that should be covered in the PVC include:
*The veterinarian's schedule for visits to the facility.
*Parasite control program specific for each species.
*Vaccination recommendations specific for each species.
*Instructions on necropsies for unexpected deaths.
*Diets appropriate for each species
*Chronic health issues for any specific animals including required hoof trims and dental issues.
*Any other medical/husbandry recommendations the veterinarian feels necessary for this facility.
*Emergency contact information.
The PVC must be signed and dated by the attending veterinarian. This document must indicate to USDA
representatives that the licensee and the veterinarian have an active working relationship.

2.131(c)(1)HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An approximately 6 to 7 month old liger is being restrained with a dog harness and leash during public exhibition. At
this age and size the liger is too big and strong to be adequately restrained by only a dog harness and leash. If the
liger was determined to reach someone or something in the audience there is a strong possibility that the snap on
the leash or the harness could fail. A dog leash and harness are not meant to restrain a liger.
During public exhibition animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public.
An exotic felid of this size could seriously injure a child or an adult if it were to gain access to the public.
