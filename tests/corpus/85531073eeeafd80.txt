SANITATION.
The four indoor bear shelters have an accumulation of old feces that has become greyish in color. The licensee
informed the inspector that the feces have not been cleaned out in a week. Excreta should be removed as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained and reduce disease hazards and odors. The cleaning
schedule of the four enclosures should be more timely and effective to prevent the build-up of excreta.
