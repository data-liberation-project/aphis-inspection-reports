ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****An adult male English Bulldog named "Larry" (MC ID# 4C2A58392D) was sitting in his shelter and was reluctant
to come out even with verbal encouragement from the licensee and inspectors. The licensee stated that this dog
had escaped his enclosure and was found limping. The dog finally got to his feet with some effort and had a severe
limp on his left rear leg as he walked. As much as possible, he did not use the leg as he walked. When standing he
would frequently put just his toes on the ground to balance himself to avoid having to put his full weight on that leg.
Despite the severity of the lameness, the licensee stated that she intended to just observe the dog and take it to a
veterinarian only if it did not improve by the following week.
****A weaned English Bulldog puppy MC ID#0A02593273 had intermittent coughing and wheezing. This puppy had
been removed from the heated whelping building the previous week and put into an outdoor enclosure without any
bedding even though the ambient temperatures had fallen below 50 degreesF during the day and below 40
degreesF at night during this time period.
Untreated leg conditions can be painful and can worsen with time. Untreated respiratory problems can be painful,
can worsen with time, and may be contagious to other dogs. The licensee must have these dogs treated and
examined by a veterinarian, must follow the treatment recommendations, and must provide written documentation
of vet care and treatment to inspectors upon request. NOTE: The licensee returned the English Bulldog puppy to
the heated whelping building during the inspection.
2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There was a black, female Pug born on 7/24/2015, also listed in the previous inspection report that did not have
official identification. Proper identification of each animal is needed for record keeping and animal traceability. The
licensee shall ensure each animal at the facility is officially identified.3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Seven of the outdoor shelter structures had little or no bedding. The outdoor temperature at the time of the
inspection was 47.8 degrees F and the National Weather Service recorded the temperature as low as 37 degrees F
that morning. A female English Bulldog puppy MC ID# 0A02593273 and a black, female Pug puppy with no official
identification had been moved from the climate controlled whelping building to an outdoor enclosure three days
prior. The licensee had not provided bedding in their dog house. The English Bulldog puppy (also listed under
2.40b2) had abnormal breathing sounds and coughed repetitively, which could be the result of illness due to lack of
acclimation to cold temperatures in conjunction with a shelter that did not have suitable bedding to help keep the
puppy warm. Sufficient bedding is needed to help the animals maintain their body temperature. The licensee shall
supply clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees F and additional clean, dry
bedding when the temperature is 35 degrees F or lower. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 3/25/16
Note: At the inspectors request (forecasted low temp 30 degrees F) the licensee and staff returned the Bulldog
puppy to the climate controlled facility until its condition could be accessed by a veterinarian and provided bedding
in all of the dog houses.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The plastic dog house in the female, adult English Bulldog's enclosure named "JD" had sharp, pointed screws that
protruded upwards from the base plate edge surrounding the outside of the house. It appeared that the screws had
been used to secure the floor of the dog house to the top. The sharp points of the screws are at ground level and
easily accessed by the dog." (cid:28)JD(cid:29)" had a small wound on her front right leg that may have been caused by one of
the screws. The licensee shall ensure that all primary enclosures are constructed so that they do not have sharp
points or edges that could injure the dogs. TO BE CORRECTED BY:3/25/2016
