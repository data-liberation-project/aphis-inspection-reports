2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On Tuesday August 19th, 2014 two inspectors from USDA/AC attended the 6pm 'Tiger Playtime' at the facility.
During this encounter up to 30 members of the public are allowed to sit in an area surrounded by fence panels
under a tent where two tiger cubs (said to be 14 weeks of age and approximately 25-30lbs) were let into the room to
interact freely with the adults and children present. During the show, the licensee was in the area for the first part of
the event with one assistant. When the Licensee left, another assistant entered the area. Before the release of the
white tiger into the room, the licensee aggravated the tiger by grabbing her by the scruff and bouncing her up and
down on his lap and ground while the tiger hissed, growled, and bit at his glove covered hands. The tiger's ears
were pinned to the side of its head during that part of the encounter and was not acting in a relaxed manner. As
described by the Licensee, the tiger was "pissed off". While the tiger was agitated, the licensee dropped the tiger in
the lap of the unsuspecting member of the public sitting next to him. The tiger jumped off this man's lap with its ears
still pinned to its head. The tiger then walked away and flopped onto the floor. At this time the tiger's ears returned
to a normal un-agitated position and another tiger was released into the room. The tigers walked, played, and
jumped around on many members of the public. People were lying down next to them, petting them and taking
photos with them during the length of the event.
There were three incidents where members of the public were scratched or bitten during the play time. One older
female was pawed and mouthed in the face by the white tiger. A young boy (estimated to be approximately 10yrs
old) was bitten on the top of his thigh. The child did yell out, pushed the tiger off of his leg, and crawled away
rubbing his thigh. One of the assistants asked him if his leg was still 'attached' and teased him about his leg being
chewed like a drumstick. The boy continued to pet and play with the tiger. Another bite was to the back of one of the
inspectors, which resulted in broken skin and bleeding. Another young boy was approached from behind by the tiger
where it grabbed both sides of his head at the ears and mouthed the top of his head. In another encounter a tiger
was lying across the back of a female lying on the floor while chewing and pulling on the hair of another woman
sitting next to them.
There were several instances where members of the public would rile up the tigers by rough housing with them, or
shaking their heads by gripping their faces, and when the tigers would respond in play by swatting with their claws
or biting their hands, multiple people responded by 'swatting' the tigers in the face, nose and eye area, or pryingtheir mouth off of their hands or arms with their free hand. There were several instances where the tigers would leap
on top of people lying down, or jump up onto the hips and lower backs of a standing person. Due to the weight and
size of the tigers, the teeth and claws could cause damage and several members of the public did say "Owe or
ouch" during the play time as the tigers swatted, jumped and mouthed the people.
While the tigers are young and at play with members of the public, the current procedure of letting the tigers walk
freely among so many people with no direct control by the keepers in the area provides an immediate opportunity
for injury to the public by the tigers' sharp claws and teeth. There is also a risk to the tigers due to members of the
public providing a 'discipline' response by swatting, pushing or prying off of their mouths. This action by untrained
members of the public teaches and encourages the tigers to become more aggressive in their play and may result
in the tigers becoming more unruly and unresponsive to discipline. Interactions between the tigers and public could
be managed in a controlled manner under the guidance of a trained keeper, but was not observed by inspectors
during the Tiger playtime they attended. Free roaming contact and unregulated discipline given by the public
provides opportunity for an injury to an animal or the public before control of the situation could be gained by a
trained keeper.
After the "Tiger Playtime" at 7pm there was a show with multiple animals where the public was given the opportunity
to see and handle other species. The licensee had many of the animals leashed and talked about them while the
public observed. On one occasion a capuchin monkey was tossed onto the lap of a man next to the inspector. The
monkey was on a long leash and was swung from the belt that was around its hips and tossed approximately 6 ft
onto the man's lap. Another monkey was twirled around the licensee by it's belt and leash. The lemur was allowed
to jump onto people causing surprise reactions by the public. A young coati was allowed to roam free across
people's laps, and a young kangaroo was allowed to roam free in the event area. The public was allowed to hand
feed many of the animals.
Animals may be injured or harmed when interaction with the public is free and uncontrolled. There needs to be more
control of the environment and animals when they come in contact with the public. All animals must be handled so
there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public during exhibition, with sufficient distance and/or barriers
between the animal and the general public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.
3.3(e)(1) REPEAT
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The issue with unsealed wood continues with the three domestic dog-hybrids (three wolf-dog hybrid and two
coyote-dog hybrids) that continue to be housed in a sheltered enclosure towards the bear enclosure. The sheltered
portion of the primary enclosure housing these dogs is constructed of unsealed wood which is not impervious to
water with support posts that have been chewed. The dirt floors under the sheltered portion of the enclosure do not
have access to direct sunlight and can not be sanitized. Walls and flooring constructed of unsealed wood and dirt which are permeable to moisture provide an optimal area
for bacterial and fungal growth both of which can cause disease in the dogs housed in these enclosures. Ultimately
the failure to construct dog enclosures out of surfaces that are impervious to moisture results in an inability to
properly clean and sanitize the primary enclosures and creates an increased risk of disease and illness.
The new enclosures are still being scheduled for completion that will house all wolf-dog and wolf-coyote hybrids
according to AWA standards and regulations. The licensee advised that the current enclosures will remain as is until
the animals are moved to the new enclosures. Failure to follow through with the planned repairs or new buildings
that meet the AWA standards and regulations will cause the animals to continue to be housed in a structure that is
not impervious to moisture and can not be sanitized due to chewed wood or unsealed cement.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the 2 enclosures that house five dogs (three wolf-dog hybrid and two coyote-dog hybrids) are housed in a
sheltered primary enclosure towards the bears continue to have an accumulation of more than 2 days of fecal
material and hair. The accumulated debris is evidence that current cleaning and sanitation protocols are
inadequate to prevent their accumulation. Cleaning is still not being done at a rate to decrease accumulation of
excreta, urine soaked areas or food waste. The meat that was put into the enclosure had an accumulation of fly
eggs due to the heat and moisture over the past 2 days, and has not been eaten or the left over waste removed.
Accumulated organic debris provides an optimal area for the growth of bacterial and fungal pathogens creating a
disease hazard for the dogs. Additionally, this accumulated debris can attract pests including flies and vermin as
well as contributes to odors within the facility.
The licensee must increase cleaning of fecal material to be as often as necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt,
debris, excreta and food waste and sanitizing at least once every two weeks.
3.125 REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are 3 original enclosures from the last inspection that are still in violation due to fencing being less than 12
feet high, as construction of the new enclosures are still in the planning process. The three large felid enclosures
contain a total of 2 Tigers and 2 Lion and 1 dog.
The remaining three affected enclosures that need correction are:
Tiger Pen 4: contains one Tiger referred to as Nahandi Tiger Pen 5: contains one Tiger referred to as Glacier and one lion known Ungowwa
Lion Pen 1: contains one male lion referred to as Cheif and Bandit(dog)
None of these remaining pens have any angled top fencing (kick-in) or any species appropriate high tensile smooth
electrical wire to provide additional deterrents for escape.
In the Bear enclosure (four adult bears) with the pond, there were still several broken pieces of a wooden walkway
along the fence with protruding nails(1-2inches) that was moved from the worn pathway into the grass along side of
it. The bear pacing near the fence was avoiding the grass area where the wood with nails way lying, however it still
poses a potential for injury as now the nails are not as well seen by the animals.
Exposed nails and broken pieces of wood can be sources of injury and infection if the regulated animals scratch or
puncture themselves on the materials.
The reported enclosures(Tiger 4,5 and Lion 1) need to be built according to standards and regulation as currently
they are not tall enough to properly contain the animals as these adult tigers could easily jump/climb out of the
enclosure if they were motivated to do so. An escape places the animal's life in jeopardy and may endanger the
safety of the public.
All broken pieces of wooden material with exposed nails in the enclosure shall be removed and/or repaired to
prevent any injuries to the regulated animals.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
There were still several Tiger water pools (enclosures' 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 ) that were green with algae, including the
bear pond with (4 bears), 2 cougars and the 1 lion and dog(Bandit). The water pools had floating clumps of algae in
some areas or a coating of algae on the bottom or sides of the metal tubs/pools. The black leopard had green
floating algae in his water tank that has not been cleaned in 6-8 days. The 8 foxes, 1 cougar and 2 porcupines had
floating algae on all of their water buckets.
Algae buildup can cause the water to be a source of harmful organisms that can be toxic to the animal and cause
possible health issues. The buildup of algae can cause skin disorders and is not a suitable drinking source.
The licensee must clean the water pools and water drinking sources as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of
algae.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted with the licensee and his wife.By the licensee signing this document, it is not an admission of guilt but serves to only reflect the licensees' receipt
of the report and exit interview.
