ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30am on
03/02/2016. During that time, the inspector spoke with the Licensee's family member, who indicated the Licensee
was away from the property at the time and that there would not be someone available until after 5pm. A business
card was left with the Licensee's family member with a request for Licensee to call and establish current hours of
availability.
