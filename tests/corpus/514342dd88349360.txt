2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** In sheltered building #2 there was an Albon/Flagyl (Sulfadimethoxine/Metronidazole), mixture of medication
past the labeled expiration date of 3/2015. This medication was intermingled with other products that are currently
being used at the facility and is therefore ready for use. Expired drugs may not work as anticipated, could become
contaminated, and could harm the animals. The applicant must ensure that all medications used in the facility are
not expired, labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices, and are stored in accordance with
manufacturer's recommendations.
**** Another medication in building #2 was not labeled appropriately. A viscous, cloudy, pink-colored liquid in an
glass amber-colored bottle was not labeled, and it was not associated with a bottle of medication.
- - These medications were intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are
therefore ready for use. Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure
that the contents of the container can be known with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses, and that
medications are not used past their expiration dates. As part of the program of adequate veterinary care, the
licensee must ensure that all medications are labeled with the contents (name and concentration of drug), dosing
instructions (specific for the species of animal being treated), and expiration date. The applicant must ensure that
appropriate methods of veterinary care are used at all times.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**** There was an accumulation of waste (hair/feces) on the metal flooring beneath the dogs in the outdoor #4
enclosures on the west end of the facility. The waste was covering 30-40% of the surface area coming in contact
with the dogs. There were several enclosures with piles or mounds of feces covering as much as a two foot by two
foot square. The licensee needs to ensure that the hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact be
spot-cleaned daily to prevent the accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. **** There was also an accumulation of waste (hair/feces) on the dirt flooring in the Barn building housing 91 dogs.
Each enclosure had dried and packed feces/hair covering 30-40% of the surface area coming in contact with the
dogs. This excessive accumulation can lead to disease hazards, odors, pests, or vermin infestation. The licensee
must ensure that floors made of dirt be raked or spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the
freedom to avoid contact with excreta.

3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**** There was a mixture of water, mud and animal waste collecting next to and under the outdoor portion of the
sheltered elevated enclosures in building #5 housing over 100 dogs. There was a mixture of water and animal
waste collecting on the ground next to and around the PVC pipes that were supposed to be taking the feces and
fluid to a nearby septic tank. It appeared as though these two PVC pipes were clogged and the animal waste,
water, and fluids were pooling and accumulating around the pipes. The pipe on the northeast side had a foot of
sewage pooling around it and the pipe on the northwest side had two feet of liquid sewage accumulating around it.
In addition, an excessive number of flies were observed in and around the affected area.
**** Also, in building #6, a wash down/fecal waste drainage pipe was allowed to empty directly under the outdoor
attached runs of another enclosure. The licensee stated that when they rebuilt the outdoor portion of the enclosures
they were built past the washdowns allowing the material to accumulate on the ground. There was a strong fecal
odor when standing between the two buildings. The wash down designed to catch the feces and waste wasn't
constructed in a manner that allowed it to prevent the feces, water, and urine from running onto the ground under
the lower portion of outdoor runs.
- - Each of these create potential unsanitary conditions and could lead to potential disease, contamination, or health
risks. Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease
hazards. All drains must be properly constructed, installed, and maintained. The licensee must provide for regular
and frequent removal of animal waste, water, and other fluids for the health and well-being of the dogs and in a
manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks.To be corrected by: 5-15-2015.
3.6(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**** In building #5 the last enclosure at the north end on the bottom row had an 8x8 inch opening in the wire. This
opening had 4 sharp points present pointing inward towards the four Poodles enclosed. Also, on the same row of
enclosures, at the middle section there is an enclosure with broken wires and numerous sharp points present above
the door on the outside west bank of the enclosure. All animals must be securely contained in the enclosure and the
licensee must ensure that the enclosures have no sharp edges or points that could injure the dogs at all times. The
sharp wire points were removed and the 8X8 opening was closed at the time of the inspection.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
**** There was an excessive accumulation of waste (hair/feces) on the ground below the outdoor #4 enclosures on
the south end of the facility. The mounds/piles of feces and hair were approximately one foot deep. There were a
number of flies present and a significant odor observed when near the enclosures. The licensee stated that the
enclosures get pulled out and cleaned under every six months. This excessive accumulation of waste can increase
disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors. The licensee must ensure that the excreta and food waste be removed
from under the primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food
waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors. That cleanliness
must be maintained at all times throughout the facility.

Inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative, a USDA APHIS AC VMO, and a USDA
APHIS AC ACI.
