- A female Patas monkey has a circular dark, hairless lesion around the tail at approximately the midpoint of the tail.
There is dark staining on the tail below this lesion, and the lesion itself appears to be inflamed and crusted with
debris. This type of problem could be the result of a strangulating foreign body, trauma, infection, or other cause.
The licensee had not noticed this lesion, and stated that it was not present the day before the inspection.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian within 24 hours, and treated in an
appropriate method.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- An indoor cage housing three red coatimundis has a wire floor with no solid part. The enclosed animals are at risk
of having their feet pass through the wire slats, and potentially being trapped or injured. The animals need to have
a solid floor to help protect them from injury. The facility must either install a solid floor in the pen, or move the
animals to an appropriate enclosure.

- In an enclosure housing three mountain coatimundis, there were multiple exposed sharp points on the inner
surface of the wooden shelter door. There were also exposed screws in the wall of the enclosure within reach of
the animals. Sharp points are a potential source of injury to the animals. The facility must remove these points.
