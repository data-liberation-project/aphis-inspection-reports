2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30 pm on
09-Mar-17.
No one was home at the facility today. I spoke to Licensee via telephone. He is unavailable today and does not
have a set schedule. He will send hours of availability weekly or as needed. Approximately three four hour blocks
of available time are necessary during daylight hours each week to facilitate inspection.
Additional Inspectors
Nanney Rebecca, Veterinary Medical Officer
