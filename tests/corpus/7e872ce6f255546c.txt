2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The inspectors could not determine if daily observation and monitoring of animal health was being accomplished for
all animals. The documentation for observing and monitoring the daily health and well-being of the animals was not
complete. The records were kept in different places depending on the status of the animals. There are multiple
pages with no entries on the off study animals. Also, the records for animals being treated were not complete.
There were entries in the drug log book with the animal identification, drug administered, and dosage and route
annotated. But in many cases, the presenting signs, diagnostic tests performed, diagnosis, prognosis, and/or
resolution of these animals were not annotated. Daily observation of all the animals to assess their well-being and
direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding health issues is necessary to ensure
that the animals receive timely and adequate veterinary care. A more detailed system should be in place to ensure
that all animals are observed daily, that ill or injured animals receive veterinary care, and the attending veterinarian
is notified when necessary.

2.131(b)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Earlier this month, 32 quail chicks were found dead. The room housing the chicks was over 130 degrees
Fahrenheit. The morning entry on the room log indicated the chicks were cold and that the thermostat was
adjusted to 80 degrees Fahrenheit at that time. There was a system failure which resulted in the room overheating.
Excessively high ambient temperatures can cause hyperthermia, pain, suffering, and death. Handling of all animals
shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating,
excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Many facilities use a monitoring
system to notify the facility staff if the room temperature exceeds an acceptable temperature. The remaining chicks
were moved to a different building.
To be corrected from this date forward.Additional Inspectors
