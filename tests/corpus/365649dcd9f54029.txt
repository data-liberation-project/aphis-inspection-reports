2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On August 13th, 2020, a pig was being prepped for use in a protocol. The pig was in the catch shoot for a prolonged
amount of time, became stressed, and it escaped the outdoor enclosure before it could be medicated for sedation. After
multiple failed attempts to catch it, the decision was made to euthanize the pig by gunshot. The prolonged time in the
squeeze shoot caused the pig significant behavioral stress and led to its eventual untimely death. While the pig was
intended for a non-recovery procedure, the early euthanasia reduced its value to the study. Handling of all animals must
be done as quickly and carefully as possible so as not to cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary
discomfort. The registrant has already consulted with their attending veterinarian and made appropriate changes to their
housing and handling SOPs to prevent a future recurrence.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
