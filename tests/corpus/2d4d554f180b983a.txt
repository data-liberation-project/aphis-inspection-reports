pests access to the area. The slatted floor has an accumulation of old spilled food and other debris between the
slats. It is important to have the food container clean and in good working order to maintain wholesome food and to
keep pests out. This is necessary for health and wellbeing of the animals.

SANITATION.
Section 3.131(c) Sanitation: The kitchen floor has had water damage to the subfloor from a leaking refrigerator and
mopping. The floor has several weak, and soft spots in front of the refrigerators. The areas have been duct taped to
reinforce the floor.
The underlying press board material gets damp when the floor is mopped. This has resulted hairline cracks on the
edges of the squares of vinyl tile. The larger areas (where the tiles have lost their integrity) have had duct tape
applied. There are six areas with the duct tape.
It is important to have the floor in the kitchen is good repair. It is important to be able to sanitize it for the health and
wellbeing of the animals. It may become a safety hazard as the floor weakens in front of the refrigerators. The
refrigerator leak has already been repaired.
To be corrected by February 28, 2015. This is a major repair and some thought will need to go into this repair
project.
