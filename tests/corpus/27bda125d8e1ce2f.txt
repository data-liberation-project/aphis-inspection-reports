OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At time of inspection there is an outdoor enclosure that is housing one large dog. This shelter structure is not large
enough for the dog in the enclosure to be provided with a shelter that allows them to sit, stand, lie and turn freely in
a normal manner. Sheltered housing that does not allow the dog the ability to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner
or turnabout freely because the housing is too small for the dog to fit in can be stressful causing discomfort for the
dog. Dogs not having access to size appropriate housing that will provide protection from direct effects of wind,
rain or snow could affect the ability of the dog to conserve body heat. Adequate housing large enough to provide
shelter is necessary to ensure the health & well-being of all dogs. To be corrected by 02-30-16.
An exit briefing was conducted with Cathy Niebruegge, ACI and facility representative.
