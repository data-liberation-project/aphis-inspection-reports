ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Newberg store had medications in the refrigerator and cabinet that were prescribed for animals no longer at the
facility. There was also a dispensing-sized bottle of pyrantel labeled for use in humans. There were no written
instructions from the Attending Veterinarian for its off-label use in animals at the store.
The Wilsonville store has a bottle of Panacur labeled for cattle. There were no written instructions from the
Attending Veterinarian for its off-label use in animals at the store.
All medications must be either labeled for use in the animals they will be used for, or must have detailed written
instructions from the Attending Veterinarian on their use.
Correct from this point forward by only using medications labeled for use in the intended species, or with the
Attending Veterinarian's proper, complete instructions for off-label use.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the Wilsonville store, the wall above an enclosure where two boxer pups were housed (although they were at the
vet at the time of inspection) has a hole chewed through the paint into the drywall. A puppy enclosure at the
Newberg store has similar damage, but there were no puppies at the store at the time of inspection. The raw drywall
is not able to be cleaned or sanitized, and the consumption of paint and drywall can be dangerous to the puppies.
Correct by repairing the walls before pups are housed in those enclosures, and then ensuring from now on that
puppies housed in the enclosures by the walls cannot reach the walls to chew on them.
This inspections of each location and exit interviews were conducted with facility personnel at each.
