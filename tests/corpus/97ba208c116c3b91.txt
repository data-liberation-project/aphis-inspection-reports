The premise, of the area containing the enclosures for the tigers, has grown up weeds and grass, with cluttered
areas
of equipment which is used for the tigers. The weeds and grass has grown up, around, and through, the equipment
and fencing surrounding the tiger area. This unkept state creates living and breeding areas for pest and vermin, and
presents a possible health problem for the tigers. The grass, weeds, and clutter, needs to be controlled or removed
to
reduce health hazards for the animals.
To be corrected by August 12th, 2014.
