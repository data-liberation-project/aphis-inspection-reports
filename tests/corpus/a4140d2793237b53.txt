FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Drainage.
1. The water receptacles for 2 of the outdoor pens are located just inside the pens' fence along the edge of the mud
wallow. The pigs must stand in the watery mud in order to access the receptacles to drink water. Standing in a wet
environment can result in foot and/or hoof problems in the animals. This item affects 21 pigs.
Per this Section of the Regulations, excess water should be eliminated from outdoor facilities to provide adequate
drainage. The water receptacles should be moved to a different area of the pens that has dry ground to prevent any
discomfort of the animals.
