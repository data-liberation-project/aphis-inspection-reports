2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The camel has large patches of hair loss on both sides of his hump. The caretaker said he is eating the hair.
Approximately 6 of the 14 tigers appear tender/sore on front legs when walking. Several have a history of arthritis
but are currently not recieving any medication or treatment. At time of the inspection, a female tiger , China , ( In 1st
enclosure ) appears very lame on both front legs . Another tiger, Dolly ( in 2nd enclosure ) is also lame and holds
her right front leg up when walking . She was diagnosed by xray last year as having severe arthritis in her shoulder
but is not recieving any medication or treatment for the condition. The male wolf in the last wolf enclosure is very
slow to stand up from laying down and walks very slowly. At one time, he was treated with a joint supplement but
will not eat the medication .
These animals need to be examined by a veterinarian to determine the most appropriate treatment. Prescribed
treatments must be carefully followed to ensure these animals are provided with proper veterinary care .
( The attending veterinarian was contacted during the inspection for an appointment. )
