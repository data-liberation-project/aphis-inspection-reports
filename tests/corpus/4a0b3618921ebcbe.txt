HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.75 (c)(1) Surfaces. General requirements. In the Monkey/Bear House building inside the indoor holding area for
3 ringtail lemurs the two elevated den boxes have paint that is peeled off leaving exposed wood. The exposed
wood is not impervious to moisture and does not allow the surfaces to be properly cleaned and sanitized.
Maintain all surfaces of the housing facility so that they can be readily cleaned and sanitized or replaced when worn
or soiled.
