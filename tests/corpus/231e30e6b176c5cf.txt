ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Clementine, a Scottish Highlander cow, and Prince, a white male llama, have overgrown hooves and nails.
Overgrown hooves and nails to this extent can cause discomfort to the animal and the misalignment it causes can
contribute to degenerative joint disease. Animals that have progressed to the point of anatomical distortion need
frequent corrective trimming to get and maintain them as close to normal as is possible.

2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) has not been updated recently, and the new animal care personnel were
unaware of the contents of the PVC and of veterinarian's instructions for a recently diagnosed and treated animal
(Clementine).
The PVC needs to be kept current with detailed husbandry information, and the animal care staff needs to be
familiar with its contents in order to follow the Program. Documentation of prescribed treatments is recommended to
prove that the PVC is being followed.
