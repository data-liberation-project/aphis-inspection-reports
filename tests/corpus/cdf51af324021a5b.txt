3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In three enclosures, containing a total of at least three dogs, there are mouse feces located around the food bowls
which contain dog food. The licensee currently has no pest control for mice in place. The presence of mice within
the dog enclosures could cause contamination of the food and the health of the dogs could suffer.
An effective program for the control of pests including parasites, insects, birds, and mice must be established and
maintained. The licensee must establish a program for the control of the mice in order to eliminate the potential
food contamination and to promote the health and well-being of the dogs.
A verbal correction date of November 08, 2016 was given at the time of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
