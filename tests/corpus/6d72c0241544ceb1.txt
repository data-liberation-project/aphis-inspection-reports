Housing facilities, general.
*** Currently chemicals and cleaning agents are stored on the top shelf of a unit adjacent to two bins of fruit with no lids.
The placement of this shelf also places the chemicals over the bottom shelf where fruit is cut and put into bowls for the
lemurs. Chemicals must not be stored in food storage and preparation areas where they could cause potential
contamination to the food items through a spill. Additionally food bowls with fruit were left out on the table and had fruit
flies around the food items. These refrigerated food should be stored in a manner that prevents deterioration of its
nutritive value for the health of the animals.
