3.75(c)(1) CRITICAL
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On January 26, 2016 a young female macaque was found dead in the outdoor portion of her enclosure. This animal
had its head entrapped in a ball which was used for enrichment in the animal's enclosure. The ball was described
by the facility as having a hole chewed into it sufficient to allow the entire head of the animal to become entrapped
with only the mandible of the jaw exposed. This animal died at some time between the PM and AM animal checks.
The necropsy of the animal was not conclusive and the facility determined that the likely cause of death was
prolonged exposure to the cold in combination with the stress of not being able to remove her head from the ball.
At the time of the inspection today the inspectors noted a few badly worn enrichment items. A couple of these
items had holes in them. One enrichment item in particular known as a "pill" had a hole in it large enough for a
juvenile macaque to stick its head into. This enrichment item has worn to the point that it is potentially hazardous to
animals in the enclosure in which it is being used. Furniture type fixtures or objects must be sturdily constructed
and strong enough to provide for the safe activity and welfare of the animals in the enclosure. When excessively
worn these items must be removed from the enclosure in order to minimize the risk of head or other limb
entrapment.
Corrected at the time of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with various Johns Hopkins University personnel.
