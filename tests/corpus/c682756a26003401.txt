FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***There is no shelter from rain or cold provided for the pigs or for the capybara. A shelter must be provided for
protection against inclement weather. As the season is changing the temperatures are now dropping into the low
50's at night the pigs and capybara will require a shelter that will protect them from the wind and cold as well as the
rain thereby protecting them from discomfort.
***The house provided for the african porcupine is in disrepair. The wood has become worn and chewed at the
entrance leaving the boards loose, weakened, and splintered which may allow the porcupine to become injured.
The house shall be repaired or replaced.
