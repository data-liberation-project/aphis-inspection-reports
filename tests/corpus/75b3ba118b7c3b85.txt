Handling of animals.
Due to ongoing construction, the public barrier is not complete near one corner of the bear enclosure. There is a single
rope strung across the unfinished opening. At the time of inspection, one end of the rope was slid near the enclosure
support so that the public could touch the enclosure on both sides of that support. Insufficient public barriers do not
adequately ensure the safety of the animals and the public. The licensee must ensure that during public exhibition, there
is sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of
animals and the public. To be corrected by 15 May 2021.
3.75(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
There are multiple surfaces in the indoor portion of the macaque enclosure that are not being maintained so that they are
able to be cleaned and sanitized. There are multiple areas of peeling and flaking paint on the walls. Most of the flaking
paint is along the bottoms of the walls. There is deteriorated metal leaving holes in the door insert. There is deteriorating,
flaking metal under one resting surface support structure. There are areas of rust on the expanded metal enclosure wall.
Flaking paint, deteriorating metal, and rust show that the surfaces are not being maintained so that they are readily
cleaned and sanitized which can play a role in disease transmission. The facility must ensure that surfaces of housing


facilities be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or
removed or replaced when worn or soiled. To be corrected by 15 June 2021.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The wood platform in the enclosure housing 2 bobcats is broken at the base with one support board that is detached from
the rest of the structure. The deterioration of this wood has left nail points exposed. The broken wood base could make
the platform unstable and the exposed nails could cause injury. The licensee must ensure that the facility be constructed
of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities
shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals. To be corrected by 15 May 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
