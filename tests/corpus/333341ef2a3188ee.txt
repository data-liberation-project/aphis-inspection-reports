attending veterinarian. The animal had goopy matter on its left eye and it was red on the white area. The dealer's

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During the last inspection on the block building's eastern and western exterior sides there were twenty-four rusted
enclosure metal divider panels. On the interior of the same building there were twenty-four rusted metal gates.
During this inspection the dealer stated they had painted all enclosure panels and forty-eight gates. However during
this inspection ten of the same enclosure divider panels, despite prior painting, have chipped rusted surfaces which
need to be repaired or replaced and maintained to insure their structural soundness, facilitate housekeeping
pratices, protect the animals from injury and prevent the spread of disease.
Affects twenty-one adults During this inspection on the western side of the block building there was a divider panel of two primary enclosures
which had become disconnected at the bottom and moved when the animals came into contact with it. The divider
panel needs to be repaired or replaced to insure it is secured in place to contain the animals securely and protect
them from injury.
Affects one adult

The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the facility representatives.
