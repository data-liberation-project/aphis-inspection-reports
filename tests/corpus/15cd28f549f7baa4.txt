ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In June 2016, PI staff recognized that a group of nile rats were having an unexpected adverse reaction to a test
compound, which the PI staff attempted to treat. Several days later, the animals had not responded to the
treatment instituted by the PI staff, the Attending Veterinarian was notified of the issue who then treated the nile rats
appropriately. A facility must maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes a mechanism of direct
and frequent communication to the attending veterinarian so that timely information on problems of animal health is
conveyed to the attending veterinarian for the health of the animals. The facility has instituted several corrective
measures to prevent recurrence of this issue.
This item has been addressed by the facility and was self-reported to USDA.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
