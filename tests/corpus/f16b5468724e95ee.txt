ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The white hedgehog had a patch of quill loss on the left side of its back and a small lump behind left ear. The
licensee had noted that the animal had quill loss and attributed it to the geriatric nature of the animal. The licensee
has not communicated these issues to the veterinarian for further guidance. Timely communication with the
attending veterinarian is important so that potential problems can be addressed and mitigated to protect animal
health. This animal should be assessed by the attending veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** There is a coated wire running along the base of the wall at the back of the cavy pen. These animals chew as
part of normal behavior, and chewing through this coating may expose electrical wire which could result in injury.
This wire should be protected from animal access to protect the animals from injury.
*** There is a wooden platform in the cavy pen that acts as a support for the rabbit cage above. This platform is
supported by wooden legs. The edges of these wooden legs have been chewed by the cavies. Continued chewing
by these animals may compromise the structural integrity of the platform, which could result in injury of the cavies or
the rabbit above. These wooden legs should be protected from the animals to ensure it is maintained in good repair
to protect the animals from injury.
*** There is an exposed electrical outlet on the back wall in the goat pen. Access to this outlet may result in injury to
the animals. This outlet should be covered to protect the animals from injury.
