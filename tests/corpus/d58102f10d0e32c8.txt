CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The primary enclosures of the Olive Baboon, 2 Ring-tailed Lemurs and a Blue Monkey had an large buildup of
brown dirt/grime around the lower walls along the floor of the enclosures as well as some of the wooden framing
along the floor where the food is brought through the fencing. The Olive baboon had a buildup of brown grime on
several areas on the walls 5 to 6 ft high around the perching area high up in the enclosure. There was a buildup of
older food along the wooden framing and diamond mesh fencing and floors that does not appear to be cleaned up
frequently enough to prevent the buildup of dirt/debris and food in accordance to the AWA regulations and
standards.
In the 'Nursery' there is a Vervet monkey and Ring-tailed Lemur enclosures that have a moderate buildup of a thick
brown/black colored dirt/grime along the inside of the cages along the floor area where the wire walls meet, and
along the middle sections of the wire cages. The Vervet Monkey had a moderate buildup of the dirt/grime on the
wires mid way up the enclosure and at the top where there was a wooden section on the top right that appeared
dark brown/black with a buildup of dirt/grime. While the current cleaning/sanitizing is occurring 2 times per week, it
appears that several of the animals may require sanitization/cleaning more often in order to prevent the buildup of
the dirt and grime that is currently produced in those animals enclosures.
The buildup of dirt/grime can be a source of bacteria and possible health hazards for the regulated animals.
All primate enclosures must be spot cleaned daily, including old food and sanitized frequently enough to prevent the
buildup of dirt and grime on all surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals.

3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two remaining enclosures at the facility that are still non-compliant with fencing being less than 12 ft high
with no kick-ins or other means to ensure adequate containment. There are 3 tigers (Male#2 and Male#3) born
9/24/15 and a female (Ellie Mae) born 5/5/15 in one enclosure, next to the second enclosure containing Tacova a
Male tiger also born in 2015.
The licensee must provide an enclosure for big cats that has walls at least 16 ft high if there are no kick-ins or at
least 12 ft high with 3 ft angled ft kick-ins' or other arrangement that is found acceptable according to the AWA
standards and regulations that will provide proper containment of these animals.
There is a section of fencing in the Hyena enclosure that is directly to the right of the metal panel used to cover a
prior hole in the fence. There is a hole approximately 1 ft in diameter with several wires poking into the enclosure
4-5 inches in length. There is a hole under the fence that has been partially blocked with a wooden fence tie on the
outside to prevent the hyenas' from escaping through the hole.
Holes under the fencing and through it can be a possible escape route or provide an area for other animals to gain
entry into the enclosure. The wires poking into the enclosure can be a possible source of injury to the Hyenas if they
continue to chew and pull at the fencing. While there have been multiple repairs to the holes in the fence using the
metal covers, the hyenas seem to be opening up additional holes right next to the end of the repaired section. The
wooden tie is not secured or strong enough in its current state to be an acceptable solution to the hole under the
fence.
The licensee must provide repairs to the holes in the fencing around the hyena enclosure. All holes must be
permanently repaired in a manner that prevents the animals from escaping or other animals from gaining entrance
into the enclosure. The current wooden tie lying on the outside of the hole is not sufficient or properly secured to
prevent escape for a determined hyena or other animal.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative and Dr. Kurt Hammel, VMO, acting
SACS.
The licensee was advised that the report would be sent via certified and regular mail.
