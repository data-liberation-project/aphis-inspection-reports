2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The written program of veterinary care on file states that the attending veterinarian will visit the premises at least annually.
The attending veterinarian has not visited the premises in over a year nor reviewed the written program of veterinary care
on file. Each dealer must employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements which include a written program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises. Failure to have regularly scheduled visits by the attending
veterinary could result in animals not receiving adequate veterinary care. Correct by scheduling a visit by the attending
veterinarian and updating any changes to the written program of veterinary care on file.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 864 adult guinea pigs, 331 weanlings, and
281 newborns were counted today. There were no inventory records for the the number of adults, weanlings, and
newborns for several months. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by
identifying guinea pig additions and losses or decreases in the number of animals born or animals kept for replacement
breeders. The facility must maintain complete records containing the required information which fully and correctly
discloses the number of guinea pigs held, owned, and disposed of including births and deaths.
