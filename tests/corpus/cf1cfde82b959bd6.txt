2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There was no employee present at the time of arrival for inspection. Members of the public were feeding animals
over the fence. No one appeared in the 10-15 minutes before I contacted the assistant manager. A knowledgeable
attendant needs to be present to ensure the safety of the animals and the public.
Correct immediately - ensure that a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant is
present at all times during periods of public contact from now on.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The east-facing shelter area in the enclosure furthest from the highway had a pipe-constructed gate loose and
nearly lying down, leaning against a wall. A second pipe gate with chicken wire added was leaning against the wall.
The chicken wire was loose around some of the edges, resulting in sharp points being exposed within reach of the
animals.
These gates as described in the animals' area pose a risk of inury to the animals. It is important to keep the animal
area clear of items that can entrap a limb or otherwise injure animals housed in the enclosure.
This was corrected at the time of inspection.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility personnel.
