3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
On 12/07/2021, while two animal caretakers were shifting the two Asian small-clawed river otters off exhibit, the cable
used to manipulate the shift door came loose resulting in the door falling down on and injuring the right, front foot of an
adult, male otter, Dale. The animal was immediately taken for veterinary evaluation and care. Per the veterinary
records, the injuries to the right, front foot included: a dislocation of the second digit, a fracture of the fifth digit, and a
laceration on the main pad of the foot. The animal received adequate guidance and follow-up care from their attending
veterinarian. Failure to maintain an animal enclosure in good repair may pose a risk of serious harm or injury to the
animals. The facility identified the cause of the shift door mechanism failure and took immediate corrective action.
Preventative measures and a system of regular checks have been implemented to prevent any future reoccurrence of this
issue. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
to contain the animals. A system of facility repair and maintenance must be in place to ensure the health and well-being
of the animals. Note, the facility self-reported this incident prior to inspection.

Corrected prior to inspection.




Within the indoor, coatimundi enclosure was an approximately 3 ft tall decorative, faux tree stump which had an area
approximately 6 in. long and 2 in. wide with the outer plaster layer completely worn through exposing underlying loose,
foam material. Additionally, on another area of this faux tree stump approximately 4 in. long and 2 in. wide, the outer
plaster-type coating has been scratched/worn or chipped off by the animals causing an under layer of material to be
exposed. Synthetic materials such as loose plaster or foam within reach of the animals may pose a risk of injury to the
animals including ingestion of a foreign body or harmful substance. Housing facilities must be kept in good repair and
maintained to protect the animals and prevent injury. A system of facility repair and maintenance must be in place.
