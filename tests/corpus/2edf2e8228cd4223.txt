2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Currently the licensee has two issues that have been identified and seen by the attending veterinarian who wrote
down the desired treatment plan. However the treatments have not been completed by the licencee in the directed
manner described by the veterinarian.
If the directions by the attending veterinarian are not followed through exactly as they are described by the
veterinarian, in a timely manner, the medical condition can become worse, or cause a treatable condition to become
chronic and increase the time of discomfort for the regulated animal.
The licensee must follow all directions exactly as given by the attending veterinarian as soon as possible and in a
timely manner, to provide proper medical care to the regulated animals. If there are any health issues that are not
resolving or improving the licensee must contact the attending veterinarian or another veterinarian that can provide
treatment to treat the animal. All treatments should be documented, and any issue that is chronic or not treatable
should be documented by the veterinarian and kept by the licensee for their records.
