2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility lacks specific guidance for the care of animals. The species
of animals being maintained at the facility that were not listed on the USDA form 7002 (program of veterinary care)
were two Degus, one bush baby and nine opossums. Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure
the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility. In addition, it does not ensure the facility
has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. The program of veterinary care must be
updated to reflect any current preventive practices for the animals being housed at this facility and ensure that
adequate veterinary care is being provided at all times. Correct by 3/1/18.
3.25(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One guinea pig had escaped from its enclosure and was observed running in an area next to its enclosure at the
time of inspection. The existing fencing could potentially allow other guinea pigs to escape from this enclosure. It
could lead to potential injury affecting the safety and health of the guinea pigs. Indoor housing facilities for guinea
pigs shall be maintained in good repair , to protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to restrict the
entrance of other animals. Correct by 2/8/18.
3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The licensee has not developed a plan for environmental enhancement for the individually housed bush baby. The
written plan allows APHIS inspectors to determine if the facility is following a plan adequate to promote the
psychological well-being of the non-human primate in a manner approved by the attending veterinarian. This is
particularly important with special considerations such as with the individually housed nonhuman primate that this
facility has. The licensee must have a written plan for environmental enhancement for nonhuman primates that is
approved by the attending veterinarian. The plan must be accordance with the currently accepted professional
standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides. The plan must address all points in this
section (3.81). To be corrected by 3/1/2018.* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 2/1/18 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of the inspection report was sent electronicially to the licensee.
