ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The Program of Veterinary Care on file is incomplete. An adult, female Great Pyrenees, used for exhibition, was
not included on the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). There was no mention of preventative care practices for
dogs, and the species itself was not listed on the PVC.
The PVC is a written agreement between the exhibitor and the attending veterinarian establishing standards of care
for the animals. Failure to have a complete PVC could jeopardize the health and well-being of the animals. The
facility should establish and maintain a PVC to include all the regulated animals at the facility and regularly
scheduled visits to the premises.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult white rabbit with black ears had a large swelling on the right side of the face, just above the nose. The
skin around the swelling was reddened. The right nostril was inflamed and larger when compared with the left.
Beneath the swelling and near the right nostril, there was a crusted area of dried blood. A yellow discharge was on
the fur underneath both the left and right nostrils. Facility staff had not identified this animal’s condition prior to the
APHIS inspector noticing it.
The presence of swelling, inflammation, and blood are an indication of disease or injury and often pain. It can result
from numerous causes including both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian
regarding the diagnosis and treatment can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.
Failure to observe and properly communicate animal health issues to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner
can result in prolonged pain and suffering for the animal and potentially worsen a current medical condition. Daily
observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being are
recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior must beconveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate care. The
facility must conduct daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in
a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected from this date forward.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***At the time of inspection, the facility was exhibiting an adult, female Great Pyrenees in an outdoor enclosure
without a shelter structure.
Without access to a shelter, dogs housed outdoors do not have protection from adverse weather conditions. The
facility must ensure all outdoor facilities for dogs has one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each
animal. Additionally, the shelter structures must be large enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit,
stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely.
