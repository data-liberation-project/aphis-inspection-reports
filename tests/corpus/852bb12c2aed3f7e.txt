(a) Structural strength. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the
animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
- In the petting zoo area, a shelter housing two goats has multiple exposed sharp points within reach of the
enclosed animals. These sharp points are due to a shelter panel being knocked loose from the frame. Sharp metal
points are a potential source of injury to enclosed animals and need to be removed or repaired as soon as possible
to help protect the animals health and welfare.
