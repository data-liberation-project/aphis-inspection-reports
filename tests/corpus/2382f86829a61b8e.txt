2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
*Five unopened individual packages of nylon suture material with an expiration date of 2015 were identified in the
clinic area. The expired packages were co-mingled and stored with unexpired products.
*In the locked controlled substance cabinet an unopened Fentanyl patch with an expiration date of 2015 and two
packages of injectable Butorphine with expiration dates of February 2017 and December 2016 were identified.
These expired products were co-mingled with unexpired products in the cabinet.
Expired drugs and products may lose their effectiveness and/or sterility. The use of expired analgesics and suture
material is not consistent with adequate veterinary care. The facility program for the identification and removal of
expired drug inventory and products should be reviewed.
The facility corrected this non-compliance during the inspection by discarding the expired suture material and
appropriately separating and identifying the expired controlled substances.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
An excessive accumulation of feces was stuck to the fiberglass floor and PVC cage furnishings in multiple guinea
pig enclosures in Rooms 135 and 136. Some enclosures were noted to have dried fecal debris stuck in the seam at
junction of the floor and sides of the enclosures. A film of unidentified dried residue was also noted on the interior
walls of two enclosures.
The facility houses multiple guinea pigs per enclosure with a partially solid floor and minimum of bedding material.
Excreta and debris is sticking to solid surfaces and is not being cleaned frequently enough to prevent excessive
accumulation. Additionally, the facility SOP for complete cage change out states it will be done weekly but
personnel stated cage changes were only being done every other week.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of
debris and excreta. Adequate cleaning will prevent soiling of the animals, minimize disease hazards and reduceodors. The facility indicated the current enclosures may be replaced with a style that will facilitate updated
husbandry practices. In the meantime, cleaning should occur more frequently under current housing conditions.
