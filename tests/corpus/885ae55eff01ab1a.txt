2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
The facility representatives were selling sugar gliders at the Murfreesboro TN Exotic Pet Expo held the weekend of
January 28-29 2023. Both adult and young sugar gliders were for sale to the public (total of 14 sugar gliders). The facility
representative stated that they had forgotten the USDA notebook containing their license and other USDA paperwork at
the house. A review of the USDA licensing system identified that the license for this facility expired on 2/22/22 and that
the license renewal process was not completed. A license is required to sell regulated species in order to be compliant
with the Animal Welfare Act and to ensure the health and well-being of the animals being sold.
The facility shall discontinue selling regulated species until a valid and current USDA Animal Welfare Act license is
obtained.

NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED WITHOUT A VALID USDA LICENSE.
This inspection was conducted at the Mid TN Expo Center in Murfreesboro, TN.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
