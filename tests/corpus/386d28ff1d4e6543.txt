PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
** In the ring-tailed lemurs primary enclosure there were several pools of water settling on their concrete floors. The
lemurs were holding onto the fence and it was observed that their tails were wet. With the enclosures floor having
standing water they were unable to stay dry which could lead to health concerns. The primary enclosures must be
designed and constructed to provide the animals with an environment to remain dry. Correct by March 7, 2018.
