2.40(a)(1) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The applicant uses a veterinarian under consulting arrangements to provide veterinary care for the animals but
does not have a written Program of Veterinary Care. The applicant does not have written guidance from an
attending veterinarian to provide preventative care or treatment for routine and common veterinary problems. In
order to ensure problems of animal health are addressed in an adequate and timely manner, a written program of
veterinary care must be maintained and followed.
During this inspection it was observed that several animals are in need of immediate veterinary care. A male
Dromedary camel, Zo, has a large growth around his chest pad. The licensee was unable to provide evidence of a
physical exam, diagnosis, or treatment plan provided by her attending veterinarian. Three female pigs and a sheep,
with ear tag 00384, had excessively overgrown hooves that were in need of trimming. Foxy, a female Fennec fox,
had hair loss over the knuckles of all four feet and had excessively long nails. A female coati, Tuffy, had a large,
golf-ball sized growth in her abdominal region. Tuffy was also repeatedly moving in a fixed pattern of jumping from
one platform to the next and then crawling on the roof of the enclosure back to the first platform. A sheep was
observed to have a distended abdomen, nasal discharge, labored breathing, and a humped back. The sheep had
not been examined by a veterinarian. A female Ibex, Pixie, had a dull, rough haircoat, and was underweight, with
her hip bones visibly protruding. Pixie has not been examined by a veterinarian.
Each applicant shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time
attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the applicant.
The program of veterinary care should address appropriate methods to prevent (vaccination guidelines), control
(parasite), diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care.
The applicant and the attending veterinarian must also discuss and develop a plan regarding the diet and nutrition,
including any supplements, for the animals at the facility.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEATATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection, it was observed that several animals are in need of immediate veterinary care.
***A male Dromedary camel, Zo, has a large growth on his chest pad that was irregular in shape, approximately 4
inches by 8 inches extending approximately 6 inches down from the body wall. The growth was covered with flies.
The licensee was unable to provide documentation of a physical exam, diagnosis, or treatment plan provided by the
attending veterinarian. The licensee periodically applies fly spray to the area.
***An adult female Fennec fox, Foxy, had hair loss over the knuckles of all four feet. A facility representative stated
that he had noticed the hair loss, however the fox has not been evaluated by a veterinarian and is not receiving
treatment of any kind. The fox also had excessively long nails that needed to be trimmed.
***A female Ibex, Pixie, was observed to have a patchy, dull haircoat. She appeared to be underweight, as
evidenced by protruding hip bones and a prominent spine. The facility representative stated that she had always
been like that. Pixie has not been examined by a veterinarian.
***APHIS employees observed a large, golf ball sized mass on the abdominal region of a female coati named Tuffy.
The licensee stated that this was the first time that she had noticed the mass. In addition, the coati was repeatedly
moving in a fixed pattern of jumping from one platform to the next and then crawling on the roof of the enclosure
back to the first platform. This behavior was not interrupted by the position or distance of the observers or when an
attendant entered the enclosure. The coati has not received veterinary evaluation or treatment.
*** A sheep with ear tag 00384 had excessively overgrown hooves on her hind feet and was in need of a hoof trim.
***Three female adult pigs, housed in an indoor barn, are in need of hoof trims. The hooves on the animals were
excessively long, extending out approximately four to five inches. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can
cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s programs of preventative
veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
***An adult black and white female sheep was observed by APHIS employees to be standing with her head down,
neck extended and breathing heavily. She had discharge coming from her nose that had dripped onto her front leg.
Her abdomen was extremely distended and her back was hunched up. When the APHIS inspector pointed this out
to the licensee, she stated that when she walked up to the enclosure she had noticed the hump on the sheep’s back
and felt she should call the veterinarian. The sheep has not been evaluated by a veterinarian.
***An intact adult male tricolor goat that had been non-weight bearing on his right front leg during the APHIS
inspection on March 9, 2017 was observed during this inspection to still be non-weight bearing. The facility
representative provided documentation showing that the veterinarian had examined and treated the goat on March9, 2017. The licensee stated that the veterinarian had rechecked the goat on March 16, 2017, however did not have
any documentation regarding that visit. A facility representative stated that he had been injecting the goat with pain
medication provided by the veterinarian. The licensee confirmed that pain medication he had been injecting the goat
with was an oral medication prescribed for a coati and was not intended to be used on the goat. The veterinarian
has not examined this goat since March 2017.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals
at the facility.
The animals mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plans for the problems cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided, in writing, to the
inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests, and the
outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed along with the dosing
instructions and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the medication is
administered to the animal.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each
animal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and
the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate
veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for
providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries.
A complete routine inspection was conducted on May 23, 2017. This report is limited to direct noncompliant items
identified on that inspection. A second inspection report containing indirect noncompliant items will follow.
Both the inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and facility representative on May 23, 2017.
