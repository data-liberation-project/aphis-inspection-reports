2.31(c)(6)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility has one animal use proposal covering all ongoing activities at the facility. There is no documentation
showing that the proposal has been approved by the IACUC. Conducting regulated activities that have not been
approved by the IACUC does not ensure humane care and use of animals at the facility. The IACUC must review
and approve all proposed regulated activities prior to conducting those activities.
To be corrected from this day forward.
2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There is one proposal covering all ongoing activities conducted at the facility. The proposal lists the number of
animals to be used each year but it does not state a rationale for the appropriateness of the numbers of animals to
be used. Failure to provide a rationale for numbers of animals used does not ensure that an appropriate number of
animals are used to conduct a regulated activity. An adequate rationale for the appropriateness of the number of
animals being used must be included in the proposal so that the IACUC may review the rationale and make
decisions regarding approval of the activity.
