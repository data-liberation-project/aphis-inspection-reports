2.75(a)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility uses cage cards as a form of inventory and identification for puppies under 16 weeks of age. The cage card
for a litter of 5 Cavalier-Bichons born 7-May-2022 is missing the disposition date for 2 puppies of that litter.
The Record of Acquisition of Dogs is missing the microchip number for "Snickers", a female Shih Tzu, and is missing the
disposition date for "Shelby" (microchip # 933000320680336). Both of these items were fixed at the time of inspection.
Each dealer shall make, keep and maintain records that fully and correctly disclose all information concerning each dog in
their possession so that APHIS officials can accurately identify dogs during inspection and trace their movements.
The Record of Acquisition and Dogs and puppy cage cards must be complete and up-to-date at all times.
3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
One enclosure containing a dam and her 3 puppies contained a plastic box that served as the whelping box. The edges of
this box have been heavily chewed on. At least 4 enclosures containing 8 adults and 5 puppies have a plastic barrier
attached to the caging. The plastic barrier has been heavily chewed on.
Indoor surfaces that dogs have contact with must be maintained so that they can be readily cleaned and sanitized to
protect their health and well-being. The damaged whelping box and plastic barriers must be repaired or replaced so that

they can be readily cleaned and sanitized.

3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
There were several surfaces, such as stairs, window sills and a shelf above a dog kennel, in the housing facility that had a
significant buildup of cobwebs and dust. There were also several surfaces containing dead flies such as window sills and
an empty dog kennel with wood shavings where hundreds of dead flies were present. When asked how often these
surfaces had been the cleaned the licensee stated most likely 2 weeks ago. All surfaces of housing facilities must be
cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices to support the
health and well-being of the dogs. The licensee must clean and sanitize surfaces in the dog kennel on a schedule that
prevents the buildup of cobwebs, dust and dead flies.

Exercise for dogs.
The Exercise Plan for Dogs had been signed by the attending veterinarian but was blank of all other details. Dealers must
develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. The facility must
create a new exercise plan that is approved by the Attending Veterinarian that accurately depicts what forms of exercise
and space are provided to each dog over 12 weeks of age.

3.13(a)(1)

Veterinary care for dogs.

The Program of Veterinary Care is missing the frequency of which the attending veterinarian will have regularly scheduled
visits to the premises. The licensee states the veterinarian is there often to vaccinate puppies but does not have a
determined frequency of veterinary premises visits.
Regularly scheduled premises visits by the attending veterinarian at least every 12 months ensure the adequacy of
veterinary care and other aspects of animal care. The licensee must develop a plan in writing with the attending
veterinarian how often they will visit the premises.

3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care is missing the schedule of which adults and puppies will be dewormed. It currently states
"Pyrantel, Ivermectin rotation." The licensee states they will give adults pyrantel every 6 months or if there is runny
manure present. Puppies are currently dewormed with pyrantel at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks and given Safeguard at 8 weeks or
right before they are sold. These deworming schedules need to be in writing and approved by the attending veterinarian
to ensure adequate protection from intestinal parasites.

3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee is not following an appropriate program of veterinary care to prevent healthy and un-matted hair coats and
properly trimmed nails.
A male King Charles Spaniel, "Oliver" (microchip #991001001886136), was found with several matts around the ears and
his feet. One matt in his ear was tight to the skin. Under the long hair on his feet, there was at least one overgrown toenail
that curled down below the toe pad and was very close to touching the toe pad. The licensee was unsure of the last time

the dog was groomed or nails were trimmed and there was no written record of the last grooming.
A female Shiba Inu, "Carlee" (microchip #933000320680347), was found with overgrown front leg toe nails that curled to
the side when standing. The licensee states her nails were trimmed maybe a few months ago or at the end of June. There
is no written record of the last nail trim on this dog.
According to the Program of Veterinary Care, long haired dogs will be checked daily and groomed twice yearly to maintain
a healthy and un-matted hair coats. Nails will be checked monthly and trimmed 3-4 times per year.
Matted fur may cause skin irritation, pain or discomfort. Overgrown toenails may cause the dog to walk with an abnormal
gait, pain or discomfort. The licensee must follow an appropriate preventative care and treatment plan to ensure healthy
and un-matted hair coats and properly trimmed nails to support the health and well-being of the dog.
"Oliver" must be groomed to remove matted fur and have his toenails trimmed. "Carlee" must have her toenails trimmed.
The licensee must ensure all dogs have healthy and un-matted hair coats and properly trimmed toenails at all times.

3.13(b)(1)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee is missing vaccination records for distemper and parvovirus vaccines for approximately 11 adults dogs and 5
puppies. They are also missing records for rabies vaccines for approximately 11 adult dogs. There is no written record of
the last annual head to tail exams and the exam findings completed by the veterinarian.
The lack of medical records makes it difficult to determine if the animals are receiving the vaccines and preventative head
to tail exams. This information is needed for APHIS inspectors to ensure the medical care is being provided by the
licensee. The licensee must maintain complete and maintain updated medical records including the identity of the animal,
including identifying marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s breed, sex, and age; Provided, however, that
routine husbandry, such as vaccinations, preventive medical procedures, or treatments, performed on all animals in a

group (or herd), may be kept on a single record.
