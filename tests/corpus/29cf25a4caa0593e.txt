2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(2) Veterinary care: An older female goat housed alone next to the male wallaby is thin and has a
rough hair coat. The pelvis of this animal is readily apparent despite the ruffled hair coat and demonstrates poor
body condition. There is fecal material under her tail and along the back side of her rear legs, especially between
the hocks and hooves. There are at least two piles of liquid/mud patty consist diarrhea on the ground of her
enclosure.

The facility personnel had separated out this goat to house alone and feed separate from the other goats. This goat
does not appear healthy. The goat has not been seen or treated by the attending veterinarian for her current
condition. Each exhibitor must establish and maintain adequate programs of veterinary care that include the use
of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of
emergency, weekend, and holiday care. Correct by having the goat seen by the attending veterinarian and
following the recommendations of the veterinarian. Correct by June 12, 2015.
2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Section 2.131(d)(2) Handling of animals: The public was observed feeding the farm animals food purchased at the
facility at around 10:30 a.m. There were no facility employees present in the animal area at that time. The APHIS
official waited outside the animal area for a facility employee to be found to come to the animal area (zoo) to
accompany the APHIS official during the inspection.

A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during
periods of public contact. Readily identifiable employees or attendants must be present during periods of public
contact to monitor and control the interactions between the public and animals to prevent harm or injuries. Correct

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Section 3.81(a) Social grouping: The four capuchins are now all housed in enclosures without another non-human
primate. These capuchins had been previously pair- housed (Mike with Molly and Sam with Potter) successfully for
many years. The facility environment enhancement plan to promote psychological well-being still describes these
capuchins as being pair housed. There is no documentation to explain why the capuchins were separated. The
animal caretaker could only inform the APHIS official that the co- owner had wanted them housed individually. The
co-owner was not at the facility during the inspection.
Capuchins are social nonhuman primates and are expected to be housed socially whenever possible. There is no
documentation in the records provided during this inspection that document a reason/explanation for breaking up
the capuchin pairs. The facility must follow their environment enhancement plan to meet the social needs of their
non-human primates. Correct by June 17, 2015.

3.81(c)(4)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Section 3.81(c)(4) Special considerations: The marmoset recently lost its mate and is housed alone in an enclosure
in a room with no other non-human primates. The facility environment plan to promote psychological well-being still
describes the marmoset as being pair-housed.

Certain nonhuman primates must be provided special attention regarding enhancement of their environment, based
on the needs of the individual species and in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian.
Nonhuman primates requiring special attention are individually housed nonhuman primates that are unable to see
and hear nonhuman primates of their own or compatible species. The facility must develop, document and follow
an appropriate plan to address the special needs of the marmoset. The plan must be in accordance with currently
accepted professional standards, as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed
by the attending veterinarian. Correct by June 17, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with the animal caretaker.
