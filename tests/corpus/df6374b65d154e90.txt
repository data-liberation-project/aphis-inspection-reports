Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Protocols AY12V, LZ06S, and CL46P did not include or contain a sufficient rationale for animal numbers used. The
Principal Investigator proposing animal activity must provide a rationale for the number of animals to be used to the
IACUC for review and approval. By not providing a rationale, an unnecessary amount of animals may be used for covered
activity. Protocols must contain a rationale for the appropriateness of the number of animals to be used. Correct by

2.36(b)(3)

Annual report.
The 2022 annual report did not contain a summary or a brief explanation of the IACUC approved exceptions nor did it
contain the number of animals affected. In failing to have the exceptions submitted with the annual report, the IACUC is
not providing the Deputy Administrator a full account of the facilities’ adherence to APHIS standards. A summary of all
such exceptions must be attached to the facilities' annual report. In addition to identifying the IACUC-approved
exceptions, this summary must include a brief explanation of the exceptions, as well as the species and number of
animals affected. Correct by December 1, 2023.
3.50(a) Critical

Facilities, general.


On September 12, 2022 a rabbit was found deceased due to a malfunction with the primary enclosure. The rabbit was
individually housed on the bottom level with another enclosure above. The self-reported incident found that the rabbit was
able to dislodge the bottom feces/urine pan from the cage above causing a gap to form. The rabbit tried to get out of the
enclosure in this gap and became entrapped with the neck being compressed between the metal support and the
enclosure above. The facilities’ investigation revealed the cause of death to be asphyxiation from becoming entrapped.
This enclosure was not constructed of such material and of such strength to safely contain the rabbit. Indoor housing
facilities for rabbits shall be designed and maintained in good repair to contain and protect the animal from injury. At the
time of inspection, corrective actions and preventative measures had been implemented.
3.56(b)(3)

Sanitation.
During inspection, in the clean side of cage wash, many items were found that were dirty. One rabbit enclosure had
moderate areas of brown fecal staining in two back corners while another had a significant amount of fecal matter wedged
within the flooring as well as brown fecal staining on the front of the enclosure. Two additional enclosures were identified
with small areas of brown fecal staining in the back corners of the enclosure. Furthermore, several plastic toys within two
separate containers were found to be contaminated with brown fecal material. Per a facility representative there are no
additional established checkpoints after the clean side of the cage wash. The cage wash system is not effectively cleaning
and sanitizing the enclosures as well as the toys. This could result in the transfer of contaminated items as well as
disease to other animals which may affect animal comfort and well-being. The method of sanitization used must be
effective and can be done by washing with hot water (180 degrees F) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage
washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by
cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam. Correct by 1/19/2023.
