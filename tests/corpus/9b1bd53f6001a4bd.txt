Handling of animals.
On April 11th, 2022, the carrier shipped 4 French bulldog puppies less than 16 weeks old in two crates on air waybill 080-
36325940. One puppy, Baloo, was found dead on arrival. Post-mortem evaluation by a veterinary pathologist revealed
that the animal had bronchopneumonia and that the cause of death is attributable to respiratory compromise and sepsis.
Climatic conditions presented by air cargo travel can worsen underlying health conditions, resulting in more severe illness
or death.

While in transport, this puppy was subjected to a combination of temperature, humidity, and time that was detrimental to
its health considering its breed, young age, and underlying health status. An animal may never be subjected to any
combination of temperature, humidity, and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into
consideration such factors as the animal's age, species, breed, health status, and acclimation.

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
On April 11th, 2022, the carrier shipped 4 French bulldog puppies less than 16 weeks old in two crates on air waybill 080-
36325940. One crate used to transport 2 animals was held by an intermediate handler and inspected by the USDA


inspector on April 19th, 2022. The exterior of the primary enclosure did not have a certification that the animals were
offered food and water within 4 hours of consignment to the carrier, nor are there specific feeding or watering instructions
for a 24 hour period. A representative of the intermediate handler stated that all documents present at the time of
shipment were present at the time of inspection.

At the time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment, the carrier must ensure that the consignor provides certification in
writing regarding the last time food and water was offered and specific feeding and watering instructions for a 24 hour
period. This information must be securely attached to the outside of the primary enclosure in a manner that makes it
easily noticed and read. Transporting animals without this information could put the animals at risk, especially considering
the young age of the animals in this shipment. The airline must ensure that the owner has provided this information in
writing, clearly visible on the primary enclosure, to help ensure that animals are adequately cared for while in transit.

This inspection was conducted with a facility representative on April 19th, 2022. An exit interview was conducted with an
airline representative on May 16th, 2022.
