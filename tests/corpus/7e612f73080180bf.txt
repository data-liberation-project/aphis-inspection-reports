HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
When I arrived at the exhibit location a10' by 10' chain link enclosure with one reindeer and one alpaca was set up
in the parking lot. There were patrons of the restaurant touching the reindeer and the licensee nor any attendants
were present. I went into the restaurant and the licensee approached me. I stated that an attendant must be
present at all times when public contact with animals is allowed. The licensee stated that he had been in the
restaurant for 15 minutes.
A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during
periods of public contact.
Either the licensee or a knowledgeable and identifiable employee must be present when the public can have contact
with animals. This is to prevent injury to the public and to the animals.
To be corrected from this day forward.

SEPARATION.
The licensee has a reindeer and an alpaca in a 10' by 10' chain link enclosure. The reindeer is running the alpaca
around the enclosure with its antlers. The reindeer is also standing on its hind legs and hitting the alpaca with its
front hooves.
Animals housed in the same primary enclosure must be compatible.
Animals housed together must be compatible to prevent injury or death of the animals.
To be corrected from this day forward.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
The inspection was conducted at the Boathouse restaurant in Traverse City, MI.
