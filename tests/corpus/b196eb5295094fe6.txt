Facilities, outdoor.
The facility, which houses kangaroos, giraffe, porcupine, hyena, lynx, and other exotic animals in outdoor and sheltered
enclosures, does not have an adequate and complete perimeter fence. The back of the property, behind the lynx
enclosure, is unfenced although posts have been installed. The front of the property, from the hyena enclosure to the
kangaroo and goat enclosure, is unfenced, although a fence is being constructed and posts are present in some areas.
The kangaroo and goat enclosure is bordered on one side by a solid wood fence beyond which there is no perimeter
fence. The area beside the giraffe enclosure is fenced with traditional farm fencing that is less than 6’ tall. There is a
perimeter fence on one side of the property, adjacent to a small dirt road. This fence is made of wire with overlying tarp,
and there are multiple gaps ranging in size from 6 inches to 10 inches between the bottom of the fence and the ground.
Employees indicated that they understood the perimeter fence was required and that the property does not have a
complete perimeter fence at this time. A perimeter fence protects animals from contact with unauthorized people and
animals. A perimeter fence also acts as a secondary containment system in the event that an animal escapes from its
primary enclosure. Correct by installing a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized
persons out, and to act as a secondary containment system for animals in the facility.

Facilities, general.
***7 Asian soft-clawed otters were housed in three enclosures, each enclosure containing 2 or 3 otters. The otters were
juveniles and adults. The enclosures containing the otters were outdoors and consisted of chain link walls, a covering on
top, and chicken wire and green plastic tarps covering parts of each enclosure. The otters were observed to be chewing
on the green tarps, and the edges of some of the tarps were badly torn. One tarp had a hole in it with ragged edges. Two
otters were observed pulling and chewing on a ragged piece of tarp that was hanging through the top of their enclosure.
One enclosure contained 2-3 square feet of a tarp that had been pulled into the enclosure through the wall. Animals that
chew on tarps and wires may ingest pieces of these materials, which may result in serious, painful, and potentially deadly
digestive problems such as a gut (gastrointestinal) obstruction. Correct by housing animals in enclosures that are
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.
***The outdoor enclosure containing one adult African Crested Porcupine contained two approximately 1 foot by 1 foot
sized areas on the ground where panels of underlying wire fence were exposed and not covered by dirt. The enclosure
containing one adult male hyena had an approximately 6 foot by 1/2 foot area on the ground where underlying wire panels
were exposed and not covered by earth. One enclosure containing Asian Soft Claw Otters had an approximately 2 foot by
2 foot sized area on the ground, in a corner of the enclosure, where a panel of underlying wire was exposed and not
covered by dirt. Employees stated that these wire panels were used on the bottom of enclosures to prevent animals from
digging out.
Wire panels that are partly exposed and partly embedded in the earth may entrap animals’ limbs other body parts,
resulting in serious injury or harm. Correct by housing animals in enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.
***An air conditioning unit located in the wall of the enclosure housing two Mexican Hairy Dwarf Porcupines was not
plugged in. The power cord for the unit was hanging in the animal enclosure and appeared to be badly chewed. Along


approximately 12 inches of the power cord, the plastic outer casing of the cord was partially missing, exposing areas of
the wiring within the center of the cord. The edge of the plastic casing was jagged and torn around the areas of exposed
wire.
Animals that chew on power cords or electrical cords may ingest pieces of plastic or wire, which may result in serious,
painful, and potentially deadly digestive problems such as a gut (gastrointestinal) obstruction. Correct by housing animals
in enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the
animals.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
***An adult male 2-toed sloth (“Kujo”) was receiving a 10-lb dose of Metacam (Meloxicam) daily, by mouth, and had been
receiving this medication for the last 10-12 days to treat an injured claw. The medication expired 5 months ago, the
expiration date on the bottle of medication was 09-2020. An employee stated that the facility owner told her that the
attending veterinarian had given instructions to use this medication for the sloth daily to treat the injured claw.
The attending veterinarian was contacted and stated that on Feb 12th she was contacted by the facility about the sloth’s
injury and instructed the facility to administer "a dose" of Metacam. The attending veterinarian did not know that this sloth
was continuing to be given this medication every day, and indicated that it was not her intention to prescribe the drug long
term. The attending veterinarian stated that she had not received any updates from the facility regarding this animal's
injury.
Medications that have expired may be less effective, resulting in less or no impact on the medical problem they are meant
to treat. Using medications for longer than prescribed may result in accidental overdose, or may damage vital organs such
as the kidneys or liver. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as Metacam (Meloxicam) are known to pose a
potential risk to kidney function in some animals if used longer than prescribed.


Correct by providing adequate veterinary care to treat injuries and support the health and well being of the sloth, including
the use of unexpired medications and timely communication with the Attending Veterinarian regarding this animal’s injury,
progress, and medication regimen.
***An approximately 1-year-old 2-toed sloth (“Kiara” on necropsy records, “Koda” in the facility's Animal Inventory
database) died on January 29th, 2021. Employees stated that this animal had diarrhea for 3 weeks prior to its death, and
was housed at the owner’s home in the days before it died. The previous attending veterinarian- who was the attending
veterinarian at the time of this animal’s death- was contacted and stated that while she was the attending veterinarian she
had not examined the sloth and did not provide medical treatment prior to its death beyond possibly conducting one fecal
exam for parasites. The current attending veterinarian submitted the animal for necropsy on February 2nd, 2021, and the
necropsy report diagnosed diarrhea as the primary illness present.
Animals with severe diarrhea can become critically ill in a short period of time and may die due to dehydration,
malnourishment, or electrolyte imbalances. Daily observation of animals for signs of illness or changes in body condition
or behavior is important for the prompt detection of illness or injury. Timely communication with the attending veterinarian
is critical for ensuring medical problems are addressed and treated. The provision of adequate veterinary care is critical
for animal health, well-being, and survival.
Correct by providing adequate veterinary care to treat illnesses and support the health and well being of sloths, including
daily observation of every sloth and expedient communication with the attending veterinarian regarding the presence of
new or recurrent health problems.
***An adult male dromedary camel had a large amount of liquid diarrhea on his hind legs and the underside of his tail. The
diarrhea was brown and covered the inside of the upper hind legs and was also located on the backs of hind legs lower
down (near the knees/hocks). Spots of similarly colored diarrhea were observed in the pasture. The animal was otherwise


quiet and alert. An employee stated that the diarrhea had not been observed yesterday, and that this animal has had
diarrhea intermittently in the past, often when he is needing to be dewormed. The attending veterinarian’s written program
of veterinary care for this facility requires fecal exam of camelids (camels) once a month, and deworming is then
performed based on results of the fecal exam. According to an employee, the last deworming for this camel occurred over
a month ago (Panacur was last given from December 15th to December 22nd, 2020), and the last fecal exam likely
occurred prior to that time.
Animals with diarrhea or intestinal parasites can become very ill in a short period of time and may suffer from dehydration,
malnourishment, or electrolyte imbalances. Failing to follow the written program of veterinary care may result in animals
becoming sick or unhealthy due to lack of adequate veterinary care.
The day of the inspection, a fecal sample from the camel was taken to the attending veterinarian for examination and
based on the fecal exam results the animal was given medications for intestinal parasites.
Correct by following the attending veterinarian’s written program of veterinary care and by providing adequate veterinary
care to support the health and well being of the camel.

Handling of animals.
Facility incident reports include two incidents of an otter biting a member of the public: On December 26th, 2020, at
3:00PM, the report states, “Guest participating in the otter swim experience was bitten. The bite occurred on the guest’s
thumb, breaking the skin.” The report goes on to say that the thumb was cleansed and bandaged.
On February 7th, 2021, at 4:20PM in the otter pool, two otters were swimming and “one of them bit a woman and made
her bleed.” The report goes on to say that the woman was “okay”.
People who are bitten by animals may suffer from pain, discomfort, or infection. Animals who bite humans may be injured
or stressed if the person is startled and hits, drops, grabs, or pushes the animal.


Correct by handling animals so that there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and to the public, to assure the safety of
animals and the public. Correct by February 25, 2021.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Records of acquisition were not available for 6 Asian soft-clawed otters and 3 two-toes sloths. Records of acquisition and
disposition did not include all animals imported and sold by the licensee, including 4 six-banded armadillos imported on
July 7, 2020. Recordkeeping is important for animal welfare because it may help in locating stolen animals, investigating
disease outbreaks in animals, and identifying illegal sale or movement of animals. Correct by making, keeping, and
maintaining accurate records which fully and completely disclose acquisition and disposition records for animals, and by
maintaining all records for at least 1 year after an animal leaves the property or dies. Records should include all animals
bought and sold by the licensee under this license (certificate) and site.
