NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
Licensee has a long standing arrangement with a day camp to provide animals for a petting zoo during the summer
months. Licensee failed to promptly notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of any additional sites, within
10 days of any change. Failure to notify USDA Animal Care of additional sites for any stay over 24 hours makes it
impossible to perform inspections to monitor the health and welfare of those animals when they are not at the
licensee(cid:25)s facility.
Correct for all future use of additional sites.
2.40(b) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Licensee failed to provide appropriate services and veterinary care to a pot belly pig housed at an unreported site, a
day camp. Licensee was notified by camp personnel that the pig was ill. Licensee stated she told the day camp that
she would pick up the pig 48 to 72 hours after notification, after the weekend, and made no arrangements for
veterinary care to be provided to the pig in the interim. The animal died before the licensee picked it up. Emergency
and weekend veterinary care must be available, and diseases and injuries must be treated appropriately and
promptly.
Correct for all future animals requiring veterinary care.

SANITATION.
Rabbit cages: A cage in the left corner of the outdoor facility had bedding material mixed with excreta and debris
covering the top part of the cage. A cage in the middle area contained a dirty, stained plastic carrier. A cage on the
right had a dirty, wooden board on the cage floor with excreta and urine waste. Primary enclosures shall be kept
reasonably free of excreta, hair, cobwebs and other debris by periodic cleaning. The cleaning schedule for theseenclosures is inadequate, as evidenced by the build up present. Additionally, an enclosure with raw wood that
cannot be properly sanitized must be replaced as needed. A system of cleaning and sanitation must be in place.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sheep and Goat pen(Pine tree pen): There was a corner area with gaps between fencing material, exposed ends
of fence wiring, and splintering, thin, jagged-edged wood boarding. A sheltered area which made up part of the
fenced enclosure had wooden boards with several, large holes with splintering and exposed wire ends and metal
edges in one corner. These areas must be kept in good repair to protect the animals and prevent injury to limbs
and keep them from being entrapped between fence material.
Sheep and Goat pen: A pen housing additional sheep and goats had one sheet of corrugated metal covering a
broken wood board with a large hole. Another sheet of metal used to fence the enclosure was torn at the top. The
enclosure must be kept in good repair to protect and prevent injury to the animals from the edges of the metal
sheeting and holes in the wooden boards.
Pig pen: A shelter box within the pen had the entire floor space composed of wooden pallets with gaps between the
slats. The pen must be maintained to protect the limbs of the pigs from being trapped or injured between the gaps
in the pallet.

3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Enclosures including both sheep and goat pens and the pig pen had a build up of excreta. Excreta should be
removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained and to reduce disease hazards
and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of these enclosures should be more timely and effective to prevent the
build up of excreta.
