At the start of this inspection all 5 sea lions were in the smaller pool. Several were squinting or keeping an eye
closed. These are signs of obvious discomfort and painful eye conditions. The 14 year old South American Sea
Lion Kitty has a cloudy right eye. Her veterinary exam done on 2-1-16 did not indicate any eye issues and stated
she was fluorescein negative. During the photo shoots Kitty was seen squinting her eyes as at 5:30 pm the three
sea lions being used for photos were looking directly into the setting sun due to the orientation of the trailer set up.
Sea lions, especially those with eye issues, should never be made to look directly into the sun.
During most of this inspection, Zoey (13 year old California sea lion) was holding her right eye closed. There is no
record of any veterinary consultation or initiation of medical treatment. The pH of the outdoor pool at the time of
inspection was 7 but may have been much lower as the testing method only goes as low as 7. The sea lions had
not been placed in this pool yet. The caretaker added soda to bring the pH up, but varying pHs of the water can be
affecting the eyes.
A medical record dated 6-26-15 stated Zoey had her eye tightly closed (record does not state which eye). There is
no notation of a veterinary consultation, but Muro drops (hypertonic saline) was given 3 times daily for several days
along with oral 500 mg amoxicillin. The record states the cloudiness left. Two months later the medical record
shows the closed eye happened again but does not state which eye, and does not state if the veterinarian was
consulted. This animal is having recurrent, chronic eye probles which are not being adequately addressed and
treated properly.
Lilly, a talkative 3 year old California sea lion, was holding her left eye closed or squinting during much of this
inspection. The veterinary exam of Lilly on 2-1-16 indicated corneal opacities on both eyes.
There is gentamicin ophthalmic drops in the medical cabinet and the caretaker stated it is used on Zoey when her
eyes are cloudy. There is no script on the bottle or in the medical records as to when to use this.
The veterinarian prescribed all the sea lions have easy access to salt water. This is not being done as the level
today is zero. The veterinarian also found titers for Leptospirosis on Zoey and Kitty and recommended furthertesting to see if any active infection was occurring or if it was vaccine related. There is no indication the follow up
diagnostics were done.
All of these sea lions need to have a thorough eye evaluation by a veterinarian to treat for any lesions and specific
protocols need to be in place for medical treatments of eyes. This traveling exhibit has a bright blue pool with no
shade, no shade on the stage and the stage was set up to face the sun at this location. Changes in their
environment need to be made to correct any eye irritations and to prevent further eye diseases.
To be corrected by 5-22-16.
