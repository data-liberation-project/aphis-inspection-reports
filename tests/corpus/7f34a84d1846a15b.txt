3.6(a)(2)(12) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
.
The outside wire runs of the Stacker building that are coated with a material (plastic/fiberglass/rubber, etc.) have
numerous missing pieces of the material, leaving bare wire that is not adequate flooring for dogs to walk on. Metal
strands of wire used for flooring must be greater than 1/8 of an inch in diameter (9 gauge) or coated. These missing
pieces of coating leave the wire flooring less than 9 gauge. The rolled/painted black plastic like coating that was put
on the bare wire flooring since the last inspection is not adequately covering the wire and has peeled off. This
flooring must be repaired or replaced in a manner that can maintain a safe environment for dogs to walk. This will
help ensure that the dogs in this building are on flooring that will allow them to move around comfortable and be
injury free.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility owner.
