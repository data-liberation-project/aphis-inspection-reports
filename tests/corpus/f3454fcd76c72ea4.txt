FEEDING.
Twelve plastic food receptacles located in the north room and one in the south room, are excessively chewed and
worn. The roughened and jagged plastic surfaces, primarily along the front edge of the food receptacles, are
collecting fur, grime and organic material. Fourteen adult dogs and six puppies are in contact with the affected
receptacles.
Food receptacles that are excessively chewed and worn cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Inadequate
sanitization could lead to bacteria and other disease causing agents that can affect the health and well-being of the
dogs.
The licensee must repair or replace these receptacles to ensure that they can be adequately cleaned and sanitized
at all times. The licensee must establish and maintain a program to ensure that all food receptacles are maintained
at all times to ensure adequate cleaning and sanitization can be accomplished.
