ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The goats in field 1, containing 18 goats, at the farm designated 91 had overgrown feet. Three animals were
individually noted to have gait changes and/or excess foot length to the point that some hooves were curling up in
front. Feet need to be trimmed regularly as an appropriate method to prevent foot problems and discomfort to the
animals. The hooves were trimed at the time of inspection. A plan for continuing husbandry of animals must be
developed. Correct by: 28 February 2014
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
