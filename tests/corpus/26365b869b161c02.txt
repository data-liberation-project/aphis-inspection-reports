3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
At least three enclosures had multiple sharp points in reach of at least four Shibas. Two of the enclosures had the sharp
points at the dog’s head level near the entrance of the shelter. In the third enclosure the points were at head level when
the dog stood on its hind feet. Exposed nails are a potential source of injury to the enclosed animals. Facility must
remove sharp points and continue such maintenance on an ongoing basis.

3.1(f)

Housing facilities, general.
Drains on both sides of the outside area of the sheltered housing facility were clogged, causing an accumulation of feces
and fluid buildup. This is a potential source of contamination to the dogs and could also serve to attract pest and insects
to the area. Facility must clear blockages and maintain drains in proper working order.
