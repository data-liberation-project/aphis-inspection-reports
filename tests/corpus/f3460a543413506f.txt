FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A soiled bag of rodent chow was left near the pig feed in the pig barn. The bag had been chewed by rodents, and
there were a few rodent droppings around it. There was no reason for this item to be in this area.
An opened envelope of Duramycin powder was left on a cabinet top in the pig barn. The unused portion was not
properly sealed in the container - it was to have been discarded.
Waste items need to be promptly discarded to reduce clutter and to prevent attraction of vermin, or to prevent
inadvertant use of the items. These were discarded at the time of inspection.
Correct by: was corrected immediately at the time of inspection.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative.
