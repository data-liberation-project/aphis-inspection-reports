2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of inspection, the acquisition records for rabbit births were incomplete. The facility utilizes a "Rabbit Breeding
Log," to record the number of kits born from each breeding. On at least 4 occasions, a date of breeding was recorded,
but the date of birth and number of kits born were incomplete.

Required acquisition records must include the births of any offspring, and must include the date of acquisition (date of
birth) and the number of animals born. Improper record keeping does not allow for a complete inspection of the facility,
and does not facilitate proper tracking of animals during periods of increased illness and/or mortality. Complete acquisition
and disposition records, including the date and number of all animal births and deaths, are necessary to accurately track
animals used in regulated activities.

To be corrected from this date forward.
3.53(c)(2)

Primary enclosures.


At the time of inspection, one primary enclosure contained a doe and seven >12-week-old kits (born 19-SEPT-2022). At
this facility, rabbits are scheduled to be weaned at 8 weeks old. The enclosure was measured, and all animals in the
enclosure were weighed; One kit weighed <2 kg, and the remaining seven rabbits weighed between 2-4 kg. The floor
space measured 30" x 36", providing 7.5 square feet of floor space. As per 3.53(c)(2), the 8 rabbits would require a
minimum floor space of 22.5 square feet. After weighing, the kits were separated from the doe.

Each rabbit must be provided a minimum amount of floor space. Overcrowding prevents animals from moving freely and
getting adequate exercise, can cause stress and lead to incompatibility, and encourages the spread of disease. After the
kits reach weaning, they must be provided floor space consistent with the space requirements set forth in 3.53(c)(2).

Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
