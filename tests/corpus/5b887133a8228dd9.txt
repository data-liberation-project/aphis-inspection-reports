RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
** The facility needs to update their inventory of animals on hand. There were two sheep and a newborn ring tail
lemur that was not recorded. The wolves that are recorded on the inventory are no longer on exhibit and the
inventory doesn't reflect the move. The exhibitor shall make, keep and maintain records or forms which correctly
disclose the information of the animals The records shall also include offspring born of any animals while in his
possession or under his control. Correct by April 24, 2016.
2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** The public attendant was not present at all times when the public was allowed contact with the animals. There
was a school bus load of 60 children and chaperons that arrived at the facility during our inspection. The kids ran
straight to the animals with feed and no public attendant. The owner was not attending the kids for a while and there
were too many kids going in different directions for him to keep up with. The facility allowed public contact with the
buffalo, fallow deer, goats, sheep and pigs through their enclosure fencing. A public attendant and an adequate
number of attendants is needed to ensure the health and safety of the animals and to decrease the likelihood of
activities (rough handling, improper feeding, etc.) that could be harmful to the animals. Correct Immediately.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the rhesus macaques, bonnet macaques and the spider monkeys enclosure there were fire hoses that the
facility is using for enrichment that have a green film on it. In "Juanita" the olive baboons enclosure there is a green
film and black spots that resembles mold on the wood beams, posts and perches. The fire hoses and other
surfaces must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and
sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled for the good health and well-being of the animals.
** The night houses for "Chucky" and "Simon" the macaques that is made of wood has not been cleaned and/or
sanitized in a while. There was a dirt film with a layer of hair and dust on the surface. All surfaces of housingfacilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary for the good health and well-being of the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
** In the enclosure containing ten ring tailed lemurs, there were pieces of wire about 2-3 inches long that was
attached to the chain link fence that could cause an injury. In the enclosure of the baboon there was a piece of
twisted wire pointing in the enclosure adjacent to a platform where she sat that could cause an injury. The
enclosure should be constructed and maintained so no sharp points could injure the nonhuman primates. Correct

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The lioness "(cid:28)Matilda"(cid:29) had a door in to her enclosure that consisted of chain link wire attached to a metal tubular
door frame by metal fasteners. At the bottom of gate the fasteners had become unattached allowing the wire to be
pushed away from the door frame. The door was not maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury or
to contain the animals.
** The cougar "(cid:28)Sabrina(cid:29)" had a piece of metal sticking out 2-3 inches off a post inside the enclosure at a level that
could cause a laceration. There were also two hinge lag screws sticking out of a post in a doorway from one part of
the frame to another part. These lag screws could cause a laceration. There was a doorway from her enclosure to
the adjacent enclosure that was open. It had two 2 x 6 boards vertically at the bottom of the opening about 3 inches
apart that the cougar could put its foot down in when traveling across the threshold. There were sharp points from a
chain link fence inside the gap that could cause an injury.
** In the night house of a black bear there was a piece of sheet metal that was jagged and extending into the night
house that could cause an injury. Also roofing of the enclosure toward the right end of the pen had debris on top
and was falling down. The top of the fencing for the ceiling is bowing which could eventually cave in.
** In the enclosure of 4 grizzly bears there was a piece of wire paneling that had been cut with pointed pieces of
about 3-4 inches extending into the doorway where they would travel from one section of the enclosure to another.
** In the enclosure for the goats, sheep and pigs there was a rubber strip and several strands of the hay bale twine
lying on the ground. These pieces should be removed to prevent ingestion.
Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. The affected
structures must be repaired or replaced and all housing facilities should be maintained and kept structurally sound
to protect and contain the animals.3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**The enclosures' for the lion, tigers and ligers have pools with green and brown water. They were last cleaned
Saturday but it has a thick green frothy consistency and it needs to be flushed and cleaned. Some of the animals
are drinking it and others are bathing in it. The dirty pool water needs to be flushed and properly disposed of to
minimize vermin infestation, odors and disease hazards.
** In the kangaroo and wallaby's enclosure there were several old pieces of sweet potatoes on the ground.
Provision shall be made for the removal and disposal of food wastes to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and
disease hazards.
