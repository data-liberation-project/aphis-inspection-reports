FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one sheep enclosure, there are sheets of corrugated metal attached to the bottom of the primary enclosure fence.
There is a large hole (approximately 12" x 12") rusted through one metal sheet at head height for the six sheep
housed in this pen. This hole has sharp pieces of rusty metal protruding inwards which could injure the animals.
This area of fencing must be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury. This is a repeat noncompliant

FEEDING.
In the outdoor enclosure housing 2 llamas, there was an empty metal cylindrical food receptacle laying on the
ground. Multiple holes have rusted through the bottom of this food receptacle. This feeder has deteriorated to the
point where it can no longer be kept clean and sanitary; nor can any food contained within it be kept free from
contamination. This metal cylindrical food receptacle must be repaired or replaced. To be corrected by:

SANITATION.
Excessive numbers of flies were observed around the head of "Roger" the camel. Roger was observed rubbing the
side of his head along the metal bars of his enclosure in an effort to rid himself of the flies. Flies can transmit
diseases and cause discomfort/distress to an animal. A safe and effective program for the control of flies and other
pests must be established and maintained at this facility. To be corrected by: September 30, 2016.
