2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Facility personnel are currently performing surgical procedures (anal sacculectomy) on skunks. A written protocol was
provided for the procedure at the time of inspection. The facility’s current written protocol is incomplete: there is no
guidance provided on the how to perform the anal sac removal and no post-procedural care instructions or pain control
measures are provided. The partial guidance provided is not being followed: the facility is not performing the procedure in
a sterile room and they are not using separate sterile instruments for each animal nor properly sterilizing the re-used
instruments between surgeries. The Attending Veterinarian (AV) confirmed that guidance was provided, but the AV has
never observed the procedure or had direct oversite to assure proper procedures and protocols are followed. Performing
surgical procedures without proper oversight or guidance from a licensed veterinarian can cause unnecessary harm, pain
or injury to the animal and can be detrimental to the animal’s health and wellbeing. The licensee must ensure the
attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and have direct
oversight and knowledge all aspects of animal care, to include all procedures being performed.

2.50(a)

Time and method of identification.

The facility currently has 9 adult and 3 juvenile domestic cats with no form of identification. Having animals that are
improperly identified can allow for miss identification during inspection, daily observation, and proper identification of
treatment of specific animals. The Licensee must ensure all live cats held on the premises, are properly identified with an
approved unified method of identification.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is not currently maintaining a Record of Acquisition (APHIS Form 7005) for any of the 12 domestic cats that
are currently being housed on the premises for breeding purposes. Improper record keeping does not allow proper
accountability of animals or proper tracking of animals during a disease outbreak. Each dealer and exhibitor shall use
Record of Acquisition (APHIS FORM 7005) for all cats on hand which fully and correctly disclose all information required
by the AWA concerning each cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or
under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.
The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.

2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is not currently maintaining up to date Acquisition and/or Disposition records for animals on the premises. The
last animal inventory shows a total animal count of 459. The disposition documentation that was provided shows a
disposition of animals as follows: 22 mink, 72 fox, 13 skunk, 30 raccoons, 5 groundhog, 46 ferret, 1 sika deer, 2 plantain
squirrel, and 1 wallaby for a total of 192.
The Acquisition/Record of animals on hand that was provided during today’s inspection contains a list of all species on

premise and the total number of each species that were on the premise at the time the document was completed (July 23,
2021). It lists 95 mink, 57 ferrets, 89 skunks, 215 fox, 53 raccoons, 17 hedgehogs, 17 groundhog, 8 coatimundi, 5
squirrel, 20 deer, 10 wallaby 12 alpaca, for total of 584 animals. The records reflect an inconsistency of animal numbers
and species both acquired and sold at the facility with a discrepancy of 125 animals. It cannot be determined if the
animals on site are newly acquired, born on the premise or the same animals from previous inspections. The number and
type of animals being sold or otherwise removed from the facility could not be determined or evaluated.
Complete Acquisition and Disposition Records are necessary to be able to accurately track animals being used in
regulated activities to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, age of the animals, and humane transportation.
Animals transferred to or acquired from other licensees must have disposition and acquisition records containing all
information required by the Animal Welfare Act Regulations available for inspection. This requirement applies to all
regulated animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased or otherwise in possession of or under control of
the licensee, and all regulated animals transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.
The record shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.

Outdoor housing facilities.
There are currently 5 adult domestic “munchkin” cats being housed in 2 outdoor enclosures. Munchkin cats are known to
be a small to medium sized breed that may not be able to tolerate the temperature extremes prevalent in Ohio/the region.
Animals that are non-acclimated to all weather extremes may be susceptible to heat exhaustion, dehydration or
hypothermia. All animals housed in outdoor enclosures must be tolerant of all weather conditions associated with the
region. To house domestic cats outdoors, the facility must receive guidance and approval from their attending

veterinarian.

3.4(c)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The facility has two outdoor enclosures housing 5 adult domestic cats constructed of a wooden frame to raise the wire
enclosure off the ground and has a wooden den box attached to the back end of the wire. The wooden den box as well as
the frame of the enclosure are not impervious to moisture. Surfaces that are not properly sealed can harbor organisms
and other material that can be harmful to the animals. These surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized leading to
a risk of disease to the animals housed therein. The facility must ensure that any surfaces of outdoor housing facilities
including dens and caging materials are impervious to moisture or replaced when worn or soiled.
Correct by: 09/30/2021.
3.6(b)(4)

Primary enclosures.
The facility has four outside enclosures housing 5 adult domestic cats, these enclosures have no elevated resting
surfaces available other than the floor space provided. Elevated resting surfaces provide the opportunity for the cats to
perform naturalistic behaviors and promote overall well-being. Failure to provide these resting surfaces does not align with
the industry standards and poses concerns for animal welfare. The facility must ensure that resting surfaces that are
impervious to moisture, elevated off the floor, and are large enough to fit all occupants of the enclosure comfortably are
provided.
Correct by: 09/30/2021.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.

Approximately 60 percent of the wire enclosures housing skunks, raccoons, red fox, coatimundi and mink throughout the
facility have an excessive amount of rust present. One enclosure containing a white-nosed coatimundi has a an
approximately 2 inch hole in the front of the wire mesh enclosure large enough for the animal to stick its muzzle through.
The area has sharp points where the wire is cut or broken off. One elevated wire mesh enclosure containing 2 red fox
has rotting and broken wooden support structures that are currently being used to raise the wire mesh floor of the
enclosure off the ground.
Enclosures that are no longer structurally sound pose the risk of escape or injury to the animals. Rust being present on
the enclosure can inhibit affect the structural strength and is not able to be properly cleaned or sanitized and which can
increase the risk of disease transmission within the facility. Holes with sharp edges or points present can cause injury to
the animals being contained.
The facility must ensure that enclosures are all structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and safely contain the animals.

3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
This facility does not currently have a perimeter fence. The Licensee had previously obtained a perimeter fence variance
for some of the species at the facility in 2012. However, there have been several changes to the overall facility and
animal inventory that were not covered under the previous variance approval in 2012. The facility was previously cited for
the lack of a perimeter fence or adequate variance approval on the last Routine inspection dated November 26, 2019. The
facility has since written into the administrator for a new variance. The request has been denied by the administrator and
the previous approval that was granted in 2012 has been revoked. The facility verbally confirmed receipt of the denial
letter and informed inspectors that a perimeter fence has not been added due to the cost associated with the building of a

perimeter fence. The Licensee must ensure a perimeter fence is properly in place or apply and receive approval for a
variance from the Administrator for all species that require a perimeter fence.
3.129(b)

Feeding.
At least 40% of the food receptacles for the skunks, and mink in the facility have an excessive amount of rust present on
them. Rust prevents the food receptacles from being properly cleaned and sanitized exposing the animals to
contamination and unnecessary disease hazards. All food receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary and/or replaced if
they are unable to be properly maintained.
Correct by: 09/23/2021.
3.130 Repeat

Watering.
At least 75% of the water receptacles for the fox, raccoon and skunk have rust or chew damage that do not allow for
proper cleaning or sanitation. In addition, several of the water receptacles have a buildup of green organic material or
brown/red matter buildup. Having water receptacles that are not properly cleaned/sanitized expose the animals to
unnecessary hazards. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
3.131(a) Direct

Sanitation.
A raccoon enclosure constructed of a wooden raised frame with wire sides and top, has a den made of wood on the back
end of the enclosure. Inside the den box there is an excessive amount of excreta piled up, which was easily observed by
inspectors from outside of the enclosure. The facility representative indicated that this animal commonly
defecates/urinates in the den box and that the waste buildup had not been cleaned out or removed for “about 2 weeks”.
The den box is currently the only form of shelter for a nocturnal species that the raccoons have access to within their

enclosure. This animal does not currently have a clean or dry denning location within it’s enclosure to allow it to perform
species specific behaviors without coming in contact with its own bodily waste.
At least 85 percent of enclosures housing skunks, racoons, red fox, coatimundi and mink throughout the facility have an
excessive amount of food waste, excreta and other organic waste piled up underneath. The enclosures are not uniform
and are suspended at different heights. The higher enclosures had waste and excreta piled at least one foot to knee high
under the enclosure. Enclosures that were lower to the ground had excreta and waste build up that was approximately 1-2
inches from touching the enclosure floor. Despite these enclosures being in an open-air outdoor area, there is a very
strong odor present, that caused burning of the eyes and throat of both inspectors.
Animals that are kept in confined areas with excessive amounts of excreta or have a buildup of excreta directly
underneath their enclosures can lead to disease hazards, and are a threat to animal welfare and produce a noxious odor
in the area.
The facility shall ensure that adequate measures are being taken to ensure that excreta is removed from enclosures as
often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained in the enclosure.
