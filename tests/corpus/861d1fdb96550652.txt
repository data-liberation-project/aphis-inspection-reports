* A female Coton de Tulear (#516) has heavily matted hair on her front legs and a rear leg. The matted hair is
densely tangled and pulling at the skin. The dense mat of hair does not allow for skin visualization either. This
condition could promote and foster skin infections because of trapped debris and moisture and the lack of air
circulation. Licensee must ensure that a hair coat maintenance program is established and maintained at all times
to prevent and remove any excessive matting of the hair to allow the dog freedom of movement, maintain healthy
skin and provide insulation against the weather.
* To be corrected by: 2/4/15 (verbally instructed at exit conference)
Inspection and verbal exit interview conducted with facility representative on 1/28/15.
