2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The sales records for a Marmoset that was sold earlier in the year was missing the address of the person that
bought the animal. In addition, APHIS Form 7019 was incomplete. The disposition dates and information was
missing for multiple animals and a newborn Lemur had not been added to the form. Not recording all the required
information for the disposition and acquisition of the animals does not allow for proper tracking of the animals by an
APHIS official. All required information must be documented in a timely manner by the licensee. Correct by
6/12/17.
3.84(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A sheltered enclosure containing three Ring-Tailed Lemurs had not been cleaned out in two weeks. Feces was
accumulating on the inside part of the sheltered enclosure. Feces accumulating at the bottom of the enclosure can
contribute to the spread of disease amongst the primates and any people working near the enclosure. All primate
enclosures must be sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often as necessary to prevent the buildup of
excreta within the enclosure. Correct by 6/6/17.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A perimeter fence was absent for two enclosures: one containing a bobcat and another containing two kangaroos.
Not having a perimeter fence for these animals doesn't ensure that the animals contained within the perimeter fence
can't escape if they somehow got out of their primary enclosures. The licensee must erect a perimeter fence for
these animals. Correct by 7/5/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
