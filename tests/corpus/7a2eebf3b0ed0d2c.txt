Handling of animals.
A 22yo male crested capuchin with a history of hair loss and his habitat mate did not have access to the heated night
quarters the night of December 24, 2022. According to the facility representative, the keeper responsible for this area
failed to provide access to the 2 non-human primate's heated building during closing rounds. The capuchin and his habitat
mate remained out on exhibit for at least 8 hours with temperatures dropping to the upper 40s and lower 50s. According
to the medical records, the geriatric capuchin was found deceased out on habitat during opening rounds with no issues
noted for his habitat mate. Immediate corrective action has been set in place by the facility. Appropriate measures should
be taken to ensure animals health and well-being during changing climatic conditions. When climatic conditions present a
threat to an animal's health or well-being, appropriate measures must be taken to alleviate the impact of those conditions.
An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature, humidity, and time that is detrimental to the
animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as the animal's age, species, breed, overall health
status, and acclimation.
To be corrected from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
