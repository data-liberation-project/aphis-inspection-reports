Both eyes of an adult blonde colored female Shi-Tzu identified by microchip (001-871-364) are abnormal in
appearance. The right eye is cloudy with a light blue color and the pupil cannot be visualized. Both eyes are mattery
and have a greenish-yellow discharge coming from them. There is a dry crusty material matted in the fur around
both eyes.
An adult fawn colored female Pug identified by microchip (0A02456273), also has eyes with an abnormal
appearance. The eyes appear enlarged and cloudy. There is a greenish-yellow discharge coming from both eyes.
The left eye has a dark brown layer of dry crusty material covering most of the surface. The licensee stated that he
noticed the problems a few weeks ago but has not yet consulted a veterinarian.
Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical
conditions and can be painful. Both dogs must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment
plan administered. Documentation should be available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any treatment
plan must be part of the documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care
at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
The enclosures in the white northeast sheltered housing facility are constructed partially of wood. The wooden
areas in the enclosures where the dogs come in contact with have not been painted or sealed and have not been
made impervious to moisture.
The outdoor facility containing German Shepherds has wooden supports in the outdoor runs that have been
severely chewed. At least two of the supports have been chewed in half. The wooden flooring inside the building
where the dogs come in contact with is worn and absorbing liquid. The licensee stated he is currently working on
updating the building. The tin sheets attached to the outside north wall along the bottom of the dog runs are rusty
and creating sharp points. The northwest outdoor housing area containing one German Shepherd has a woodenshelter that is worn and damaged along the bottom left side.
Damaged, worn and jagged surfaces cannot surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must
repair or replace all surfaces that are worn and cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning.
There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta on interior surfaces of the enclosure containing three German
Shepherds. The wooden flooring inside the building where the dogs come in contact with has not been properly
sanitized within the last two weeks. The entire concrete surface in the outdoor run that the dogs have access to is
wet. There is mixture of fecal material and urine pooling on the concrete near the back of the run. The dogs have to
walk through it to access the shelter.
Sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent the accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards. It indicates
an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or health risks. The licensee must ensure
that all surfaces that the dogs come in contact with are spot cleaned daily or more often to ensure all dogs the
freedom to avoid contact with the excreta. Surfaces must also be sanitized at least once every two weeks or more
often if needed.
