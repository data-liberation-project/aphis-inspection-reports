2.31(d)(1)(ii)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In the teaching protocol for canines that was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC), it states that three dogs per year will be used under Pain Category D - which involves procedures which
may cause more that momentary or slight pain or distress, but the protocol does not include written documentation
and description of consideration of alternatives to such procedures, as required.
Prior to approving a protocol the IACUC must review the proposed activities, and ensure that alternatives that might
minimize pain and distress have been adequately considered. Failure to include this consideration could result in
unnecessary pain and / or distress for the animals.
The protocol should be revised, and reviewed by the IACUC prior to any Category D animal use. Correct for all
Category D activities in all protocols by May 1, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility veterinarian.
