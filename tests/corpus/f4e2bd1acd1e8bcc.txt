ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult female Shih Tzu named Nicole had a firm mass of tissue (about 1 inch by 3 inches) on her abdomen
that appeared to involve a mammary gland. The dog had not been examined by a veterinarian. Untreated medical
conditions can worsen and can be painful. The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian. The
licensee must keep records of the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care and must make these records available
to the inspector upon request. If the animal's condition does not resolve during treatment or if it returns, the
licensee must consult a veterinarian for further evaluation and treatment. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 6/9/15.
***Three adult female Shih Tzus (Little Suzy, mc# 460 9507 B2C; Nicole, mc# 485 076 2952; Abby, mc# 485 102
7458HA) had excessively matted hair on their faces and around their eyes. The matted hair appeared to be
irritating their eyes. Little Suzy(cid:25)'s right eye had a small amount of gray discharge. Both of Nicole(cid:25)'s eyes had a
small amount of gray discharge. Abby(cid:25)'s right eye had a small amount of gray discharge. Abby'(cid:25)s left eye had a
small amount of yellow discharge that was crusting around the edges of the eye. Matted hair can result in skin
and/or eye problems, can be painful, and can compromise the hair(cid:25)'s ability to provide protection from the heat or
cold. The licensee must remove the matted hair from these animals(cid:25) faces and must establish an effective program
of haircoat maintenance. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 6/4/15.
3.6(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
3.6 Primary Enclosures(a)(1)
There were at least 2 metal support poles of the chain-link outdoor enclosures that were rusted, broken and had
sharp edges. The first pole was at the base of the inside gate panel and the second was the vertical pole of the
back right side panel. These areas have sharp rusted edges that could injure the dogs and because they are broken
off they do not adequately support the enclosure panels. The licensee shall provide primary enclosures that are
structurally sound and ensure that they are kept in good repair; free from excessive rust and sharp edges.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
3.6 Primary Enclosures(c)(2)
Inside the 1st (Reefer) sheltered housing facility there were 3 female and 2 male adult dogs housed in the same
enclosure. The two male Silky terrier dogs had blood on their heads and bodies, presumably due to fighting. One of
the females was displaying signs of heat and the two males were observed growling at each other as one attempted
to breed the female. The licensee removed the male dogs from the enclosure and had a kennel worker take them to
a veterinarian for medical treatment during the inspection. The licensee stated that she only intended one male to
be placed in the enclosure and that one of the kennel staff had mistakenly placed the additional male in the
enclosure. Moving animals to new enclosures without observation of compatibility leaves opportunity for
incompatible behavior and fighting which can result in serious injury or even death. The licensee and kennel staff
shall ensure all dogs housed in the same primary enclosure are compatible. TO BE CORRECTED BY:6/4/2015
NOTE: The male dogs returned from the veterinarian before the inspection concluded. He noted minor injuries that
did not require treatment.
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee and Konnie Plumlee, VMO.
