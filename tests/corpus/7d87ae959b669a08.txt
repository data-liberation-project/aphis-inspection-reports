There were two vervet monkeys that died in April 2021 due to unknown causes. The female was acting sick for one day
and died in the evening. The male appeared fine for four days after the female vervet died, then he died on the 4th day
due to unknown reasons. The licensee stated he tried to call several veterinarians including the person he said serves as
his primate vet and advised no one would let him bring in the animals as they did not see vervet monkeys, or they did not
have time, and the primate vet could not examine the female until 4 days later. The licensee did not contact his attending
vet due to assuming they would not work with his primates. There was no additional planning or research on other
veterinary clinics for emergency care for the primates if the primate veterinarian was not available.

The lack of formal arrangements with specialists or the attending veterinarian can cause the lack of timely vet care to be
provided which can cause the animal to be in unnecessary pain and discomfort. The lack of vet care could be fatal in an
emergency situation. There must be a formal arrangement with a veterinarian for every regulated species that the
licensee owns.

Each dealer and exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time

attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary
care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer or exhibitor.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a cougar male approximately 5 months old (Mercury) that was observed to be extremely thin with all ribs, hips,
shoulders and spine protruding. The flanks were sunken in. The animal appeared very sick and uncomfortable as shown
by his tensed abdomen and arched back. The skin was pulled upward (tented) to check for dehydration, and the skin
stayed up in the pinched position until he moved forward, indicating a serious level of dehydration. The cub was very quiet
and moved very little even with people there. During the observation, the cougar passed brownish, liquid diarrhea with
flatulence. The smell was very strong and pungent, and the feces was light brown with mucus. The cougar took several
drinks of water and had a bowl full of meat that was not being eaten. The licensee advised the cougar was sick a month
prior with something similar and had looked worse than on this date. A fecal sample was performed at a veterinarian’s on
March 24, 2021, although the cub had not been taken in for an exam. The fecal revealed coccidia, and rare amounts of
tritrichomonas and strongyloides. The licensee stated that the cub was treated and seemed better, however he felt the
cougar started to get sick again approximately 3-4 days before this inspection, losing weight and not eating well. The
cougar had not been taken to a veterinarian or treated according to veterinary directions on this second episode of illness.
The licensee advised he was waiting for a friend that works at the clinic to be available in the next week to go with him to
the veterinary clinic.

The lack of appropriate veterinary care in a timely manner can cause a treatable condition to become chronic or fatal if not
attended to as soon as the symptoms begin to appear. This delay caused the cub to suffer unnecessary pain and
discomfort.


The licensee was advised during the inspection to contact a veterinarian immediately and take the animal in due to the
severe condition of the animal.
The licensee did call and take the animal to the veterinary hospital at the end of the inspection.

Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include: the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease and injuries, and the availability of emergency,
weekend, and holiday care.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
