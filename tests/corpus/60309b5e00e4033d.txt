2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the petting zoo, two goats continue to have excessive hoof growth One, a large white Boer goat was observed
walking abnormally as if discomforted.
***Although the attending veterinarian was made aware of the Male Pere David's Deer that had a front left hoof that
appeared to be twisted approximately 90 degrees outward from the other three hooves and had a long hoof on the
last report, the animal has not been assessed and a treatment pan has not been created. This male maneuvers with
a limp on the affect leg.
***A female goat in the nursery area had a large severely bilaterally deformed udder. The licensee stated she had
mastitis last year when she kidded and he treated her. The animal also had excessive hoof length on its rear
hooves causing them to curve upward and crack. The veterinarian has still not examined this animal. Mastitis is a
painful and uncomfortable condition and this animal has a malformed udder likely secondary to an inappropriately
treated mastitis.
***An additional newborn fallow deer laying beside an adult fallow deer inside the rhino enclosure had a large round
spot (approximately 1 1/2 to 2 inches round) on its head that was hairless and grey.
***A large male Watusi was observed tilting its head at an irregular angle. The animal has been observed in the
past exhibiting this abnormality and it appears to be becoming more pronounced.
The attending veterinarian must be made aware of changes in animals health in order to adequately diagnose and
treat them. The licensee must have the above listed animals assessed by the attending veterinarian for appropriate
diagnosis and treatment plan. The licensee must follow the treatment plan and assure that all of the animals are
provided with adequate veterinary care as required.
2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).***According to the licensee the following animal deaths have occurred in the last 45 days:
The male Aoudad that could not stand on its front hooves and move in a normal manner, and that had excessive
hoof growth in the front two hooves has perished. The owner stated that the animal laid down inside the Rhino barn
and did not move for at least two days until it died. The attending veterinarian was not notified nor was any
treatment given to the animal during that time.
A Water Buffalo that according to the owner was healthy and had a good weight was found deceased in a pond of
what the owner referred to as drowning.
A Sika deer was found deceased and partially eaten. The owner stated that he believes a bobcat is getting through
the perimeter fence and attacking animals.
The attending veterinarian was not notified about any of these animal deaths. Without appropriate methods to
diagnose and treat injuries and illness, animal conditions may worsen or in this case, the animals condition may
become fatal. The licensee must have timely and accurate communication with the attending veterinarian as
required.
3.127(d) CRITICAL REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The owner stated that he thinks a bobcat is getting through the perimeter fence at night and killing hoofstock. In the
past animals have been found dead of mysterious wounds or found partially eaten. The entire facility ground is
surrounded by a perimeter fence. However, a majority of the hoofstock animals have free range access within the
complex and are not enclosed in any type of pen causing the complex fence to act as a large single enclosure
without any sort of perimeter fence or secondary containment. The entrance and exit to the facility contain large
drive through gates that remain open when the facility is open. There are no attendants in place to keep animals
from escaping the facility grounds through this manner. There are cattle guards on the road in several sections of
the park which the owner has stated the animals will not cross. However, on at least one occasion, hoofed animals
were seen jumping over one of these cattle guards. At least one section of fencing close to the entrance of the
facility appeared to be only a few feet tall.
The licensee has stated that the perimeter fence is approximately 7.5 feet tall. One rhinoceros at the facility
requires a perimeter fence at least 8 feet fall.
An appropriate perimeter fence is required to prevent public contact with the animals and to serve as secondary
containment. Perimeter fences less than 6 feet high or less than 8 feet high for dangerous animals, such as the
rhinoceros, must be approved in writing by the Administrator. However, this facility does not have a variance in
place.3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
In the outdoor portion of the petting zoo area and in the nursery, a multitude of flies were observed in and around
the animals and on the food. The owner stated that he has no pest prevention program in place. Pests carry
diseases which increases the risks of contamination to the animals, water and food supply. The licensee must
ensure that measures are taken to control pests in the facility. The licensee must establish an effective pest control
program to eliminate the pests throughout the entire facility as required.
This was a focused inspection to readdress noncompliances listed on the prior inspection, as well as to address
accusations listed on a recent complaint.
This inspection was conducted with the site owner on 5/15/2018.
