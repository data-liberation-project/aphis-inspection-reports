2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Written Program of Veterinary Care.
1. The Licensee employs a part-time Attending Veterinarian and there was a written Program of Veterinary Care
(PVC) dated 3/26/15 using APHIS Form 7002 available for review at the time of the inspection. However, the
written PVC did not contain sufficient details under several subsections of Sections III and IV. The species of
animals covered under the written PVC were not specified; there were no details provided for Parasite Control
Program for all species; the subsections on provisions for Emergency Care and Capture/Restraint methods were
blank; and the Method of Euthanasia was not specified for all species. In addition, Section I did not contain
information for the Licensee and the PVC had not been signed by the Licensee.
Per this Section of the Regulations, whenever an exhibitor employs an attending veterinarian under part-time or
consultant arrangements, a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is required. The written PVC should include
complete and specific details from the Attending Veterinarian concerning the preventative medical practices and
health topics to ensure that adequate veterinary care is provided to all of the animal species on the premises of the
Licensee, and the PVC should be signed by both the Licensee and the Attending Veterinarian to document the
formal arrangement.
The written PVC needs to be revised to include the missing detailed information and it must also be signed by the
Licensee.
Correct by 4/1/16.
