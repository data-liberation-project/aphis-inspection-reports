2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A female goldendoodle # 317 was observed shaking her head repeatedly during the inspection. The licensee
mentioned he had seen the dog shaking its head for several weeks and had looked at the ears and not noticed any
issues. When examined closer, the dogs ears were moist, red and irritated with a yeast like smell. It is important that
if the licensee cannot locate an issue but the dog continues to show signs of irritation with the ears, this issue is
communicated to the attending vet for further assessment. This dog needs to be assessed by the vet for treatment
options.
