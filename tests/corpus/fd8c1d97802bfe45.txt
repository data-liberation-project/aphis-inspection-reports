FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Wire fencing surrounding the llama enclosure was in disrepair. A section of chain-link fencing was not secured to
the posts in some areas and the fencing was pushed away from the posts leaving gaps between the fence and the
posts. Additionally, the ends of a number of connecting wires were protruding into the enclosure.
Sharp objects and gaps in fencing may cause injuries to the animals. Animal enclosures should be constructed and
maintained in a manner that will protect the animals from injury.

FEEDING.
There were no feeders in a cattle enclosure and hay on the ground was contaminated with feces. Contaminated
feed may be less palatable to the animals and contain pathogens that could adversely impact animal health. The
facility should ensure that food is wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination.
This non-compliant item was corrected during the inspection. 3.131(c)
SANITATION.
A plastic bag containing moldy milk was found in a refrigerator in a large animal storage room. The refrigerator also
contained medication for animals.
Open dumpsters containing garbage and water were found adjacent to a llama enclosure. One dumpster contained
several inches of water. A large number of live mosquito larvae were observed in the water. Two other dumpsters
contained garbage. Discarded materials were found on the ground near the dumpsters including a broken wooden
pallet and a large mat resembling an animal bed. A discarded plastic wrapper on the ground also contained water.
Garbage, decaying material, and standing water may harbor vermin and pathogens that could adversely impact the
well-being of animals. The facility should ensure that buildings and grounds are kept clean in order to protect the
health of the animals.
These non-compliant items were corrected during the inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
