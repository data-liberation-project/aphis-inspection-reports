Handling.
1. On 10/30/14 a laboratory staff member accidentally dropped a rabbit when returning the animal to its primary
enclosure following an IACUC approved research activity. The rabbit had suddenly moved when the staff member
opened the door of the enclosure and the animal fell to the floor. The Attending Veterinarian (AV) was immediately
contacted and examined the rabbit. Spinal fracture was diagnosed and the rabbit was euthanized.
Per this Section of the Regulations, handling of animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does
not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
The AV reported the incident to the IACUC. The IACUC and AV acted promptly to address this item by conducting
an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and USDA, and swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions.
Corrective actions included but were not limited to providing re-training to the laboratory staff and implementing
additional measures to prevent any future incidents. No additional incidents have occurred.
This item has been appropriately addressed by the research facility and it has been corrected.
