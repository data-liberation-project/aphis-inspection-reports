Watering.
An enclosure housing two guinea pigs had a water bottle containing no water. Lack of potable drinking water can have
serious health impacts on the animals, especially during summer months. Potable water shall be provided daily. Correct

3.56(a)(1)

Sanitation.
The housing area for one rabbit was heavily soiled with fecal matter and grime. Build-up of feces and grime provide a
source for fly infestations and disease transmission which can cause harm to the animals. Primary enclosures shall be
kept reasonably free of excreta, hair, cobwebs and other debris by periodic cleaning. Correct by June 24, 2021.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
An excessive amount of flies were present throughout the facility. The pest control program in place is insufficient to
handle the number of flies present. Excessive numbers of flies pose a health risk to the animals due to fecal transmission
between species and contamination of foodstuff. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites,
and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Correct by July 14, 2021.
