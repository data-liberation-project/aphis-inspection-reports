2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This farm advertises on their website, and by signage at the property, that it is operating a petting type zoo on
Saturdays (for a fee) where the public can see and interact with various farm animals and/or other small mammals.
You must first obtain a USDA Animal Welfare Exhibitors license to do this type of exhibition (petting/interaction zoo
activity). This type of activity is considered an exhibition as defined by the Animal Welfare Act definition &
regulations.
You may not exhibit regulated animals (including, but not limited to, sheep, goats, pigs, cattle, & rabbits) without first
obtaining a USDA Animal Welfare license. A pre license package will be sent to you under separate cover. If you
wish to continue to show your animals to the public in this manner, please complete the application for license and
submit it together with a $10.00 application fee. You must pass a pre license inspection before a license will be
issued.
