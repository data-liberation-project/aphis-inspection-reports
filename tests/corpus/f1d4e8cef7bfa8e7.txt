2.126(c)(1)(iii) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee sent a written itinerary for an exhibit in Des Moines, IA for the Iowa Deer Classic. The licensee did not
include the address of the exhibition event.
The itinerary shall include the following: The names, dates, and locations (with addresses) where the animals will
travel, be housed, and be exhibited.
Include all required information on itineraries for overnight travel. Failure to provide and update itinerary information
results in the Department's inability to conduct an inspection to ensure the welfare of the animals covered under the
Animal Welfare Act.
This inspection was conducted with the licensee. Three attempts to schedule the exit interview, two by text
6MAR20 and 13MAR20 and one by phone 17MAR20, have been made.
