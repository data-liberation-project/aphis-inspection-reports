Handling of animals.
Currently there are 2 rabbits and an armadillo in enclosures with two-foot tall fences and no barriers. These animals are
within easy reach of the public. The armadillo and the rabbits are not continuously monitored by an employee. During
possible public contact a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at
all times. The facility needs to have enough attendants to adequately monitor all visitors that have contact with the
animals at all times or the animals need to be in enclosures less accessible by the general public. This if for the protection
of the animals as well as the guests.

Facilities, general.
The Bengal cat enclosure has several structural issues.
Two of the walls in the off-exhibit area are constructed of sheetrock. Sheetrock is not an appropriate material for animal
enclosures. Sheetrock can be easily scratched and gouged by an animal and cannot be adequately cleaned and
disinfected. In this case there were large areas where the outer paper on the sheetrock had been ripped off the wall.
There was also a large hole in the sheetrock at the floor level.
The wood around the door leading from the cat holding area into the exhibit appears to have been repeatedly used as a


scratching post and spray post for the animals in the exhibit. The wood was stained and gouged. Stained, gouged,
unsealed wood cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected.
There are 2 layers of wire mesh that separate the Bengal cats from the public. There is a hole in the inside layer of wire
mesh at ground level. The cats could cut themselves on the sharp edges exposed or possibly get a body part stuck in the
hole.
Facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals and the facilities shall
be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The above issues need to be corrected or the animals need to be moved to different enclosures.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
