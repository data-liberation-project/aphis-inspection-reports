2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 on
07/20/2016.
Attempts to make contact with the licensee were made by knocking on the door and dialing the listed phone
number. There was no answering service or way to leave a message, but the phone was allowed to ring
unanswered for at least 90 seconds (10-15 rings). After waiting 30 minutes for someone to arrive home, the
inspector left the premises and sent the attempted inspection report by mail.
The licensee must ensure that a responsible adult is available to accompany the inspector in order to facilitate the
regulatory process. Correct from this time forward.
