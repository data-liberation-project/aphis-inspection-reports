2.131(d)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During inspection of the area of the petting zoo housed in an indoor building, a wallaby was observed to be
contained in a canvas tote bag with two straps constructed as handles attached to the top on each side of the bag.
The bag with the wallaby inside was clipped to the enclosure fencing on the interior of the petting zoo area which
was accessible to the public. Both straps on the tote bag were attached with one clip and the weight of the animal
pulled the straps taut minimizing the opening so that the animal was essentially restrained within the bag.
Many members of the public were observed crowded around the tote bag handling the animal. Attendants were not
in close proximity observing the public interactions with the wallaby. The wallaby was unable to move to remove
itself from unwanted or potentially stressful interactions. Exhibition of an animal while restrained and unable to move
around an enclosure without observation by an attendant in close proximity is incompatible with requirements under
the Animal Welfare Act. Animals must only be exhibited under conditions consistent with maintaining their
well-being.
Correct by:This non-compliance was corrected prior to the completion of this inspection however all animals must
be appropriately exhibited in the future.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted conducted with company employees and on-site managers.
The inspection was conducted at the Houston Livestock and Rodeo Show and included petting zoo and animal
racing venues.
