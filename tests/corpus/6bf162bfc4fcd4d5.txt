Facilities, general.
Several enclosures were observed to be in varying states of disrepair.
In the enclosure housing five servals, there was a wooden platform with a section of wood that has been worn away
exposing a jagged hole. This section of the platform has the potential for limb entrapment.
In the enclosure housing two caracals, there was a worn (darkened, discolored, beginning to splinter) wooden platform
with an exposed screw near the edge of the platform.
In the enclosure housing a tiger and black bear, there was a wooden 2X4 support plank extending over the top of the
enclosure over the den with substantial damage (chunks of wood missing or splintered). Approximately 50% of the plank
is still intact. Additionally, the top section of the primary den shows signs of wear (worn, discolored, splintered wood).
Wearing wood and poorly maintained structures within primary enclosures can cause injury to the animals if not regularly
maintained. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and contain the animals.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
The food prep shed has excessive flies in it. Additionally, there is excessive accumulation of spider webs, the food prep
shed portals of entry do not close securely and the area is cluttered.
A safe and effective program for the control of pests shall be established and maintained. It shall be utilized to eliminate
excessive flies in the food prep area to prevent contamination of food.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The current environmental enhancement program only addresses the psychological well-being for ringtail lemurs. The
licensee now exhibits a bush baby, hybrid ruffed lemur and owl monkey. The licensee could not produce an EEP that
addressed the species need for the additional nonhuman primates.
Exhibitors must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote
the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted
professional standards and as directed by the attending veterinarian.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A review of facility records identified an incomplete inventory of animals on hand. It did not list a newly acquired otter
(whose acquisition paperwork was also missing), 3 pot belly pigs, two adolescent bear cubs, and 5 fennec fox kits.
Additionally, there were no records of disposition for several animals that had passed: raccoon, kinkajou, prevost squirrel,
lynx, lion, cougar. Complete acquisition records are required for tracking animal ownership and for compliance with animal
welfare regulations.
Correct by maintaining an updated record of animals on hand as well as maintaining records of acquisition or disposition
for any animal exhibited at the facility.
