ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Upon inspection, 6 adult dogs in the kennel were found to have advanced dental disease including tartar build up,
reddening and swelling of the gums, mild to moderate whitish discharge on some teeth, and several had extremely
loose teeth. USDA tags are used to identify the animals in the kennel 146 (female Yorkshire Terrier), 196 (male
Yorkshire Terrier), 213 (female Maltese), 140 (female Yorkshire Terrier), 142 (female Yorkshire Terrier), 127 (male
Brussels Griffon). These dogs had not been identified by the licensee as requiring dental care. Ensuring proper
dental health in the kennel is important to prevent pain or other illnesses as a result of dental disease. These dogs
must be seen by the attending veterinarian and provided treatment according to their instructions.
