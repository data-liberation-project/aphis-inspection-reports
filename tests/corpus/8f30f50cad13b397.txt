2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
When the written program of veterinary care was requested by the inspector, the facility produced a document which the
employee stated she had completed herself the night before per the facility owner's instructions. The document was not
written with the input from the attending veterinarian, who stated that she did not agree with the contents of the document.
The attending veterinarian is required to have the appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary
care and oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use. Correct by February 5th, 2021 by creating a
program of veterinary care with consultation and input from the attending veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Records of acquisition were not available for 6 Asian soft-clawed otters, 3 domestic goats, 2 water buffalo, and 1 male
serval cat (“Kovu”). Records of acquisition and disposition did not include all animals imported and sold by the licensee,
including 4 six-banded armadillos imported on July 7, 2020. Recordkeeping is important for animal welfare because it may
help in locating stolen animals, investigating disease outbreaks in animals, and identifying illegal sale or movement of
animals. Correct by making, keeping, and maintaining accurate records which fully and completely disclose acquisition
and disposition records for animals, and by maintaining all records for at least 1 year after an animal leaves the property


or dies. Records should include all animals bought and sold by the licensee under this license (certificate) and site.
Correct by February 9th, 2021.
2.126(a)(4)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
During the inspection, when the inspector asked the facility representative if there were any other animals or enclosures
that needed to be inspected, the facility representative failed to disclose the location of a juvenile sloth. Animals that are
subject to the Animal Welfare Act regulations must be disclosed to APHIS inspection personnel. Correct on all future
inspections by disclosing the location of all covered animals.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
***Employees stated that a male otter escaped from his enclosure one night. The facility owner stated that this happened
2 to 3 months ago. The attending veterinarian aided in the capture of this animal the day after the night of the escape. The
animal in question was an adult male Asian soft-clawed otter, and he recovered from the incident and no injuries were
observed. Animals that escape may suffer from stress, hunger, thirst, predation, injury, or death. Correct by February 5th,
2021 by housing animals in structures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and contain the animals. At the time of this inspection, no otters were present in the enclosure from which the
escape had occurred.
7 Asian soft-clawed otters were housed in three enclosures, each enclosure containing 2 or 3 otters. The otters were
juveniles and adults. The enclosures containing the otters were outdoors and consisted of chain link walls, a covering on
top, and chicken wire and green plastic tarps covering parts of each enclosure. The otters were observed to be chewing
on the green tarps, and the edges of some of the tarps were badly torn. One tarp had a hole in it with ragged edges, and
otters were observed actively chewing at this area of the tarp. There were also small metal wires used to hold parts of the


enclosure together. One otter was observed chewing and pulling at the loose wires. Animals that chew on tarps and wires
may ingest pieces of these materials, which may result in serious, painful, and potentially deadly digestive problems such
as a gut (gastrointestinal) obstruction. Correct by February 5th, 2021 by housing animals in enclosures that are
structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.
***Three juvenile red kangaroos and three domestic goats were housed in an enclosure in which the only shelter was a
covered patio and two small unfinished rooms which an employee stated was under construction. There was a table saw
and construction materials on the patio. There were two unfinished rooms adjacent to the patio which contained tools, a
box of screws, and a large amount of exposed insulation and wires. There were animal feces on the floor in the rooms,
and animals were observed resting on the patio in close proximity to the tools. Animals may become injured by tools or
electrical wires, and may be sickened by ingesting screws or insulation. Correct by February 5th, 2021 by housing
animals in enclosures that are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
contain the animals.
3.127(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
A male 10-month-old giraffe was housed in a pasture that contained a shelter which failed to provide adequate heat for
the local climatic conditions. The shelter was an approximately 12-foot tall shed with 3 sides, a roof, and a dirt floor. At
one end of the shed, black plastic was hung enclosing an area approximately 12 feet by 12 feet in size, which contained
an oil space heater. There were large gaps between the black plastic and the walls of the structure. An employee stated
that the giraffe was closed up in the heated area of the shed at night, and that temperature in the shed was checked in the
morning and night but was not recorded. An employee stated that the heater was set to maintain a temperature between
55F and 60F at night. The night of January 28th in Ethel, Louisiana the temperature reached the mid-30F’s. At
approximately 8:00AM the giraffe calf was out of his heated shed, although employees had not let him out. Employees


stated that the giraffe could escape from the shed by pushing through or under the hanging black plastic sheet that made
up one of the walls. At this time, the outdoor temperature was 44.2F, and the temperature inside the heated part of the
shed was 44.2F. The heater in the shed was on its highest setting and was plugged in. Animals who do not have
adequate shelter from cold weather may suffer from discomfort, frostbite, or hypothermia. Animals who are young, sick, or
stressed are especially vulnerable to the impacts of cold weather exposure. Giraffes are especially susceptible to the
effects of cold weather because they do not develop a winter coat or thick layer of fat to keep them warm through the
winter, and they have a large surface area on their long legs and necks through which they lose heat. Correct by providing
adequate shelter from cold weather to protect the animal and prevent discomfort, and by continuing to monitor
temperatures within the giraffe shelter. Temporary correction by February 3rd, 2021, to provide adequate shelter and
temperatures for this juvenile animal at its current size. A permanent correction must be made by May 1st, 2021 by
constructing a taller shelter sufficient to accommodate an adult sized giraffe.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility, which houses kangaroos, giraffe, porcupine, hyena, lynx, and other exotic animals in outdoor and sheltered
enclosures, does not have an adequate and complete perimeter fence. The back of the property, behind the lynx
enclosure, is unfenced. The front of the property, from the hyena enclosure to the kangaroo and goat enclosure, is
unfenced, although a fence is being constructed and posts are present in some areas. The kangaroo and goat enclosure
is bordered on one side by a solid wood fence beyond which there is no perimeter fence. There is a perimeter fence on
one side of the property, adjacent to a small dirt road. This fence is made of wire and there are three gaps ranging in size
from 6 inches to 10 inches between the bottom of the fence and the ground. Employees indicated that they understood
the perimeter fence was required and that the property does not have a complete perimeter fence at this time. A perimeter
fence protects animals from wildlife which can spread diseases and injure captive animals. A perimeter fence also acts as


a secondary containment system in the event that an animal escapes from its primary enclosure. Correct by installing a
perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out, and to act as a secondary
containment system for animals in the facility. This issue was last cited on June 21st, 2018.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner; Dr. Cody Yager, Supervisory Animal Care
Specialist; and Bryan Irwin, Compliance Specialist.
