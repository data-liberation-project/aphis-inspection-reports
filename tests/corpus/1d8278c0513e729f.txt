2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was an adult male spider monkey with an open lesion on the anterior surface of the left shoulder. The lesion
was approximately one-half inch in diameter, circular, and reddened. The edges of the wound appeared to be
thicker than the surrounding tissue. There were crusts on the wound edge. The licensee must have this animal
examined by a veterinarian by the end of the day on Thursday, October 13, 2016. The outcome of this examination
must be provided to the inspector upon request.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There were not sufficient public barriers in the petting zoo area of the facility. The enclosure housing the juvenile
camel had no public barrier and there was not an attendant present. The inspectors watched as a customer
reached up and petted the head of the camel. When this was pointed out to the facility representative
accompanying the inspection, two attendants were summoned to the area. Later in the inspection, the attendants
were not paying attention to the customers in the area. One attendant was looking at his phone for extended
periods of time and/or doing tasks (such as raking) that diverted his attention from the customers that were petting
the animals. There was also no barrier at the end of the juvenile hog enclosure outside the giraffe barn. The
absence of a barrier allows the public access to areas with animals and could result in harm to the animals or the
public. A barrier must be present in areas that don’t have an attendant present.
To be corrected from this date forward.
3.56(d)
SANITATION.
There was an excessive accumulation of rodent feces on the surface of an elevated plywood slab in the rabbit
enclosure inside the giraffe barn. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of
pests to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
These areas must be cleaned more often.
To be corrected by: October 27, 2016.3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was an excessive accumulation of feces on the floor of the shelter of a baboon enclosure. This enclosure
was located in the drive-through portion of the facility and housed three baboons. The excessive accumulation of
feces increases the risk of contamination of insects, pests, and odors, and may harbor pathogens and play a role in
disease transmission. This enclosure must be cleaned more frequently and the waste removed daily.
3.78(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There was water covering over 75 percent of the floor of the shelter in an enclosure housing a spider monkey and a
blue monkey. There was insufficient floor area in the shelter for both non-human primates. The lack of shelter does
not provide protection from the elements and may cause distress to the animal. The facility must ensure that
adequate shelter space is provided for all animals.
To be corrected from this date forward.
3.81(b) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The environmental enrichment provided for the non-human primates was not adequate. The facilities enhancement
plan states “The toys in their cage are changed on a regular basis.” There were at least seven enclosures housing
thirteen non-human primates with no toys in the enclosure. There were other enclosures with minimal enrichment
but not toys. The lack of environmental enhancement may lead to abnormal behavior patterns and decreased
mental and emotional health. The licensee must provide environmental enhancement in accordance with currently
accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed
by the attending veterinarian that is appropriate for the species housed at the facility.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were many structures that were not being maintained.
***There was a hole in the wood siding in the giraffe barn. There were sharp points on the exposed wood.
*** The top of the chain link fence housing the juvenile camel in the walk-through area was pulled apart, with sharp
points at head level of the camel.
***There were two enclosures housing two ligers and one tiger that did not have sufficient enclosure fencing. The
exterior fence was twelve feet high with a three foot kick-in at 90 degrees. Big cat enclosures must have enclosure
fencing that is twelve feet high with a three foot kick-in at 45 degrees or have a 16 foot high fence. ***The chain link fencing used to protect trees in two enclosures was pulled apart with sharp points. There were two
ligers and one tiger in these enclosures.
***There was loose metal on several shelters in the drive-through portion of the facility. The sheet metal was pulled
away from the support structure, both exterior and interior, and in most instances was within reach of the animals
contained within the enclosure.
***The wood platforms in the big cat area on the hill were deteriorating. There were broken pieces of wood, bolts
exposed, and some of the platforms appeared unstable.
The housing facility shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
contain the animals. The licensee must remove all sharp points or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury
risk to the animals. The licensee must also repair or replace the wood platforms. The two ligers were moved to an
enclosure with an enclosed top during the inspection. The tiger must be moved to an appropriate enclosure or the
fencing in the current enclosure must be changed so that it is appropriate for the tiger.
3.127(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was insufficient shade in two enclosures housing three lions. These are the same enclosures cited on the
May 24, 2016, inspection report. There were no trees or man-made structures that provide shade. The lack of
shade can cause pain and distress to the animals. It also inhibits the animals ability to thermoregulate and prevent
overheating. The licensee must provide shade in these enclosures.
3.130
WATERING.
There were dirty water receptacles in both the drive-through and petting zoo portions of the facility. There was
bedding shavings on the bottom interior surface of the black water receptacle in the enclosure housing two juvenile
cougars. There was a greenish brown discoloration to the surface of the concrete water troughs in two enclosures
housing three tigers. There was also dirt, leaves, and other debris in the water. Contaminated water may harbor
pathogens and increases the risk of disease for these animals. The licensee must clean and sanitize these water
receptacles.
