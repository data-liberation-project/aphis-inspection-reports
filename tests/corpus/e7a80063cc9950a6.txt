No non-compliant items identified during this inspection.
This is a focused inspection on the Direct NCI from the inspection on February 11, 2014.
The veterinarian came to the facility and did multiple dentals on the affected dogs (King, #2658) and diagnosed and
provided treatment for the dogs that had eye issues. The licensee has been treating all of the affected dogs with eye
issues and has gone through the kennel and identified and worked on any dogs with buildup on their teeth.
The dogs treated with the eye medicine look much better, and the dogs that had dentals appear to be healthy and
healing well. The licensee addressed all concerns in a timely manner and has continued to document and provide
treatment.
Inspection and Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
