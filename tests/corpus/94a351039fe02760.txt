3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence is incomplete. Portions of the facility are enclosed by a six foot high wood privacy fence. The
fence does not encircle all of the regulated animal enclosures.
Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height (6 feet) to keep animals
and unauthorized persons out. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by
restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in
the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. It must be of
sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the
enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Such fences less than 3 feet in distance from the
primary enclosure, and less than 6 feet high, must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
A perimeter fence must be constructed to provide the animals in captivity protection from predators, security from
unauthorized persons entering the facility and can be used as a secondary containment in case of escape. A
detailed perimeter fence variance request can also be sent to the Eastern Regional Office for review and possible
approval.
