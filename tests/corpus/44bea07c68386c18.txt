3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter fence.
The perimeter fence for the outdoor housing facilities for 6 brown bears and 3 black bears does not meet the
requirements for dangerous animal facilities.
This violation was first cited on 04/August/2015. Although progress has been made on construction of the perimeter
fence it still has not been completed around the entire bear facility. Reasonable time has lapsed given the
remoteness, rugged terrain and weather conditions that must be considered in this part of Alaska to complete this
project.
The perimeter fence provides security for the animals and the public and the highest priority should be given to its
completion.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
