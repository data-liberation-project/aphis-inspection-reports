2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee had a program of veterinary care (PVC) form that was inadequately filled out by the attending
veterinarian. Even though the animals had documented records of vaccination, the spaces for vaccination
guidelines was blank on the PVC. There must be a written guideline approved by the attending veterinarian that the
licensee follows to maintain the health and immunity of the animals.
The PVC did not specifically identify the agent to be used in the event of euthanasia; only the route was specified
(IV injection). These items must be written in detail to provide adequate guidance to the licensee in order to ensure
proper veterinary care is provided to the animals by a licensed, certified veterinarian. Licensee can correct by
having the attending veterinarian fill in these blanks on an updated PVC form or separate document.

3.8
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
The licensee did not provide a written exercise plan for the dogs on exhibit. Licensee provides daily exercise
through the exhibitions performed as well as a separate exercise yard set up on the temporary facility site; however,
a written plan has not been formulated and approved by the attending veterinarian. A written exercise plan must be
available to APHIS officials during inspection to serve as proof that adequate exercise is provided to the dogs by the
licensee.
