ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:29pm on
03-Jun-19.
There was no response to my telephone call or knocking on the front door. I got in contact with the facility
representative two days later.
