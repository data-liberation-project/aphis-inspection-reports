* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta on the metal enclosure bar and wall board. One Snow Macaque is
in contact with the affected surfaces located in shelter housing. The affected area covers approximately 40 percent of
the surface area. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards.
This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or health risks. All surfaces of
housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and
practices. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces which any primate comes in contact with must be spot cleaned on a
daily basis and sanitized in accordance with 3.84.

conditions if cobwebs continue to collect in the primate area. Removal of cobwebs from interior building area is
necessary to ensure the health & well-being of all primates.
