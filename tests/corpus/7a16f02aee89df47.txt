INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
** Protocol TD02-2017-06-1 did not have a complete description of the proposed procedures such as surgical and
non-surgical techniques. The description also lacked explanation on the location of which the animal would be held
prior to the procedures. There must be sufficient detail in the protocol for the IACUC to understand the use of the
animals and evaluate the impact of the research projects on the animal in order to approve the protocol. The IACUC
needs to address this deficiency that was identified by being amended by the Principal Investigator and reviewed by
IACUC. Correct by May 4, 2017
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian.
