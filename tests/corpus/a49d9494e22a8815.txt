2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the building housing eleven dogs, there is one bottle of Vetericyn spray that expired in September 2014. The
licensee stated that recently she had used this medication on a dog but only one time. Expired medications may
lose their effectiveness and the health of the dog could suffer.
The use of expired medications is not considered adequate veterinary care. The expired Vetericyn spray must be
either properly disposed of, labeled as expired, or moved to a physically separate location away from any current
medications for the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
Female chocolate Labrador, #94, cited under 2.40 (b)(2) on inspection report dated April 07, 2105 has been
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian and received treatment.
Exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
