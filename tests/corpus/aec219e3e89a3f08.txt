ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection, an adult female Bactrian camel named Sorrey was instructed by the attending veterinarian to be
sprayed with a product called "(cid:28)Endure"(cid:29) to prevent and control fly bites; however, the animal care staff did not use
the product. There were concerns about the product negatively impacting the health of the nursing calve. According
to the attending veterinarian, the staff was instructed to limit the use of the Endure product but to still use it. By not
following a veterinarian(cid:25)s instructions animals can become significantly injured and even result in an animal(cid:25)s death.
Veterinarian instructions must be completely followed to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care.

During inspection, an adult female Tayra named Aisha housed individually in enclosure JTB-29/30 was determined
to be in need of medical care but had not been seen by a veterinarian or received any form of treatment. The first
half of the tail was completely void of hair. The majority of exposed tail skin was significantly red in color that ranged
from light pink to dark red. The back side of the left hind leg also had hair loss with an approximate 2 inch area of
raised, swollen red tissue located in the middle of the hair loss on the leg. The animal was pacing back and forth in
the front section of the enclosure while biting and chewing at the areas of hair loss on both the tail and back side of
the left hind leg. According to staff, this animal has a history of skin problems. At the time of inspection, the animal
had not been seen by a veterinarian and was not being treated. Delays in providing necessary veterinary care not
only negatively impact the welfare of the animal but can lead to the worsening of the original condition along
secondary infections of the skin. It is the responsibility of the facility to ensure all animals are provided veterinary
care in a timely manner. Correct by ensuring all animals are adequately evaluated and treated in a timely manner.

During inspection, an adult female Bactrian camel named Sorrey had significant number of flies around all 4 legs
along with dozens of small dark red spots that had the appearance of dried blood. There was also hair loss on all
four legs. The camel appeared to be severely bothered by the flies and was observed using its tail to swat at the
flies while also scratching its legs together. Flies can serve as a source of infection and can led to self-inflicted
injuries while severely decreasing the welfare of the affected animals. The facility must provide adequate care to
prevent, control, and treat diseases including ectoparasite infestations.

During inspection, a female Tayra named Aisha housed individually in enclosure JTB-29/30 was determined to be in
need of medical care but it was not communicated to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner. The animal
care-taker on 6/15/2014 wrote in the daily observation form (cid:28)pulling more hair off tail(cid:29) and listed it as a behavioral
info. There was no previous information listed about the hair loss before and was not communicated to the
veterinarian. Additionally, on 6/16/2014 the animal care-taker correctly identified the critical condition of the animal
around 6:30AM, but only reported it to a veterinarian around 11:30AM. By under reporting observations of diseases
or waiting an excessive amount of time to report the observation to a veterinarian it can lead to the worsening of the
disease along with decreasing the welfare of the animal. It is vital that the communication between the animal care
staff and attending veterinarian is done in a timely and accurate manner.

SANITATION.
All six indoor rhinoceroses(cid:25) enclosures have significant amounts of accumulation of brown to tan debris on the walls
and bars of the enclosure. According to the staff, the urine from the rhinoceroses adheres to the surfaces of the
enclosure and makes it difficult to remove. During the inspection, the Veterinary Medical Officer and Animal Care
Inspector were able to use their fingers to scratch off some of the debris. Cleaning strategies were discussed. The
accumulation of debris can function as a suitable environment for bacteria to grow and can serve as an opportunity
of infection for the animals in the enclosure. Proper cleaning removes all sources that promote bacteria growth. The
primary enclosure must be cleaned as often as necessary to remove excreta in order to minimize disease hazards
and reduce odors.Corrected by: 6/25/2014
The Inspection was conducted with the Director of Animal Collections and the Curator of Mammals, and the exit
