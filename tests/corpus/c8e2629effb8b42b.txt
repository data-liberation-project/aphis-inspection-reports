SANITATION.
Pest control.
1. There was an excessive number of common house flies noted inside the guinea pigs' primary enclosure and
several times the inspector observed the animals move whenever one of the flies landed on or near them. This item
affected 3 guinea pigs.
Per this Section of the Regulations, an effective program for the control of insects should be established and
maintained. This is important for the health and well-being of the guinea pigs because insects can carry diseases
and cause distress to the guinea pigs as well as contaminate and affect the palatability of their feed.
The licensee needs to improve the current pest control practices to minimize the number of flies for the health and
well-being of the guinea pigs.
