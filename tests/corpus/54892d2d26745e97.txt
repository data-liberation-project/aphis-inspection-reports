2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
Six incidents of serious orthopedic injuries in non-human primates have been identified by the facility this year. The
facility has identified that a new handling technique being implemented was a factor in causing the injuries.
Orthopedic injuries can be painful for animals and handling methods must not cause orthopedic injuries. Handling
of animals must be done as carefully as possible to avoid physical harm to the animals.
Note: The affected animals received veterinary treatment. The Attending Veterinarian and IACUC were adequately
and promptly notified of the injuries and appropriate steps are being taken to prevent further occurrences.
Correction: Ensure corrective actions are followed.
Exit interview conducted with facility representatives.
