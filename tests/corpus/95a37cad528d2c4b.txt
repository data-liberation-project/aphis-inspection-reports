3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the alpaca yard housing the alpacas, llamas, goats, and cow, there is a rusty wire protruding into the animal area
near the entrance to the barn. The grate covering the drain in the wallaby enclosure is broken resulting in a sharp
point and a possible area of entrapment for the one wallaby.
Failure to eliminate sharp points and damaged areas in the enclosures could result in injury to the animals.
The indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Sanctuary Manager.
