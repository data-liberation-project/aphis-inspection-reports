FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Along the back corners of the shelter for one adult camel named "Skittles" is large open gaps. The wall on the left
side of the shelter is bending outward (warped). These large gaps on both sides allow the wind and rain to enter
the shelter and does not adequately protect the animal from inclement weather. Provide natural or artificial shelter
for all animals housed outdoors to afford protection and to prevent discomfort.
