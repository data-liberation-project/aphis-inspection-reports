ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00pm on
19-Sep-16.During that time, the inspector knocked on the door of the house on the property. The inspector called
the phone number on file and left a message. The inspector then waited 30 minutes in the driveway of the property
before leaving.
Lack of availability for inspection prevents any oversight by APHIS Officials in enforcement of the Animal Welfare
Act. Correct by establishing optimal hours for inspection with the home inspector, and ensuring that a responsible
adult is available during those times for inspection. Correct from this time forward.
