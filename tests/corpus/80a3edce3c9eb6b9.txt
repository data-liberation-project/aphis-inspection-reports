2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was an individually housed male English Bulldog (#0A0*202*4128) with a right eye that was red. Upon
closer observation, a cloudy bluish grey circular-like area was present on the central portion of the eye. The entire
area of the eye that is normally white was red. The tissues surrounding the bottom portion of the eyelid also
appeared slightly inflamed and red. A small amount of yellowish green crusty discharge was present mostly on the
outside corner of the eye. The licensee stated she had been cleaning the eye out every couple days with a wet
cloth to clean off yellow crust but this had not been done for a couple of days. When asked if the dog had been
seen by a veterinarian for the right eye condition, the licensee stated that the dog had been seen by a veterinarian
"months ago" for the right eye and it had been treated for a scratch on the eye. There was no documentation
provided by the licensee regarding the veterinarian's evaluation of this dog's eye condition. However, according to
the licensee, the attending veterinarian had also been onsite and had examined all the dogs on September 28,
2015. There was written documentation from this onsite visit initialed by the veterinarian and it stated that there
were "no problems" under the notes section for this dog. The condition of this dog's eye could indicate an injury,
illness or other veterinary medical condition which may be uncomfortable. The licensee must have this dog seen by
a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and that an appropriate treatment plan
is developed and followed. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals recieve adequate veterinary care a all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning Surfaces.
***In the facility's sheltered buildings, at least 11 enclosures affecting approximately 20 dogs, there is a
blackish/brown dirt and grime buildup on the dog entry doors and doorway walls. The doorways are approximately
30%-60% covered in grime. The accumulation of dirt and grime can cause diseases and attract pests. Cleanliness
is important to the health and well-being of the animals. The licensee must ensure that enclosures are spot cleaned
daily and sanitized at least every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt and grime
and other disease hazards.
