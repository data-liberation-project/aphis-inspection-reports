SANITATION.
There are several large regions of the kitchen floor in which the top layer has either eroded or been chipped away,
leaving large indentations in the floor. These exposed areas in the floor are susceptible to debris and bacterial
build-up due to the inability to properly clean them, which can then be tracked into other areas of the facility.
Premises, including buildings and grounds, need to be kept in good repair in order to protect the health of the
animals. Correct by replacing the surfaces of the kitchen floor that are missing. Correct by January 20, 2018.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
