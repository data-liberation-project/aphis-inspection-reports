2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Required facility records including the program of veterinary care, animal inventory/acquisition records, and records
of animal dispositions were not available for review at the time of inspection. The unavailability of the required
records does not allow APHIS Officials to determine if the records are accurate and complete, that the program of
veterinary care is being followed to ensure the health of the animals, or for the proper tracking of the animals. All
required records at the facility must be maintained so they are available for review at the time of inspection.
This is a new site inspection. All items at this new site must be compliant prior to conducting regulated activities.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
