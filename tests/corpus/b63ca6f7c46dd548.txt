2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Two protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) did not contain an adequate
rationale for the number of animals to be used.
Protocol #9722 was approved for 70 hamsters per year, in addition to various numbers of other species. In the
original approved protocol(cid:25)'s description of how the animal numbers requested were calculated there is no mention
of hamsters or hamster numbers. On the renewal form, which also requests 70 hamsters, under "How was this
number of animals determined" it states: "By considering power analyses and genetic characteristics", but these
analyses or further info is not provided. It is uncertain why 70 hamsters are needed, or why this number was
approved. Additional documentation provided by the facility also mentions power analyses used to determine the
need, but does not include any such calculations to explain how the hamster numbers were generated.
Protocol # 9677 was approved for 300 gerbils per year. In the description of how the animal numbers requested
were calculated there is a reference to a "Table of Animal Usage". The facility provided this document, and it
explains that there are three stages to the study that each call for 100 gerbils, but there is not an explanation as to
why 100 gerbils are needed. In the renewal document, under "How were the animal numbers determined?" it says
that the numbers were based on last year(cid:25)'s animal usage (which was 0 gerbils) and refers to the aforementioned
"Table of Animal Usage".
Failure to provide a rationale for animal numbers requested for use could result in unnecessary use of animals. The
IACUC should ensure that the investigator has provided a clear, adequate rationale for the number of animals
requested.
To be corrected by 6/1/16 in these two protocols, and in all approved protocols by the time of the next routine
inspection.
2.33(b)(2)ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In a room where seventeen rabbits were being housed, there were unidentifiable pharmaceutical products present.
A dropper vial and an ointment tube, both opened, were found on the countertop, and the veterinary staff was not
able to identify these products. The drugs were eventually identified, via internet search, as an ophthalmic antibiotic
(drops and ointment each containing Ofloxacin). The products were not properly labeled (they are labeled in a
foreign language, possibly Korean), and one appeared to be expired.
The presence of improperly labeled drugs in an animal room could result in errors that could be harmful to the
animals. Proper labeling of pharmaceutical products allows veterinary and Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee personnel to assess animal use activities.
All pharmaceuticals used on the animals should be clearly labeled and identifiable. The facility should reinforce the
importance of this issue with all personnel involved in animal use.
Corrected at the time of inspection, and to be adhered to for all animal use areas from this time forward.
This inspection was conducted on 3/29/16 and 3/30/16 by Veterinary Medical Officers Dr. Pamela L. Smith, Dr.
Marcy Rosendale, and Dr. Michael Schnell.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representatives.
