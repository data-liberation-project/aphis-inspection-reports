2.132(d) Critical

Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
On 01/20/2022, the licensee knowingly acquired a young female red kangaroo from an unlicensed dealer. The licensee
was previously informed that a USDA license is required to sell or trade exotic mammals, and was aware that this dealer
was not currently licensed by USDA.
Licensure under the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) is important for animal welfare and wellbeing, because license holders are
subject to oversight and inspections to ensure compliance with AWA regulations.
Correct from this day forth by acquiring exotic mammals (including kangaroos) only from sources that are currently
licensed under the Animal Welfare Act, if licensure is required.
3.137(a)(1)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
On 02/04/2022, a female African crested porcupine was transported in a collapsible wire crate. Collapsible cages may
collapse with an animal inside during transport, injuring the animal or permitting the animal to escape. Correct by ensuring
that transport containers are strong enough to withstand the normal rigors of transportation. Correct from this day forth.

This inspection was conducted with a representative of the licensee, and the exit interview was conducted with the
licensee.
