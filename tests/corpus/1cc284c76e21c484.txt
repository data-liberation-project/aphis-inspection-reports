HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the squirrel monkey enclosure, a wooden den box was observed to shift downwards when a squirrel monkey
jumped on top of it. Failure to secure den boxes in place may injure the animals. Furniture-type fixtures or objects
must be sturdily constructed and must be strong enough to provide for the safe activity and welfare of nonhuman
primates. A system should be in place to ensure furniture in animal enclosures are monitored regularly to ensure
their safety.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the squirrel money enclosure, the surfaces of one wooden den box appeared worn and was not being maintained
in a manner that allowed it to be readily cleaned and sanitized. Failure to maintain surfaces in a manner that can be
readily cleaned and sanitized can adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals. All surfaces must be
maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other furniture-type
fixtures and objects within the facility--that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or
soiled.
