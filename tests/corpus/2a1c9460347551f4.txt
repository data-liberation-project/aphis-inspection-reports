FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Outdoor Housing Facilities.
The following structural issues were identified for the outdoor pens.
1. The pen housing 2 large sized goats (which have large, thick, curved horns) has several areas of the fence with
structural issues. The single horizontal bar that had been located at mid height of the fence to provide additional
support to the chain link had fallen off in 2 adjacent approximately 8 foot long sections of the fence. The chain link
fencing bows outward as a result of the goats pushing against the unsupported chain link. The unsupported
sections of chain link affect the structural integrity of the fence.
2. Also noted in the corner of the same goat pen, the gate closest to the barn also needs repair. The ½ inch wide
solid strip of metal along the vertical edge of the chain link next to the vertical post of the fence has been bent from
the goats pushing against it. As a result there is a long tapered elliptical shaped space at least 20 inches high by 6
inches at widest point that is a hazard to the goats for possible entrapment of their horns or limbs.
3. The 1x1½ inch wire mesh attached to the inside wall of one stall inside the barn has several areas that have
detached from the wall and there also are broken welds with sharp points. The sharp points of wire could cause an
injury to the skin or eyes of the 3 goats that are housed in the stall.
4. The pen near the office that houses 1 goat and 1 pony has 2 vertical wooden posts that are deteriorating at
ground level. These 2 vertical posts as well as the 2 panel gate wobbled when the inspector applied gentle
pressure. The wobbling of the posts and gate indicate that the structural integrity of the fence is compromised.
5. Also noted in the same pen near the office, a portion of the end of one horizontal board next to the gate had
rotted away and as a result the end of one of the the long nails that had secured the board to the vertical post was
sticking out into the pen. The protruding nail could cause an injury to the skin or eyes of the goat.Per this Section of the Regulations, outdoor housing facilities must be constructed of such material and of such
strength as appropriate for the animals involved. In addition, outdoor housing facilities shall also be structurally
sound and be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
The Licensee needs to repair or replace the structural issues identified for these 2 pens for the safety and health of
the animals and to ensure that the housing facilities are maintained in good repair.
Correct items 3 and 5 by 8/16/17. Correct items 1, 2, and 4 by 12/1/17.
NOTE - Exit briefing held 8/10/17 on-site with facility representatives. Report delivered by e-mail 8/11/17.
