Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The complete disposition record for two tiger cubs born 4/29/2021 was not available. Correct and complete records must
be maintained and available so animal tracing can be done if needed (for example--health tracing). Maintain completed
and correct records as required.

Correct from this day forward.
2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On or before 5/24 (the licensee said they don't remember the date), a male tiger cub that was younger than 4 weeks old
at the time was transported by an employee (with permission from the facility) to a classroom for what the facility reports
was for an educational discussion on why big cats don't make good pets. The facility said only the employee fed it and
handled it and discussed its care to the class.
Public exhibition of young tigers less than 4 weeks old puts them at risk for getting sick. Nondomestic cats of this age do
not have a completely developed immune system and are unable to fight off disease and infection. Handling of animals
must be done as careful as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, behavioral stress, physical


harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Protect young nondomestic cats from these conditions by not transporting and
exhibiting cubs that are 4 weeks (28 days) or younger in age.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
