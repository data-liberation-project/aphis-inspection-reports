2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At least 5 goats and 2 pigs in the petting zoo area had excessive hoof growth.
A mature Aoudad ram continues to be unable to use either front foot/leg in a normal manner when walking and the
front hooves appear to be overgrown. There was another Auodad located beside the entrance road that had an
overgrown hoof on the left hind foot. The hoof was beginning to curl upward. This Auodad had a slight limp on the
left hind leg. The attending veterinarian has not examined either of the Auodads in at least two months. Abnormal
postures and gaits can indicate a serious, painful problem with the feet.
A Male Pere David's Deer had a front hoof that appeared to be twisted approximately 90 degrees outward from the
other three hooves. The affected hoof was overgrown and pointing skyward. There appeared to be a significant
buildup of brown wet organic matter on the hoof that made it impossible to see the foot or most of the hoof. The
owner stated that the animal was injured approximately three years ago.
A Gaur standing beside the Rhino enclosure stopped in front of the inspectors and lifted its tail. It proceeded to
evacuate a watery brown fluid from its rectum for several seconds before walking on. When asked, the owner
stated that he was unaware of any of the Gaur having diarrhea.
A ten year old Watusi named Goliath was observed to be noticeably thinner than it had been on the prior inspection.
Several ribs and its hip bone was prominent through its flesh and it had a slight but noticeable tilt in its head. The
owner stated that he had given the animal several dewormers and that the attending veterinarian had not been
made aware of the situation
The attending veterinarian must be made aware of changes in animals health in order to adequately treat them.
The licensee must have the above listed animals assessed by the attending veterinarian and a written plan of
treatment or diagnosis must be created and followed.
2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL REPEATATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
According to the licensee the following animal deaths have occurred since the last inspection:
A male kangaroo, a female giraffe, two eland, and one lemur. In these cases, the animals died suddenly and
unexpectedly. The attending veterinarian was not notified of these, nor was a necropsy preformed to determine the
cause of death.
Since the last inspection, a watusi became lethargic and began having trouble standing. Over the course of three
days, the animal deteriorated, became unable to stand and eventually died. The attending veterinarian was not
notified throughout this three day period nor was a cause of death determined.
The attending veterinarian was not notified about any of these animal deaths, nor does the licensee know how the
animals died. Without appropriate methods to diagnose and treat injuries and illness, animal conditions may
worsen or in this case, the animals condition may become fatal. Animals must have access to adequate veterinary
care as prescribed in the formal arrangements.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Six Llamas were recently given to the licensee. Two Jacobs Four Horned Sheep were also brought on to the facility
grounds and placed on exhibit. However, no record of acquisition, or any other written documents stating where
these animals or any other animal at the facility came from, could be presented to the inspectors.
At least seven animals have expired since the last inspection. However, no documentation or dates could be
presented.
A written inventory of animals on hand has not been updated to reflect animal births, deaths, or new animals at the
facility in at least two months.
Records of animals on hand, acquisition, disposition, and transportation of all animals that come, go or reside in the
facility grounds is essential and necessary in order to properly track the animals whereabouts at any given time.
The licensee must develop a record of all mammals exhibited on the facility grounds and ensure that it is kept up to
date as needed when animals are born, expire, or are bought, sold or otherwise transferred on or off of the facility
grounds.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There are no barrier fences for the two Pagonian Cavy. There are no barrier fences for two adult Giraffes and one adolescent Giraffe housed directly next to the petting zoo
area, which also does not have an attendant present.
This facility does not have an effective barrier that prevents the public from reaching some animals. During public
exhibition, any animal must be handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general
viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
No attendants were present in the following areas in which the public could have access to animals: Giraffes,
Patagonian Cavies, goats, pigs, sheep. With out an adequate number of employees, there is a significant health
and safety risk for both the animals and public. The licensee must ensure that areas with public access be attended
by an adequate number of knowledgeable employees or have adequate barriers to ensure that the animals remain
secured and unmolested in their enclosures.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility grounds are surrounded by a barrier made up of a mixture of a thick density steel type fencing, what the
licensee called pig wire, and cattle panels. In multiple areas throughout the facility, sections of this fencing were
excessively rusted, corroded to the point that there were small gaps noticed in some areas, and damage causing
sharp and twisted points in the fencing.
In the Giraffe enclosure, the fencing is significantly bent and loose. Damage to the fencing was causing sharp and
rusted points to be exposed.
The American Buffalo enclosure contained several areas of fencing that were excessively rusted or damaged,
exposing bunched up and/or sharp points.
The hay barn, which also has a shelter built out of each side of the barn, contained walls that were excessively
rusted. Some panels on the back walls were separating and folding out, causing sharp surfaces near feeding
troughs. Sharp, rusted nail heads were observed in this same area, near feeding troughs. One section of the wall
had recently collapsed.
The enclosure containing a Watusi and two cows contained sections of damaged and rusted fencing.The enclosure containing two muntjac contained sections of damage and excessive rust.
The Kangaroo enclosure contained areas of excessive rust and damage causing sharp points to be exposed. The
same enclosure was covered over with mesh fencing that was in place with several pieces of twisted wire. These
caused multiple sharp metal pieces several inches long to point inside the enclosure.
A large enclosure containing white tailed deer was in disrepair, and the fencing was separating from the supporting
posts in some areas.
An enclosure containing two Jacob's Four Horned Sheep was in disrepair, and the fencing was loose in some
areas. The fence between the Jacob Sheep and the nursery goats was leaning toward the nursery goat enclosure.
A wire panel had been placed against that fence on the opposite end from the barn. The wire panel was detached
from the post leaving a gap in which the Jacob Sheep could be injured or become entrapped.
The petting zoo area containing sheep, goats and pigs was in disrepair. Fencing was rusted and damaged in some
places, and several long nails were sticking out of wooden boards making up the bottom of the fence.
A fence directly in front of the Gaur barn was bent and damaged.
Fencing and shelters in disrepair can cause animals within to become injured and poses hazards including but not
limited to injury, animals escaping or unwanted animals entering enclosures. The licensee must repair, replace, or
discontinue using these areas to enclose animals.
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In several areas throughout the complex, there were areas in excess of ten feet wide and up to several feet thick of
what appeared to be excreta and used hay. Recent and fresh hay had been placed on top of these areas, and
Animals were observed feeding and climbing on the hay.
Excreta, rubbish, and used bedding that is not properly disposed of in a timely manner can soil the animals, and
attract insects and vermin to the area. Areas within the complex must remain clean and free of excess waste.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The entire facility ground is surrounded by a perimeter fence. However, a majority of the hoofstock animals have
free range access within the complex and are not enclosed in any type of pen causing the complex fence to act as a
large single enclosure without any sort of perimeter fence or secondary containment. The entrance and exit to thefacility contain large drive through gates that remain open when the facility is open. There are no attendants in
place to keep animals from escaping the facility grounds through this manner. There are cattle guards on the road
in several sections of the park which the owner has stated the animals will not cross. However, on at least one
occasion, hoofed animals were seen jumping over one of these cattle guards.
The licensee has stated that the perimeter fence is approximately 7.5 feet tall. One rhinoceros at the facility
requires a perimeter fence at least 8 feet fall.
An appropriate perimeter fence is required to prevent public contact with the animals and to serve as secondary
containment. Perimeter fences less than 6 feet high or less than 8 feet high for dangerous animals, such as the
rhinoceros, must be approved in writing by the Administrator. However, this facility does not have a variance in
place.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The Javalina enclosure contained animal feed and vegetables that appeared to have been dropped onto the ground
inside the enclosure instead of being placed into a sanitized receptacle. Contamination of food by animal waste,
insects or vermin can cause animals who ingest it to become ill. Food must be given to animals in sanitized
receptacles.
In the area directly surrounding the food receptacle for the Jacob's Four Horned Sheep, there was deteriorated food
pellets on the ground that were covered in whitish grey mold.
Animal excreta was observed in the feeding receptacle of the white tailed deer enclosure.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The following areas contained watering receptacles that were discolored, and contained green, organic material
inside: Jacobs four horned sheep, Muntjac, Wallaby, goats, and a large receptacle beside the hay barn. The
Jacobs water receptacle contained a multitude of insects inside the water.
Animals are susceptible to parasites and can become ill from contaminated or unclean water. Animals must be
provided clean fresh water in sanitized receptacles.
3.132 REPEATEMPLOYEES.
The licensee has one less employee than he did at prior inspections. The licensee stated that he has problems
getting the employees that he does have to do adequate work. Based on the number of noncompliances, animals
observed with health abnormalities, and animal deaths since the prior inspection, the facility does not have an
adequate number of trained and knowledgeable employees to conduct adequate husbandry practices. Without an
adequate number of employees, the facility can fall into disrepair, animals with health problems may go unnoticed
and there is a health and safety risk to the public. The licensee must gain a sufficient number of adequately trained
employees, supervised by a person or persons with a background in animal care.
This inspection was conducted with site owner on 2/28/2018.
Exit interview was conducted with site owner on 2/29/2018.
