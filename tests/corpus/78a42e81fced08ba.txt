PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements.(2) Primary enclosures.
****
One enclosure in the whelping building housing three puppies had a floor with openings big enough that the puppies
feet and legs were passing through the 1" x 1" coated wire floor. These openings could allow for the puppies to get
stuck or easily injured. The outside portion of the Wheaten sheltered building had wood slatted floors. The wood
slatted floor had about a 1 1/4" gap between the slats. Some of the wood slats have come loose and moved,
causing a larger gap, (doubling the gap) which the dogs feet and legs were passing through. The animals' feet and
legs falling through the openings in the enclosure floor could cause injury. The licensee must ensure that
appropriate flooring is used to prevent the animals' feet from passing through the openings in the floor.

The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
