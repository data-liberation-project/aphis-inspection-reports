2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 3 rabbits with medical conditions that had not been observed. One rabbit (Barn 4, H66) had a snotty nose with
thick white nasal discharge. One rabbit (Barn 5) had a blackened mammary gland in the left mammary chain near the
armpit. One rabbit (Barn 5 EG68) had red and raw wound on top of the left hind foot, encompassing at least half the foot.
Daily observations had already been completed on these animals at the time of inspection. Daily observations of all
animals are important to assess their health and well-being, so problems can be communicated to the AV or treated as
directed in the Veterinary care plan. Correct from this day forward by ensuring daily observations are done in a thorough
manner to insure that all problems are addressed quickly.
2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
During inspection of Barn 4, an inspector noticed a rabbit in the drainage gutter in the northeastern corner. The juvenile
rabbit ran through the gutter and left the building. During the inspection, facility representatives were able to catch the
rabbit and the rabbit was euthanized due to loss of biosecurity. A facility representative said the rabbit likely got loose
during routine movement of animals on the site. Handling of all animals shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner
that does not cause trauma to the animal. Animals that are not secured within the facility can experience excessive heat,


cold, behavioral stress, predation, and loss of life. Correct from this day forward by ensuring animals are handled as
expeditiously and carefully as possible.
2.134

Contingency planning.
There is no written contingency plan for this site, and it is not clear that the staff have been trained to a contingency plan.
Contingency plans need to be in place and relevant to each unique site so that all employees know what to do in case of
disasters, facility breakdowns, electrical outages, and animal escapes, among other problems. Correct by 12/07/22 by
developing a relevant contingency plan and training employees to insure they know how to respond to an adverse event.
3.50(d)

Facilities, general.
There was a buildup of rabbit urine in Barn 4 that led to excessive ammonia odors in the atmosphere of the building
causing the eyes of the inspectors to burn and their noses to run. The rabbits are in suspended wire cages over a packed
dirt floor. Waste is removed from underneath the cages on a weekly basis and had been removed 4 days prior to
inspection. There were puddles of standing water and urine, and while there was an attempt to cut drainage gutters in
places, they were not sufficient to drain the waste adequately. Provisions should be made for the removal of animal
wastes to minimize buildup of odors and disease hazards. Correct by 2/16/22 by adequately addressing drainage of
waste liquids in Barn 4.
3.51(c)

Facilities, indoor.
In barn 4, lighting was insufficient to perform normal husbandry and inspection of all enclosures. There were 8 rows of
suspended cages and the first and last rows of cages, closest to the walls, were very dimly lit, requiring a flashlight to
adequately inspect. One rabbit was noted as having a snotty nose and the health tech stated they had not noticed the


snotty nose because they did not have their flashlight. Without sufficient lighting, daily health observations, routine
husbandry of rabbits, and maintenance of cages can be missed. Correct by 12/16/22 by providing well-distributed, ample
lighting.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
