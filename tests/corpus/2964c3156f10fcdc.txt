FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Six rabbits are housed in a room that is used to store bedding , lab coats and miscellaneous materials. The room is
cluttered with these materials. Animal housing areas should be maintained free of clutter and stored materials not
used for the daily care of the animals to facilitate husbandry. All rabbits must be housed in areas free of stored
materials. Correct By : 9-1-16

SANITATION.
All the air vents in the main rabbit housing room are coated with rabbit hair. The hair is covering greater than 50 %
of the surface of at least 2 vents . There are cob webs and rabbit hair collecting in the corners and along the upper
edge of the walls. A black substance is noted on the right wall next to one air vent. Allowing such an accumulation
of hair on the vents may lead to less air flow in and out of the room which may cause animal discomfort. The vents ,
ceilings and walls must be cleaned with such frequency to prevent a build up of hair and other materials to maintain
husbandry . CORRECT BY : 8-19-16
The inspection was conducted and exit briefing was conducted by Dr. Pannill - USDA with a facility employee.
