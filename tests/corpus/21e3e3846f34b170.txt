ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was a female Yorkshire Terrier "Cricket" (# 941000013549658) with a dental condition at the facility. The
dog was observed with the tip of her tongue hanging outside of her mouth. There were also some small clumps of
brown to yellow material matted in strips of the fur around the eyes of the dog. Upon closer observation of both
sides of the mouth, the dog was missing some teeth. The remaining teeth had a heavy build-up of yellowish brown
to black material on them. This abnormal build-up of material covered the majority of the remaining cheek teeth and
extended into the gum line. The gums had receded along some of these teeth. Much of the root of the lower left
canine tooth was exposed and the tooth was easily moved and wiggled within its location. The dog would
consistently lick while observing her mouth. According to the licensee, this dog's dental condition had not been
identified prior to the inspection and a veterinarian had not been contacted. The abnormal build-up of material on
the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures. This condition could be painful, may decrease
the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall health of the animal. The licensee must have this
animal examined by a veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is made and an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must establish and maintain programs of adequate
veterinary care at all times. TO BE CORRECTED BY: July 22, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
