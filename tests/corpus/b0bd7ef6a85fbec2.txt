HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The rope ladder in the outdoor enclosure for the vervet has become detached from the enclosure fence at one of
the four attachment points leaving the ladder tilted and unsecured which could allow the vervet to fall when climbing
on it. There is a wire feed basket attached to the enclosure fence with twisted wire that has exposed sharp points.
These sharp points could cause the vervet to become injured. The ladder shall be secured or removed and all sharp
points shall be removed to protect vervet from injury. Correct by April 14, 2016.

***The base of the primary enclosure for the lions is reinforced with large boulders and rocks. There are gaps
between some of the large rocks in areas that the facility currently uses to feed the lions. These gaps are large
enough to allow the lions to stretch their paws and a portion of their forelimb through. Although the foundation
around the enclosure is primarily hard rock (boulders), we observed a softer substrate at a couple of the feeding
gaps that could allow the lions to dig deeper and enlarge the feeding hole potentially allowing an escape. All areas
shall be made secure. If the openings are required for feeding, they should be reinforced or constructed in a manner
that will not allow them to be enlarged, thereby ensuring that the lions are securely contained within their enclosure.

***The chain link of the divider fence between the enclosure for the two white tigers and the enclosure with the white
tiger and Bengal tiger has been bent and pulled in the left front corner and toward the middle of the fence leaving
jagged points that could cause injury. The fence material shall be repaired or replaced to protect the tigers from
injury. Correct by April 21, 2016.
