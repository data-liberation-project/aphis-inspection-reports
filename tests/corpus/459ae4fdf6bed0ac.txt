3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At the time of inspection, the facility still does not have an appropriate perimeter fence that contains the regulated
animals at the facility. This facility has a perimeter fence around the primary enclosures for the fox, nutria and
raccoon that is comprised of three sides: a brick wall connected to the store entrance which faces the front of the
property and a chain link fence on each opposite side, all at least six feet high. There is NO fourth side. Perimeter
fences must be properly constructed as a secondary containment so as to protect and contain the regulated species
and prevent unwanted entry by animals and unauthorized persons.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with APHIS personnel Dr. Simone Tomlinson, VMO and the facility
manager.
