PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were several points from the ends of the chain link fencing composing the walls of dog run #12 that were
pointing into the enclosure at a level where the dogs may come in contact with them and become injured. All
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so they have no sharp dog. Correct by April 14, 2014.

EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
There is no written exercise plan or exemptions for the dogs. Dealers must develop, document, and follow an
appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. In addition, the plan must be approved by the
attending veterinarian. The plan must include written standard procedures to be followed in providing the
opportunity for exercise. The plan must be made available to APHIS upon request. Correct by March 21, 2014

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are 18 sheep, 2 goats and 1 cow, contained in a large pasture. There is only one 12 X 12 shelter provided to
allow the animals to get out of inclement weather. Extended exposure to inclement weather (cold, rain, etc) may
cause illness. This shelter is not large enough to adequately and comfortably accommodate the number of animals
contained in that enclosure. Additional shelter shall be provided. Correct by April 14, 2014.
