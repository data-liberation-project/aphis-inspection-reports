CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
A dog was encountered at the Animal Quarantine center that had arrived from LAX to HNL with Hawaiian Airlines
baggage tag HA IA 60 32 55. The owner's certification regarding feeding and watering on top of the kennel had
been completed incorrectly: the date entered for last time the animal was offered food was 2-29-15, and the "29"
was scribbled over and not completely legible. The carrier should take steps to ensure that ticket counter personnel
carefully review the information provided by the owner to verify that it is compete and accurate in order to protect
the well-being of the animal.
To be corrected immediately.
