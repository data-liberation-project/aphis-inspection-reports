ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the outdoor housing enclosures the following dogs were observed to have hair loss on the tips or edges of their
ears: male Akita "Bailey" microchip #010837062, and female Akita "Torie" microchip #076621343. On "Torie" the
areas of hair loss were heavily covered with flies. On "Bailey" the areas of hair loss were covered with flies but
were not as heavily infested as "Torie".
Male Akita "Osaka" microchip #070805851 was observed to have several flies on both ear tips, but hair loss was
not noticed.
The licensee confirmed that all three dogs have "fly strike" on their ears and he has a salve that he puts on their
ears.
Flies congregating on animals and hair loss can be signs of veterinary care issues. The animals listed above must
be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. This information including diagnosis, treatment, and resolution of the
condition must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor enclosures, housing at least ten adult Akita dogs, the enclosures have cement floors and the feces
has been removed from these enclosures but has been piled up around the edges of the cement flooring. There
were a large number of flies observed to be accumulating on and around these piles of feces. An accumulation of
animal and food waste can lead to pest and odor buildup and pose a health hazard to the dogs. Housing facility
operators must provide for frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food waste. Correction date: June 30, 2015

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One enclosure, housing four adult Golden Retrievers, has outdoor flooring that is constructed of coated wire. Part
of this wire has broken and has created a gap in the flooring along with sharp points the dogs could step on.
Broken wire flooring could cause injury to the dog'(cid:25)s feet or legs. The licensee must replace or repair this flooring
and ensure that all enclosure flooring is constructed in a manner that protects the dogs from injury.
