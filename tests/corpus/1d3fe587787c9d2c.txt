ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three adult dogs were observed to have medical conditions.
A red and white Boston Terrier (m/c# 985121005255980) had tearing around its left eye. Upon further observation,
there was a thick, white, gelatinous film over the eye. There was a bluish-white opacity to the cornea.
The left eye of a red and white Boston Terrier female (m/c# 0A02323572) had very red tissue on the outer edge of
the eye, with tearing. The eye had a flattened area near the center.
Eye conditions can be painful and worsen very quickly. If left untreated or not treated appropriately, the dog can
lose its vision or eye. These dogs must be evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment.

An Olde English Bulldog, (m/c# 002011015A0) was observed to be rubbing her face and ears along the fence. She
was squinting, tearing and the skin around her eyes appeared swollen. Upon further observation, the inside of both
ears were dark red with a moderate dark brown discharge. There was a moderate odor to the ears. Ear conditions
can be irritating and even painful to the dog and can worsen if not treated appropriately. This dog must be
evaluated by a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment.
Documentation of evaluations and treatment must be available to APHIS officials.
