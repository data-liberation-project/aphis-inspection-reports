2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male red fox has a large, swollen, dark-colored, hairless area on the right side of the neck. The affected area is
covering the majority of the surface of the right side of the neck and is wrapping around on the underside of the
neck. The affected area contains many open wounds, as well as, a dark scab-like material across the surface. A
white-colored discharge is dripping from one open wound and fresh blood was also noticed coming from at least
one other wound. The hair surrounding the affected area is wet and tinted with a red color.
The licensee had not noticed the condition of this fox's neck, but thought it might have been caused by a fight with
the female fox also housed in the same enclosure.
Open wounds could cause pain and discomfort to the animal. A white-colored discharge, as well as, areas of
inflammation or swelling could indicate an underlying infection which may have a negative impact on the health of
the animal.
This fox must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment
plan. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
