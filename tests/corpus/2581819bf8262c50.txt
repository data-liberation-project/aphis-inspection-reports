3.1(c)(1)(ii)

Housing facilities, general.
There is one shelter structure within an outside enclosure that has an exterior surface constructed of aluminum material.
There are several areas that have been bent or chewed and is causing jagged or sharp edges and points. Having shelter
structures with sharp/jagged points/edges can cause injurie to the dogs. All surfaces must be free of jagged edges or
sharp points.
This was corrected at the time of exit, the shelter structure was removed from the enclosure.
3.4(b)(3)

Outdoor housing facilities.
There are three outside shelter structures without a wind break and rain break at the entrance. Not having a wind/rain
break exposes the animals to the elements and does not provide them with protection from the wind/rain while inside their

shelter. Correct by ensuring all outside shelter structures have a wind break/rain break at the entrance of the shelter.
Corrected at the time of exit, each shelter structure was provided with a wind/rain break at the entrance.
3.4(b)(4) Direct

Outdoor housing facilities.
There are two outside enclosures, containing 5 dogs, with shelter structures that do not have any form of bedding to
assist the dogs in keeping warm. In addition, the dogs were all wet due to their enclosure being wet and muddy. At the
time of inspection the temperature was 41.6 °F. Not having bedding in enclosures, especially when the animals are wet,
during the winter season can cause the dogs unnecessary discomfort and/or stresses. Correct by ensuring all outside
shelter structures contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 °F (10 °C). Additional clean,
dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 °F (1.7 °C) or lower.
This was corrected at the time of exit, clean dry bedding had been added to each outside shelter structure.
3.6(a)(2)(v) Direct

Primary enclosures.
There are two enclosures housing 5 dogs that are housed outside. These dogs do not have the ability to remain dry
and/or clean dry within their enclosure. Rain and wet weather for the area has left all dirt surfaces within their enclosure
wet and/or muddy. In addition, their shelter structures do not have clean dry bedding or provide them with any clean dry
area within their enclosure. All dogs are wet and 2 out of 5 dogs have wet mud all the way up their feet to their mid
section. Not having clean and/or dry areas within outside enclosures during the winter can be detrimental to the animals
health and well being. Correct by ensuring all primary enclosures, to include dogs housed outside, enable the dogs to
remain dry and clean.
This citation was corrected at the time of exit. Clean dry bedding was placed in shelter structures for all outside dogs. In

addition, straw was placed within the enclosure, outside of the shelter structures, to assist in providing dry areas within the
enclosure.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
