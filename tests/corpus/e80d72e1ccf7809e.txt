2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***According to the veterinarian's hands on check of the dogs in August 2015, there were two adult female dogs
identified as a French Bulldog #18 (Misty) and a Chihuahua #15 (Lexi). These two dogs were marked as unsound
for breeding and needed to be further evaluated by a veterinarian.
During today's inspection, it was revealed that #18 (Misty) was bred on April 7, 2016. The facility representative
stated that they had received some medication from a veterinarian to treat a skin condition however; there was no
documentation from a veterinarian to state that this dog was now sound for breeding. The disposition records
revealed that four Chihuahua puppies were sold on 12/17/2015. These puppies were traced back to #15 (Lexi). At
the time of inspection, Lexi had not seen a veterinarian for further evaluation. Health issues that are identified and
left untreated can worsen the condition. Breeding dogs that are determined to be unsound for breeding can lead to
harmful conditions for the females and/or the puppies. The licensee must have these dogs evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian and assure that all of the regulated animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.
To be corrected by May 30, 2016.

This inspection began at 1053.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative and Bev Hicks, ACI.
