Facilities, outdoor.
Within an outdoor pen where an adult goat was being housed at the time, the ground adjacent to the only available
drinking water source was muddy and had standing water. At the time of inspection, access to the drinking water would
require the goat to walk through and stand in the mud and/or water. Facility representatives conveyed that they had
already prepared a plan for a new housing situation for the goat, due to the drainage issue. At the present time, however,
the goat continued to be housed in the outdoor pen with ongoing drainage concerns.

Animals must be allowed to remain dry and to have access to drinking water without having to walk through standing
water and/or mud. Standing water and mud can create hazardous conditions for animals, including the potential for
injuries.

A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate the excess water.

Watering.
At the time of the inspection, an accumulation of green material was observed along the walls and the bottom of a water
receptacle being used for an adult goat. The water receptacle that contained the green material was the only available
drinking water source for the animal, according to facility representatives. A facility representative commented that the
green material appeared to be algae.

The consumption of water that contains accumulations of materials can cause disease conditions in animals.

All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

Corrected during the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
