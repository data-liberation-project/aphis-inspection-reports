A focused inspection was conducted by APHIS inspectors at 10:30am on March 9, 2017. Animal manager informed
the inspectors that a veterinarian had visited the facility this morning and provided veterinary care to the animals.
The veterinarian had euthanized Shyla, the coatimundi, and the young gray and white female goat which was
unable to straighten her front legs at the knees during the previous inspection. Documentation left by the
veterinarian showed that the coatimundi had received sedation consisting of ketamine, midazolam, and sedivet,
before being administered Fatal Plus euthanasia solution. The document showed that the female goat had been
sedated with Sedivet before being given Fatal Plus euthanasia solution. APHIS personnel were able to verify the
disposition of the coatimundi.
The veterinarian gave the intact adult male tricolor goat that was non-weight bearing on his right front limb during
the previous inspection an injection of Firocoxib. The animal manager informed us that the veterinarian had rushed
off to complete other calls but would be coming back to re-evaluate the animals and fill out the program of veterinary
care, as the new attending veterinarian.
This inspection was conducted with the animal manager and exit interview was conducted with the animal manager
and licensee.
