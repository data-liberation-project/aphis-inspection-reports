ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:30 on
07/05/2016.
The licensee's son indicated that the licensee would not be able to leave work until 1-2 hours after the time of the
attempted inspection. The inspector notified the son that inspection procedures only allow for 30 minutes to wait for
a representative to arrive to conduct the inspection, and that an Attempted Inspection report would be sent by
standard mail.
Without a responsible, knowledgeable facility representative to accompany the inspector, the regulatory process
cannot be completed in an efficient manner. The licensee must ensure that there will be a responsible and
knowledgeable adult available to accompany inspectors.
