2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
During 2015, two incidents were reported to the IACUC that involved injury/death to baboons when handled in the
chute system. In one incident, a female baboon suffered injuries when three male baboons gained access to her in
the chute system while being transferred. The second incident occurred when a male baboon was able to lift a
chute door and attacked a female and her infant resulting in death of the infant. The IACUC investigation
determined these incidents were a result of lack of communication between employees handling the animals.
Animals must be handled carefully and in a manner that does not cause trauma. Employees have been retrained in
handling animals in the chute system and a new SOP for Moving Alert Baboons and Macaques has been developed
but has not yet been approved by the IACUC. The SOP for moving animals must be approved and followed to
ensure animals are handled carefully and without trauma.
