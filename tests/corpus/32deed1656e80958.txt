ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Attending Veterinarian (AV) has not been to the facility recently to inspect the animals.
The older brown llama had a baby and she lost some weight since last observed by me and the front teeth are long
which may make it difficult for her to eat. The hoof need to be trimmed for the llamas and donkeys under exhibit as
often as necessary and as determined by the AV.
In order to comply with this section of the AWA regulations, daily observation of all animals to assess their health
and well-being; Provided, however, That daily observation of animals may be accomplished by someone other than
the attending veterinarian; and Provided, further, That a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is
required so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed
to the attending veterinarian.
