2.40(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At time of inspection all Yorkshire Terriers, 2 Maltese, and one Poodle had matted hair on the legs, neck, shoulders,
and back covering approximately 40 percent of the body. Hair mats weren't to the point of affecting walking,
urination, or defecation. It can foster skin infections, affect the animal's mobility or be able to defecate normally if not
removed. Matted hair does not maintain the same insulating qualities of normally groomed hair. The licensee must
remove all matted hair and establish an effective program for coat maintenance for the health and well- being of the
dog. To be corrected by 07-20-16.
3.6(a)(1)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At time of inspection the metal panels along the outside enclosures have rusted or extended outwards towards the
dogs. The metal panels are located throughout the facility housing 4 Australian Shepherd. Sharp points or edges
could create a potential safety issue and could lead to injury. The licensee must ensure that all metal surfaces be
maintained to have no sharp points or edges for the health and well-being of the dogs. To be corrected by 06-27-16.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At time of inspection an enclosure containing 2 dogs have dried, caked fecal residue along the 2 x 4 supporting the
wire flooring. The dogs are in contact with the flooring. Fecal residue is smashed underneath the wire that is
attached to the wood. It indicates an unsanitary living condition exists and could lead to potential disease or health
risks. Increased animal, food or fecal waste buildup reduces available clean surface area that the dogs have
access to. The potential for soiling or caking of the hair coat exists when the dogs have to walk or rest on the
affected surfaces. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are cleaned and sanitized on a daily basis. To be
corrected by 06-27-16.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
