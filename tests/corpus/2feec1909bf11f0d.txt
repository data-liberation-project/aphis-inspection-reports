Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The grounds surrounding the singly housed African green monkey, the three brown capuchins, and the agile gibbon
enclosure had areas of tall weeds. The weeds were approximately two feet in height and surrounded a majority of the
enclosures. Uncontrolled weeds can make it difficult to facilitate cleaning of the premises and allow for harborage of
pests. The weeds must be cut in order to maintain proper husbandry practices and pest control.
