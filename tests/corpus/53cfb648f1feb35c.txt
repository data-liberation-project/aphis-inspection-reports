FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were two areas of the fence around the goat and alpaca enclosure that had gaps at the bottom large enough
to be a danger to the animals. This enclosure also contained metal "t" posts that were no longer in use for fencing
but were still in the ground and could cause injury to the animals if they ran into them. The fence needs to be
repaired and the unused posts removed to assure the animals do not become trapped trying to escape or impaled
by the metal posts. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct By: 15 July 2015

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence at the back (uphill) of the property had an area where it was lower than the rest of the fence.
This area was near a piled rock structure which made the fence effectively shorter still at this point. This area
presents a likely point for an animal to get over the fence. The facility must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is
of sufficient height (at least eight feet) to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. This height must be
maintained for the entire length and vegetation must not be allowed to compromise the integrity and effectiveness of
the fence. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that
it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. Correct By: 15 July 2015
