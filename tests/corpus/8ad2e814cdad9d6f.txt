ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The licensee has recently contracted with a new attending veterinarian through consultant arrangements. The
written program of vet care only identifies the new veterinarian, there is no mention or identification of the species
that is covered at the facility, nothing listed for vaccines with animals that will be potentially handled by the public,
and no mention of parasite control or any species specific concerns the attending vet may want to address
(nutrition, exercise etc.). The written program needs to be more detailed to assure the health care needs of the
animals are being met.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** The current record of animals on hand are not accurate. There is no date of disposition for the lion headed
rabbit, no acquisition records for the new rabbit and the number of chinchilla's at the facility are not accurate. These
records need to be maintained in a timely and accurate manner for record-keeping purposes.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
*** The room housing the rabbits needs to be addressed. There is a large hole in the wall where the rabbits have sat
in and defecated. This section of wall needs to be maintained in good repair. In addition, there are sections of the
wall where paint is peeled away exposing drywall that is no longer sealed and impervious to moisture. These walls
need to be re-painted/re-sealed to facilitate cleaning and sanitization of the area.
