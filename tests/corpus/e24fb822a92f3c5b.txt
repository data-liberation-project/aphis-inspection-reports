2.40(a)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility did not have a current written program of veterinary care which covers the care for the goats, sheep, cow,
alpacas, and rabbits present at the facility. A completed written program of veterinary care is important for the care of the
animals and ensures clear and accurate communication between the facility and the attending vet. The facility must
employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. The formal arrangements shall include a written program of
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.

Per the licensee, the facility’s attending veterinarian only cares for the dogs but does not have authority over the care of
the aforementioned animals. In addition, deworming protocols are being carried out for the hoofstock animals that have
not been approved by the attending veterinarian. When the attending veterinarian is not given the appropriate authority,
the provision of veterinary care may be inadequate or inappropriate. The facility must assure that the attending
veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of
other aspects of animal care and use.

2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Most of the medications maintained at the facility, mainly dewormers that are currently in use, were past their expiration
date. Expired medications may lose functionality or could become detrimental to the health of the animals. The facility
must ensure that all medications are being used in a manner that is consistent with providing adequate veterinary care to
prevent, control and treat diseases or injuries. To be corrected by July 15th, 2022.
3.8

Exercise for dogs.
The exercise plan for the dogs was signed by the former attending veterinarian and has not been approved by the
facility’s current veterinarian. An exercise plan is a regulatory requirement to ensure dogs are given the proper exercise
for their physical and psychological well-being. The facility must document and follow an appropriate exercise plan that
has been approved by the attending veterinarian. To be corrected by July 29th, 2022.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility had a mobile veterinarian visit the facility recently to perform the required yearly visit and physical exams for
the dogs. Per the licensee, the current written program of veterinary care for the dogs was developed with and signed by
the mobile veterinarian instead of the facility’s chosen attending veterinarian. A written Program of Veterinary Care is
necessary to help safeguard the welfare of the animals by designating a veterinarian with the authority and responsibility
of overseeing all aspects of care, and on-going communication regarding any possible medical issues that arise. The
facility must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian. To be corrected by July 15th, 2022.
