2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:45 pm on
03-OCT-18.
After not finding anyone at the kennel or at home, I called and left a message. I also waited for 30 minutes and
honked my horn several different times.
