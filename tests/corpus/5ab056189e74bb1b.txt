2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility has made steady progress updating the records of animals on hand since the last inspection. However,
the records of acquisition, disposition and animals on-hand are still not complete. The pig and deer species young
born this year have not yet been recorded. A full facility animal census is scheduled for February, 2018, per the
facility representative. Accurate record keeping is necessary to adequately identify species and animals present to
provide for their care and to allow legal and medical tracing of the animals. Per this section, every dealer shall
make, keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the detailed information contained in
this section.
2.131(e) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Review of inventory records showed a notation that four water buck were found dead and one water buck died soon
after discovery on November 20, 2017. The drive-through portion of the facility relies on an abundance of natural
shelter but has only one roofed, three-sided shelter that is not large enough to shelter all animals in the
drive-through. According to the facility representative and the attending veterinarian, these animals had arrived at
the facility mid-October and these animals had apparently not acclimated to the facility appropriately when a cold
period occurred, contributing to their deaths. An animal may never be subjected to any combination of temperature,
humidity, and time that is detrimental to the animal's health or well-being, taking into consideration such factors as
the animal's age, species, breed, overall health status, and acclimation. From this day forward, all animals in
residence must be provided with appropriate acclimation periods and adequate shelter from weather conditions that
may impact their health.
The giraffe and lamb cited on last inspection have received veterinary care.
The facility had no patrons during the time of inspection. APHIS personnel were unable to determine adequacy of
public barriers and number of attendants present.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative. Additional Inspectors
