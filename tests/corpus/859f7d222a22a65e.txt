FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following items are in need of removal or repair:
* The black, singly housed pig has two metal hose clamps attached to the fence fabric and bottom of the enclosure
fence. There are sharp edges of these clamps that are protruding into the enclosure that could injure the pig
housed therein. Sharp edges of metal must be removed to prevent injury.
