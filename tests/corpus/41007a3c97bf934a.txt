OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is no bedding in the shelter structures in five outdoor enclosures housing 12 dogs. The ambient temperature
at the conclusion of the inspection was recorded by the inspector's kestrel as 32.1 degrees F. In addition, according
to the NOAA website (weather.gov) for the licensee's zip code, the lowest temperature recorded in the last 24 hours
in the area was 19 degrees F. Dogs that are not provided dry bedding when the ambient temperatures are low can
have a difficult time maintaining a safe body temperature. The licensee must provide dry bedding when the ambient
temperatures are below 50 degrees F, and additional bedding when the temperature is below 35 degrees F. To be
corrected by end of the day today.
