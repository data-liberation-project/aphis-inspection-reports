FEEDING.
*** This facility does not have a written feeding plan for the large felids on the property. The current plan only
mentions 2 cougars and juvenile tigers. The facility currently has 2 adult tigers and 4 adult cougars on hand. A
written plan approved by the attending veterinarian is required to ensure the special dietary needs for these large
carnivores is documented and followed by the facility. This plan must include guidance for supplements to be
added to the diet if a complete commercial diet is not being fed to the animals. Correct this by contacting the
attending veterinarian to develop and approve this plan.

SANITATION.
*** Six enclosures were found to be excessively dirty during this inspection. This included the outdoor enclosure for
4 adult wolves, the outdoor enclosure for 2 adult coatimundi, 2 indoor enclosures each housing one lynx, and 2
indoor enclosures each housing one adult cougar. All of these enclosures have feces, hair, and dirt build-up in
varying degrees that require cleaning. Clean and sanitary enclosures are required to allow the animals to stay
clean, reduce disease potential, and to satisfy accepted cleanliness standards. Correct this by cleaning and
maintaining all enclosures in a sanitary condition.

SANITATION.
*** The main building for indoor tiger housing is also used for food preparation. This entire area requires cleaning,
removal of unused items, and general reorganization. There are many items not currently being used that need to
either be discarded or placed in a suitable storage area. Dust and cobwebs are accumulating throughout the area
which impedes food preparation and makes normal husbandry practices more difficult. Correct this by cleaning
and reorganizing this area.
