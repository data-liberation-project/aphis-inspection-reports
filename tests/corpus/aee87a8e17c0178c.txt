During the inspection there were three health issues identified that had not been reported to the attending
veterinarian or treated due to not being observed. A brown hound #4446 had a 'hotspot' type of skin irritation
located on his left shoulder, approximately 6 inches in diameter with a 2 inch pusy center. The skin was red and
oozing tissue fluid due to the irritation and there was some hair loss in the area. The dog did not appear to be in any
visible signs of discomfort or pain and looked to be in good condition, however the injury was at least a few days old
due to the size when found during the inspection and had not been observed by the staff. The dog was in a pen with
2 other hounds.
There was a sow (#612) that had an extremely swollen right ear that was full of fluid approximately 2-3 inches thick,
running the entire length of the ear 8-9 inches long. There was some red colored fluid oozing around the ear tag and
the ear hung down the side of the sows face and over her eye due to the weight. There was a sow (#847) that had a
fluid filled swelling on top of her left knee approximately 4 inches in diameter. The sow was able to walk, however
she did have a limp occasionally due to the swelling. Both sows appeared to be in good health and not in any
obvious pain, however there were signs of discomfort due to limping by #547 and some head shaking from #612.
Due to the three injuries not being observed until during the inspection, there had not been any treatment given or
veterinarian contacted.
It is very important that any injuries or illnesses are observed as soon as possible in order to prevent an minor issue
from becoming chronic and to decrease the time an animal is in any discomfort or pain. Daily observations of all
animals, especially in large populations (350 dogs/ 1700 pigs) as with this facility need to be conducted making sure
all animals are made to move and be seen.

During the inspection the veterinarian had been contacted and all three animals were treated. The dog(#4446) had
the injury shaved, cleaned and treated. Sow (#612) had her ear drained and sow (#547) had her knee drained
under the direction of the attending veterinarian. All animals are on the facilities treatment log to continue with daily
treatment as needed and monitoring until the injuries are resolved under the direction of their veterinarian.2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were three animals that had health issues that had not been observed before the inspection and had been
observable for several days prior to inspection due to their size. In a population of 350 dogs, a brown hound (#4446)
had a hotspot type formation on his left shoulder that had an approximately 2 inch 'pusy' center with a surrounding 6
inch diameter circle of irritated, red skin where the hair was moist with tissue fluid and the hair was falling out. The
dog did not appear to be in any pain during the inspection and was in a pen with two other dogs.
In a population of 1700 pigs, there was a sow (#612) that had a very swollen right ear that had some tissue fluid
oozing from around the ear tag. The entire ear was full of fluid approximately 2-3 inches thick and 8-9 inches long.
In the next pen there was a sow (#847) that had a fluid filled swelling on the top of her left knee approximately 4
inches in diameter. Both sows appeared to be healthy and acting normal except for the swollen knee and fluid filled
ear injury and did not appear to be in noticeable pain during the inspection, however discomfort was observed.
It is imperative that all animals are checked daily for any signs of illness or injuries in order to decrease the time of
discomfort or pain by a regulated animal. In such large populations of animals it will take more effort to make sure
all animals are observed, however it is important for their health and well being that any injury/illness is identified
before it becomes painful or chronic.
The licensee must continue to work at physically checking all animals on a daily basis for any possible health issues
and making sure all animals are treated in a timely manner.
