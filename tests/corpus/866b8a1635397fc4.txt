2.31(c) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility’s IACUC has not reviewed the research facility's program for humane care and use of animals,
inspected all of the animal facilities, or prepared and submitted reports of these evaluations to the Institutional
Official (I.O.) in the last six months. The last program review and facility inspection by the IACUC was performed on
March 4th, 2016. An evaluation of the research facility's animal use program and an inspection of all the animal
facilities is necessary to ensure adherence to the Act. The results of these evaluations must be reported to the I.O.
to keep them informed of the nature and extent of the facility's adherence to the Act. The IACUC shall review the
facility's program for humane care and use of animals, inspect all the animal facilities, and prepare and submit
reports of these evaluations to the I.O. at least once every six months.
2.31(d)(1) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility used three sheep in a blood draw pilot study without an IACUC approved protocol. The facility has an
IACUC approved blood draw protocol for use in goats, but not for sheep. The IACUC must ensure that all animal
use activities are review and approved by the IACUC before starting any animal use activity. Initiation of any
procedure prior to IACUC approval precludes the IACUC from performing review and assurances under 2.31 (d)
such as related to minimization of pain or distress, consideration of alternatives, that activities do not unnecessarily
duplicate previous experiments, the complete description of activities and the rationale for using animals. Therefore,
lack of prospective review and approval precludes the IACUC members to fulfill their function of safeguarding the
welfare of the animals. The IACUC must assure that no proposal-related activities occur prior to IACUC approval.
