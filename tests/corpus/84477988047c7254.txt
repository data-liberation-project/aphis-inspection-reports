3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Within the sheltered building housing adult dogs, most of the enclosures had a build up of dirt and grime along
the solid walls, floors and/or on the access doors inside the building. Also, the inside of some of the shelter units
within the outdoor enclosures housing adult dogs had some build up of dirt and grime along the inside surfaces. The
build up dirt and grime increases the risk of disease hazards in the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all hard
surfaces with which the dogs come in contact with are spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with Sec.
3.11(b) of this subpart at all times. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when
necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. To be corrected by: November 7,
2016.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***There was an accumulation of fecal material on the ground under the outdoor portion of the enclosures for the
sheltered whelping building. Large numbers of flies were present in and around most of the lower row of enclosures
closest to the ground. Regular and frequent collection, removal and disposal of animal and food wastes must be
provided for in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. The licensee must ensure that all
disposal and drainage systems are constructed and operated so that vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors and
disease hazards are minimized at all times. To be corrected by: October 28, 2016.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***None of the shelters in the outdoor enclosures had bedding in them. According to the National Weather Service,
overnight temperatures got down to 46F degrees. Clean, dry bedding is necessary for protection from the cold. Cold
temperatures can cause stress, discomfort and make dogs more susceptible to illness. Clean, dry bedding must be
provided when the temperature is below 50F degrees. Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the
temperature is 35F degree or lower. To be corrected by: this point forward on October 24, 2016.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and a facility representative.
