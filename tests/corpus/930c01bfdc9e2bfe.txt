SANITATION.
Temperature indicator strips used in a mechanical tunnel washer indicated that the washer sporadically did not
achieve 180 F at the level of the surface to which they were applied. The source water is supplied to the washer at
approximately 190F per the facility. Although other cleaning chemicals such as acid and detergent was used, no
disinfectant was used. This tunnel washer might be used on equipment for any species housed in this facility.
Incomplete sanitization can result in transmission of disease between species and/or between animals of the same
species.
Equipment for rabbits must be sanitized by washing them with hot water (180 F) and soap or detergent as in a
mechanical cage washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective
disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam or flame.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the equine barn, screw tips and/or broken screws were protruding from the walls of four stalls each occupied by a
horse. Facility staff removed the screws following inspection of the barn.
A vertical metal bar attached to the wall of another stall was partially detached, bent and protruding off of the wall.
In an enclosure containing five research horses, several wires holding the chain-link fencing to the metal poles
contained sharp points facing into the enclosure. These wires were pointed out to facility maintenance staff who
were fixing portions of the fencing.
In two primary enclosures, each containing one groundhog, there were several sharp points created by the metal
sheeting attached to the walls of the enclosure.These hazards can injure the animals. All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points,
protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to protect and properly contain the animals. A system of timely
identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.

FEEDING.
The surfaces of ten hay troughs in a goat enclosure were caked with debris approximately an inch thick. The
troughs contained traces of fresh hay.
Three mineral holders in a sheep enclosure contained dirt, feces, and debris. One of the holders contained a
mineral block.
Unsanitary receptacles can adulterate the food and can lead to disease. Food receptacles shall be kept clean and
sanitary at all times.

3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
At the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, a submerged portion of several automatic water receptacles within the primary
enclosures of various animals were corroded and had rough, irregular edges. The water receptacles also contained
a green algae-like growth over these rusted portions of the metal. The water receptacles affected were in separate
enclosures for goats, alpacas, horses, 2 different herds of sheep, and a cow.
Failure to maintain such receptacles prevents proper sanitation and the provision of potable water to the animals,
which may adversely affect their health and welfare.
A system must be utilized for monitoring the condition of water receptacles and the maintenance thereof to keep
them clean and sanitary.
This report is a continuation of the previous report issued on July 7, 2017 and contains the indirect citations from the
routine inspection conducted from June 20-23, 2017. An additional report containing the direct citations was
previously delivered to the facility on July 8, 2017 and an exit interview was conducted on June 23, 2017. With
respect to the noncompliant items contained within this report, an exit was conducted via telephone on June 29,
2017 with the Senior IACUC Coordinator, the attending veterinarian, and the undersigned inspectors.Additional Inspectors
