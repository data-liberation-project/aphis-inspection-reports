Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On March 22, 2022, a macaque monkey ID # 47533 was found by veterinary staff to be dull, with sunken eyes, and dry
crumbling stool and no urine on the enclosure pan, consistent with dehydration. The veterinary staff directed the
investigator to have the animal removed from water regulation. Upon review of the animal’s records, it was noted that the
laboratory staff failed to follow the water regulation section of the approved protocol because they had not weighed the
animal “at least weekly” while the animal was “on a water schedule”. Prior to the dehydration incident this animal had last
been weighed on 3/18/22 and ten days previous to that on 3/8/22. After this incident, laboratory staff were retrained by
veterinary staff on methods to monitor general health and dehydration. Despite being retrained, a second incident
occurred in this lab on May 2, 2022 when the clinical veterinary staff diagnosed dehydration on two macaques sharing the
same enclosure, ID #s 45483 and 43901. Animal # 45483 in particular was found to be recumbent, not eating, and had
sunken eyes. Both animals had dry, pellet-like feces and scant urine, and both drank readily when offered water.

In the approved protocol the section titled “Water Regulation” specifies “Whenever an animal is on a water schedule,
detailed records of fluid intake are maintained. During this period animals are also weighed at least weekly, and usually
several times per week…. Supplementary hydration is provided, and veterinary staff are notified if the animal's weight falls


below 90% of the current baseline weight, if it appears listless or unduly distressed, if the skin is loose and inelastic, or if
stools are hard and dry or if the animal is constipated.” Despite the previous incidence of dehydration with Animal # 47533
after which the veterinary staff provided the lab with additional training, the lab failed to ensure that the animals under
their care received adequate hydration.

Failure to follow the research protocol that has been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) can put the animals at risk of harm. This incident was self-reported by the attending veterinarian to USDA APHIS
Animal Care, and the veterinary staff and IACUC are taking steps to ensure that the water regulation guidelines described
in the protocol are appropriate, and that the investigator and lab personnel adhere to the approved protocol from this time
forward.
2.33(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On May 3, 2022 it was discovered that a collar that had been placed around the neck of a macaque monkey ID # 44340
six days prior was too tight, and had caused skin lesions. The clinical veterinary staff anesthetized the animal and
removed the collar, and lesions encircling the animals’ neck were appropriately treated. The animal has fully recovered.

The investigator’s lab personnel had been chairing the animal regularly for other procedures, yet failed to notice that the
collar was too tight and causing injury. Failure to recognize injuries or illness can cause unnecessary pain and distress,
and worsen the prognosis for recovery. Animals must be observed on a daily basis, with any issues being reported
promptly to the attending veterinarian or their proxy.



This incident was self-reported to USDA APHIS Animal Care by the attending veterinarian, and corrective actions are
being put into place. To be corrected from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
