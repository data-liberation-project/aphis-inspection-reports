PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
During this inspection the adult male Yorkshire Terrier "Samson" housed in pen #4, was able to escape his
enclosure by climbing the chain link wall and exiting over the top. This primary enclosure is only partially roofed and
the dog is able to enter and exit at will over areas where the enclosure is uncovered.
Primary enclosures must securely contain the animals to prevent escape and loss of the animal or accidental injury
from falling or climbing.
Correct by: This non-compliance was corrected at the time of inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with VMO's Moore and Pannill, the licensee and her friend.
