FACILITIES, INDOOR.
( b ) Ventilation.
***** At time of inspection the building housing the lemurs had upon entering a strong ammonia odor which caused
inspectors eyes to burn and tear and nose to burn. This building currently exhausts odors through the use of
windows, a door and has an exhaust faan which is turned on manually. There is need for additional ventilation. It
was discussed with the licensee that perhaps the exhaust fan being put on a timer system to come on automatic for
additional periods of time may be a solution. If not then addtional ventilation would need to be provided. Additional
ventilation will help to reduce discomfort to the animals and aid in helping to keep the animals in good health.
