HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure for the two Java macaques suffered hurricane damage and the strong metal areas used for hanging
enrichment are no longer supportive. The rope hammock was down and excessively frayed and breaking. One
animal was observed chewing on a 12 inch piece of the rope at time of the inspection. The caging needs to be
reinforced to support the hanging items.
The shift door into the concrete block night shelter located at the back of the enclosure is extremely difficult to open
and close. The shift door is in need of repair. The primary enclosure must be kept in good repair, and they must
protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.
