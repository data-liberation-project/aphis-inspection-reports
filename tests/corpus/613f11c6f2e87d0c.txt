ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process from 11:40am to
12:35pm on Tuesday, 06/10/2014.
I knocked on both doors and no one answered. There did not appear to be anyone on the property.
