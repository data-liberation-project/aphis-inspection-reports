ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:28pm on
11-Dec-18.
In additional to waiting 30 minutes, I called the phone numbers provided, knocked on the door and honked the
vehicle horn.
