3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
Where enclosure panels meet the floor there is excessive soiled material stuck between the panel and floor. The dogs
can contact some of this soiled material. Excessively soiled material can cause health hazards and create areas for pests
(flies) to nest in. Ensure that all areas that dogs can contact are maintained clean and sanitized at least once every 2
weeks or more often in order to prevent build-up of soiled material.

3.3(a) Critical

Sheltered housing facilities.
The licensee reported that a week ago stove vents had been forgotten to get closed before going in for the night. The
licensee said a thermometer that records the daily high temperature in the building was observed to have recorded 146
degrees F overnight and was 65 degrees F in the morning when first entering and 26 puppies were found dead the same
morning. Excessive heat can cause harm to animals. The sheltered portion of the facility where dogs are housed must
be maintained in a way that protects dogs from temperature extremes and cannot be more than 85 degrees F for more
than 4 hours.



***Correction: The facility has recognized the error that caused this noncompliance and described corrective actions
already in place to prevent it from happening again. Ensure to maintain corrective actions.
