CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
Three dogs arrived, at the SFO international baggage claim area, en route to Seattle from Mexico on Alaska Airlines
flight 223 (baggage tags AS-97-02-39, AS-97-02-40, and AS-97-02-41). None of the crates had a consignor(cid:25)s
declaration stating when the dogs were last offered food and water, and instructions for feeding and watering during
transport. Failure to complete a written consignor's certification regarding feeding and watering could have a
negative impact on the well-being of the animal. The airline should ensure that complete information is provided on
each crate, by the consignor, prior to taking possession of the animal.

Three dogs arrived, at the SFO international baggage claim area, en route to Seattle from Mexico on Alaska Airlines
flight 223 (baggage tags AS-97-02-39, AS-97-02-40, and AS-97-02-41). None of the crates were labeled with the
words "Live Animals" in letters at least one inch tall, as required. Additionally there were no arrows to indicate the
correct, upright position for the enclosures. Primary enclosures should be labeled on top, and one or more sides,
with the words "Live Animals" in letters at least one inch in height, and with arrows or other such markings to
indicate the correct position during transport. Failure to adequately label the primary enclosure could result in
improper handling of the animal, which could put its well-being at risk.
