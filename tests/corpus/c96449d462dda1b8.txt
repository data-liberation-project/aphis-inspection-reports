SANITATION.
In the commissary / food preparation area the following was noted:
1) There was discarded meat on the ground and lodged in a crack of a damaged baseboard. 2) At least 3 buckets
located over the sink, used to contain animal diets, were worn and stained. 3) A mop used for cleaning was propped
up next to the sink. 4) At least 2 metal food storage racks were rusted. A knife was placed directly on one of the
racks. 5) Two peacock bird feathers were noted lying on the racks in the meat thawing area. 6) Some of the
surfaces indoors and out did not appear to be adequately sealed which may allow dirt, debris or other organic
matter to accumulate and prevents effective cleaning practices.
Food preparation areas should be kept clean and in good repair to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set
forth in this subpart.
