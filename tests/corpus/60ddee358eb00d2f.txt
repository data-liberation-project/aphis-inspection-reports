2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The disposition information was not documented for 5 sugar gliders given to a previous employee and the records were
missing the address for 1 chinchilla as well as for 1 ferret sale. Per the facility representative, 4 sugar gliders and
approximately 2 to 3 ferrets were returned but the acquisition information were not documented. Without records which
fully disclose the animal’s acquisition/disposition, legal and medical information traceback is not possible. Be consistent in
maintaining records disclosing the required acquisition/disposition information including the date, name, address, and
USDA number if applicable of the person from whom the animal was acquired from or transferred to. To be corrected by
February 1, 2023.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
