Facilities, general.
* Facility outdoor containment fencing is bent up along the bottom in an estimated four different places. The length of
the fencing rolled up is estimated to be from five to ten feet in length. Three wood posts used to support the containment
fencing was bent over at the ground level. The wood posts were providing little to no support for the containment fencing.
It was estimated the total length of bent wood posts and fencing to be 30 feet. In addition, the containment fencing was
bent in the middle in an estimated three different places. Three goats and one bovine are in contact with the affected
fencing and posts located in an outdoor enclosure. The ability to contain the animals securely is greatly affected and
could lead to potential injury, if the containment fencing is not kept in good repair. This could have a negative impact on
the animals. The containment fencing must be kept in good repair to prevent entrance of unwanted animals. The
licensee must ensure the facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals
involved. The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by 5/31/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the authorized person.
