ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 32 yr old African elephant, Nosey, was observed during this inspection to have the toenail on the first digit of her
left front foot to be overgrown, curling upward, and pulling away from the nail bed. This poses a risk for debris to
become imbedded under the nail or for the nail to be pulled off which can cause pain or lead to chronic foot care
issues.
The licensee shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
Corrected during the inspection.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The licensee was conducting rides for the public using one female African elephant, Nosey, prior to a circus
performance. The barriers between the ride area and the public roaming on the floor of the arena prior to the circus
performance were not complete and there was a large opening underneath the ride stand without any responsible
person monitoring to prevent access to the ride area by the public. Two small children, unaccompanied by an adult,
were observed to approach this unrestricted area and could easily have entered the ride arena. None of the
personnel engaged in the ride activities noticed these children nor the gap in the barrier until the APHIS inspectors
pointed out the area and the risk.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
Corrected during the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee and 2 APHIS VMO's on 3/19/2014 at the Pershing Center,Lincoln, NE.
