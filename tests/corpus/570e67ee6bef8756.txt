PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On the day of inspection the temperatures were in the nineties, with full sun. In the enclosure for the baboons there
was not sufficient shade to accommodate all four animals in the enclosure. There was a small building outside the
enclosure that provided a small area of shade in the afternoon, but did not reliably provide shade for all animals
throughout the day. There was a small off-exhibit concrete structure accessible to the animals, but the temperature
inside that structure read 85 degrees Fahrenheit as recorded with an Infrared gun, and the animals were not able to
see anything outside when in this small space.
All animals should be provided with adequate shade during the day so that they may elect to use shade as needed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the Aoudad enclosure the side of the metal shelter was damaged, with exposed sharp points. The exterior fence
line had 4" by 2" livestock wire that was curled up at the bottom, creating sharp points and a hazard. The dividing
fence had exposed twisted wire ends curling into the enclosure along the bottom of the fence line.
In the hyena indoor enclosure, the particle board siding was damaged, with exposed splinters.
In the white tiger enclosure, there was rusty twisted wire on the dividing fence line.
In the camel enclosure the back side of the shelter was exposed, with damaged, sharp metal edges.
The outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. These defects should be repaired in order to protect the animals
from potential injury.Correct by October 31, 2019

SANITATION.
The pest control program for flies was not effective. The female lion had fly strike on her ears, and she was rubbing
them along the fence. The patagonian cavies also had damage to the edge of the ear pinnae. Flies were swarming
in hay and old food in several enclosures, especially discarded food items that had not been picked up. Although
the facility has made progress addressing rodent infestation issues, there were still rodent feces visible in areas
such as the brown-nosed coati enclosure, and where hay was stored. Flies and rodents can transmit disease and/or
be irritating to the animals. The licensee must establish and maintain effective methods of pest control.
