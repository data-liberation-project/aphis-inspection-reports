2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* A ten year old black, white and tan Shebia-Enu male (ID # 10) had an excessive buildup of a dark brown to gray
material on the canine teeth and front teeth extending up to the gum line. The right side cheek teeth are covered
with a buildup of grayish material. The gums were swollen on both sides of the mouth and dark red on the right side
of the mouth. Part of the gum tissue was eroded away where the canine tooth (the large carnassial tooth) and gum
line meet on the right side of the mouth. There was a grayish creamy material along the gum line near the large
canine teeth (the large carnassial teeth) and cheek teeth on both sides.
The buildup of abnormal material on teeth with a discharge at the gum line can be painful, impact the ability of the
dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
