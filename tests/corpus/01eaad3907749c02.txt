3.80(a)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary enclosures- 1 pigtail macaque primate does not have a shift cage and the owner is the only one that can go
in with him. There are some metal bars are the floor of the enclosure that could cause injury to the primate. There
was also some miscellaneous trash in the enclosure. The shift cage is needed to prevent the accidental opening of
the enclosure and the primate getting out and proper removal of unwanted items. The metal bars are heavy and are
not a safe enrichment item in case they were to pick them up and swing them around. The licensee must add on a
shift cage and remove the metal monkey bars lying on the floor of the enclosure.

SANITATION.
The (2) sloths are in a room that contains items that are not used for husbandry. The room they are currently
housed in is for storage of boxes and miscellaneous items not used for the animals. Animal enclosures must not
have any miscellaneous items stored in with the animals to protect the health of the animals because they are free
to roam around the room. The licensee must remove all shelves with miscellaneous items and all items not
pertaining to the husbandry practices for these sloths.

SEPARATION.
Separation- 2 emus are being housed in the same enclosure with 4 wallabies. The animals are not a compatible
species and must be housed in separate enclosures. The emus and wallabies will not share the shelter building and
this will interfere with their health as the weather turns colder. The licensee must move one of these species to a
separate enclosure to protect their health and not cause them discomfort.
