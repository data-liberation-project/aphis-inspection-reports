PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
On the afternoon of 11/8/18 the inspector observed three enclosures housing guinea pigs (one housing 4 guinea
pigs and two housing 2 guinea pigs each) in which the shavings were soaked with fluid such that the bedding was
dark brown instead of a light yellow color and completely wet. The area of the floor around the enclosures was
visibly wet with wet shavings present outside the enclosures. The entire bodies/haircoats of the two guinea pigs in
one of the enclosures (#46) were observed to be soaking wet including their backs. The guinea pigs were not able
to find any dry shavings to sit on. The inspector informed the warm room attendant who had the owner add dry
bedding. On the morning of 11/9/18 the inspector again noted that all the shavings in the enclosure housing 2
guinea pigs (#46) were completely wet and that half the shavings in the other two guinea pig enclosures were
soaking wet. Wet bedding can no longer absorb and cover excreta and can cause the animal distress. Guinea pig
enclosures must contain clean litter. Correct from this day forward.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The weather during the auction (Wed-Fri) was rainy and cool (temperatures in the 40s and 50s per Kestrel
measurements and weather.com).
*Numerous outdoor enclosures/pens in the back behind the covered barn stalls/pens are completely open to the
elements with no sides or overhead protection from inclement weather. The animals outside including the water
buffalo, watusi and bison had no protection or shelter to allow them to remain dry. The dirt in their enclosures
quickly became wet sloppy mud. The animals' haircoats became wet. The mud in the enclosures was over ankle
deep for many of the animals. The animals' feet made sucking sounds when lifted by the animals to move about.
The animals did not have any dry ground to move to to get out of the mud.
*One enclosure/pen in the covered barn area had one side open to the elements and housed zebu. The rain water
was draining into this enclosure with half the enclosure consisting of standing water and half of wet dirt. The lower
half of the zebus' legs were covered in wet dirt.
*Excessively muddy/wet ground in the enclosures may lead to slipping of the animals, hoof problems and injury. In
addition, the inability to seek shelter from the inclement weather may lead to distress to the animals. Live animals
shall be provided protection to allow them to remain dry during inclement weather.3.142(c)
HANDLING.
In the early afternoon on 11/9/18 the inspector noticed a hedgehog enclosure lying upside down in the middle of the
walkway of the warm room. The enclosure was picked up, righted and replaced on a shelf (approximately 3 feet
above the floor) holding hedgehog enclosures. It was observed that due to the large number of enclosures and
limited shelf space that hedgehog enclosures on several shelves were stacked such that the enclosures extended
1-3 inches past the edge of the shelf. This would make it more likely for an enclosures to fall if brushed by a person
walking through the narrow walkways or even if the animal itself shifted too much weight to the portion of the
enclosure overhanging the edge of the shelf. A fall may lead to distress, injury or escape if the enclosure were
damaged during the fall. All primary enclosures used to transport live animals shall not be stacked in a manner
which may reasonably be expected to result in their falling. Correct by 3/15/19.
This inspection was conducted on 11/8/18 and 11/9/18.
The exit interview was conducted on 11/9/18 with Vice President.
