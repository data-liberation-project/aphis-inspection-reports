3.28(c)(1)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were four primary enclosures each housing four guinea pigs which did not provide the minimum amount of
floor space as required. The four enclosures measured 9 inches by 17 inches (153 square inches) with feeders
occupying approximately 3 inches by 4.5 inches (13.5 square inches). The approximate weight of each of the
guinea pigs was 185 grams. The resulting floor space of approximately 139.5 square inches does not meet the
regulatory requirement of 60 square inches for each guinea pig from weaning to 350 grams of body weight.
Enclosures with insufficient space may have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the animals being
maintained within them. A sufficient amount of floor space for guinea pigs is necessary in order to ensure that they
have enough space to make normal postural adjustments and adequate freedom of movement. The facility should
ensure that the housing for the guinea pigs meets the required minimum floor space set forth in the regulations.
Corrected at time of inspection.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
The following conditions involving inadequate sanitation were noted and include:
- A stainless steel table that was not currently in use in a procedure room for guinea pigs was soiled with apparent
dried blood and other debris. Also, the wall directly above this table had brownish staining and was not properly
cleaned.
- In a room housing guinea pigs, there were steel racks used to hold the large primary enclosures for the guinea
pigs which had several areas that were soiled with urine and other debris. A large cardboard box was not properly
stored on top of this steel rack, allowing it to potentially fall and injure the animals below. Several, empty primary
enclosure tubs on a rack had dried feces and feed on the litter pan liner material underneath the tubs. Also, the lid
of the food container was soiled and was labeled with a food bag inventory card with earliest date of use of
5/15/2015. All animal areas shall be cleaned and sanitized with sufficient frequency to prevent an accumulation of excreta or
debris. Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate
the prescribed husbandry practices. Failure to maintain adequate sanitation and appropriate housekeeping may
adversely affect the health such as potential disease transmission and negatively impact the well-being of the
animals.
