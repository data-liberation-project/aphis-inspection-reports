Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review during this inspection. A total of 497 adult, weanling,
and newborn guinea pigs were counted during this inspection.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths or decreased numbers of animals born and to track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals held, owned, and acquired or disposed of including births and deaths.

Facilities, general.
Although the side walls of the enclosures were at least 7 inches in height, during the inspection, four guinea pigs were
observed to be out of their enclosure and running around on the floor of the building.
Guinea pigs that have escaped their enclosure could be at risk of injury or escape from the barn as well as the inability to
access food and water.
The licensee must ensure that the enclosure contains the animals at all times and does not allow them to escape.


Housing facilities must be adequate to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Sanitation.
Approximately half of the guinea pig pens contained an accumulation of soiled, wet bedding with excess fecal material
particularly in the area near the automatic waterers. The facility had last performed a cleaning approximately 7 days ago.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the enclosure,
and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material and
sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
