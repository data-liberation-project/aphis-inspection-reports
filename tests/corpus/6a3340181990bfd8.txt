3.53(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The enclosure housing the three Flemish rabbits is in need of repair. The enclosure is made of wire sides attached to a
wood frame. The wire in the corner behind the rabbit shelter structure has become loose from the wood frame at floor
level leaving an opening about 7 inches long and up to two inches wide at its widest. The rabbits could injure themselves
if their foot/leg became caught in the opening. The enclosure should be maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits
from injury, to contain them and keep other animals out. Correct by 10/1/21.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The outdoor enclosure housing the wallaby is currently enclosed by a perimeter fence that is less than 6 feet high (about
4 1/2 feet). It is located over three feet from the primary enclosure and is constructed such that it keeps out unauthorized
animals/persons and prevents contact between the wallaby and any outside animals/people. The perimeter fence should
be 6 feet high for non-dangerous animals such as the wallaby or be approved in writing by the Administrator/Animal Care.
