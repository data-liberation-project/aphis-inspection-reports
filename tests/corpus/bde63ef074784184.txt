3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the outdoor exercise pen, there is one metal gate panel and support beam that has an excessive build up of
rust.
In addition, there are approximately 4 kennels in the housing trailer that have small areas of rust build up. The
presence of rust may prevent the required cleaning and sanitizing and/or can affect the integrity of the surface.
Surfaces that come in contact with the dogs should be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and
sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface. A system should be in place to identify, repair/
replace rusted surfaces that come in contact with the dogs.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Inside the dog trailer, a moderate amount of hair and other debris is collecting between the individual dog kennels.
Accumulations of hair, dust and other debris can attract pests and/ or increase disease hazards in animal areas.
Primary enclosures, including the spaces between each kennel, should be cleaned as often as needed to facilitate
the husbandry practices required in this subpart. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure the required
cleaning is completed in a timely manner.
