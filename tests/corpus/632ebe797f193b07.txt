FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is construction being conducted inside the South America enclosure. New concrete walls are being
constructed inside the enclosure and the animals enclosed have access to the part of the enclosure currently under
construction. There are sharp pointed ends of exposed rebar pointing upward and outward toward the animals
enclosed. There is a gap between 8 to 12 inches wide between the concrete board forms and the soil. There is
rebar around the gap pointing toward the animals. The exposed rebar and gap can be hazardous to the animals
enclosed and can potentially cause injury. The enclosure must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury.
