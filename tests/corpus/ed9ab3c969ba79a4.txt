FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The guinea pig pelleted feed is being stored in the original bags with open bags not stored in secure containers.
Hay for feeding the guinea pigs in the upstairs of the housing facility was observed being stored directly on the floor.
Feed/food that is stored inappropriately can result in deterioration of the food or be contaminated by pests, mold, or
other sources and if used, cause illness in the animals.
Supplies of food must be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against spoilage or deterioration
and infestation or contamination by vermin.
3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On the upper floor of the building, there are 3 sets of wooden racks of guinea pig pens that, on the ends of the
enclosures around the water nipples, have bare wood pieces that are not painted or sealed and therefore not
impervious to moisture.
Unsealed surfaces are difficult to clean and sanitize, which can lead to disease hazards for the guinea pigs.
Enclosures for guinea pigs must be constructed and maintained so that they are impervious to moisture, can be
readily cleaned and sanitized, and won’t absorb moisture or odors.
3.29(d) DIRECT
FEEDING.
The hard plastic bowls being used to feed weanlings in the main first floor room of the guinea pig housing facility
contained several fecal pellets mixed in with the pelleted feed. Approximately 135 weanlings are housed in these
pens.
Failure to locate feeders to minimize contamination with fecal material and to clean feeders often enough to prevent
contamination with fecal material can result in avoidance of food or spread of disease.
Food receptacles must be located to minimize contamination by excreta and must be kept clean.
Correct from this day forward3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Under the clean layer of bedding in several enclosures there is a thick layer (up to 2 inches) of compacted wet
bedding containing a large amount of fecal material.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the
enclosure, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris.
Remains uncorrected.
