2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:54 AM on
19-AUG-19.
Upon arrival at the facility, I called Mr. Wilbur's mobile phone number. Mr. Wilbur conveyed that he was unavailable
to meet me at the facility. Mr. Wilbur shared that a family member, who he has coordinated with and has designated
to be available for USDA inspections specifically, happens to be out of the state at this time. He conveyed that no
other representative was available for the inspection. Mr. Wilbur indicated his plans to provide more information to
USDA related to available days and times for conducting inspections. After our call, I left the facility.
