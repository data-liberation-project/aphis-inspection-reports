2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility has a program of veterinary care that lists an attending veterinarian. Contacting the listed veterinarian
revealed that the veterinarian had not been in contact with the licensee since 2020. Furthermore, the veterinarian stated
that he thought the facility might have obtained a different veterinarian for care. Not having a veterinarian with a clear
agreement for care authority puts the animals at risk of improper care. All care of the animals should be done in
accordance with the guidance and under the authority of an attending veterinarian.
Develop an agreement with an attending veterinarian, knowledgeable with all species in the facility, which gives them the
authority for oversight of the care. Ensure that care of animals is conducted in accordance with guidance from the
attending veterinarian that is given said authority.

Sanitation.
Accumulations of hair and dust remain in the animal rooms. Several pens have accumulated hair along the edges of the
enclosure. One room which houses two ferrets also has additional non-regulated animals. The dirty litter pans in the
ferret enclosure as well as in the additional animal pen creates an unhealthy living condition for the ferrets.

Accumulations of hair, urine, excreta, and other debris may harbor disease hazards, posing a threat to animal health.
Enclosures, litter trays, and housing facilities shall be cleaned as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and
reduce odors.

3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
The animals are housed in various rooms throughout the licensee's primary residence. The rooms are overcrowded with
personal items and an excessive amount of clutter remains in the animal housing areas. Stored items impinge space
such that there is minimal clearance to work with and access the animals, clean enclosures and housing rooms, as well
as provide repair to and maintain enclosures. Optimal animal welfare is hindered in such cramped quarters. Premises
shall be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices.
