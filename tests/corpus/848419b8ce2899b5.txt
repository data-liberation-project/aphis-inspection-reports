FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two rope-mesh hammocks suspended in the enclosure for the seven raccoons. The mesh has areas
where there are holes from the mesh giving way. Other areas are getting thin and frayed. The indoor and outdoor
housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals.
These hammocks are in need of replacement to protect the animals from possible injury.
