FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Four grey squirrels (black color variation) escaped from their enclosure. The squirrels are now living in the yard and
can no longer be adequately protected from predators. Ensure that the squirrel enclosure is structurally sound and
maintained in good repair so it contains the animals and prevents the animals from escaping. Correct immediately.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with the licensee, Animal Care Inspector Kevin Wilken and Animal Care
Inspector Kimberly Miller.
