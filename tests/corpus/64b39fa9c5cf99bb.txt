INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Review of Program of Animal Care and Use.
1. The IACUC failed to identify a deficiency of their Animal Care and Use Program at the time of their 12/21/16
semi-annual program review. The IACUC had not updated their report to the Institutional Official (IO) since 1/13/16
but the IACUC did not identify the failure to update their report to the IO at least once every six months as required
per Section 2.31 (c) (3) as a deficiency of their Program.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the IACUC shall review the research facility’s program for humane care and use
of animals at least once every 6 months in order to determine the Program’s compliance with all of the requirements
of the AWA Regulations.
The IACUC needs to complete another review of their Animal Care and Use Program to ensure the Program's
compliance with all of the requirements of the AWA Regulations.
Correct by 4/18/17.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC Functions.
1. The IACUC has not updated their reports to the Institutional Official (IO) at least once every six months as
required. The last Semi-annual IACUC Report submitted to the IO was dated 1/13/16. Although the IACUC did
perform semi-annual reviews of the program for animal care and animal facility inspections on 6/14/16 and
12/21/16, Semi-annual Reports for those two semi-annual reviews have not been submitted to the IO. Thirteen
months have elapsed since the IACUC has updated their semi-annual report to the IO.
Per this Section of the Regulations, reports of the IACUC semi-annual evaluations of the program for animal care
and animal facility inspection should be updated at least once every 6 months upon completion of the requiredsemiannual evaluations and the report submitted to the IO. Compliance with this requirement is important so the IO
is updated regarding the status of the animal use program and the condition of the animal facilities to ensure that
the research facility is adhering to the standards and regulations specified under the Act.
The IACUC needs to update their Semi-annual Report to the IO for the June and December 2016 evaluations.
Correct by 3/1/17.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Consideration of Alternatives.
1. Protocol #00-013 includes blood collection procedures that would be considered more than momentarily painful
or distressful (orbital sinus and cardiac puncture) but the protocol approved by the IACUC did not contain a written
narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available to these two
procedures.
Per this Section of the Regulations, whenever a proposal for animal use contains procedures that may cause more
than momentary pain or distress to the animals, the investigator is required to consider alternatives to those
procedures and provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that
alternatives were not available. This requirement is important to ensure that all procedures involving animals
minimize pain and distress to the animals.
The IACUC needs to address this deficiency that was identified for this protocol.
Correct by 3/17/17.
