ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male bichon-shih tzu mixed puppy approximately 5 weeks old was observed with an open wound around the
muzzle area. The dam is identified with microchip number (00-06FD-386D). A facility representative did not notice
an injury to the puppy earlier in the day before an inspection was conducted. Along the bridge of the puppy's nose
there is a triangle shaped portion approximately 1.5 inches long by 1 inch wide of skin missing and a cream-colored
discharge coming from the wound. The puppy's nose is split open from the top down to the mouth. There is a small
area under the left eye that has dried red matter on the fur. Lesions on the muzzle can be painful and can affect the
puppy from nursing properly. The licensee must have the animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to
ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The
licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
