Sheltered housing facilities.
The ambient temperature outside at the time of the inspection was 37 deg F. The licensee had turned off the heat for the
indoor portion of the sheltered facility. The sheltered boxes for the dogs are fully enclosed with a top that lifts off and
inside the box there is a metal shift door that opens to the outdoor portion of the run. All the sheltered boxes had their shift
doors propped open with a wood block to facilitate air flow due to the heat from the previous weekend’s high
temperatures. However, since the weekend, the temperatures have gone down into the low 30’s at night. In keeping the
door propped open, a draft is coming into the shelter, and it does not adequately protect the dogs from the elements to
protect their health. These doors need to be able to open and close appropriately to maintain heat and reduce drafts in
the shelter for the wellbeing of the dogs.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
