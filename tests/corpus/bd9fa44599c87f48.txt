FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The wolf enclosure is not surrounded by an 8' perimeter fence. Lack of a perimeter fence does not prevent
unauthorized people or unwanted animals from having access to the animal housed within. Also, lack of a perimeter
fence cannot function as a secondary containment system. An 8' perimeter fence must be constructed to be used
as a secondary containment and to ensure there is no public contact with the wolf to protect the safety of the animal
and the public. Correct by August 31, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
