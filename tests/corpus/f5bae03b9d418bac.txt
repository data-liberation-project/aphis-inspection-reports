WATERING.
The water container for the goats had not been changed since last week and was brownish in color. Unsanitary
water can lead to the spread of disease. The watering receptacles need to be changed out on a more regular basis
prior to the water changing to a brownish color. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
