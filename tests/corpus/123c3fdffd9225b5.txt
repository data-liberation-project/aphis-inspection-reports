3.28(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The openings in the metal pens around the automatic water nipples have jagged, sharp edges in approximately 25% of
the guinea pig pens.
Sharp points around waterers can result in injury to the guinea pigs when they approach the nipples to drink.
Primary enclosures must be maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.
