3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
Item One: Critical

Two Peromyscus leucopus mice were given to the facility by a member of the public. The animals were in a cardboard
box that was temporarily enclosed in a larger tote box with ventilation holes inside a room to maintain the animals until
they could be placed into permanent housing the next day. The animals escaped both boxes during the night and were
not recaught, despite the facility's best efforts with baited humane traps. The licensee must ensure the housing facilities
are appropriate and contain the animals securely.

Correct by: Immediate; the facility has updated it's policy for this species

Item Two: Non - critical

Unprotected electrical outlets were located in the den quarters of two of the mountain lions in a position accessible by the
animals. Exposed outlets may present a risk to the animals of electrocution, leading to injury. The licensee shall


maintain the facilities to protect the animals from potential injury from access to electric power.

Sanitation.
15 northern flying squirrels housed in a wood and wire enclosure had large accumulations of feces and urine in two
corners of a shelf in the cage. The feed bowl had dark caked on material on the chewed outer rim of the bowl that may
have included feces. Built up deposits of excreta in enclosures are a source of contamination that can lead to adverse
health outcomes for the animals. The licensee must ensure the removal of waste materials as often as necessary to
minimize disease hazards.
