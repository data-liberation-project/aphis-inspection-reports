3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces -- General requirements.
***The plastic water and food buckets in 12 enclosures throughout both kennel buildings housing a total of 17 dogs
had excessive chewing damage causing grooves and pitting on the top edge of the bucket with hair and dirt
accumulating in the grooves.
***Four enclosures in the south kennel building housing one dog in each had excessive chewing on some of the
wood support boards leaving a rough surface to the wood.
Rough surfaces do not allow for them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, which may increase disease hazards,
affect structural strength or lead to injury. Replace or repair chewed surfaces to reduce or eliminate these risks.

3.3(b)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Ventilation.
The south kennel building housing 9 adult dogs had a prevalent ammonia smell. Although the facility is equipped
with ventilation methods such as fans and doors, no ventilation methods were in use at the time of this inspection
and therefore ammonia levels were not being controlled.
High ammonia levels may adversely affect the comfort of the dogs and increase health hazards such as respiratory
illnesses. Provide and maintain adequate ventilation to effectively minimize ammonia levels in the kennel and to
provide for the health and well-being of the dogs. Correct by April 10, 2014.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Cleaning of primary enclosures.Several day's worth of feces was present in the outdoor portion of the far east enclosure on the north kennel
building. This enclosure housed two dogs.
Failure to remove excreta daily from primary enclosures could increase disease hazards, pests and odors and lead
to soiling of the animals. Remove feces and maintain daily removal of excreta to reduce these risks. Correct by April
10, 2014. Note: The licensee corrected this noncompliance during the inspection.
Animal inspection conducted with owner's spouse and records inspection and exit interview were conducted with
the owner.
