2.75 REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee's Record of Acquisition of Dogs on Hand (form 7005) is incomplete for twelve of the dogs he has
acquired since the last inspection. In the "Acquired From" section (box I.), the licensee has only documented the
name of who he acquired the animals from. No other required information is provided.
Not providing complete and accurate information does not allow for proper tracing of the animals by an APHIS
official. The 7005 form must be updated to include all required information.
3.6(a)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The following list are of items that are in disrepair in the licensee's primary enclosures:
---Three primary enclosures in the main building have holes in the walls. The licensee stated it was caused from
the dogs chewing on the walls. One cage is on the inside part of the building. The other two cages are in runs on
the outside part of the building. One of the holes on the outside part of the building has sharp edges protruding out.
---Some dog cages have plastic strips half way up running alongside the walls of their primary enclosures that are
chewed up.
---A wooden post inside one of the outside dog runs is chewed up near the bottom of the post.
---Concrete flooring in both buildings has not been seal-coated.
---A few of the outdoor runs have fencing that has rust near the ground that has not been painted or covered.
---One primary enclosure in second building (old cow barn) has metal pipes running out of the ground that are
covered in rust.---One primary enclosure in second building (old cow barn) has a small hole in the ground that is not covered. It
appears the hole was for a pipe that has since been removed.
---One primary enclosure has three metal pieces (appears to be old pipes) protruding a couple of inches out of the
ground.
The above items that are in disrepair are problems for a number of reasons. A hole in the ground, holes in the walls
with sharp edges, and metal pieces sticking out of the ground can cause injury to dogs that are exposed to it.
Chewed up plastic strips, chewed up wooden posts, unsealed concrete flooring, and fencing or metal pipes with rust
doesn't allow for it to be readily cleaned and sanitized.
All items noted above must be repaired.
Correct by 7/4/16.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
While inspecting the second building (old cow barn), the licensee informed me that he has not disinfected the floors
of the primary enclosures since he has started using that building (a few months ago). Not disinfecting the floors
doesn't ensure that the various types of germs (such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, etc.) have been killed and that
the cage is safe to use for new incoming dogs.
All primary enclosures must be disinfected once every two weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
Correct by 5/18/16.
Note: All previous veterinary care issues cited under 2.40 (b)(2) from the last inspection that took place on 5/19/15
were corrected at the time of this inspection.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with licensee.
End of report.
