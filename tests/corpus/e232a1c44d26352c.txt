ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female Bulldog named Bonnie (m/c# OAO1782940) was missing a significant amount of hair from her back
and sides and had scabs and reddened areas over much of her back and sides. She was scratching, chewing, and
licking at the areas during the inspection. The licensee stated that the problem started about 2 weeks earlier and
that she had not consulted a veterinarian about the problem. Skin problems can be painful, can lead to other
medical conditions, and can be contagious to other animals. The licensee must have this dog examined and
treated by a licensed veterinarian. She must maintain medical records concerning this condition and make them
available to the inspector upon request.

primary enclosure and contact the puppies. Contact with dogs other than the dam can result in injury to the
puppies. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so that they keep otheranimals from entering the enclosure.
