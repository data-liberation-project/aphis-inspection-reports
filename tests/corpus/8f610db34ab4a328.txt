ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1333 on
21-Nov-17. I went to the facility. A facility representative came to the door. He was not familiar with where the
paperwork was at and said the main person that normally conducts the inspections was not working today. He
stated he would prefer that I come back another time when the main person in charge of the animals is working. I
told him I would try back another day.
End of report.
