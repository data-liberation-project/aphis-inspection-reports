HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
2.131(c)(1) - On 5-19-16, a house guest of the Oswald's was injured by a bear cub in the Oswald residence. This
cub had been doing poorly as it was undeveloped weighing around six pounds and had vision problems. The
Oswald's had been providing nursing care to the cub in the house and it had been let out of its enclosure for
exercise. The cub inflicted a minor scratch to the house guest which became infected two days later. The wound
was treated and the guest recovered without incident. The licensee is to have sufficient distance and/or barriers
between the public and the animal at all times to ensure safety of the animal and the public.
Correct by: Correct from this time forward.
This was a focused inspection on the cub incident.
The licensee self reported this incident to the USDA.
Exit interview conducted with the licensee and APHIS employee Kurt Hammel.
