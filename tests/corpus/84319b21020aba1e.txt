FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The roof of the open air barn housing the goats has insulation panels on the interior surface. The panel covers are
torn in multiple areas with exposed insulation (presumably fiberglass) and pieces of damaged panel cover are
dangling from the ceiling. The goats are housed in three separate stall areas under the insulated ceiling. Exposed
fiberglass and pieces of dangling panel cover are visible in the ceiling over all three housing areas. Fiberglass
exposure could cause skin, ocular, respiratory or gastric irritation and ingestion of insulation or panel covering could
cause foreign body related illnesses.
Indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to prevent injury to
the animals. The damaged insulation panels should be removed, repaired or replaced. Correct by: October 18,
2017.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with TAMU executive director CMP.
