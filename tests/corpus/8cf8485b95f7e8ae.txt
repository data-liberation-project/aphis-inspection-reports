2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On Saturday, July 26, 2014 a zoo patron was given a guided tour by an employee of the zoo. The 15 year old
attendant opened an unlocked gate allowing the zoo patron access between the perimeter/barrier fence and the
primary enclosure. The patron reached into the primary enclosure and the lion bit the tip of her middle finger off.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
Do not allow the public access to the area between the primary enclosure and the perimeter/barrier fence.
To be corrected from now on.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter/barrier fence gate that allows access between the primary enclosure and the perimeter/barrier fence
was left unlocked after morning chores on the day of the bite incident. Leaving this gate unlocked led to the patron
of the zoo having access to this area.
All outdoor housing facilities (i.e., facilities not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of
sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 8 feet high for potentially
dangerous animals, such as, but not limited to, large felines (e.g., lions, tigers, leopards, cougars, etc.), bears,
wolves, rhinoceros, and elephants, or less than 6 feet high for other animals must be approved in writing by the
Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility.
This gate must remain locked at all times unless the licensee is doing maintenance work in the area.To be corrected from now on.
