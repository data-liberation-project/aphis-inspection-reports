upper and lower cheek teeth and approximately half of the surface of each canine. The gums are slightly reddened.
Veterinary care problems such as these can be painful and can lead to further health complications. All of the
animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is
obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
This must be done by 5:00 pm Friday, December 12th.
A female standard poodle (microchip # 018 340 006) has an excessive number of mats on its chest, legs and back.
The majority of the mats are moderate to large in size and cover nearly the entire length of both legs. The mats are
not tightly adhered to the skin and the skin does not appear to be affected.
A male cocker spaniel (microchip # 076 805 639) has moderate sized mats on both ears and a few small superficial
mats on its head and chest. The mats on its ears are tightly adhered to the skin. There is dirt and/or debris
embedded in the mats.
A female poodle (microchip # 081 860 853) has an excessive number of mats on its face, back, legs, hips, abdomenand under the tail. The mats on the legs and hips are moderate to large in size and cover nearly the entire length of
both legs. The mats on the face, abdomen and under the tail are smaller and more superficial. None of the mats
are tightly adhered to the skin and the skin does not appear to be affected. There is dirt and/or debris embedded in
the mats on the face and under the tail.
Matted hair-coats can be painful, can lead to skin infections and reduces the ability of the coat to insulate the
animal. The licensee must remove the matted hair from all matted dogs and must develop an effective program of
hair coat maintenance.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the area "South of the Barn" three metal self-feeders, affecting at least nine dogs, have bird droppings on the top
of them and running down their sides. In the "Husky Area" there is one water receptacle, affecting three dogs, that
has bird droppings in the water. Food and water receptacles contaminated by bird droppings can pose a health risk
to the dogs. Licensee must ensure that food and water receptacles remain free of bird droppings and other
debris. Food and water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized once every two weeks or as often as necessary.
Throughout the sheltered housing facilities, affecting at least fifty-two dogs, the self-feeders have a caking of food
debris inside of them. Food receptacles caked with food debris can contaminate food and pose a health risk to the
dogs. Licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are properly sanitized and are clean and free of caked food
debris.
Throughout the outdoor and sheltered housing facilities, affecting at least fifty-five dogs, the enclosures have an
excessive buildup of feces in them. In several of the sheltered enclosures the feces have been smeared and
compacted into the wire flooring. Some dogs were observed to have soiled feet. Failure to remove the excreta can
cause soiling of the dogs within the enclosure as well as, increase the risk of disease, pests and odors. Also, the
buildup of compacted feces into the wire floor does not allow for proper sanitization to occur. Licensee must
remove all excreta daily from primary enclosures to ensure that the dogs remain clean and to reduce the risk of
disease, pests and odors and allow for proper sanitization of the enclosure.
In several sheltered enclosures, affecting at least ten dogs, there is a buildup of dirt and grime on the walls around
the access doors. In at least three sheltered enclosures, affecting at least six dogs, there is a buildup of dirt and
grime on the access doors. In one outdoor enclosure, affecting at least three dogs, the outside surfaces of theshelter have an excessive buildup of dirt and grime on them. This buildup of dirt and grime does not allow for
sanitization of the surfaces. Licensee must ensure that surfaces remain free of dirt and grime buildup to ensure
proper sanitization can occur.
