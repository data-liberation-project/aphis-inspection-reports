INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 12-013 expired 3/19/2015. Due to a glitch in the electronic notification system, it was not discovered by the
IACUC or principal investigator (PI) until June 26, 2015. Nine rabbits were used during this period. The use of the
nine rabbits followed the guidelines from the expired protocol. Three additional rabbits were slated for use, but
placed under the facilities holding protocol when the expired protocol was discovered. The facility instituted a
manual notification and review system for determining protocol expiration dates to prevent recurrence. The PI has
since submitted a new protocol which has been reviewed and approved by the IACUC. Animals used without
IACUC review and approval may experience conditions leading to unnecessary pain and/or distress. Activities
related to the care and use of animals must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to initiation.

MISCELLANEOUS.
In July of 2014 twelve Siberian hamsters sustained eye injuries as a result of blood collection. The IACUC
approved protocol covering their use allowed retro-orbital collection of blood. Two trained and approved graduate
students collected blood from an estimated 50 hamsters within a couple of hours over a two day period. Within a
week of the sampling, animals were identified with squinty or hazy eyes and treated appropriately. Despite
treatment, ten animals developed shrunken, non-functional eyes.
The IACUC conducted an investigation of the event and determined that due to the large number of animals and
short sampling period, a fast, robust sampling technique resulted in the eye trauma. Corrective measures
implemented were retraining of the personnel and smaller sample size. Now only 10-12 animals are sampled in a
comparative amount of time. Since this event, one of the graduate students has collected similar samples from 390
animals without any animal injury.
Eye trauma is associated with pain and distress. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and
carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress,physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
