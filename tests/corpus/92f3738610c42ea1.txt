2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) states that visits by the Attending Veterinarian will be made on a
semi-annual basis. The last visit documented by the Attending Veterinarian was September 3, 2013 and the
licensee stated they have not contacted the Attending Veterinarian to make a visit this year. Regularly scheduled
visits by the Attending Veterinarian are important so that the husbandry and health of the animals can be observed
and discussed. It is the licensee's responsibility to contact the Attending Veterinarian to make a site visit so that the
animals can be observed, their husbandry discussed, and to update the PVC if there are any changes in the care of
the animals.
