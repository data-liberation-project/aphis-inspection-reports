2.4 Critical

Non-interference with APHIS officials.
Facility representatives directly interfered with the USDA inspection process by not making all regulated animals on the
premises or those that had been previously purchased available for the 9/16/2021 routine inspection. Records reviewed
during today’s inspection indicate that 12 hedgehogs were purchased on 7/10/2021. These records and the 12
hedgehogs were not made available by the facility for inspection on 9/16/2021. In addition, the alpaca and fallow deer
inspected today were also identified by the facility representative as being on the premises at the time of the previous
inspection, but were not made available for inspection on 9/16/2021. When the inspection team was viewing the
enclosure housing sika deer during the 9/16/21 inspection, they asked whether the facility had fallow deer at that time;
however, the representative led inspectors to believe they did not have fallow deer: “There’s no fallow deer in here.” At
several points during the inspection on 9/16/2021 the facility representative was asked, “Have we seen all the animals
here today?” and the answer was “Yes.” During today’s inspection when questioned about the fallow deer that were
visible in enclosures at the beginning of the facility’s driveway adjacent to the neighboring property, the facility
representative stated, “They’ve always been there. Last time I thought you’d already seen them, they’re the first thing you
see as you drive up. They’re not the neighbors’, everything here is ours.” Additionally, disposition records reviewed today
indicate 2 spotted rock squirrels were sold one day after the previous inspection, on 9/17/2021. These animals were not


made available during the inspection on 9/16/2021 and there are no other acquisition or transfer records indicating that
they were not present at the facility on 9/16/2021.
During today’s inspection, there were several areas that the facility representatives stated, “There’s loaded skunks there,
you may not want to get too close.” However, on careful close examination, the following animals were observed that may
not otherwise have been inspected or counted:
- 1 raccoon near the back of the property housed next to a non-descented skunk
- 12 skunks inside the mink/ferret barn that were not counted/pointed out when the facility representative initially was
going through counting mink and ferrets; these were only discovered when the second inspector walked the whole line of
cages to examine animals more closely.
Reluctance by the facility and purposely interfering with proper inspection of all regulated animals present at the facility, is
not conducive or compliant with AWA standards for proper inspection. The licensee and all facility representatives must
not interfere with any portion of the inspection process and must ensure that all regulated animals are properly identified
and made available for inspection.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The attending veterinarian does not have appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care with
respect to dosing, frequency, and rotation of dewormers. The facility representatives stated they will give different
dewormers at different times of the year, and they will generally use the dosing instructions given on the label. The labels
for one bottle of Panacur and one bottle of Ivermec only contain dosage instructions for horses, cattle, or swine. The
written program of veterinary care does not provide any specific schedule, screening, or indication for deworming, nor
does it contain dosing or rotation instructions for the species maintained at the facility. According to the licensees, usually


the veterinarian provides dosing instructions on a prescription label attached to the bottle. However, today those labels
were absent (fell off). Improper use of dewormers in certain species can be dangerous (toxic) or can lead to parasite
resistance. Lacking these explicit instructions (dose, frequency/schedule, and rotation of products) does not assure the
attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to oversee this aspect of animal care.
Additionally, facility personnel have performed surgical procedures (anal sacculectomy) on skunks in the past (none since
last inspection). The facility’s current written protocol is missing the following pieces of information:
- How specifically to perform the anal sac removal (step by step)
- Post-procedural care instructions
- Pain control measures
They are planning to review this procedure, including having the veterinarian observe the procedure on site, when new
baby skunks are born next summer. Until that time, no changes to the written guidance will be able to be finalized.
Performing surgical procedures without proper oversight or guidance from a licensed veterinarian can cause unnecessary
harm, pain or injury to the animal and can be detrimental to the animal’s health and wellbeing. Correct by ensuring the
attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to oversee the provision of adequate veterinary care and have direct
knowledge of all aspects of animal care, to include all medications to be given and procedures performed.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Several animals were identified as in need of veterinary care during the inspection. The facility did not have any ocular
medications on hand even though they stated they had been treating the animals with eye problems described below. The
program of veterinary care does not provide any instructions for treatments and the veterinarian has not been consulted
on any of these specific conditions:
- A mutated white mink has dark, crusted material, flecks of blood, and matted fur surrounding his right eye. This animal


seemed agitated and was pacing his cage. When the licensee tried to catch him for closer examination, the animal did not
seem to want to be caught or handled and consistently tried to escape or wriggle out of the hold. The licensee could not
place his hands near the mink’s face even with sturdy leather (bite-resistant) gloves.
- An arctic fox appeared to have increased respiratory effort and noise. The noise sounded like a raspy snore or stertor,
but the facility representatives stated he was growling. When inspectors observed this animal for several minutes while
being quiet and crouching in a non-threatening manner, the animal continued to breath in this manner, with pronounced
abdominal movements in time with each breath.
- A white red fox has a small amount of thick yellow purulent discharge and a large amount of dark crusted material and
matted fur at the inner corner of the left eye.
- Nearly all the arctic fox as well as some red fox have large piles of soft to runny/pasty diarrhea accumulated on the
ground under the wire cage bottoms.
These conditions, particularly the ocular cases, can be extremely painful as the eye is exquisitely sensitive to pain and
inflammation. Diarrhea is also a distressing condition and can lead to serious dehydration if not adequately compensated.
These animals did not have water available to them at the time of the inspection (water dishes were empty or frozen
over). Correct by using appropriate methods as instructed by the attending veterinarian to diagnose, control, treat, and
prevent diseases and injuries such as these conditions.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is missing disposition records for 9 adult cats and 3 kittens that have been removed since the last inspection.
During today’s inspection, there are no adult cats or kittens present on the premises or made available for inspection.
Improper recordkeeping does not allow proper accountability of animals or proper tracking of animals during a disease


outbreak. Each dealer and exhibitor shall use Record of Disposition (APHIS FORM 7006) for all cats which fully and
correctly disclose all information required by the AWA concerning each cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held,
or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is not currently maintaining up to date acquisition and/or disposition records for animals on hand. Errors in
recordkeeping were noted in the following manner:
- On the last routine inspection conducted on 9/16/2021, there was a total of 595 animals inspected. There were also ten
fallow deer and an unknown number of alpaca (between 0 and 4) that were apparently at the facility during the last
inspection, but which were not made available during the inspection at that time and so were not recorded in the total.
Acquisition and disposition records that were available during today’s inspection account for 55 total acquisitions and 11
total dispositions since the last inspection. Today there is a total of 699 animals that were inspected. This means that
acquisition records of at least 46 animals are missing.
- 12 hedgehogs were purchased on 7/10/2021 that were not present or made available for inspection on 9/16/2021, but
were present and inspected today. No disposition or transfer records were available to show if the animals left the
property and thus were not on the premises at the time of the last inspection.
- 2 spotted rock squirrels were sold on 9/17/2021. These animals were not present or made available for the last
inspection completed the day prior on 9/16/2021. No acquisition records were available to document when they were
obtained, and no disposition or transfer records were available to show if the animals left the property and thus were not
on the premises at the time of the last inspection.
The records reflect an inconsistency in animal numbers and species both acquired and sold at the facility. Improper


record keeping does not allow for a complete inspection of the facility and does not facilitate proper tracking of animals
during a disease outbreak. Complete acquisition and disposition records containing all information required by the Animal
Welfare Act Regulations are necessary to be able to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure
their legal acquisition, proper care, age of the animals, and humane transportation. This requirement applies to all
regulated animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased or otherwise in possession of or under control of
the licensee, including any offspring born of any animal while that animal is in his or her possession or under his or her
control, and all regulated animals transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.

Facilities, outdoor.
The rabbit enclosure does not contain adequate shelter from cold weather. The enclosure consists of a wood frame with a
solid roof, one solid wood wall along the back, and three wire mesh walls and wire mesh floor. One wire mesh wall
adjacent to the back wall has a plywood board set up against it for a wind break. There is a small pile of hay or straw
covering about 1/3 of the enclosure floor. However, this is covered in fecal pellets and/or is wet and matted. There is not
adequate shelter to keep the rabbits warm. During the inspection the temperature was no warmer than 36 degrees
Fahrenheit according to The Weather Channel. Inadequate protection from the elements, including cold weather, is not
consistent with appropriate care and well-being. Correct by ensuring appropriate shelter offering protection from the cold
is provided for rabbits kept outdoors when the atmospheric temperature is below 40 F.

3.56(a)(1)

Sanitation.
The enclosure housing two rabbits has not been adequately cleaned. There is a pile of hay or straw covered with fecal
pellets spanning roughly 1/3 of the enclosure. The facility representative stated that the enclosure is stripped, washed,


and re-bedded once every week (last time was one week from today). This does not appear to be frequently enough to
keep the enclosure reasonably free of excreta and other debris. Inadequate cleaning can subject the rabbits to endure
dirty conditions or can pose a disease risk due to organisms harbored in fecal material and excreta. Correct by performing
periodic cleaning to keep primary enclosures reasonably free of excreta, hair, cobwebs, and other debris.

Facilities, general.
Several facility structures are not structurally sound or have been maintained in good repair:
- Approximately 40% of the wire enclosures housing skunks, raccoons, red fox, coatimundi and mink throughout the
facility have an excessive amount of rust present. The facility has been actively working on this issue as roughly 60% of
the enclosures were observed in this condition on the 9/16/2021 inspection report. Excessive amounts of rust affect the
structural strength and can pose risks to the animals of injury or escape in addition to preventing effective sanitization as
is required when new animals are moved into previously inhabited enclosures.
- One enclosure containing a Prevost’s squirrel has two wooden shelter boxes each with a protruding wood block that is
there for him to chew on. There are sharp points protruding from where these wood blocks are attached just below the
entrances to the boxes. Sharp points protruding from a structure which is intended for the animal to chew on pose a risk
of injury to the animal’s mouth or head while engaging in this activity.
The facility must ensure that enclosures are all structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and safely contain the animals.

Inside a large storage container (inactive freezer) in the wallaby barn is one opened bag of “Happy Hopper” diet currently
being used. Spilled on the floor of the freezer are several small piles of moldy feed. Even though the moldy feed is not
currently in the “to be fed out” bag, storing the opened bag in this container with the moldy feed exposes the “to be fed
out” diet to the mold spores, which can make animals sick if ingested. Additionally, two large open bags of canid diet are
stored inside a stock trailer without any additional measures to prevent contamination, mold, or spoilage. Correct by

Facilities, outdoor.
A large number of animals do not have access to an appropriate shelter: a total of 3 striped skunk, 83 red fox and 29 artic
fox. One of the male skunk was noticed to be shivering within its enclosure. A video taken during the inspection shows the
skunk continued to shiver for at least 3 minutes. The skunk’s enclosure had a shelter box but the door had been blocked,
restricting the skunk’s access to use the shelter. The rest of the enclosure consists of a wire floor and wire hooped walls &
roof, with no other wind or rain break. This same type of enclosure and method of restricting access to the shelter boxes
was observed for 11 of the 83 total red fox and 3 of the 29 total arctic fox as well as the 3 striped skunk. Most of these
enclosures had either nothing acting as additional wind or rain break, or a small section of shingle-like paper material
covering about 25% of the roof and not sufficient to afford adequate protection from the elements for the animals
contained therein. The facility representative stated that the majority of these shelters had been blocked off (either turning
the box so the door faced a wall or placing a board over the entrance hole) the day before in order to aid the facility
representatives in moving animals for breeding purposes. The remaining 72 red fox and 26 artic fox have enclosures that
do not have any form of protection from the elements on all four sides of their enclosure. All four sides and the floor of the


enclosure are all constructed with wire mesh. The top of the enclosure is the only solid surface to provide the animals with
any protection from the elements and weather extremes. The licensee stated that this is to keep their coats full by
preventing hair breakage associated with rubbing against or lying inside a shelter box. The Weather Channel recorded the
overnight low on 11/21-22/2021 at 21 degrees Fahrenheit and the high on 11/22/2021 at 37 degrees F. Inadequate
shelters do not allow the animals the ability to have protection from wind, rain, snow or other weather extremes. Cold
weather exposure can lead to hypothermia and/or unnecessary stress and discomfort. The licensee must ensure that all
animals have access to an appropriate shelter for the local climatic conditions and that afford them adequate protection to
prevent discomfort.

Facilities, outdoor.
This facility does not currently have a perimeter fence. The licensee had previously obtained a perimeter fence variance
for some of the species at the facility in 2012. However, there have been several changes to the overall facility and animal
inventory that were not covered under the previous variance approval in 2012. The facility was previously cited for the
lack of a perimeter fence or adequate variance approval on the last two routine inspection dated 11/26/2019 and
9/16/2021. The facility’s request for a new variance has been denied, and the previously approved variance has been
revoked by APHIS Administration. The lack of a perimeter fence does not allow for a secondary form of containment in
the event of an escape of dangerous or exotic species. In addition, there are no physical barriers in place that would
prevent unwanted animals or people from walking directly up to an enclosure and making contact with the animals
contained therein. The licensee must ensure a perimeter fence is properly in place or apply and receive approval for a
variance from the Administrator for all species that require a perimeter fence.

Space requirements.
At least 33 red fox and 5 raccoon are housed in enclosures with shelter boxes that do not provide adequate space:
- 3 large shelter boxes measuring 3 feet long x 2 feet deep x 22 inches high were provided to 5 adult-sized red fox each
- 2 large shelter boxes of the same dimensions were provided to 4 adult-sized red fox each
- 1 small shelter box measuring 2 feet long x 2 feet deep x 22 inches high were provided to 3 adult-sized red fox
- 2 small shelter boxes (measurements unknown but height clearly shorter than the tallest fox when standing in a normal
position) were provided to at least 2 red fox each
- 1 small shelter box measuring 30 inches long x 2 feet deep x 22 inches high were provided to 5 adult-sized raccoon
The licensees stated that many of these groups of animals were either spring or summer babies, and should already have
been moved, but they do not currently have enough cages. Inadequate space, especially within the shelter areas, may
lead to animals being excluded from protections from inclement weather. Correct by providing enclosures with adequate
space to allow each animal within the enclosure to make normal postural and social adjustments, including standing in a
naturally erect position, with adequate freedom movement.

3.129(b) Repeat

Feeding.
At least 40% of the food receptacles for the fox, raccoons, skunks, ferrets, and mink in the facility have an excessive
amount of rust or have buildup/deposits of old food present on them. Many of the food receptacles do not have a top or
cover that prevents rain from getting into the food. Rust and organic buildup prevents the food receptacles from being
properly cleaned and sanitized and may contaminate fresh food being deposited into these receptacles, which exposes
animals to disease hazards. Correct by ensuring all food receptacles are kept clean and sanitary or are replaced if


necessary, and measures are taken to prevent molding, contamination (including by rainwater), and deterioration or
caking of food.
3.130 Direct Repeat

Watering.
The animals do not have sufficient access to potable water to support their health and comfort. Inspectors arrived at the
facility around 10:30am for inspection. At that time, the facility representatives stated that they had not been able to care
for the animals yet that morning prior to the inspectors’ arrival. Over the course of the inspection, the majority of water
dishes were seen either empty or frozen solid. When asked about this, the facility representative stated that the animals
had been given water sometime the previous evening and that they are watered twice daily, which would normally have
begun about the time the inspection started. Several animals appeared not to have sufficient access to water considering
their health and comfort during the course of the inspection:
- A red fox was observed scratching continuously at its empty water bowl. When the facility representative was asked to
provide the fox with water, she first said that it would continue scratching and spill the water because that was a known
behavior. When pressed to fill the dish anyway, video taken by the inspectors shows that the fox drank the water nearly
continuously for 3 minutes and 45 seconds, interrupted only a short time when it raised its head and looked around for a
few brief moments.
- A raccoon was observed playing with one or two large ice chunks (the only remnants of water available in its water dish),
passing them back and forth between its front paws and alternately putting them in its mouth to chew and taking it back
out.
- Several other animals were seen scratching at or licking the bottom of the empty water dishes.
- A large number of arctic and red fox were noted to have large deposits of diarrhea under their cages. Diarrhea causes
dehydration when not adequately compensated with an appropriate intake of fluids such as by drinking fresh water.


The inability to access a sufficient amount of potable water can lead to dehydration, stress and unnecessary discomfort to
the animal. Correct by ensuring all animals are provided with access to a sufficient quantity of potable water, even during
cold weather, to provide for their health and comfort.
In addition, at least 45% of the water receptacles for the fox, raccoon and skunk have chew or scratch damage that do not
allow for proper cleaning or sanitation. This is an improvement from the 75% of receptacles that were identified on the
9/16/2021 inspection; however, these 45% seen today still have deposits of brown, red, or black material embedded into
the scratch marks or chewed areas. Having water receptacles that are not properly cleaned and sanitized expose the
animals to unnecessary hazards or can adversely affect the flavor and thus the animals’ willingness to actually drink the
water. Correct by ensuring all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary.

Employees.
The facility does not currently have an adequate number of trained personnel to properly maintain the professionally
accepted level of husbandry practices set forth in the subpart for the amount of animals present at the facility. Inspectors
arrived at the facility around 10:30am for inspection. Upon making contact, the facility representative stated that none of
the animals had been fed or cared for that morning due to other obligations that required her attention prior to her arrival.
Over the course of the inspection, the licensee or representative made comments like:
- “They would have water by now, if you were not here.”
- “With all these animals, it take time."
- “Do you know how long it takes for all these animals?”
- “It’s hard to keep up when I have another job.”
It is clear by the amount of non-compliant items at this facility, especially those identified as directly impacting the current
health, wellbeing and/or comfort of the animals present at the facility, such as the lack of water, lack of shelter and/or lack


of proper veterinary care, and the comments made by the licensee or representative, that they do not have enough
trained employees or personnel to commit the time required to maintain the accepted level of care for these animals.
Correct by ensuring the facility maintains the adequate number of trained personal to properly maintain the professionally
accepted level of husbandry for the amount of animals and species at the facility.
