CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Three enclosures housing two dogs each have an accumulation of fecal waste on 30 to 40 percent of available
dirt flooring. The waste buildup is located in the outdoor housing. The licensee stated that it had been a while since
the last time the fecal waste had been removed from the enclosures. The potential for soiling or caking of the hair
coat exists when the dogs have to walk or rest on the affected surface. Unsanitary living conditions could lead to
potential contamination, soiling or caking of the hair coat or disease risks. The licensee must ensure that all excreta
is removed from the primary enclosures on a daily basis to reduce any disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors.
