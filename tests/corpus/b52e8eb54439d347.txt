HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor portion of the sheltered housing facility, the enclosures are separated by vinyl plastic fencing. At the
level of the dogs, this fencing has a buildup of dirt and grime on it. This buildup of dirt and grime can cause a risk of
disease hazards towards the dogs. The fencing must be cleaned and sanitized every two weeks to prevent the
accumulation of dirt and grime.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In all the enclosures containing outside access doors, except for one, the access doors are framed in vinyl plastic
and have been excessively chewed by the dogs. This damage allows for dirt and food waste to penetrate the
surface of the vinyl which can result in disease hazards to the dogs. The vinyl plastic needs to be replaced or
altered in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization of the enclosures every two weeks.
