INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On inspection of the Semiannual Report of the Program Review and Facility Inspection addressed to the
Institutional Official, the plan and correction schedule for a significant deficiency was not adhered to and was not
reported to APHIS. The deficiency was related to the protocol citation identified on the previous USDA APHIS
inspection. On the Semiannual Report to the IO dated July 15, 2013 the deficiency was labeled as significant with a
plan to correct Protocol 2010-0628 by having the protocol be (cid:28)re-evaluated to ensure literature searches, narratives
and long term effects are properly described(cid:29). The correction schedule was marked for December 20, 2013. At time
of today'(cid:25)s USDA APHIS inspection the protocol had not been changed and failure to adhere to the plan and
schedule had not been reported to APHIS. Facility representatives indicated the reason for this was due to the fact
there were no more animals available for use on the study. Some IACUC members believed protocol 2010-0628
had been inactivated. Protocol 2010-0628 was never inactivated. Not only was this protocol unchanged but also the
protocol's annual review was approved in January 2014. It is a fundamental duty of the IACUC to correct all
deficiencies according to the plan and schedule stated in the Semiannual Report. Failure to comply with the
correction plan and schedule can result in a further decrease in animal welfare along with preventing the IO from
assuring the requirements of 9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3 will be met by the facility. Any failure to adhere to the plan and
schedule that results in a significant deficiency remaining uncorrected shall be reported in writing within 15 business
days by the IACUC, through the Intuitional Official, to APHIS and any Federal agency funding that activity.
Correct by notifying APHIS and any Federal agency funding this activity within 15 days.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 2010-0628 was cited on the previous inspection report dated 20 June 2013 for lacking a complete
description of the proposed use of the animals - the protocol did not mention any long term effect on the gait of the
pigs while being studied or how this long term effect was to be monitored and when/what criteria would require that
intervention was to be instituted. The correction date for the protocol to contain a complete description of the
proposed use of the animals was by Dec. 20, 2013. According to IACUC records review of the full protocol wasdone on 1/28/13 and the protocol expires on 1/28/16. According to a facility representative, an annual review of the
protocol was completed by a Designated Reviewer on 1/14/14 but no amendments or changes had been made to
the protocol by the principal investigator and approved by the IACUC between June 20, 2013 and Jan. 14, 2014. All
active protocols to conduct an activity involving animals, or to make a significant change in an ongoing activity
involving animals, must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals.
The inspection was conducted with a facility representative and the exit interview was conducted with the IO,
Director and Associate Director ORI, Associate Director DLAR, clinical veterinarians, ORI and DLAR staff.
