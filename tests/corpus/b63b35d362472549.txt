ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:20 AM on
29-AUG-19.
Arrived at the facility at 11:20 AM, called the first two numbers which were no longer correct (disconnected/wrong
person). Called the third number and reached voicemail, left a message with work phone number for the licensee to
call me back and advised that if I didn't receive a call back before 11:50 AM, an attempted inspection report would
be generated. Licensee did not return call that day, or by the time the report was generated.
