3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The ramp between the first and second climbing platforms in the sheep and goat enclosure has a broken wooden
horizontal slat. These slats provide better footing to the animals on the ramp and a broken one can lead to slips or
injuries on the broken edges.
Also, the first platform of this same climbing structure has eleven exposed screws protruding areas of the platform
where the wooden surface is missing or worn away. The exposed screws are approximately 2 inches in length and
can injure animals on the platform.
Facilities must be maintained in good repair to prevent injuries to the animals. Correct by repairing/replacing
missing/broken wood and removing exposed screws.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
