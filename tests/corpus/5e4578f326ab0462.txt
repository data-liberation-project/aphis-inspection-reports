ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In pen 50, there is a white and tan guinea pig with extensive hair loss over the shoulder, abdomen, and rump.
There are several other guinea pigs with varying degrees of hair loss in numerous enclosures.
In pen 47, there is a tri-colored guinea pig with severe injury or disease to the left hind-limb resulting in the inability
to stand and walk. In pen 9, there is a tri-colored juvenile guinea pig which is unable to stand or walk and shakes
when gently touched. In pen 55, there is a tri-colored juvenile guinea pig which is unable to stand or walk and was
being harassed by the other guinea pigs. When notified of this diseased guinea pig, the owner immediately
removed the animal from the enclosure.
In pen 4, there is a tri-colored guinea pig with multiple red, inflamed lesions on its back.
There are at least 10 other dead guinea pigs noted in several enclosures.
The owner stated that he had not observed the conditions of the ill and injured animals and had not contacted his
attending veterinarian for instructions on caring for these animals. The owner was also unable to provide a written
program of veterinary care.
The hair loss, inability to stand or walk, and red lesions can be indicative of disease and/or injury which can be
painful and affect the general health and well being of the animals. Failure to use appropriate methods to prevent,
control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries can result in pain to the animal and potentially worsening of the
condition. The licensee must implement and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that includes
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There were no records of the current number of guinea pigs on hand at the facility.
Records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the number of animals
held, owned, and acquired or disposed of are necessary in order to accurately track animals being used in regulated
activities to ensure their humane care and use. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to identifyanimal losses through escape or if there is disease in the facility that affects number of offspring born.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were several (at least 5) loose guinea pigs observed that had escaped from enclosures and were free on the
floor of the facility. There was one enclosure (Pen 34) in which the side wall sporadically opened because the latch
was broken, resulting in no side wall of the enclosure which contained 10 guinea pigs.
Housing facilities need to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals. Failure to do so can lead to injury
or death from falls to the ground, escape from the barn, or becoming trapped outside of the pen.
The facility must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury, to
contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals.

3.25(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The hay being used for feeding the guinea pigs was being stored in a pile directly on the floor on the stairs at the
entrance to the room housing the animals. It was difficult to walk up the stairs without stepping on the pile of hay.
Feed/food and bedding that is stored inappropriately can result in deterioration of the food or be contaminated by
pests, mold, or other sources and if used, cause illness in the animals.
Food supplies shall be stored in containers with tightly fitting lids or covers which adequately protect such supplies
against spoilage or deterioration and infestation or contamination by vermin.

3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There was a build-up of dirt, dust, grime, and cobwebs on the walls, floors, and ceilings of all of the enclosures.
Dirty enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the enclosure, and attract pests and vermin
that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
The facility must ensure primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of
excreta or debris.

3.31(b)
SANITATION.
There was a build-up of dirt, dust, grime, and cobwebs on the walls, ceiling, and floor of the room housing theguinea pigs including around window sills. There was an accumulation of hay and bedding on the floor of the room,
areas of standing water, and other miscellaneous debris such as pieces of plastic and wood.
The lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room and may contribute to spread
of disease.
The facility must keep premises clean and in good repair and free from accumulations of trash in order to protect the
animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
