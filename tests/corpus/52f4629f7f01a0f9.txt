ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates
was not available at the time of inspection, but was later provided to the inspectors. The plan addressed all the
required elements, but has not been reviewed and signed by the veterinarian since the housing accommodations for
specific animals (such as nets for older animals), the number of feedings, and the use of training has changed. The
plan must accurately reflect how the animals are currently being cared for and be approved by the attending
veterinarian.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative by Dr. Alex Andricos and Dr. Katharine Frank.
