2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A total of nine rabbits are housed together in an outside enclosure. At the time of inspection, one 3 year old female
rabbit was observed with a right head tilt and the right ear had red inflamed skin with scabs and puncture wounds.
The licensee informed the inspectors that the rabbit was currently under treatment for an ear mite infection but has
not been examined by their attending veterinarian for her current medical conditions.
Mercedes, a 5 year old female goat, was observed limping on her right front leg and holding it up when standing.
Lameness can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be
painful and distressing and affect the health and well-being of the animal. The licensee informed the facility that
Mercedes has not been seen by their attending veterinarian.
The facility must use appropriate means to prevent, control, diagnose and treat disease and injuries of animals with
medical issues. When problems relating to the animal health or behavior are observed, they must be examined by
the attending veterinarian in a timely manner so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
treatment and diagnosis.

SANITATION.
The tray under the wire enclosure that housed two guinea pigs and the plastic surfaces and little box in the
enclosure that housed 4 ferrets had an excessive amount of feces and urine soaked newspaper. Inside the crate in
the enclosure that housed nine rabbits dried feces and debris covered the floor. Excreta should be removed from
the primary enclosure as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to
minimize disease hazards. It is necessary to maintain a clean enclosure and sanitize it when soiled in order to
reduce contamination and reduce the risk of disease to the animals.Corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
