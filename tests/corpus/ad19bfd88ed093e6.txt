3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Male Labrador's pen had a piece of wood on ground with exposed nails. Dog house had areas around with entry
way with nail heads sticking out above the surface. A hole in the fencing on the gate was large enough for the dog
to put his head through. In sheltered housing, an indoor/outdoor access door on the top level kennel that houses a
male French Bulldog has jagged edges and sharp points on upper corner.
Poorly maintained facilities could cause injury to the animals. Owner must ensure all facilities are in good repair to
prevent injury. Owner must correct by Nov 5th, 2016.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Kennel containing the Female Labrador with puppies had excessive build up of fecal material on the gravel surface.
In sheltered housing, several feeders had accumulation of grime and buildup of material both inside and out.
Several inside wire cages had fecal material accumulated along edges. Waste material must be removed daily
from enclosures for disease control and to prevent vermin or other pest that could adversely affect the health and
well-being of the dogs. Feeders must be kept clean and free of buildup and debris to prevent contamination of food.
Owner must ensure that all the waste is removed from the enclosures daily or as needed, and each enclosure and
food containers are routinely cleaned and sanitized.
