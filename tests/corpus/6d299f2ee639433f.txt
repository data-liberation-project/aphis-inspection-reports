ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In a rabbit room, an un-labeled syringe with an unknown substance was identified on a table. The syringe was
disposed of by the facility representative. Syringes should be labeled and stored in a manner which minimizes its
potential to be misused.
In a drug cabinet located adjacent to a surgical suite, several expired drugs were observed to be stored intermingled
with in-date drugs. These drugs were removed at time of inspection.
Expired drugs should be labeled and separated from in-date drugs and or medical material to minimize its potential
to be misused.
Each research facility should establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
Corrected at time of inspection.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The floors of 9 dog enclosures are of slatted construction. The gaps between each individual slat is approximately
7/8 of an inch and is wide enough for the breed of dog housed in this enclosure to get their feet caught. It was
observed the dogs were spreading digits to keep from going through the openings in the floor. This may lead to
injury of their limbs and/or discomfort for the animals.
Primary dog enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have floors that are constructed in a
manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow the
dogs' feet to pass through any openings in the floor.
Corrected at time of inspection.An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
