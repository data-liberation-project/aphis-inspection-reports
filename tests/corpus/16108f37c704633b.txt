2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility had received reports in February 2015 from a customer of health issues affecting the guinea pigs that
were suspected to originate at the breeding facility. While the facility went on the interact with the customer for
decision making and diagnostic testing, the facility did not communicate this issue with the attending veterinarian
nor include the attending veterinarian in the diagnostic process. Each dealer must maintain a program of adequate
veterinary care that includes a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Many of the animals' enclosures had an accumulation of grime and organic residue on the lower edges and corners
which is not sanitizable. The primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to be kept free of a
buildup of excreta for the health and well-being of the animals.
