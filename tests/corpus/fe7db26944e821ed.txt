3.13(c)(3) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
Upon inspection of the crate of a sixteen week old Spinone puppy arriving on a KLM flight to SFO from Rome via
Amsterdam, it was discovered that no feeding and watering instructions were attached to the crate. There was a
sticker applied in Amsterdam stating that the animal had been fed and watered after arriving there, but it said the
animal was last offered food and water on 10/8 at 8:00. Assuming that was 8:00 AM, with the 8 hour time
difference, that would have been 12 AM SFO time, thirteen hours previous to the time of inspection at SFO. But this
is uncertain, as the information was unclear, and no feeding and watering instructions were provided from the
shipper.
Waybill # 074-57280510
Carriers must ensure that a certification is signed by the consignor that includes written instructions for feeding and
watering, and that this information is clearly visible on the primary enclosure so that the animal can be properly
cared for during transit.
This same issue was previously cited at this cargo office at SFO on 3/20/14 with an immediate correction date.
An exit interview was conducted with a cargo office representative.
