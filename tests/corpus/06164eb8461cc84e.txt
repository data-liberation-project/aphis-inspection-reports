ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has some formal arrangements with a veterinarian, however it is very limited and does not include
information such as: Types of species of primates at the facility, and what type of dog food is acceptable for use
with the Coatimundi. Without properly completed formal arrangements with a veterinarian there is no way to ensure
that animals are receiving adequate care. Complete formal arrangements with a veterinarian.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are no written records annotating where animals on the facility were acquired from. A primate and an
opossum have died since the last inspection and nothing regarding the dates or circumstances are annotated..
Without adequate records keeping, there is no way to properly track animals acquisition or disposition. Create a
written inventory of animals with all pertinent information required.
3.75(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The freezer currently being used to store animal food continues to be soiled with bits of food waste and insects on
the shelf with the food. There is a risk of contamination if food is not properly stored in a clean environment.
Sanitize the animal food storage area and ensure that no other items are stored on or around them.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are excessive amounts of rust on many of the sugar glider cages and cage stands. Excessive rust can affect
the structural strength of the cage and impair adequate sanitation. The rust on these cages needs to be removed
and any defects caused by the rust repaired or these cages and stands need to be replaced in order to adequately
protect the animals from injury and illness and to contain the animals.
3.127(d) REPEATFACILITIES, OUTDOOR.

be kept in good repair and kept closed to prevent unwanted animals and persons from gaining access to the facility,
and to function as a secondary containment system in case of animal escape. Ensure perimeter fence is closed
and secure at all times.
