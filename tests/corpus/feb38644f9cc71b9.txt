ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
During the on-site inspection of animal facilities, it appeared that all nonhuman primates were receiving basic
enrichment as directed by the environmental enrichment plan. Animals requiring special attention under this section
were receiving an extra enrichment device each week. The duration of interaction with this enrichment was less
than one day. The success or failure of special attention being provided to these animals was not sufficiently
documented to determine if the special attention was effective, and/or if adjustments were needed to help address
the psychological distress. Correct by assessing and documenting the effectiveness of the special attention being
provided, and implementing modifications to the environmental enrichment provided to these animals as needed
and as approved by the attending veterinarian. To be corrected prior to the next inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with the attending veterinarian.
