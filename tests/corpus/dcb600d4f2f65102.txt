CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
The facility is currently housing two rabbits with two ducks in the same primary enclosure inside the Discovery
Center. Housing rabbits with other species may affect their health and well-being and increase the risk of injury to
the rabbits. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure rabbits are not housed in the same primary
enclosure with any other species unless required for scientific reasons.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the Discovery Center inside the storage/food preparation room is an open bag of dry cat food sitting on the stairs
that had been previously fed to the skunk. Inside the commissary/warehouse is an open bag of livestock feed
sitting on the ground and on the shelf an open bag of Corid medicated feed for calves. There is potential for vermin
to contaminate the food, rapid deterioration or molding which could cause disease or illness to the animals.
Ensure that all food and bedding are stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration,
molding, or contamination by vermin.
