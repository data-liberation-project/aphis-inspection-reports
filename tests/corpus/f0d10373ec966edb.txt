FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The corrugated siding on the barn is rusting along the bottom and there are portions of these walls that have
become separated resulting in sharp edges protruding into the enclosure. In addition, the corrugated door,
connecting the corral and barn pens, also has is heavily rusted and is deteriorating with sharp bottom edges. There
is a log next to the siding. There is enough room between the metal siding of the barn and the log for a foot to get
caught. The presence of sharp edges can injure animals coming in contact with them. Outdoor housing facilities
should be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. A system should be in
place to ensure animal housing areas are maintained in good repair.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The animal transport trailer has not been cleaned since the facility(cid:25)s last trip. Bedding and fecal material wasobserved in the trailer as well as in 2 uncovered trash cans. There was also loose bedding and fecal material
around the trash cans. Flies were present in these areas. The presence of fecal material and other debris can
attract flies and other pests to animal areas potentially increasing the risk of disease hazards. A system should be in
place to ensure timely removal and disposal of waste products.

SANITATION.
The corral and barn areas house one bovine, one alpaca, 12 goats, and two sheep. These areas have an excess of
fecal material on the ground and the dirt floors. There were no areas in the enclosure free of excreta. The enclosure
should be cleaned more frequently in order to prevent contamination of the animals, to minimize disease hazards,
and to reduce odors and pests. A system should be in place to ensure animal housing areas are cleaned more
often to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.

SANITATION.
The corral area had a deteriorating wooden cable spool. The spool is about 3 feet in diameter and had bolts
protruding from the collapsed spool. The deteriorated wooden spool and metal bolts were removed at the time of
inspection. The interior of the barn on the west side has erosion of the dirt floor. There is erosion at several levels
(about 9-12(cid:29) in height). The grounds shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. A routine maintenance program to review and fix problems is
needed to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.

SANITATION.
In the barn and trailer area there is a high presence of flies in this area and there are numerous ground squirrel
holes in and around the barn. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and
