3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
One enclosure containing two foxes has two screws that are protruding upward into the enclosure from the flooring. The
foxes can step directly onto the screws.

One enclosure containing at least one raccoon has a broken wire that is protruding inward into the enclosure and is
located at the level of the animal.

One enclosure containing at least two skunks has multiple broken wires running along the bottom of one side panel. The
broken wires are protruding into the enclosure and the animals can come into direct contact with them.

Sharp points and contact with metal screws could cause injury to the animals.

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor
and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals. The licensee must remove the sharp points and metal screws from the enclosures
and ensure all enclosures are maintained in good repair at all times. The licensee was able to remove the sharp points

from the raccoon and skunk enclosures at the time of the inspection.

At least three wooden nest boxes, accessed by a total of approximately seven skunks, have areas of flooring that are
heavily saturated with urine. The wood is so heavily saturated that urine visibly drained out when the inspector applied
digital pressure to the boards. The boards felt soft and spongy and the wood easily peeled away.

Soft and saturated wood is not structurally sound and may fail to contain the animals within the enclosure.

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor
and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals. The licensee must either replace, repair or alter the soft and saturated wood in a
manner that ensures the structural integrity of the nest boxes. The licensee must ensure that all aspects of the enclosure
are maintained in good repair at all times.
3.126(b)

Facilities, indoor.
The ammonia level inside the raccoon building is extremely high. The inspectors' eyes felt irritated throughout the
inspection of the building. Large puddles of urine and piles of feces are located beneath each raccoon enclosure. Three
hundred and thirty-nine raccoons are housed in the building.

High levels of ammonia could cause discomfort to the animals as well as lead to further health issues.

Indoor housing facilities shall be adequately ventilated by natural or mechanical means to provide for the health and to

prevent discomfort of the animals at all times. Such facilities shall be provided with fresh air either by means of windows,
doors, vents, fans, or air-conditioning and shall be ventilated so as to minimize drafts, odors, and moisture condensation.
The licensee must ensure that the ammonia is kept at a compliant level either by removal of ammonia causing waste
and/or proper ventilation at all times in order to support the health of the animals.

To be corrected by: At the time of the inspection the licensee opened the windows that run along the length of both sides
of the building which resulted in an immediate improvement in the ammonia level.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
Within the ferret room, the inspector observed a mouse run across the top of the animal enclosures and across a pile of
ferret food. A large amount of rodent feces are located on the tops of nest boxes and on food containers in empty
enclosures. The licensee stated that he puts out mouse poison underneath the raised ferret enclosures and also houses
a barn cat in the room. Two hundred and fifty-six ferrets are housed in the room.

Pests such as rodents could contaminate food supplies and increase the risk of disease towards the animals.

A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be
established and maintained. The licensee must establish an effective plan for the control of rodents in the ferret room.
The licensee must ensure that all programs for the control of pests are effective to support the health of the animals.
