SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Section 3.128 Space requirements: The two capybara are housed in an enclosure without a water receptacle that is
large enough for them to at least submerge their bodies into water. The capybara have a water dish in the shelter
and a rubber tub with about 2 inches of water outdoors. Under natural conditions capybara spend a significant
portion of their time in water. Compliance with space requirements means there should be both dry and aquatic
portions of the primary enclosure, each which, at a minimum, provide sufficient space to allow the animal to make
normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. During warm weather the capybara have access
to an outdoor pool which is empty of water now. Correct by providing the capybara a water receptacle for the
shelter that is large enough and deep enough for them to submerge their bodies into the water and move in the
water when they do not have access to their outdoor pool. Correct by February 24, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility vice president.
