PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the room housing adult dogs, the enclosure flooring is raised off the ground and constructed of wire. In one
enclosure, containing one dog, the wire floor has a hole in it that is approximately three inches wide. All flooring
must be constructed in a manner that does not allow for the dog's feet and legs to pass through. The flooring needs
to be replaced or altered in a manner that protects the dogs from injury and the licensee must establish a
maintenance plan for the enclosure flooring to ensure it remains safe for the dogs and in good repair.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the last enclosure in the puppy room, hard water mineral has built up on some of the metal bars. In the room
housing the adult dogs, the first enclosure has hard water mineral buildup on the automatic waterer. This buildup of
hard water mineral does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of the metal bars or the automatic waterer.
This buildup of hard water minerals must be removed in order for cleaning and sanitization of these areas every two
weeks.
