ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One llama, brown with white markings, is in need of foot care/trimming on all four feet. The hooves are overly long
and are curling/rotating due to their excess length. It appears that the llama's foot/ankle joint is positioned/held in an
abnormal, dropped position due to the excess length of the hooves when the llama was standing still. The llama
was noted walking around a small area without any obvious limp. Long hooves can lead to discomfort to the animal
and abnormal pressures on the muscles and joints of the legs. The facility shall have the llama's hooves trimmed.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The acquisition and disposition records were available for review today but were not up to date. The records list
more animals than are actually present on site for all species. For example, there are 9 pigs present on site. The
records state that there are 13 pigs on hand. In another example there were many more goats recorded that were
present. The owner stated that five goats had died and 3 had been sold that were not yet updated in the records.
Accurate records are necessary for health and ownership tracing. The facility shall make and keep up to date all
required information for all animals.

3.125(d) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A large amount of accumulated excreta was noted again during this inspection in the pasture directly behind the
house housing goats and camelids (alpaca/llamas). The owner reported it had not been cleaned out since the last
inspection. In addition, there is a large area of hay on the ground in the pasture in the front of the house where fresh
hay is fed on the ground. There is a lot of accumulated excreta on this hay. There is an large amount of
accumulated excreta on the ground/mats in the sheltered portion of the pig housing. There is a strong excreta odorinside. If the pigs come inside to seek shelter from bad weather they have to stand in the excreta as there was no
dry/clear area. Their legs, feet and abdomens were noted covered by brown mud with excreta.
The accumulation of wastes can attract flies and lead to spread of disease such as parasitic infections. The owner
reports that he has purchased a new tractor to use to clean the pastures but has not yet had time to do so.
Provision shall be made for the removal and disposal of animal wastes regularly to prevent accumulations.
3.127(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*The owner reported that two goats and one alpaca died during the recent severe cold weather. The owners were
out of town at the time but the animals had access to the covered shelter structure in the pasture behind the house
and a neighbor was checking on the animals daily. The shelter is divided into three stalls. It is a total of
approximately 8x18 ft. This shelter does not appear to supply enough room to shelter all the animals adequately
including all the goats, sheep, cows, alpacas, llamas and mini donkeys (36 total today) especially if some do not get
along. The trees along the sides of the pasture are currently without leaves and do not provide protection from rain,
wind, and cold.
*Two cows and a zebu in the far pasture behind the riding arena do not have a shelter structure and the leafless
trees do not provide sufficient protection from winds, rain and cold weather.
The owner has purchased two shelter structures and has them on the property but they have not yet been set up in
the pastures.
Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to local climatic conditions for the species concerned must be provided for the
animals kept outdoors to provide protection and prevent discomfort.
3.127(c) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*The ground of the outdoor portion of the pig housing is completely composed of sloppy wet mud. The pigs
feet/lower legs sink completely into the mud such that the abdomens of the pigs are touching the mud. A sucking
sound is made when the pigs pick up their feet to walk. The muddy ground may lead to feet/leg/skin issues, spread
of disease, discomfort and keep the animals wet which can lead to hypothermia in winter weather conditions.
*The ground just in front of the shelter structure for the goats, sheep, llamas and alpacas is muddy as is the ground
inside the shelter's stalls. Wet shelter areas are uncomfortable for resting and can lead to wet, hypothermic body
conditions.
A suitable method must be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water to ensure that the animals are provided a dry
space so they can remain dry and comfortable. Correct by Feb. 7, 2017. This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
