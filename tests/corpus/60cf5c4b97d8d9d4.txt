Personnel qualifications.
Two of seven rabbits died from inappropriate placement of central venous line catheters. Per a facility representative, the
study member that conducted the procedure lacked experience in placing central venous catheters in rabbits under
anesthesia. One of the necropsy reports supports the poor placement of the catheter because the heart was punctured.
The second rabbit, per the facility representative, most likely also died from poor placement of the central venous catheter
based on blood loss seen during the attempt and necropsy findings. Post-incident, the facility representative questioned
the study member on their experience with rabbit central venous catheter placements. It was revealed, even though the
study member had experience placing central lines in other animal species, they had never done so in rabbits before.
• Because the individual placing the central venous lines lacked experience in placing them in this study’s species of
interest, rabbits, avoidable deaths occurred. It shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all
scientists, research technicians, animal technicians and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment and use are
qualified to perform their duties which shall be fulfilled in part through the provision of training and instruction to those
personnel.
• This incident was self-reported to the IACUC, and corrective actions had been developed and implemented at the time
of inspection.


2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
The facility self-reported the death of a female white-tailed deer which occurred on December 10, 2021, at a deer
research facility. The deer (W130) was sedated for a study but upon administration of the reversal agent, she temporarily
stopped breathing. Even though CPR was performed, she had difficulty recuperating and died shortly thereafter. Per an
internal investigation, it was determined an overdose of the reversal agent was most likely the cause of death.
Furthermore, per the facility representative, the amount of reversal agent used was not determined by the specific body
weight of this animal as required in the protocol.
• Mistakes in handling, mainly involving the recovery period and overdosing of the reversal agent, by all indications
contributed to the death of this deer. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a
manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary
discomfort.
• This incident was self-reported to the IACUC, and corrective actions had been developed and implemented at the time
of inspection.
3.81(b)

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
A female macaque (116-18) was found February 24, 2022, with her right cheek caught in a metal clip that attached an
enrichment item outside the primary enclosure. The monkey was observed within an hour of the incident occurring and
when found, per the facility representative, was observed in distress. Her cheek was stuck in the clip, which was also still
attached to the primary enclosure, thereby tethering her to it. A puncture wound resulted that was approximately 1.5 cm in
length and communicated with the inner cheek pouch to the outer cheek skin. The injury required anesthesia and
veterinary care to repair. These clips had been used routinely at the facility without any problems prior to this incident but


were immediately removed from all this species’ enclosures afterwards.
• This enrichment item in this specific enclosure caused injury and therefore did not allow the macaque to express non-
injurious species typical activity. The physical environment in the primary enclosures must be enriched by providing
means of expressing non-injurious species-typical activities.
• This incident was self-reported to the IACUC, and corrective actions had been developed and implemented at the time
of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
