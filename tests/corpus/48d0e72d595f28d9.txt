2.40(a) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of the inspection the facility did not as yet have an attending veterinarian and thus no signed program of
veterinary care. The facility is in the process of hiring an attending veterinarian.
Animals can become sick or injured and require immediate veterinary care. An attending veterinarian is also
required to provide health care checks and husbandry advice. The facility should ensure that a veterinarian with
marine mammal experience is employed and available to perform the necessary functions of an attending
veterinarian.
