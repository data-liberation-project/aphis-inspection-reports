3.26(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Interior surfaces. There are still areas of bare wood on the floor in the guinea pig building where the paint is worn or
scratched off. The floor was repainted since the last inspection report, but paint has peeled off in high traffic areas
especially in front of the enclosures on the right side of the building. The paint on the wooden floor is not holding up
to daily activities such as cleaning, feeding, and watering. The interior building surfaces such as floors must be
constructed and maintained so that they are substantially impervious to moisture and can be repeatedly cleaned
and sanitized. Correct by ensuring the floor where bare wood is present is resealed or covered with an impervious
surface that can be repeatedly cleaned and disinfected.
Remains uncorrected.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
