ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:45pm -
4:15pm on 13-Feb-20.
I knocked on the door, called and left a voicemail. The licensee emailed me informing me that she is out of town for
the day and would not be available to do an inspection.
