FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.25(a) Structural strength: There were two escaped white Djungarian hamsters loose on the floor of the
animal room. These hamsters were captured when identified by the APHIS official during this inspection. Injury
may occur from falls and exposure to dangerous substances when an animal escapes out of its enclosure. There
were about 10 animal enclosures with full thickness cracks at either the bottom covered with tape or at the top just
below the enclosure lid/top. Correct by ensuring all animal enclosures are structurally sound and worn/broken
enclosures are replaced. Correct by March 19, 2016.
3.29(d)
FEEDING.
Section 3.29(d) Feeding: There were about 30 dwarf hamster enclosures with an excessive buildup of rust on the
feeder lid. The rust may contaminate the pelleted feed and the excessive rust prevents the feeders from being
properly sanitized. The animals chew on the feeder lids while eating and may become ill. Correct by ensuring that
the feeder lids are not rusty and rusty feeder lids are replaced. Correct by March 25, 2016.3.30
WATERING.
Section 3.30 Watering: There were about 20 enclosures, each with two dwarf hamsters and their offspring, that had
green algae in the water bottles. Drinking water containing algae may cause the hamsters to become ill. Correct by
ensuring water bottles/receptacles are sanitized at a frequency that prevents the buildup of algae or debris in the
water, and at a minimum of every two weeks. Correct by March 14, 2016.
