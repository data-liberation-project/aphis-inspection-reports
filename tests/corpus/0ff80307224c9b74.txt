2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The applicant has an attending veterinarian and a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). However, the written
PVC is incomplete and inaccurate. There is no dosage, route of administration, frequency, or concentration listed
on the PVC for any of the routine or preventative treatments. There are also species listed on the PVC including
birds and reptiles which should not be referenced. The method and administration of euthanasia was also not up to
date or accurate. There were previous methods of euthanasia referenced that are no longer in practice and the
current method of euthanasia did not include route or dosage information.
The applicant must consult with the attending veterinarian and develop a complete and accurate written program of
veterinary care that reflects the practices at this facility. The written program of veterinary care will ensure that there
is accurate communication between the applicant and the attending veterinarian and ensure that all routine
medications and vaccines provided to the animals by the applicant are done with the direction and knowledge of the
attending veterinarian.
To be corrected by 2/7/2017.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee did not have complete acquisition records. For several regulated animals, the address of the person
from whom the animals were purchased or acquired from was missing. Additionally, the vehicle's license number
and state and/or the driver's license number and state were also missing for several animals. Records containing
the required information for animals acquired for use in regulated activities, including those offspring born on
premise, are necessary in order to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to ensure their
humane care and use. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition of all animals that fully
and correctly discloses the required information.
To be corrected from this date forward.3.28(c)(2)(ii) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The interior height of the primary enclosures housing dwarf hamsters (unweaned and breeding groups) is still 5
inches and still does not meet the requirements of at least 6 inches. Insufficient interior height of the primary
enclosure does not allow the animals to make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. A
system should be in place and maintained to ensure this requirement is met.
3.28(c)(2)(iv) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In 51 total primary enclosures, the facility is still housing nursing female dwarf hamsters with other adult hamsters.
The Veterinary Medical Officer (VMO) noted 1 male hamster with a single nursing female and their offspring of
varying ages in 18 total enclosures. The VMO noted 1 male hamster with two nursing females and their offspring of
varying ages in 33 additional enclosures. Overcrowding of pregnant and nursing female hamsters can increase
stress to the dam and result in increased rates of cannibalism of the offspring and fighting. A system should be in
place to ensure nursing female hamsters with her litter shall be housed in an enclosure that contains no other
hamsters and provides the required amount of floor space.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with all three of the facility representatives.
