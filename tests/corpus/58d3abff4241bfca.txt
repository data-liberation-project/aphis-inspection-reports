INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The search for alternatives in protocols 2003270-090218 GA and 2002568-111416GA is incomplete. There are no
keywords used to reflect the actual potentially painful or stressful procedures being performed on the macaques in
the studies.
The IACUC shall insure that the principle investigator has completed a thorough search for alternatives to determine
that alternatives are not available. This requirement ensures that the procedures in the proposal involving the use of
animals minimize discomfort, distress and pain.
To be corrected by October 31, 2015.

MISCELLANEOUS.
In December 2014 a 7 month old female macaque was found dead outside of her enclosure and in the adjacent
enclosure. The macaques had been shifted into the adjacent run through a connecting tunnel the previous day to
allow their enclosure to be cleaned. They were then shifted back into their primary enclosure. There was no
observation made at that time that a macaque was missing. It could not be determined upon facility review how the
macaque accessed the adjacent enclosure. Because it could not be determined how the macaque got out of her
enclosure and into the other enclosure additional husbandry procedures have been put in place, as well as
additional training in the procedures.
All animals shall be handled in a manner that will minimize distress and protect them from injury. The corrective
and preventive measures instituted after the incident appear to be appropriate.
Corrected.
