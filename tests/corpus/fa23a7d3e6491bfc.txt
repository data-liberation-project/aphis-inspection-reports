ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee is not scheduling regular visits to her facility by her Attending Veterinarian. Her Program of Veterinary
Care states that these visits will occur annually or more often if needed; however, the last visit was on November
25, 2013. These visits are necessary to ensure that the Program of Veterinary Care is being understood and
followed by the licensee, to check the health of the dogs, and to determine if changes in the Program of Veterinary
Care are needed. The licensee must ensure that the Attending Veterinarian is visiting her facility on a regular basis.

2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult male French Bulldog named "Pierre" had excessively long toenails on both front feet. The toenails caused
the toes to be displaced sideways when he stood, especially when on a solid surface. Also the toenails curled
around the wire on the floor and sides of the enclosure as he stood on and jumped against the wire. Excessively
long toenails can result in injury from getting hooked on the wire, can affect the dog's normal gait due to the
displaced toes, and can be painful. The licensee must trim this dog's toenails and must establish a maintenance
program for toenail care for all dogs.

appearing as a dark brown material on the dog doors. Dirt and grime can harbor organisms that can cause disease
in dogs. The licensee must spot-clean and sanitize hard surfaces that come into contact with the dogs as often as
necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
