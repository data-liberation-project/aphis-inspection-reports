2.126(c)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
2.126 (c). An inspection was attempted at the home site at 11:00 am on 09/16/2015, however it was discovered that
the exhibitor was out of town. No current itinerary has been received by USDA-APHIS-Animal Care that accounts
for this travel. In the case of traveling exhibitors, itineraries must be submitted to USDA via fax, mail, or electronic
mail at least two days prior to any overnight travel. The submission of itineraries allows USDA to conduct
inspections in order to assess the welfare of the animals both at home and while traveling. Current itineraries
should be submitted to USDA in a timely manner.
