2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records of animals on hand are incomplete. There is no information as to the source of the animals on most of
the entries.
Accurate records are a requirement of licensure.
This is a repeat non-compliance. Previous correction date was January 2, 2015.
3.127(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The cattle (2) have been moved to a different pasture with their own shelter.
The enclosure nearest the highway containing 2 llamas, 3 sheep, and 5 goats has inadequate shelter space for the
number of animals contained in the enclosure.
The animals must have shelter from inclement weather and from direct sunlight that will accomodate all the animals
at the same time. One must consider size of animals as well as individual compatibilities when determining whether
the amount of space is adequate.
This is a repeat non-compliance. The correction date was January 2, 2015.
3.127(c) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The series of enclosures nearest the highway (gates are open, so several are accessible to the animals) have a lot
of standing water and mud throughout. There is standing water under the eaves of one of the shelters, reducing the
already inadequate area of shelter from the rain. The llamas have no accessible dry resting place.
There is work in progress to remedy the situation by removing mud in the worst areas and replacing it with crushed
rock. An enclosure behind the main building is being expanded to incorporate shelter that will accomodate the
llamas. The mud-caked condition of the animals indicates this work is long overdue.Correct as soon as possible,but no later than 2/10/2015.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
Discussed feeding the animals, monitoring condition of the animals, and asked them to determine specific amounts,
in pounds, of hay to feed daily to ensure adequate nutrition.
