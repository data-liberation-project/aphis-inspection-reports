HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At time of inspection numerous wire pen dividers are rusted to the point that they are starting to deteriorate and
break apart causing broken wires in the divider panels. The divider panels in these pens must be replaced or
repaired in a manner that removes the rust and repairs the broken wires. This must be done to ensure that the
structural integrity is not compromised and that the animals are protected from injury due to broken wires. The
bottom support pipes for these wire panels where rusty, need to be painted to prevent further rusting and
deterioration. To be corrected by 10-30-14.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
