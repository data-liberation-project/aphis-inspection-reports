2.131(a) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A young male tamandua that had arrived three weeks earlier was found dead on June 27, 2019. The animal had
not been quarantined nor acclimated to its new environment, but was housed in a round enclosure in a central
location inside the busiest area of the petting zoo. The licensee estimated that the tamandua had weighed
approximately 8 pounds, but wasn't certain; and the animal had experienced some weight loss, which may have
been from about 8 ounces to one pound. There were no written records to document the actual body weight of the
animal, nor the amount/progression of this weight loss. The animal was never examined by a veterinarian. No
necropsy was conducted; thus, the cause of death is unknown.
All licensees who maintain wild or exotic animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of the
species they maintain. Lack of knowledge of this species was a contributing factor in the death of the tamandua.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection was conducted with the facility representative. An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee by
phone on July 9, 2019.
