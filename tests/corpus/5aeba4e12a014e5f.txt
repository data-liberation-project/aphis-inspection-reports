FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Two groups of animals do not currently have a shelter which they can go under to get out of extreme weather such
as heavy rain. Three yak, 8 pigs, and one bovine in one pasture, and six nilgai in a smaller pasture only have some
natural tree and bamboo along the fence lines to shelter from the elements. The nilgai are brought into the adjacent
barn in the winter months. Other means of shelter need to be provided to protect the animals from the discomfort of
the cold and rain. To be corrected by 11-13-17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
