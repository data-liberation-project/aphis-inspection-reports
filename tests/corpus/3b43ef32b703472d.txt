ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* There were four vials of Feline Rhinotracheitis Calici-Panleukopenia with an expiration date of 06/15. These
vaccines were found intermingled with other vaccines in the refrigerator and are therefore considered ready for use.
The usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary
practice. Expired medications and vaccines can experience spoilage or have reduced efficacy. This could result in
decreased immunity for the animals being vaccinated. The licensee must ensure that all vaccines/medications used
at the facility have not gone past the recorded expiration date. Correct by 10/15/15.
*******************************************
* The current program of veterinary care( PVC) stated that the non human primate (NHP) was under the care of
another veterinarian. The licensee stated that she had a PVC signed by another veterinarian specific for the NHP
but she was unable to find it during the inspection. It is important that the NHP is included in a written PVC to
ensure she is receiving adequate veterinary care. The licensee must ensure that the program of veterinary care
covers all species being housed at the facility. The program of veterinary care must be made available for review
during inspections to ensure adequate veterinary care is being provided. Correct by 10/15/15.
