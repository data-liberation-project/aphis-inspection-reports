2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
*A current written program of veterinary care was not available during the inspection. The program of veterinary
care was last reviewed by the attending veterinarian in 2011 and the following was noted:
-There was not a current inventory of animals listed. Section III A lists calves, pigs and rabbits, however, only
rabbits and pigs are currently housed at the facility.
-Section III D did not indicate the specific method of euthanasia to be utilized which includes the route and dosage.
-Section 1A did not list the correct designed official. The facility changed ownership, however, the designated
official information had not been updated to accurately reflect the change.
***Failure to have an accurate written program of veterinary care that has been reviewed by the attending
veterinarian does not provide for adequate veterinary care of the animals. It is the responsibility of the licensee to
ensure the written program of veterinary care accurately reflects the species of animals, method(s) of euthanasia
and designated official(s)in order to ensure appropriate veterinary care will be provided.
