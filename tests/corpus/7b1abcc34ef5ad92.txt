2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
This facility has been cited on 2/6/15 and on 5/12/15 for lacking adequate experience and knowledge of cougars.
They also were cited on 5/1/15 for a failure to handle this animal in a manner where there was minimal risk of harm
to the public and the animal. The animal at that time was controlled by a system of leads, but it was too fast, too
large, and too unpredictable to be handled safely by the lead system. Since that time, the 3 primary cougar handlers
attended a half-day training session at a major zoo, and also had staff from that zoo observe their handling
techniques on site over a two day period of time. Also, the new Head Animal Trainer, who does not personally
handle the animal, attended the same half-day session as mentioned above. The two secondary animal handlers
have worked under the supervision of a primary handler, but have never had any formal training beyond what was
available at the facility. The animal is currently handled by a two lead system using a primary handler and a
secondary handler, with another primary handler available by radio. On 3/7/16, the facility was notified that the level
of training and experience does NOT fulfill the correction requirements of the citation of 5/12/15. The facility still has
not completed training and gained experience handling (cid:28)adult(cid:29) cougars. Most of their training has been handling
their own animal as it grows and develops. They need to be able to anticipate the future handling requirements of
this animal. Failure to handle the animal properly will increase the risk of harm to the animal or to the public, or may
lead to potential escape. This facility must either hire an individual who has the necessary handling experience and
knowledge, or obtain the necessary experience themselves before continuing to handle this animal in this manner
(by the lead system).
REMAINS UNCORRECTED
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The current outdoor enclosure lacks an adequate 8(cid:25) perimeter fence. The perimeter fence on the north and part of
the east side is approx. 7 feet tall. There is a gate on the east side that is only 6(cid:25) high, and the fence on the west
side is farm fence and farm gates, opening into a horse pasture, that is approx. 4(cid:25) high. The cougar is currently led
out to the outdoor enclosure from the building into an open area on two leads before being led into the outdoor
enclosure. The new cougar enclosure will have an outdoor section attached to the indoor area by a guillotine door,but the outdoor fence and perimeter fence have not yet been built. This current perimeter fence is not adequate to
keep unauthorized animals and persons away from the cougar, or to operate as a secondary containment
system. Failure to maintain an adequate perimeter fence can lead to potential escape with devastating effects upon
the welfare of this animal, or potential human injury or disease potential from contact with infected animals. The
facility must maintain an 8(cid:25) perimeter fence, as required by this section, around all outdoor enclosures for
dangerous animals or large felines.
Correct before utilizing the outdoor enclosures again.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
On the day of the inspection, the 20 month old female cougar was housed in an enclosure that measures approx.
15(cid:25) X 11(cid:25). This is the same enclosure that was cited prospectively on 4/20/15 as inadequate space for a mature
cougar. At the time of the inspection the animal was observed leaping from corner to corner of the cage. There were
some cage complexities, a small corner shelf and a swinging platform that it would leap onto. It was explained that
this animal stays in this enclosure when the weather is inclement, as it was the day of the inspection. This animal
currently has a larger outdoor enclosure that it is led to (with two handlers, on two leads) when the weather is
acceptable. The facility is also building a new enclosure that will have a combined indoor/outdoor exhibit that
appears large enough for a mature cougar. On days when the weather is inclement or there are not enough
handlers on site to leash walk the animal to its outdoor enclosure, this animal lacks sufficient space to make normal
postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Lack of adequate space can lead to stress or abnormal
behavior problems.
