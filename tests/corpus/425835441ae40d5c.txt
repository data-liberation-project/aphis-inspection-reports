2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The last documented veterinary visit was March 30, 2012. The licensees state the attending veterinarian has been
out to the facility since that date, but they have not evaluated the dog kennel or the kangaroos. There is currently
one kangaroo with severe health complications. Veterinary visits are required in order to ensure the proper health
and care of the animals. Licensees with a part-time or consultant veterinarian must have formal arrangements with
an attending veterinarian to include regularly scheduled visits to the premises at least annually.

2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One male red kangaroo, approximately 2 years old, is repeatedly circling to the left with a mild head tilt to the left.
Both eyes are moderately protruding from the head. There is a light pink soft tissue structure approximately 1cm in
size present at the inside corner of both eyes. Failure to seek medical care for animals showing signs of illness or
injury can lead to unnecessary pain and discomfort for the animals or further veterinary complications. The animal
listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained
and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment
and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.
This animal must be evaluated by a veterinarian by 5:00 pm on January 23, 2015.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are no acquisition records for four camels and one kangaroo. Complete and accurate records must be kept in
order to facilitate tracking/tracing of animals. Records must be made, kept and maintained that fully and correctlydisclose information concerning all animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, transported,
sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of and shall include any offspring born while in the licensees possession.
3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are four outdoor enclosures that have severely rusted cage doors. The rust is pitted and flaking. On each
door, the rust has eroded through the metal surface creating large gaps and holes in the bottom rails on the doors.
There are four dogs in the affected enclosures. Rust can affect structural strength and prevents the required
cleaning and sanitization of surfaces, which can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. All rusted surfaces that come
into contact with the dogs must be repaired or replaced so they can be properly cleaned and sanitized and to
ensure structural strength.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the outdoor housing enclosures containing fifteen dogs, the food or water receptacles are made of hard plastic.
These receptacles have been chewed and damaged by the dogs and have a buildup of dirt and grime in them. This
buildup of dirt and grime, as well as, damage from chewing does not allow for proper sanitization of the food or
water receptacle. All food or water receptacles that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when
worn or soiled.

3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The shelter in one outdoor enclosure, containing two dogs, does not have a wind and rain break at the entrance.
Shelters without wind and rain breaks do not provide the dogs with protection from the elements. All shelters must
be provided with a wind and rain break at the entrance in order to provide the dogs with protection from the
elements.
