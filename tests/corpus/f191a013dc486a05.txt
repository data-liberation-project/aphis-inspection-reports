3.80(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A two-inch gap between the left front wood pole and the mesh wire of the gibbon enclosure was identified. The gap
is wide enough that the animal was observed to extend its thoracic limb approximately twelve inches outside the
primary enclosure. Primary enclosures for non-human primates must be designed and constructed to be sound and
maintained in good repair. The gap should be repaired as soon as possible to avoid any potential physical contact
between the animal and humans.
