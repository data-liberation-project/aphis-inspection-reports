There was no entry made in the medical records for the procedures performed on a non-human primate that was
sedated and later euthanized on April 7, 2015. According to the clinical veterinarian, the procedure was done
because the veterinarian suspected an abscess around a cranial implant.

care.

procedure. To be corrected from this day forward
