HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The kennel facility consists of one sheltered building. On the western and northern exterior sides of the building
there is standing water. There is evidence on the wash down drainage pipe of a leak and the trim on the lower
western side of the building is green from moisture. Housing facilities must be equipped with disposal facilities and
drainage systems that are constructed and operated so that animal waste and water are rapidly eliminated.
Disposal and drainage systems must minimize vermin and pest infestation, insects, odors, and disease hazards. All
drains must be properly constructed, installed, and maintained. The dealer must take measures to repair or replace
the leak and prevent future leaking and standing water to minimizes disease risks and to protect the health and
welfare of the animals.
