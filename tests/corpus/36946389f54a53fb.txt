SANITATION.
The interior housing area of the singly housed coatimundi is excessively dirty. The resting boards have a black film
on most of their surfaces. Fecal and food waste is caught between a front board and the resting boards. An
accumulation of fur is on a board behind the inside cage. The interior of this enclosure needs to be cleaned more
thoroughly on a routine basis. This was corrected during this inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
