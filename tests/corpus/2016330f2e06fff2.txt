FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is not sufficient shade provided for 4 camels housed together or for 2 additional camels housed in adjacent
enclosures. The facility owner stated they are currently working on the plans to build sheltered areas for these
animals. A shaded/ sheltered space should be provided for the health and comfort of the camels. A system should
be in place to ensure animal enclosures have sufficient shade by natural or artificial means to protect animals when
sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort to them.
