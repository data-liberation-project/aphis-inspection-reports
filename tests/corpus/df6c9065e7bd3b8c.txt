2.40(a)(1) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of the inspection, the licensee did not have a written program of veterinary care documenting the consultant
arrangements with a veterinarian who is willing to serve as the attending veterinarian. The licensee must have an
attending veterinarian who is willing to provide veterinary care to all species maintained at the facility which includes a
written program of care and regularly scheduled visits to the facility.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
**The brown alpaca’s left eye still had thick, white discharge, and was not holding the eye fully open. This is a sign of eye
pain. This animal still has not seen a vet nor was his condition communicated to a veterinarian for further guidance,
diagnosis, and possible treatment.

** The bobcat was limping on his right rear leg, and observed holding it off the ground. This is a sign of pain. The
condition was not noticed until the inspectors pointed it out to a facility representative. The condition of the animal must be
communicated to the veterinarian for guidance.


** A spiny mouse was observed with a 1/2 by 1/3 inch open wound on the right hind leg, and was non weight bearing,
indicating pain, on that limb. The injury on this animal was not observed by the facility despite blood visible on the
aquarium sides and had not been reported to a veterinarian.

** A group housed degu had bleeding bite wounds on it's tail. Blood was visible on the sides of the aquarium. Despite this,
the wounds had not be observed by the facility and no communication to a veterinarian had been done.

The licensee must ensure that the daily observation of all animals, and that a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication is in place so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health is conveyed to the
attending veterinarian.
3.10(a)

Watering
The water bucket for the two wolf dog hybrids was frozen and had not been cleared of ice at the time of the inspection
around 10:45am. Lack of drinkable water adversely affects animal welfare. Potable, unfrozen water must be continuously
available to the dogs for their health and well-being.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There was large accumulation of feces in the wolf dog hybrid enclosure that has not been removed and cleaned. Feces
and food waste must be removed daily to prevent soiling of the animals, contamination of food, and to protect their health
and well-being.

3.31(a)

Sanitation.
An accumulation of feces was present in the guinea pig cages, and the bedding was thoroughly soiled. Fecal material
that builds up in cages results in contamination that can adversely affect animal health and welfare. The facility must
ensure that enlosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta and debris.

3.51(b) Repeat

Facilities, indoor.
There was a strong smell of ammonia throughout the indoor buildings that made the USDA inspectors' eyes water and
nose burn. There was an accumulation of feces in the building as well as large amounts of cobwebs, dust and debris
which can trap and hold ammonia odor. The fan that was running did not effectively minimize the ammonia odor
throughout the building. Ammonia odor indicates that high levels of ammonia in the air, which is detrimental to animal
health. Indoor housing facilities must be adequately ventilated to reduce these odors to maintain the health and comfort
of the animals.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
**The wire gate panel for the bobcat enclosure is still showing areas of rust along the bottom of the door that is now pitted
and flaking. This door needs to be kept in good repair for the containment of the animal.

** There is a section of wire on the back panel of the crested porcupine enclosure that has sharp edges protruding into the
enclosure that could be a potential source of injury, and is a hazard to the animal. This section of wire must be kept in
good repair for the safety of the animal.


** The shelter for the goats and sheep has wood that has been chewed, damaging the structural integrity, and there is an
exposed nail protruding into the shelter that may injure animals rubbing against it. The facility must ensure that the shelter
is structurally sound and will not injure the animals.

**The alpacas and several goats are now in a large, fenced space surrounding empty enclosures at the front of the
property. This area needs to be cleaned of trash and debris that is a hazard to the animals including a broken piece of
plexi-glass the approximate size of a door lying on the ground, a downed chain link gate, a tarp on the ground, and
loosely stacked unsecured fencing next to a shelter. These items can are a potential injury hazard to the animals and
should be removed for their safety and pest control.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
Multiple enclosures including the binturongs, sugar gliders, hedgehogs, pigs, sheep and goats had an accumulation of
feces that is not being cleaned as often as necessary to reduce odors and minimize contamination of the animals. The
sheep and goat shelter area did not have any straw pack for warmth as the animals are eating the straw that is put in, and
the shelter floor is covered in a thick layer of manure. Multiple hedgehogs were in cages with bedding that was soaking
wet and needed to be changed. Enclosures with wet bedding and large amounts of feces present are detrimental to
animal health and welfare. All enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to reduce this accumulation of feces
and for the health and well-being of the animals.

3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.

*A significant amount of clutter was seen in the main building, the second building and around outdoor enclosures. An
empty enclosure between the turkeys and pigs was filled with dirty crates and small animal enclosures, providing hiding
spaces for pests and vermin. Other items, such as toys and boxes, were being stacked on and above occupied
enclosures, and were covered in cobwebs and dust.

** The walkway just outside the bobcat enclosure was a sheet of ice that had bobcat feces, empty plastic bags and other
trash items frozen into the ice. When feces are removed from the enclosure, they must be removed from the areas
adjacent to the animals to minimize odors and prevent spreading of feces around the facility when employees are walking
through the area.

*A considerable amount of spider webs, dust and debris could be seen hanging from the ceiling, covering the top of
enclosures, and covering the skylights. The excessive dust along items hanging from the walls and ceiling attracts and
holds dirt and bedding material and contributes to the odor of ammonia in the room. Unsanitary conditions in the areas
surrounding primary enclosures housing animals can also lead to unpleasant odors, attract pests, and negatively impact
animal welfare. Premises where housing facilities are located must be kept clean and free of clutter to facilitate good
husbandry practices and to protect the animals from disease as well as injury. The facility still needs to develop and follow
a plan to store excess items in another area to be able to facilitate cleaning in the buildings for the health of the animals.
3.131(d) Repeat

Sanitation.
There was still an accumulation of flies throughout the main indoor building area. The flies were around food bowls and
around animals in their enclosures. The facility is not using sufficient measures to mitigate flies inside the buildings. Flies

are known to be carriers of disease and can both cause and spread illness between animals and species. A safe and
effective program for controlling pests must be implemented and maintained
3.132

Employees.
At the time of the inspection, three representatives were at a local exhibit for multiple days leaving two part time
individuals to water, feed and clean all the animals at the main facility. As evidenced by the non-compliant items listed in
this report, the facility does not have enough employees to maintain an acceptable level of husbandry and care for the
animals at the facility. Cleaning, feeding and watering for the 200 plus regulated animals at the facility in addition to
performing daily observations for health concerns is not being done adequately to ensure animal health and welfare. Lack
of employees is leading to adverse welfare impacts for these animals. The facility must ensure that staffing is adequate to
provide care for the animals.
