SANITATION.
In all three vole rooms, there was an accumulation of dirt/dust/debris on large centrally located ceiling ducts. Since
the voles are housed with wire mesh top cages, they are potentially exposed to contamination from the
dirt/dust/debris on the ceiling or in the air. Facility needs to clean and maintain the ceiling vents as needed to
prevent dirt/dust/debris accumulation.
