ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
On August 12, 2015 at 12:30 PM, the licensee did not have a responsible person at the facility to conduct an animal
welfare inspection. The property appeared vacant.
A telephone call was made to the licensee who indicated that he has not acquired any animals, nor has he
conducted any regulated activity, since becoming licensed. The licensee also indicated that he is contemplating
moving to another location, and does not anticipate conducting any regulated activity at this location in the future.
Please inform the Raleigh Regional Office if you relocate to another address within 10 days of the change. Your
USDA licensee is only valid at this site, and another inspection will be required at any new location before you can
conduct any regulated activity.
Exit interview conducted by telephone with facility representative.
