ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three dogs had excessive matting of the hair. An adult female Schnauzer named "Darla" had matted hair on her
feet, legs, and abdomen. An adult female Maltese (m/c# TR94170303) had matted hair on her legs and abdomen.
An adult female Poodle (m/c# 18FC47-03) had matted hair with fecal matter on her hind legs and beneath her tail.
Matted hair can result in skin problems, can be painful, and can compromise the hairCBEs ability to provide
protection from the heat or cold. The licensee must remove the matted hair from these animals and must establish
an effective program of haircoat maintenance.
