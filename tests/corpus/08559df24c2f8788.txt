3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces-- (3) Cleaning.
*** Inside the whelping building, most of the enclosures had a build-up of hair, feces and grime hanging from the
floors underneath the enclosures. Also, there was a build-up of hair, dirt and grime along the sides of the
enclosures. The accumulation of the dirt and grime can cause diseases and attract pests. The licensee must ensure
that primary enclosures are properly sanitized at least once every two weeks, or more often if necessary. The
licensee must ensure animal enclosures, areas inside of housing facility and adjacent areas must be kept clean to
ensure the health and well-being of the animals. The licensee must spot clean daily as required.
3.4(b)(3) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements.
*** There were 5 enclosures housing at least 9 dogs which had shelters with inadequate wind/rain breaks at the
entrance. The entrances to these igloo type shelters were not off set and were approximately only 10-11 inches long
midway up the entrance. These enclosures only had one shelter each, most enclosures housed Golden Retrievers
and one housed 4 Japanese Chins and a Chihuahua. Standing in front of the enclosure the entire flooring surface of
the shelter could easily be visualized. During the inspection most of the dogs were observed laying in a normal
comfortable position, which put them at the shelter entrance. Since the entrance is short, open, and straight into the
shelters, with no flaps or doors, the dogs are not adequately protected from the elements. The dogs need effective
wind and rain breaks on their outdoor shelter units to protect them from the elements and help keep them dry. The
licensee must provide adequate wind and rain breaks at the entrances of all the outdoor shelter units.
3.6(a)(2)(10) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements.(2) Primary enclosures.***Three enclosures in the whelping building housing at least 10 puppies total, had a floor with openings big
enough that the puppies feet and legs were observed passing through the flooring during the inspection. The
flooring, housing these small breed puppies, is a 1"x1" coated wire. These openings could allow for the puppies to
get stuck or easily injured. The licensee must ensure, at all times, that all puppies are housed so their feet and legs
cannot pass through the flooring.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
(b) Food receptacles.
***Within the whelping building, a mold-like substance and contaminated food were observed along the metal ledge
in the self feeder which was located inside an enclosure housing a puppy. The entire metal ledge inside the feeder
was covered in a grayish-white, mold-like material and included some kibbles of dry food. There were also cobwebs
formed inside the feeder. Contaminated food can decrease the dog's acceptance of the food and can increase the
risk of disease and health hazards. The licensee needs to remove the current, caked and moldy feed to protect the
health and well-being of the puppy. The licensee needs to establish and maintain a program to ensure that feeders
are cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks and that measures are taken to ensure that there is no
molding, deterioration and caking of feed at all times.
To be corrected by: Corrected during inspection.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted on 8/14/2014 with MDA and licensee.
