FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a)
***** At time of inspection the metal posts and frames of many of the enclosures has rusted to the point that if not
protected with a rust inhibitor or paint that will protect the metal from continuing to rust these surfaces will not
remain structurally sound. These surfaces must be maintained in good repair so that they continue to provide the
support to the enclosure as intended.
