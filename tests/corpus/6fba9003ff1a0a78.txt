include the species being utilized or sold in regulated activities, preventative care, common health problems that
they may have and how these will be addressed by the licensee and the Attending Veterinarian.

Veterinary Care and is made available for review during the inspection process.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several hoofstock animals are heavily matted and need to be sheared. Five llamas, four sheep and one Angora
goat have an excessively matted coat. The hair coats are heavily twisted with large mats that cover most of the
animals. A sheep that is severely matted is scratching against the fencing and also using its hoof to scratch matted
areas on its body. The mats on this sheep are nearly long enough to touch the ground when the animal is in a
normal standing position.
Excessively matted hair coats can cause discomfort for the animals and lead to health problems. The licensee must
remove the mats and develop a hair coat maintenance plan with the attending veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee could not locate all of the required records at the time of inspection. A current and accurate inventory
list for the animals that are located on and off the property was not provided.
Records which fully and correctly disclose the required information regarding the acquisition and disposition of
animals other than dogs and cats is required to ensure that the transactions are done legally, so that animals may
be properly tracked through during the inspection process, and to ensure the humane care and use of animals
during transport, housing, and exhibition.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There's a wire hog panel in the reindeer barn that has at least four sharp wire points. The sharp wire points are
approximately 6 inches long and located on the end of the panel. Nine reindeer can come in contact with these
points. The sharp wire points create a hazard that could potentially injure the reindeer.
The licensee must ensure that all outdoor housing facilities are maintained and free of sharp points that could injure
the animals.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are three goats and three llamas that do not have access to adequate shelter that would provide protection
against inclement weather. The three llamas are being housed in an enclosure on the east side of the property. The
llamas have access to shade but not shelter from inclement weather. The goats that are housed in a pen on the
north side do not have access to natural or artificial shelter that would protect them from inclement weather or direct
sunlight.
Not having access to shelter during inclement weather does not ensure the animals can remain clean and dry. Lack
of shelter during inclement weather can also cause discomfort for the animals. The licensee must provide all
animals with shelter that protects them from inclement weather.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The enclosure on the north side of the property that contains three goats is surrounded by junk, clutter and
discarded materials. A wooden pallet and other wooden materials are piled up against the fencing. This can harbor
and provide breeding areas for rodents and other pests.
Premises must be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate proper
husbandry practices. Accumulations of discarded materials and other materials not needed for animal husbandry
shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
