2.40(b)(3) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Four puppies id # 3814, 3914, 4014, 4114 are separated from their mother due to small sores and scabbing on
their bellies. The license's thought the sores came from bacteria in the mother's mouth as she carried them around,
but even separated the puppies still developed them. The licensee's have spoken to other breeders and are
attempting to treat the sores, but have not spoken to the vet about the situation. Daily observation of the animals
includes communication with the attending veterinarian on problems of animal health in a timely manner so that
these items can be treated accordingly. This needs to be addressed and these puppies seen by the vet for their
health.

*** Several of the feeders have a layer of grime along the sides and need to be cleaned. Feeders need to be
sanitized on a routine basis to keep this grime from accumulating and for the health of the dogs.
*** There is a layer of dust throughout the kennel that needs to be cleaned more frequently. Per this regulation,
used primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an
accumulation of dirt and debris.
