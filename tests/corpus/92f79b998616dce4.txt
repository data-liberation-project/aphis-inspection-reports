HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Within the Discovery Center there is an enclosure containing two tamarins. The enclosure is made out of wire mesh
and is immediately adjacent to a public walkway. There is a barrier along the public walkway, but it will not stop the
public from sticking their fingers through the wire mesh and having direct contact with the animals in the enclosure.
There is no attendant present in this portion of the facility to monitor this enclosure. This poses a hazard to both the
public and the animals within the exhibit.
During public exhibition, there must be sufficient distance and/or effective barriers between the animals and the
general viewing public so as to ensure the safety of the animals and the public. The licensee must ensure that the
public cannot place their fingers inside the tamarin enclosure or come into direct contact with these animals in order
to ensure their safety and well-being.

A large open enclosure is located in front of the wallaby barn and there is a walking path for the public that runs
through this enclosure and numerous adults and children were present in the wallaby enclosure at the time of the
inspection. At least ten wallabies are housed in this enclosure and a few of the animals were observed hopping
freely across the walking path and near the people.
At the time of the inspection, there are no employees present within the wallaby enclosure to supervise the potential
public contact with the animals and there are also no public barriers to keep the wallabies and people away from
each other. Unsupervised contact between people and wallabies could result in a dangerous situation.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
The facility must either establish acceptable barriers to keep the free-ranging wallabies at a sufficient distance from
the public or a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at alltimes during periods of public contact. The facility must ensure that all required measures are taken to eliminate any
potentially dangerous situations between the animals and the public.
To be corrected by: The facility representative stated that from this day forward an employee shall always be
present within the wallaby enclosure when this exhibit is open to the public.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor enclosure containing three giraffe and four sand gazelle contains numerous large trees that have wire
mesh wrapped around them to protect them from the animals. Sections of the mesh have become detached and
are hanging off of at least one tree and one of the pieces of mesh has many sharp points along it's edge. Contact
with the loose sections of wire mesh could cause the animals to become entangled or injured.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved.
Indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury. The licensee must alter the loose wire mesh in a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the
animals. All facilities housing animals must be maintained in good repair at all times.
