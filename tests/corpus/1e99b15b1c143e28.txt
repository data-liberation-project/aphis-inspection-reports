Facilities, general.
An open bag of pelleted feed was observed to be sitting in the bin with other intact bags of pelleted feed for the guinea
pigs. This bin is left uncovered and the open bag of feed, still about halfway full of pellets, was only closed by twisting the
open top of the bag.

Additionally, there are several bags of carrots stored on the ground, including an open bag of carrots in which the carrots
have spilled out onto the ground. These carrots are used to supplement the diet of the guinea pigs.

Feed needs to be stored in a manner that protects it from spoilage and deterioration and food supplies not in their original
intact containers must be stored in a container with a tightly fitting lid or cover. Additionally, refrigeration must be supplied
for perishable food items, such as carrots. Failure to do so can lead to deterioration and/or contamination of feed, which
can lead to an increase in disease or illness in the guinea pigs.

Correct by storing open bags of feed in a container with a tightly fitted lid or cover and by storing carrots in a manner that
prevents spoilage and contamination. Correct by February 3, 2021.


3.29(d)

Feeding.
Feeders in multiple guinea pig enclosures have pelleted feed that has deteriorated to the extent where it is mostly powder
with few intact pellets remaining in the bottom half of the feeder.

Measures must be taken when using self-feeders to prevent the deterioration or caking of pelleted feed. Failure to do so
can lead to weight loss, illness, and dental issues if the animals attempt to ingest the feed in it's powder form.

Correct by replacing deteriorated feed with intact pelleted feed. Correct by January 28, 2021.
3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
Two of the guinea pig enclosures had an accumulation of wet bedding and fecal material on the wire mesh directly under
the water spigots. The bedding surrounding the water spigots were also wet.

Primary enclosures must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of feces or debris, including wet bedding.
Failure to do so can lead to illness if the guinea pigs avoid the water or have to stand in wet bedding bedding in order to
drink.

Correct by cleaning the areas under the water spigots and removing wet bedding as often as necessary. Correct by
January 28, 2021.
3.31(b)

Sanitation.


There is an accumulation of dusty spiderwebs directly above two of the open-topped guinea pig enclosures.

Premises need to be kept clean to protect the animals from injury. Accumulations of dusty spiderwebs can impact
ventilation as well as cause contamination of feed and water sources.

Correct by keeping the premises clean and free from spiderweb accumulations. Correct by February 3, 2021.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
While reviewing records, it was observed that the facility does not have a current count of animals on hand nor are animal
births being recorded.

Animal dealers must make, keep, and maintain records which include animals owned as well as any offspring born while
in his/her possession. Failure to do so can make it difficult to identify trends in animal losses.

Correct by maintaining records that include number of animals on hand and animal births. Correct by January 28, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
