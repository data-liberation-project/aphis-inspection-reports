FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A new goat enclosure for 9 goats with a goat ramp has just been completed. The goat ramp appears over 12 feet
high at the top platform with the two lower platforms over 6 feet high. The ramp is narrow and the platform size is
such that if more than one goat is on it at a time jostling can lead to loss of footing and potential slipping potentially
leading to injury. No sides or railings are currently in place. The outdoor facilities including the goat ramp shall be
structurally sound to protect the animals from injury. Correct by Nov. 30, 2014.
