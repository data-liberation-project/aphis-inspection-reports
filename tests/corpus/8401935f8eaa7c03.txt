The Facility's program for humane care and use of animals has not been reviewed by the IACUC on a six month
interval. A program review was conducted in April 2013 and then not again until April 2014. A program review
conducted at least once every six months ensures aspects for optimal animal welfare are reviewed, discussed, and
implemented. If a program review is not conducted, animal welfare may decline. The IACUC must review, at least
once every six months, the facility's program for humane care and use of animals.
