ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One grey and white female Akita with USDA Tag #19 was found to have wounds that were approximately 1.5 cm
long on of the tips of both ears, the wound on the left ear had bleeding with flies in the wound, the right ear was
crusted with dried blood. Both tips felt thickened and the dog pulled away when a close up examination was
attempted. One black and white female husky with USDA Tag # 39 had a 1 cm wound on the back of her left ear.
The wound was covered in dried blood and the area appeared thickened. The licensee had already conducted his
daily observations for the day and was not currently treating either dog for the condition.
Untreated wounds can be a source of pain and discomfort for the dogs and a treatable condition left untreated can
become infected and cause a serious health issue. The licensee must use appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

The licensee has an appointment with his AV for 7/10/2019.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outdoor enclosure holding one grey and white female Akita with USDA Tag # 19 was found to have a large
amount of excreta built up on the floor of the pen. A large amount of excreta can increase disease hazards, pest
activity and prevalence of odors. Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures daily to prevent soiling of the
dogs in the enclosure.
