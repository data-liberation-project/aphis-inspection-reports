FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength.
Several weeks ago a male black bear was able to scale the side wall at the front of the enclosure and escape the
exhibit. He was quickly sedated and safely returned to the off exhibit area of the enclosure. The wall of this exhibit
has since been repaired to prevent further escape. All enclosures must be maintained in good repair to contain the
animals.
