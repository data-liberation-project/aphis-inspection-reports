3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are excessive mouse droppings with in the whelping room and food storage area. In the food storage area
mouse droppings were evident on the window sills, running boards, around and on the pallet with the closed bags of
dog food and on the disinfectant sprayer used for cleaning. Small amounts were seen in other areas of the food
storage room including around the stored bedding. In the whelping room, feces were present in the trough next to
the enclosure containing 1 adult/7 puppies and on the floor surrounding the food and bedding containers. Licensee
states that no current pest control plan is in place except for a cat that has access to the room. Pest fecal material
can lead to health hazards for the dogs. An effective program for the control of mammals that are pests, must be
established and maintained to reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
The licensee must develop a plan for control of rodents in order to promote the health and well being of the animals.
