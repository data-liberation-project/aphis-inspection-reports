ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:22 on
23-APR-19.
Upon arrival at the facility, I knocked on the door two times and rang the doorbell. When there was no answer, I
called the primary phone number for Ms. Wieczorek and left a message. After waiting for over 30 minutes, I left the
facility.
