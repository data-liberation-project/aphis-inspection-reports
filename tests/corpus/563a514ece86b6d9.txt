Facilities, general.
During this inspection it was noted that the enclosure that housed 2 goats, 2 pigs, 3 sheep was in need of repair. The
enclosure is constructed of hog panel fencing and a small wire mesh attached to these panels. However, the small wire
mesh has begun to detach from the panels and is bowing upwards along the bottom edge. There is also a section, in the
upper right corner, where the welds have broken and there are large gaps in the panels. To ensure that the animals are
securely contained and unwanted animals can not enter this fencing will need to be addressed.
