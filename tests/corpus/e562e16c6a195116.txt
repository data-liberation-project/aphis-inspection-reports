3.80(a)(2)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
An extension cord with multiple items plugged into it was hanging on the outside of the primary enclosure for
“Bubba” the marmoset. These cords were all within reach from the inside of the enclosure. A live electric power cord
could cause injury to the marmoset if it is chewed on. All power cords must be installed in a manner that protects
the animal from coming into direct contact with the cords. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained
so that they protect the nonhuman primate from injury.
