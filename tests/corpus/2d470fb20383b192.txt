2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
2.40 (b) (2) Multiple bottles of expired medications were found to be intermingled in the current supplies being
utilized by the facility in a cabinet inside the veterinary clinic. All the medication and vaccines being stored in the
refrigerators inside the commissary and gift shop have expired (i.e. Twin Pen, expired: 08/08, Clavamox, expired:
12/12). .Use of expired or improperly labeled medications or medical supplies is not considered appropriate to
prevent, control, or treat illnesses or injuries. Expired medications can experience spoilage or have reduced
efficacy. This could lead to prolonged illness or suffering for the animals needing the medication.

Ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired and labeled properly in accordance with standard
veterinary practices.
