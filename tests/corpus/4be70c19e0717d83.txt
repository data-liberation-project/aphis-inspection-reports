2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult buff guinea pig in enclosure # 62 was observed during inspection to have a left head tilt.

An adult tri-colored (white, tan, and grey) guinea pig in enclosure # 63 was observed during inspection to have a left head
tilt.

An adult white & tan guinea pig in enclosure # 63 was observed during inspection to have a right head tilt.

These three guinea pigs appeared to be eating and drinking normally. The licensee stated that he had not observed the
head tilt condition in three guinea pig and had not contacted his attending veterinarian for instructions for caring for these
animals. The written program of veterinary care on file does not address head tilts or inner ear infections in guinea pigs.

Failure to conduct adequate daily observations with direct communication with the attending veterinarian can result in
delay of care provided to animals and prolong animal health problems. All animals must be observed daily to assess their
health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed.


The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian about the three adult guinea pigs with head tilts and provide
appropriate treatment for these animals as recommended by the veterinarian. Correct by July 14, 2021.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 557 guinea pigs were counted during this
inspection. There were no inventory records indicating the number of adults, weanlings, or newborns present since
January 2021. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the caviary by identifying
changes in numbers and keeping track of animals born. The facility must keep and maintain records containing
information which fully and correctly discloses the number of animals held, owned, acquired, and disposed of including
births. Remain uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
