INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC committee must complete a semiannual inspection of the facilities and report the findings to the
Institutional Official. The reports shall be signed by a majority of the IACUC members and minority views must be
included. Three facility inspections have been completed by the IACUC over the last 18 months. However, each
form was only signed by a single member, and there is nothing in the meeting minutes to specify which members
actually conducted the inspections. The IACUC may use a subcommittee composed of at least 2 members to
conduct the facility inspection, but any member that wants to participate must be included. On the most recent
report, a deficiency was noted on the walk through. However, there was no indication of severity, nor was there
anything to indicate if or how the deficiency was corrected. Any facility deficiencies must be designated as either
significant or minor, and there must be a reasonable, specific plan for correction, including a schedule with dates.

To be corrected from this time forward.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
- The IACUC did not conduct appropriate reviews of the animal activities for protocols 99-02 and 99-06 to ensure
that the investigators are following the approved protocols. The animal use activity involved dogs for these
protocols.
- Protocol 99-02 stated in the _"Protocol 99-02 Surgeries" section Laboratory Exercise Identification_ states "After a
maximum of two hours of inhalant anesthesia, the isofluorane will be discontinued and the animal will be allowed to
wake up." There is indication in the animal health records that some animals were under anesthesia for periods
longer than two hours as approved in the protocol. For example, the following animals surgery and anesthesia logs
were reviewed. These logs indicate that the dog identified as Louise ( 2 year old American Staffordshire terrier
cross) identification numbers 13-075 and A021675 was induced on 11-6-2013 at 1:10 pm and endotracheal tube
removed at 4:07pm. Louise(cid:25)s length of procedure according to the surgery log book was 2 hours and 21 minutes.
Her length of time under was 2 hours and 57 minutes. Dog identified as Ladybird identification numbers 13-040 and
A138678 was induced on 4-17-2013 at 1:14 pm and endotracheal tube removed at 4:40 pm. Ladybird's length of
procedure according to the surgery log book was 2 hours and 22 minutes. Dog identified as Norman animal controlidentification numbers 13-042 and A005258 was induced on 4-24-2013 at 1:13 pm and endotracheal tube removed
at 4:21 pm. 13-042's length of procedure according to the surgery log book was 2 hours and 30 minutes.
- The IACUC approved animal use activity (protocol 99-06 appendix F) involving dogs did not list the medication
Hydroxymorphone as an approved drug in the "Appendix F drugs to be used" section of the protocol. According to
surgical records Hydroxymorphone was administered during induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia logs and medical
records indicate that the dog identified as Louise ( 2 year old American Staffordshire terrier cross) identification
numbers 13-075 and A021675 received 0.85 mg of hydroxymorphone IM as part of the preanesthetic. Anesthesia
logs and medical logs indicate that the dog identified as Fresca ( 2 year old American Staffordshire terrier cross )
identification number C13-002759 received 0.90 mg of hydroxymorphone IM as part of the preanesthetic. Proposals
to conduct activities using animals shall include a complete description of the procedures so that theIACUC can
determine whether to approve the proposed procedures.
To be corrected from this time forward.
2.35(d)(5)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
All existing protocols were approved at the Winter 2012 IACUC meeting. There is no indication of an annual review
of these protocols in 2013. Personnel changes that have occurred since the original approval are not reflected in
the protocols. All protocols must be reviewed no less than annually and updated or amended as necessary.
To be corrected from this time forward.
Inspection conducted with RVT and exit interview conducted with facility representative.
