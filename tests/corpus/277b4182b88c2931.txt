3.136(b)
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
On February 25, 2016 United Airlines accepted for transportation four young sugar gliders housed in four individual
primary enclosures. The four enclosures had tape applied to the exterior that sealed all ventilation openings on the
enclosures. Removal of the externally applied tape on one enclosure revealed the openings had also been sealed
with a layer of tape applied to the inside of the enclosure.
Carriers and intermediate handlers must only accept for transportation any live animal in a primary enclosure which
conforms to the requirements of 3.137: when there are ventilation openings located on all four walls of the primary
enclosure the ventilation openings on each wall shall be at least 8 percent of the total surface area of each wall.
By sealing the openings on all four sides of the enclosures the animals were essentially provided with no openings
for ventilation. Insufficient ventilation during transportation will compromise animal well being by restricting oxygen
and could result in death of the animal. Animals must not be accepted for transportation when housed in primary
enclosures that do not meet requirements for adequate ventilation under the Animal Welfare Act.
