ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The approved method of euthanasia is carbon dioxide. No pressure regulator or flow meter are present at the tank
Sudden exposure to high carbon dioxide concentrations is very distressful to the animals. AVMA guidelines for
carbon dioxide euthanasia require the use of a regulator and a flow meter to ensure humane euthanasia. The
attending veterinarian must be consulted concerning the proper addition of a regulator and flow meter to the
equipment used to deliver carbon dioxide euthanasia.
