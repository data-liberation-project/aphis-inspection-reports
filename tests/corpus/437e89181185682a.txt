FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At the time of inspection, part of the lattice fence that served as the first public barrier for the facility'(cid:25)s lion enclosure
was in disrepair. The fencing was missing in areas and in need of repair or replacement. Broken fencing can cause
a potential risk to the public and the animal being contained. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities must be
structurally sound and be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and also contain the animals.
