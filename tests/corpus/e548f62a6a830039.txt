ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female white standard poodle named Pippie (ID # OAO2380148) was observed shaking her head several
times. Upon examination, her left ear had a lot of hair growing out of the ear canal. This hair was clumped and
matted with a copious amount of a thick, oily, brownish-black material. The skin around the affected area was
slightly reddened. There was no noticeable odor detected.
Ear problems can be extremely painful and/or itchy, can cause other health issues and affect the well-being of the
animal.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment, and provide the
inspector the documentation of this visit upon request. The licensee must ensure all animals are given proper
veterinary care at all times.
