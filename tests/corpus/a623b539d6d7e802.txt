2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*In late September 2016, a chinchilla became injured due to an employee not following proper procedures. During
routine husbandry cage cleaning the chinchilla escaped from the cage. The animal was capured and placed in a
transport cage and transported to the Attending veterinarian for treatment. The employee did not follow proper
husbandry protocols and ensure the safety of the enclosed animals. Since the incident, the facility has retrained the
employees.
The handling of this animal was not conducted in a manner that prevented trauma, behavioral stress, and physical
harm. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not
cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Corrected prior to the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
