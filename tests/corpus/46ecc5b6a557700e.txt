HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During this inspection it was noted that a variety of the barrier fences were in need of attention. The Tamarin that is
singly housed in the farm animal barn has access to an enclosure that is along the outside wall of the barn.
Although the enclosure is ~5(cid:25) off of the ground there are some areas with a large enough mesh that may allow the
public to have direct access to this primate. There is one wooden support post, in the front of the leopards holding
area, that has begun to loosen up. This now allows for the fence to move back and forth. There is also a wooden
support post in front of the bobcat enclosure that has also loosened up. Again the barrier is able to move back and
forth. To ensure that the public does not have direct access to these animals these barriers will need to be
addressed.
