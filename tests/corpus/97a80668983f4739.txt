2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
On September 20, 2022, a USDA Veterinary Medical Officer (VMO) conducted an unannounced search inspection,
accompanied by SC Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Horry County Police Department personnel. Upon
arrival, the facility owner spoke with the USDA VMO, providing a tour of the facility, describing the use of the animals on
hand. While none of the animals on site are being exhibited, the owner stated they traded one Fennec Fox to another
facility out-of-state last month, in exchange for one kangaroo. This exchange served as compensation for their
agreement. In addition, the owner intends to explore exhibition and brokering of their exotic animals in the future.

The inspector discussed parameters for licensing with the owner in full, explaining a USDA license is required to conduct
regulated activity. Any person operating or intending to operate as a dealer, exhibitor, or operator of an auction sale,
except persons who are exempted from the licensing requirements under section 2.1 (a)(3), must have a valid license.

NO regulated activities may be conducted until a USDA license is obtained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
