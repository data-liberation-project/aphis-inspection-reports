2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility had recently acquired two pigs, however the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) document had not been
updated to include this species. The Attending Veterinarian had provided adequate veterinary care to the animals
since they had arrived at the facility. The written PVC needs to be revised to include the pigs.
