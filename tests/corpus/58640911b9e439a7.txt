Facilities, general.
* An estimated 100 foot section of enclosure fencing was observed leaning at a 45 to 60 degree angle. The fencing was
leaning in the direction away from the camels. The fencing does allow the camels to stick there heads over the top of the
fencing and then they are able to lean against and on the fencing. Two camels are in contact with the affected fencing
which is located in outdoor housing. In addition, protruding wire panel ends were observed protruding inwards towards
the camels. The ability to contain the camels securely is greatly affected and could lead to potential injury, if the
enclosure fencing is not kept in good repair. In addition protruding panels ends could also cause potential injury if the
camels run into the protruding ends. The licensee must ensure all outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound
and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by 2/14/22.

This inspection and exit interview done on 1/31/22 were conducted with the facility representative.
