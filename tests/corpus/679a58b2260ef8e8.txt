2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Appropriate authority.
The licensee acknowledged using CO2 to euthanize animals. This method is not listed and approved by the
attending veterinarian on the written Program of Veterinary Care plan. Since there is no written documentation
regarding this method, it can not be determined whether the attending veterinarian has knowledge of the licensee
using this method of euthanasia. This does not ensure that the attending veterinarian has been given appropriate
authority for the provisions of adequate veterinary care including euthanasia. This may lead to failure to deliver
adequate veterinary care to the animals or cause pain, distress or negative effects to the animal during euthanasia.
The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian regarding euthanasia methods to ensure they are
appropriate and that the attending veterinarian has been given appropriate authority and oversight over the care of
the animals. Euthanasia methods must be included in writing as part of the written Program of Veterinary Care and
approved by the attending veterinarian. Correct by April 12, 2016.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adequate veterinary care.
The male African Soft-furred Rat must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian. There are several small raised
lumps throughout the length of its tail, a scabby sore below the left eye and the left eye was unable to open due to
another growth near the eye. This health issue has not been addressed and the animal has not been seen by a
veterinarian. Lack of veterinary care could lead to a worsened health condition and discomfort to the animal. The
licensee must have this animal evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and recommended treatment.
Documentation must be maintained regarding this veterinary evaluation and kept by the licensee for review by
APHIS officials on subsequent inspections. Correct by April 5, 2016.

housing hamsters must have a minimum interior height of at least 6 inches. Lack of interior height could affect the
comfort of the animals and limit or prevent vertical postural adjustments of the animal. Provide hamsters with a
minimum of 6 inches of interior height. Correct by April 12, 2016.
