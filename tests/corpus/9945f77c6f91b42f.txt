2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is not currently maintaining any records of animals on hand (adult or juvenile). Complete and accurate records
are necessary to facilitate tracking of the animals and compliance with other aspects of the AWA. Every dealer shall
make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning
animals, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her
control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.

3.129(b)

Feeding.
The Licensee is not currently cleaning and sanitizing feeders often enough to ensure they are being maintained rust free.
The feed receptacles are currently only being cleaned and/or sanitized when new animals are introduced into an
enclosure. Over 30% of the enclosures have a moderate to excessive amount of rust on the self-feeders where food is
dispensed. In addition, at least 25% of the rusted feeders have sharp or jagged edges as a result of the excessive rust.
Rust is not able to be properly cleaned and sanitized and the jagged edges can cause injury to the animals while
attempting to feed. The licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are kept clean and sanitary at all times to minimize

disease hazards and protect the animals from injury. Rusty feeders that cannot be properly cleaned or have sharp or
edges to promote the health of the animals must be repaired, resurfaced or replaced.

3.131(c)

Sanitation.
Overall cleaning of the building is not currently facilitating the prescribed husbandry practices. There is a thick buildup of
dust, hair and debris on the top of and surrounding at least 50% of all used and unused enclosures. In addition over 40%
of the enclosures that are not currently being used have not been cleaned. There is deteriorating food in some unused
enclosures and a layer of hair and/or dust buildup in over 40% of unused enclosures. Failure to maintain acceptable
cleaning can contribute to disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that all premises (buildings and grounds) shall be
kept clean in order to protect the animals from disease hazards and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set
forth in this subpart.
