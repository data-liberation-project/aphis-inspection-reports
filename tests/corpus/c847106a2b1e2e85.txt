2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
-Two, stacked rows of 15inch tall plastic, pet carriers with cats inside were placed on top of a 43inch mobile
transport container. These carriers were not affixed together or secured to the transport container. The top row of
pet carriers was measured to be approximately 73inches off the floor. Cats kept in stacked carriers at substantial
heights in an unsecure, unstable manner may potentially result in trauma or physical harm to them if the carriers
were to fall or unintentionally be knocked over.
-There were two goats kept in one transport container (23in. height X 21in. width X 28in. length) for approximately
10-15 minutes prior to transporting them to a travel trailer. The goats are kept from jumping out of this container
and are restricted in movement by a chain which is connected from the inside of the container to the goat(cid:25)'s neck
collar. Goats kept or handled in such a manner may experience stress or unnecessary discomfort by not having the
ability to turn about freely or make normal postural adjustments.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Correct for all future inspections.
