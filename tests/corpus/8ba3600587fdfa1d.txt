2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A male adult Maltese (microchip # 102 794 846) had wet fur and staining of the fur around its mouth. Close
inspection of the dog's mouth revealed that there was a thick brownish colored material on the surface of the teeth
encasing several cheek and canine teeth causing it to be difficult to visualize the normal shape of the teeth. Dental
problems can make it difficult for an animal to eat normally, can be painful or can lead to other systemic health
problems.
***A female adult Shih Tzu (microchip # 096 362 521) had long fur around its eyes making it difficult for the
inspectors to visualize the eyes. Close evaluation of the dog showed that the left eye was covered by matted fur.
After the fur was pushed aside, it could be seen that the eye was dry and had crusty discharge. Irritated eyes can
be painful and lead to additional eye issues.
There is no written documentation to demonstrate that these dogs have received care regarding these health
concerns. Additionally, the facility's Program of Veterinary Care does not have a plan in place to address these
health issues; therefore, an evaluation is needed by the attending veterinarian to provide adequate veterinary care
to these dogs.

The licensee failed to identify these issues and therefore, timely veterinary care was not provided. Develop and
maintain a method of daily observation so that health problems are identified in a timely manner and animals are
provided adequate veterinary care. Correct by January 28, 2015.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
