2.32(a)
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
During a conversation with investigator staff member at the time of the inspection, the APHIS inspector and the
Attending Veterinarian (AV) discovered that: (1) the staff member did not recognize that the AV needed to be
contacted when complications were noted during a terminal surgical procedure performed the preceding week; and
(2) the staff member intended to use an instrument during a surgical procedure scheduled for later that same day
that was inappropriate for use in the guinea pigs under study. It was also later determined that the investigator staff
member had no prior experience working with this species of animal.
Per this Section of the Regulations, it shall be the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all personnel
involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified and appropriately trained to perform their duties.
The AV immediately acted to address this situation by reinforcing with the staff member the need to contact him/her
regarding animal issues, being present during the surgical procedure scheduled for later that day, and providing the
laboratory with an instrument appropriate for the species of animal.
Although the AV took immediate actions in this particular situation, the research facility needs to ensure that
investigator staff have appropriate training and qualifications to perform procedures on the species of animals under
study.
