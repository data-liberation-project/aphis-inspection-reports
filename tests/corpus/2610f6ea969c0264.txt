ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three skin lesions on a male lion had not been noticed by the caretaker. Two approximately one inch long reddened
scratches were observed near the base of the tail, one on each side of the tail. The third lesion, located on the left
hock, was approximately 1.5 inches long and one inch wide. The hair was missing over all three lesions and the
skin was abraded and open over the tail and hock lesions on the left side of the body. Flies were seen settling on
the left tail lesion.
Daily observation of all animals to assess their well-being as well as direct and frequent communication with the
attending veterinarian regarding health issues are necessary to ensure that the animals at the facility receive timely
and adequate veterinary care. Documentation of health problems, communications with the attending veterinarian,
and treatment of those problems are necessary to ensure that the facility is providing appropriate monitoring and
treatment of sick and injured animals. A system should be in place to ensure that the facility keeps appropriate daily
observations of animal health problems and treatments.
Correct from this time forward.

FEEDING.
There was no feeding plan for exotic small cats available for review.
Failure to provide an appropriate diet can lead to serious medical problems for the animals. The exhibitor must
ensure that diets have sufficient nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The diet should be preparedwith consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. The exhibitor should develop
appropriate diet plans for the exotic cats on site.
