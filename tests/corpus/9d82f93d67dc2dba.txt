Several pieces of ceiling insulation are separating from the underside of the metal roof above the stalls of three
giraffe housed in one building. In the adjacent hoof stock building, several pieces of ceiling insulation are
separating from the underside of the metal roof above the stalls of six zebra, two kudu, and six gazelle. Insulation
material which has separated from the ceiling may fall into an animal enclosure and could potentially be ingested by
the animals housed in these two buildings. The ceiling insulation must be properly secured or replaced to prevent it
from falling into an animal enclosure and to avoid accidental ingestion. To be corrected by: January 30, 2015.
