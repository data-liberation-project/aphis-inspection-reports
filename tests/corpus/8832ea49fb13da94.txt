SANITATION.
The guinea pig enclosure had several gnats/fruit flies around it. The gnats/fruit flies were concentrated within the
enclosure and on the enclosure wire. A single sticky fly trap was hanging from the ceiling in the room, however; the
trap was ineffective because it was full of flies. Flies can carry and spread disease.
Implement and maintain provisions to effectively control the gnat and fruit fly population.
