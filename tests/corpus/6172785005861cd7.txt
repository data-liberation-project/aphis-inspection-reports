INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Several areas along the walls of the main building as well as the ceiling are composed of exposed wood and other
materials not impervious to moisture. These areas are able to absorb moisture and create a potential to harbor
pathogens. The floors, walls, ceilings and other areas in contact with the animals must be impervious to moisture.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The floors, walls and doors on the outside portion of the primary enclosures were moderately worn. The primary
enclosures in this area are constructed of primarily of coated wire. The wire coating has been worn or chewed off
over portions of the floors, walls and doors. In the majority of these areas the exposed wire is rusted. These areas
of the kennel are no longer in good repair. The areas where the coating is damaged provide crevices that organic
material can become entrapped preventing adequate cleaning and sanitization. Additionally, the rust which has
formed over the exposed wires also prevents them from being readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by repairing or
replacing these damaged areas. All surfaces in contact with the dogs must be readily cleaned and sanitized in
accordance with Sec. 3.11 (b) of this subpart, or be replaceable when worn or soiled.
