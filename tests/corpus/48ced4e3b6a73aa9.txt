2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee had a program of veterinary care that was accurate to the activities at the facility, however the
attending veterinarian listed on the provided program of veterinary care has since retired. The licensee states they
do not have an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements.
Lack of an attending veterinarian does not ensure that there is adequate veterinary care provided at this facility.
The licensee must make formal arrangements with a knowledgeable veterinarian. The formal arrangements must
include a written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee, VMO Cole, and ACI Bartels.
