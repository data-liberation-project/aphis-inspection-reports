3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
A majority of the outdoor housing facilities are not enclosed by a perimeter fence which is required for the animal species
housed at this facility. Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep
animals and unauthorized persons out. A perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility
by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in
the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility. Fences less than
8 feet high for potentially dangerous animals or less than 6 feet high for other animals must be approved in writing by the
Administrator. Additionally, the fence must be at least 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure or must be approved
in writing by the Administrator.
The facility must construct a perimeter fence of appropriate height and distance from the primary enclosures or must
obtain approval by the Administrator.

The facility is currently in the process of applying for a perimeter fence variance.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.



All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 11/19/2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
