3.28(c)(1)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Section 3.28(c)(1)(iii) Space requirements: An enclosure housing five adult guinea pigs (each weighing over 350
grams) did not have adequate floor space. The enclosure measured 15 inches by 22 inches or 330 square inches
of floor space. Guinea pigs weighing over 350 grams require at least 101 square inches of floor space. Two guinea
pigs were moved to another enclosure during the inspection. Guinea pigs must be housed in primary enclosures
that provide at least the required floor space for their comfort and well-being. Correct from this day forward.
3.28(c)(2)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Section 3.28(c)(2)(iv) Space requirements: There were 63 enclosures each housing an adult female hamster with
her nursing litter that did not have adequate floor space. The enclosures measured 7.5 inches by 12.25 inches or
91.875 square inches of floor space. In addition, the overhead water receptacle and feeder protruded down into the
enclosure about 3.5 inches above the floor taking up 18.125 square inches of the 91.875 square inches of floor
space available. The space below the protruding water receptacle and feeder is not sufficient height (at least 6
inches high) for this area to be counted as floor space for the hamsters. These animals only had 73.75 square
inches of floor space not affected by the water receptacle and feeder and is not sufficient for housing a nursing
female hamster and her offspring. A nursing female hamster with her litter must be housed in in a primary
enclosure that provides at least 121 square inches of floor space for their comfort and well-being. Correct by May
28, 2015.
3.31(b) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(b) Housekeeping: The cart, knives and potato slicer used to prepare potatoes for the animals were
excessively dirty with old, dried potato residue. The enclosure racks housing 496 Chinese hamsters had debris on
the shelves. Cobwebs were on the racks, on the shelves between the enclosures and on the enclosures. An
enclosure rack housing 22 guinea pigs had cobwebs on the rack and animal enclosures. Rodent feces were alongthe walls in the room with the potato cart, the animal room, the storage room and around the pallets storing the
food. Debris and food residue may harbor bacteria and cause animal health issues. Food preparation areas must
be kept clean to prevent contamination of the food. Animal racks must be kept clean to keep the animals healthy.
Rodent feces may harbor bacteria and parasites and must be cleaned up on a regular basis for the health of the
animals and to monitor pests. Premises must be kept clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth
in this subpart. This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
3.31(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.31(c) Pest control: Rodent feces were observed along the walls in the room with the potato cart, the
animal room and the storage room including between the pallets of food. Wild rodents may introduce diseases and
parasites into the animal colonies. Facility personnel showed the APHIS officials one wire box trap being used in
the storage room and informed the APHIS officials that poison is put under the pallets with food. No other pest
control measures were observed during the inspection. The current pest control program is not adequate based on
the amount and distribution of the rodent feces observed throughout the facility. An effective program for the control
of mammalian pests must be established and maintained. This is a repeat non-compliance that remains
uncorrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility employee; Mary Geib, VMO; and Robert Markmann, ACI.
