INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Many of the teaching protocols have not been reviewed by the IACUC in several years. The IACUC shall conduct
continuing reviews of covered activities as determined by the IACUC but not less than annually. Protocols must be
reviewed on a regular basis to ensure current standards continue to be followed and to ensure changes have not
been made to the protocol without prior IACUC approval. All protocols that have not been reviewed in over a year
need to be submitted to the IACUC for review and approval.
