veterinary care must be provided which includes a preventative program to provide grooming and coat

** The female Dachshund m/c# 4A40637645 had hair loss and dry skin with scabs on her back, legs, tail and ears.
The dog had not been diagnosed nor being treated for the condition. Hair loss and skin conditions can be irritating
or painful to the dog and may be the indication of a serious medical issue. The licensee shall obtain a written
diagnosis and treatment plan from a licensed veterinarian by the close of business 8/8/2015 and provide treatment
as prescribed.
***The licensee had two different types of puppy vaccines at the facility. The type of vaccine listed in her program of
vet care to be administered to puppies at the facility was expired. She stated that she had switched the type of
vaccine she was providing to her puppies to the 2nd type because the broker provided them to her. Providing in
date vaccinations of the appropriate type, at the recommended intervals is crucial to preventing disease. The
licensee shall administer vaccines as directed by her attending veterinarian and agreed upon in the facilities written
Program of Veterinary Care. If changes to the protocol or types of vaccines need to be made, the licensee shall
consult the attending veterinarian for guidance and any changes should be noted in the POVC. The licensee shall
ensure medications for the dogs are not expired. TO BE CORRECTED: 8/7/2015

the wall and the floor. The licensee stated that it was caused by water damage. Animal housing areas must be kept

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were at least 3 litters of un-weaned puppies housed in the raised, coated wire enclosures of the whelping
room that were observed with their feet and legs falling through the floor of the enclosure. The licensee had covered
a portion of their enclosures with carpet squares and dry deck. However, there is nothing to prevent these young
puppies from moving to the uncovered portion of the enclosure where their feet and legs can fall through the
openings in the flooring. Young animals that are not provided adequate support can result in the inability to learn a
proper gait and has the potential to cause injury. The licensee shall provide enclosures that have flooring that does
not allow the feet and legs of the animals to pass through any openings in the floor. TO BE CORRECTED BY:

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
An adult, female Schnauzer, housed in a raised enclosure of the whelping room did not have sufficient head space.
When standing or sitting erect there was only 3 inches of space between the top of her head and the ceiling of the
enclsoure. Sufficient head space is necessary for dogs to make normal postural adjustments and to move freely
inside their enclosure. The licensee shall ensure the interior height of all primary enclosures are at least 6 inches
higher than the head of the tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position. TO BE
CORRECTED BY: 8/14/2015.

WATERING.
There were two adult dogs in the raised outdoor enclosures that did not have access to water. The water receptacle
was dry and inspectors requested that the licensee provide the dogs water. At the sight of the licensee approaching
the enclosure with the water bowl one of the dogs stood on its hind legs and pawed at the enclsoure door anxiously.
When provided water both dogs drank continuously for an extended period of time. Adequate water is necessary to
prevent overheating and dehydration. If potable water is not continually available to the dogs, it must be offered to
the dogs as often as necessary to ensure their health and well-being. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 8/5/2017
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee and a MoDA inspector.
