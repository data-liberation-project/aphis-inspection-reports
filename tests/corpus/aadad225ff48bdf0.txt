2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Multiple chinchillas had health problems that had not been recognized by the facility and were not receiving any
medical treatment:
-Male grey (no id; housed in south stacked cages, west/front room) had a large hairless swelling under its chin and
its right eye was crusted shut and had hair loss around it with a creamy pale discharge.
-Female grey with ear tag 332; its right eye was swollen and had a pale creamy discharge.
-Female black with ear tag GROS 313 had a soiled and unkempt hair coat, crusty eyes and hair loss around the
lower jaw area. The licensee said that it appeared to have 'bone spurs' on the bottom jaw and may have bad back
teeth. The combination of an unkempt hair coat, crusty eyes, and hair loss are suggestive of an underlying health
condition that must be determined by the attending veterinarian and treated per the AV's reccomendations.
-Male beige with ear tag GROS 329; its left eye was swollen and had a pale creamy discharge in it.
-Male beige (no ID; cage card "AMMC"); its left eye was swollen and had a pale creamy discharge in it.
-Male cream with ear tag GROS 375; had a large, hairless swelling under its chin that was firm and had reddened
skin indicating inflammation. The chinchilla would vocalize each time the swelling was lightly touched indicating the
swelling was painful.
-Female beige with ear tag GROS 352 had a large hairless swelling on the area under its chin.
INDIRECT NON-COMPLIANCES:
-White female in cage 168 on south stacked cages, tag 876 had a swollen area with hair-loss and the tissues felt
thickened. Licensee said that this was just a 'plump' chinchilla. Given the other chinchillas with concerning chin
swellings, the licensee must have this chinchilla observed by the veterinarian to determine if any treatment isnecessary.
-Female grey with ear tag PMR 233; its left eye had an opaque mass inside of its eyeball. To ensure that this
condition is not painful, the licensee must have the attending veterinarian observe this animal's condition and follow
any treatment instructions.
-Silver grey female (no ID, housed in front room, north side, row of cages facing the wall); had a left head tilt and
when it moved, it would circle to its left. The licensee reports observing this problem about two months ago and has
been observing it for improvement but the attending veterinarian has not been consulted to diagnose and guide any
treatment for this animal.
**Untreated medical problems can cause ongoing pain in affected animals and can be contagious to other animals
in the building. The veterinarian must be contacted to properly diagnose and treat each animal's health problem
and the facility must follow the reccomended treatment. Documentation of the diagnosis and treatment plan for
animals must available for APHIS officials for future inspections.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility had previously recognized and had 10 chinchillas under treatment with eye problems at the time of
inspection, but there were 9 more chinchillas that had health problems that we brought to the licensee's attention
during inspection. These 9 chinchillas were pointed out to the licensee by inspectors to have health conditions:
-Male grey (no id; housed in south stacked cages, west/front room) had a large hairless mass under its chin and its
right eye had hair loss around it with a crusty and creamy pale discharge.
-Female grey with ear tag 332; its right eye was swollen and had a pale creamy discharge.
-Female black with ear tag GROS 313 had a soiled and unkempt hair coat, crusty eyes and hair loss around the
lower jaw areas.
-Male beige with ear tag GROS 329; its left eye that was swollen and had a pale creamy discharge in it.
-Male beige (no ID; cage card "AMMC"); its left eye was swollen and had a pale creamy discharge in it.
-Male cream colored with ear tag GROS 375; had a large, hairless swelling under its chin that was firm. The
chinchilla would vocalize each time the swelling was lightly touched indicating possible pain.
-Female beige with ear tag GROS 352 had a large hairless swelling on the area under its chin.
INDIRECT NON-COMPLIANCES:
-Female white in cage 168 on south stacked cages, tag 876 had a swollen area with hair-loss and the tissues felt
thickened.
-Female grey with ear tag PMR 233; its left eye had an opaque mass inside of its eyeball. Lack of thorough daily observations has resulted in animals not receiving prompt veterinary care. The facility must
develop and maintain a method of routine daily observations to ensure any animal with a health problem is treated
promptly and appropriately.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength.
Two enclosures had wire points that the animals could contact. Two chinchillas were affected. Sharp metal points
inside the enclosure can result in animal injuries. The facility must be maintained in good repair to contain and
protect animals from injury.
Note: The licensee corrected the sharp metal points during the inspection.
3.125(d) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste disposal.
The facility's equipment to eliminate the excreta, waste, and used bedding from the gutter was not working properly
at the time of inspection. There was a large buildup of excreta, waste, used bedding and water under the enclosures
of animals located over the south gutter of the facility. This buildup of material created a strong ammonia smell and
foul odor within the facility and a large number of small black flies were present in the middle room of the facility.
This buildup of material and foul odors can cause sickness in animals and attract pests such as flies. Eliminate the
excessive buildup of excreta, waste, used bedding and excess soiled water from the facility as often as necessary
to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards.
Note: The licensee reports having contacted the repairman prior to inspection and contacted the repairman during
the inspection and scheduled repairs for Sunday 6/26/2016. The licensee must ensure that it is fixed by then. If the
equipment breaks down again, additional methods must be used to remove soiled material from the building to
protect the animals from excessive odors and disease hazards.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water lines that provide water for the majority of the animals have sections where the tubing has a greenish
appearance. The outside of the watering line continues to have some areas where an excessive buildup of hair andsoiled material is present. At least one watering bottle had a greenish buildup inside of it. Unclean water
receptacles may contaminate the water supply and cause many animals to get sick. To protect the health of the
animals, clean and/or replace water lines, spouts, and bottles as often as necessary to assure a clean supply of
water to the animals.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Enclosures in the front room in the middle (cid:24)group pens(cid:25) where about 20 chinchillas are housed and enclosures on
the stacked enclosures on the south side of the front room housing approximately 10 chinchillas were noted to have
an excessive amount of feces. The licensee stated that the enclosures had not been cleaned out in about two and
a half weeks. Excessive accumulations of feces can increase animals(cid:25)' risks for disease and does not provide for
their comfort. Enclosures must be cleaned out as often as necessary to minimize excessive accumulations of feces
and soiled bedding.
