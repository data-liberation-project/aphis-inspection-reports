2.131(c)(1) Repeat

Handling of animals.
The licensee conducts public encounters with lemurs in two settings, both of which pose significant risk to the animals and
the public.
The licensee allows public encounters with two adult red ruffed lemurs in an indoor room. The licensee stated that one
lemur wears a harness attached to a leash, and the other lemur does not wear a harness but is unlikely to approach a
member of the public. While wearing a leash, the first lemur is allowed to be petted and fed by the public, and is allowed
to climb around on the members of the public doing the encounter. The licensee stated that this lemur is not trained but
will follow the food that is available.
The licensee allows public encounters with three juvenile ring-tailed lemurs in an outdoor setting. The lemurs wear
harnesses attached to leashes. The licensee stated that an employee will hold the other end of the leash. Review of
social media photos of encounters posted in July and August 2022 show children with juvenile lemurs on their arms,
shoulders, and heads. One photo shows a child with a lemur on their shoulder, and the end of the leash is in the child’s
hand.
Allowing untrained lemurs to climb on the head, shoulders, and arms of members of the public poses risk of harm to the
animals and the public. The animals may contract diseases from the public, and may be injured when roughly handled or


dropped by members of the public. Members of the public may be bitten or scratched when animals are startled, scared,
or stressed, which in some cases may result in euthanasia of the animal for rabies testing.
Correct by conducting encounters with animals so that there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and to the public, to
assure the safety of the animals and the public.

Facilities, indoor.
Five guinea pigs were housed in an indoor facility that was not sufficiently cooled. The ambient temperature in the animal
room, at the location of the guinea pigs, was 87.9 at 4pm and 91.3 at 6pm. When guinea pigs are subjected to high
temperatures, they can become stressed and dehydrated and develop heat-related complications, such as heat stroke.
House guinea pigs in indoor facilities with ambient temperatures between 60-85F. Correct by 10/1/22

Indoor housing facilities.
3 juvenile ring-tailed lemurs are being housed in a room that is not adequately cooled.
At 4:13PM, the ambient temperature on the right side of the enclosure housing 2 juvenile ring-tailed lemurs was 86.2
degrees Fahrenheit. On the left side of this lemur enclosure, above the guinea pig enclosure, the temperature was 88
degrees Fahrenheit.
At 6:01PM, the ambient temperature on the right side of the of the lemur enclosure was 90.9 degrees Fahrenheit. On the
left side of this lemur enclosure, above the guinea pig enclosure, the temperature was 91.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
The temperature outdoors today, according to local weather data, was over 90 degrees Fahrenheit from 11:00AM to
7:00PM in Blue Springs, Mississippi.
Exposure to hot temperatures can cause animals to become stressed or dehydrated, and can lead to more serious
conditions such as heat stroke. Infants and young juveniles are especially susceptible to the effects of heat exposure due


to their small size and immature body systems.
Correct by 10/1/22 by ensuring that indoor facilities for nonhuman primates do not rise above 85 degrees Fahrenheit for
more than 4 consecutive hours when animals are present.

Watering.
In the back safari pasture, there was no potable water available to the animals, including fallow deer, wildebeest, yak, and
cows. The only source of water was a rain-filled pond that, due to lack of recent rain, was very low. The water that was
present was muddy and had a greenish-brown film over at least 80% of its surface. When asked what he does to provide
water when there hasn’t been any rain, the licensee stated that he fills a tub up by the gate; however, the tub by the gate
was empty and completely dry at the time of the inspection. When animals do not have access to sufficient quantities of
clean water, they can become dehydrated, weak, and die. Animals can fight or intimidate others in the pasture when
competing for access to water. Potable water must be provided in sufficient quantities and frequency to provide for all
animals’ health and comfort. Correct by 9/23/22

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
