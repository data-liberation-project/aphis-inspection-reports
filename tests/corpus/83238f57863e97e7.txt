2.33(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
A Principal Investigator failed to communicate with the attending veterinarian in a timely manner as previously instructed
by IACUC regarding potential complications encountered during surgical procedures and the post-operative condition of
rhesus macaques. Following one such surgery, an adult male rhesus macaque (A11N156) subsequently died, although
the cause of death remains inconclusive. Direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. After full committee review of this
incident and other recent records, the IACUC has formally instructed the PI that all procedures requiring anesthesia and
or sedation may only be performed by the ARC veterinary staff until a qualified anesthesiologist approved by the IACUC is
appointed. The PI must also communicate by phone with the veterinary staff before leaving for the day when anesthesia
procedures have been performed to ensure proper anesthesia recovery has occurred.
