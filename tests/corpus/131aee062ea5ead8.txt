3.6(c)(1)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are 2 Husky puppies identified on today's inspection that were housed in primary enclosures that did not
provide the dogs with 6 inches above their head while they were sitting or standing fully erect within their enclosure.
Not having a sufficient amount of space can cause unnecessary stress and/or discomfort for the dogs. The interior
height of all primary enclosure, containing adults or puppies, must be at least 6 inches higher than the head of the
tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position.
