more than 10 days as ago per the new residents of the building. Failure to notify the Animal Welfare Operations Office in
changes of address doesn’t allow inspection for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, Regulations, and Standards.

Notification of changes in address must be sent by certified mail within 10 days of making such a change.
