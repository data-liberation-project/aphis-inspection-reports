2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In Pen #12, an adult, female, tri-colored guinea pig was observed to be laying laterally on her right side and made
no attempts to stand as other guinea pigs rushed around her when approached by APHIS officials. The guinea pig
appeared to be sunken into the shavings around her and did not attempt to rise when two juvenile guinea pigs
approached her and attempted to nurse. The only movements observed by this guinea pig were several kicks of
the left hind leg and a few attempts to move her head. When the facility representative attempted to stand the
guinea pig up, she reclined back into a lateral position.
When asked about this guinea pig, the facility representative was previously unaware of her condition and had not
contacted the Attending Veterinarian (AV) regarding this animal. Also, seven additional dead juvenile guinea pigs
were identified in Pens 17, 49, and 10, and an adult guinea pig was found deceased in Pen 4. The facility
representative was likewise unaware of the deceased guinea pigs in these pens prior to inspection.
The inability to stand or walk can be indicative of disease and/or injury which can be painful and affect the overal
health of the animal. Failure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment for disease may result in pain to the animals,
worsening of the condition, and possible spread to additional animals if the condition is contagious. The licensee
must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include appropriate methods to prevent,
control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
3.26(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
There was a strong ammonia odor throughout the indoor guinea pig housing areas. There was an operable fan in
the larger room and closed windows present in both housing areas, but these methods were not sufficient to provide
adequate ventilation. The licensee stated that he had not made any changes to the ventilation since the last
inspection. Failure to provide fresh air can expose the guinea pigs to potential disease hazards. The indoor
housing facilities must be ventilated to minimize odors and ensure the health of the animals.
3.31(a)(1)SANITATION.
There are three enclosures (Pen #20, 21, and 22) with a large accumulation of feces covering the floor and a lack of
bedding material. There is also a build-up of dirt, dust, and grime on the walls of a majority of the enclosures. Dirty
enclosures can cause unpleasant ammonia odors, lead to the contamination of feed and water, and attract pests
and vermin which can carry diseases and affect the health of the animals. The facility must ensure primary
enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris.
