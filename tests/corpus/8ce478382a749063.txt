Facilities, outdoor.
A small number of animals still do not have access to appropriate shelter: a total of 20 arctic fox. This is a significant
improvement from the number of animals with inadequate shelter from the previous inspection. Most of these enclosures
had either nothing acting as additional wind or rain break, or a small section of shingle-like paper material covering a little
more than half of the roof and not sufficient to afford adequate protection from the elements for the animals contained
therein. Inadequate shelters do not allow the animals the ability to have protection from wind, rain, snow or other weather
extremes. Cold weather exposure can lead to hypothermia and/or unnecessary stress and discomfort. The licensee must
ensure that all animals have access to an appropriate shelter for the local climatic conditions and that afford them
adequate protection to prevent discomfort.

Facilities, outdoor.
During today's inspection, a loose raccoon was observed walking on the ground near the regulated animal enclosures.
The licensee appeared to believe that this was a wild raccoon, and since the records are inadequate there is no way to
confirm that this loose raccoon was in fact a regulated animal. This raccoon was interacting and touching noses with at
least one of the licensee's raccoons through its cage wire. Because this facility does not currently have a perimeter fence,


this animal was allowed to directly contact and potentially spread disease to the covered animals. In addition to this
disease hazard, the lack of a perimeter fence does not allow for a secondary form of containment in the event of an
escape of dangerous or exotic species. In addition, there are no physical barriers in place that would prevent unwanted
animals or people from walking directly up to an enclosure and making contact with the animals contained therein. The
licensee must ensure a perimeter fence is properly in place or apply and receive approval for a variance from the
Administrator for all species that require a perimeter fence.

Watering.
Roughly 20% of the water receptacles for the fox, raccoon and skunk have chew or scratch damage, or have
accumulated layers of calcium or organic deposits that do not allow for proper cleaning or sanitation. This is an
improvement from the 45% of receptacles that were identified on the previous inspection; however, these 20% seen today
still have deposits of brown, red, or black material embedded into the scratch marks or chewed areas. Having water
receptacles that are not properly cleaned and sanitized expose the animals to unnecessary hazards or can adversely
affect the flavor and thus the animals’ willingness to actually drink the water. Correct by ensuring all water receptacles are
kept clean and sanitary.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
