Female, gray and white Shih Tzu mix "Sassy" with number 204 has a buildup of brown material completely coating
the upper "cheek teeth" (premolars and molars) on both sides. The first and second "cheek teeth" (premolars) on
the upper right side are loose. The gum line over these teeth has recessed, exposing the roots of the teeth. There is
also some gum recession on the upper right canine tooth. Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue and
tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health
of the animal. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian by 15 March 2014 in order to
ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.
The licensee must document the outcome of this consultation and make it available to the inspector upon request.
There is a bottle of Pyrantal Pamoate with an expiration date of 05/09. This is the medication that the licensee has
on the premises to deworm the dogs as directed on the program of veterinary care. Expired medications can
experience spoilage or have reduced efficacy. This could lead to prolonged illness or suffering for the animals
needing the drug. The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired and labeled
properly in accordance with standard veterinary practices.
