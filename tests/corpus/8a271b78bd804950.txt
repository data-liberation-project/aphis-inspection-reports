No dog or cat shall be accepted for consignment for transportation in commerce unless it is at least eight weeks of
age and has been weaned. The carrier transported the underage animals, despite documentation showing the age.
Transporters should assure that animals handled meet the minimum age requirements for shipment. Shipping
puppies less that 8 weeks old could put their well being at risk.
To be corrected immediately.
