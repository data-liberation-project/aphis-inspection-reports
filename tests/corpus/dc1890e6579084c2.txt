HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the inspection of the walk through portion of the park where goats are present for visitors to interact with and
pet, an attendant was not present. Adults and children were observed interacting with and petting the goats. A
responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during
periods of public contact.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
A table currently being used to prepare animal food in the kitchen/food preparation area was scratched and the
surfaces were no longer able to be properly cleaned and sanitized. There was a full trash can next to the food
preparation table that did not have a lid. The animal food preparation/kitchen area had a general accumulation of
dust, dirt and other debris. The walls in the animal preparation area including the wall adjacent to the food
preparation table had peeling paint, significant scratched areas ,and an accumulation of debris. Additionally, there
were two wheelbarrows full of uneaten, meat and bone, food waste directly outside of the food preparation area.
Buildings and grounds, to include animal food preparation areas, need to be kept clean and in good repair to protect
the health and well-being of the animals, to prevent the infestation of pests and other vermin and to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices. A plan needs to be implemented to ensure the animal food preparation/kitchen
areas and other facility premises are being cleaned on a regular basis to facilitate prescribed husbandry practices.

To be corrected by June 25, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility manager.
