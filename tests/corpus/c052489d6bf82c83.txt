2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two animals were identified during this inspection as having diseases or injuries for which they were not currently
receiving treatment:
A standard female in cage 14-24 with the left eye's surface almost completely opaque white in appearance. In the
center of the surface of this eye is an area with more dense white material and an area that appears to cave in. The
sclera of this eye is covered with densely packed blood vessels. The attending veterinarian had not been contacted
and the facility representative was not treating this animal at the time of inspection because she had been told by
the licensee that this was a blind animal and nothing needed to be done. There is no documentation in the written
program of veterinary care about withholding treatment for an animal with this condition.
A standard female in cage 17-15 has a crusted yellowish discharge matting the fur under her right ear. Upon closer
examination, there is a clear yellowish scab-like lesion on the interior surface of the outer ear pinna. The skin of the
ear in this area feels thickened. This condition had not been identified by the facility prior to this inspection, so it was
not receiving treatment nor had the attending veterinarian been consulted.
Conditions that have not been treated in accordance with the veterinarian's recommendations can lead to undue
pain, distress, or further illness and are not consistent with an adequate program of veterinary care. The facility
must correct by establishing and maintaining an adequate program of veterinary care which includes the use of
appropriate methods to treat diseases and injuries in consultation with a veterinarian. Furthermore, correct by
providing appropriate treatments to these animals which has been directed by a veterinarian.
Corrected at the time of exit.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility has been maintaining an inventory of animals on hand and accounting for acquisitions and dispositions.
However, on 6 of 18 disposition records, the numbers of animals on the sales receipts do not match the numbers onthe running tally that has been serving as the animal inventory. Complete and accurate records are necessary to
facilitate tracking of the animals and compliance with other aspects of the AWA. Every dealer shall make, keep, and
maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following information concerning animals, purchased
or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or
which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.
This inspection was conducted with the facility representative on 18 August 2020. An exit interview was conducted
with the facility representative and the licensee on 19 August 2020.
