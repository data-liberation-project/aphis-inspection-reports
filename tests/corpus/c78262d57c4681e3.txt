A male Bichon's (#021) left eye had some tear staining. Upon closer observation there was a very small lesion on the
upper eyelid. This lesion was approximately 1mm and the skin in the lesion was reddened. The small lesion could irritate
the eye causing discomfort to the dog. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian and develop and document a
treatment plan.

Housing facilities, general.
The waste drainage pipe for the kennel was broke and leaking next to the building. The broke waste drainage pipe
outside are close to the building and food and feces are accumulating on the ground. Having waste close to the facility
can attract pest and vermin that can harm the dogs. The waste disposal system must dispose the waste far enough from
the facility as to not attract pests or vermin near the animals.

kennel visits , not more than every 12 months and exams for each kennel dog.

attending veterinarian.
