3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
Two enclosures, containing an approximate total of two adult skunks and two juvenile skunks, have a large gap between
the nest box and the wire flooring. The gap is large enough to allow a skunk's foot to pass through. Gaps that are large
enough to allow an animal to pass part of its body through could cause the animal to become entrapped or injured.

At least 6 enclosures, containing an approximate total of twenty-three ferrets, have nail heads protruding into the
enclosure and located at the level of the animals. Contact with the nail heads could cause injury to the ferrets.

One enclosure, containing at least one raccoon, has a piece of wooden board lying on the enclosure floor with a nail
protruding through it. The sharp point of the nail is pointing upward and located at the level of the animal. Contact with
the sharp end of the nail could cause injury to the raccoon.

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. The licensee must alter the enclosures in a manner that eliminates the risk
of injury due to the gaps, sharp nail and nail heads. The licensee must ensure the enclosures are maintained in good

repair and safe for the animals at all times in order to support their well-being. The licensee corrected the nails heads and
sharp nail at the time of the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
