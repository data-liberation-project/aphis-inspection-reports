2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown lionhead rabbit approximately 3 months old has an open wound on the back just behind the neck. The
wound is about 2 inches in diameter, red, crusted and devoid of hair. The skin and wound in this area are adhered
in place and not movable. Staff noticed a small laceration on the rabbit yesterday, consulted via phone with a
veterinarian, applied topical medication and removed the animal from display. Store personnel indicate the wound
area looks worse. The veterinarian has not been contacted today and the rabbit has not been evaluated by physical
evaluation. Further deterioration of the wound in spite of treatment prescribed by phone is an indication that the
animal should be examined by the veterinarian.
Wounds can be painful and become infected without appropriate treatment. The licensee must have the rabbit
examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m. tomorrow to obtain an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. The
licensee shall maintain programs of adequate veterinary care, including the use of appropriate methods to prevent,
diagnose and treat injuries.
Correct by: Ensuring that procedures are implemented for all injured and ill animals to promptly receive appropriate
veterinary treatment.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Seven rabbits weighing less than 4.4 lbs were housed in a primary enclosure measuring 45 x 32 inches or 10 sq. ft.
Seven rabbits of this size require 10.5 sq ft for the animals to have adequate freedom of movement and make
normal postural adjustments without restrictions. To ensure the physical and psychological comfort and well being
of the animals adequate space must be provided according to the requirements under the Animal Welfare Act.
This non-compliant item was corrected during this inspection by moving one rabbit to another enclosure with
adequate space.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with staff and the manager.
