2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
At the exit briefing on September 28, 2021, I stated to the licensee that he shouldn’t conduct any regulated activity after
October 7, 2021 because his license will no longer be valid. The licensee is currently undergoing the re-license process.
According to a news report, two zebras owned by the former licensee were sold at the Triple W Exotic Animal Auction in
Tennessee on November 4, 2021. The former licensee confirmed that he sold 2 zebras that were housed at a location in
Florida at the auction. Regulated activity was conducted without a USDA dealer license. Conducting regulated activity
without a USDA license does not comply with the regulations under the Animal Welfare. Regulated activity must cease
until the licensing process is complete and the facility is in full compliance with the regulations and standards of the
Animal Welfare Act.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The records of acquisitions and dispositions are incomplete. The documentation of the disposition of the camels referred
to in the previous inspection report dated May 6, 2021 were not available for review. Also, there were no original
acquisition documents for the 39 zebras that were transferred from a location in Florida to Maryland, just a notation they
came from Wild World in 2000. Zebra “Baby Z” was donated to an unlicensed person. However, APHIS Form 7020 does


not include the date of birth, of the zebra, the date of donation, and the name and full address of the person who acquired
the zebra.
Complete acquisition and disposition records should be maintained and kept to facilitate the tracking of animals. Records
of acquisitions for the zebras and the disposition records for the camels and the zebra named “Baby Z” must be updated
to include all information required under Section 2.75 (b)(1) and maintained for review by an APHIS inspector.
2.131(a) Critical Repeat

Handling of animals.
The two of three zebras that escaped during the process of being unload from a trailer on August 22, 2021, have not been
captured. The zebras have eluded capture for 79 days despite multiple measures to trap the zebras in a temporary
enclosure. The zebras appear to be in good condition based upon pictures from cameras placed in areas they have been
sighted. Animals roaming free is considered improper handling as the licensee is unable to administer the prescribed
husbandry practices as set forth in Subpart F standards of the Animal Welfare Act. The zebras must be captured to for
their health and safety.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
***The barns used as shelter from the elements for 32 of the zebra are in need of repair.
Large Barn: The wall surfaces on the left side of the barn from the entrance to the back of the barn, is made of various
panels of plywood. The panels are pieced together in a manner that has some small gaps has gaps that would allow cold
air into the barn. One of the glass panels has cracked and held together with tape. On the outside of the barn, near the
entrance gate, there are detached siding,

Small Barn: The right portion of the entrance sliding doors has a detached section along the right edge. There are several


areas in the front and back of the barn in which there is a hole in the siding or missing siding. Panels of siding above the
entrance to the barn were detached.
The barns must be repaired and constructed in a manner to ensure structural strength and to prevent injury to the zebras

***Two holes were present in the ground along the bottom of the wall in the back area of the barn. The holes are a size to
suggest a medium sized rodent is harboring in the barn. There is no plan to control the pests. Effective measures must be
established and maintained to control the activity of mammalian pests to minimize structural damage to the barn and for
the safety of the zebras.
3.127(b) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
Shelter from inclement weather - Three of the zebras are in an enclosure that does not have adequate protection from
inclement weather. Although there is natural shelter from trees, the trees are shedding their leaves since the fall season
has started. These zebras do not have access to the barns that provide shelter from inclement weather for the other
zebras. Animals kept outdoors should be provided shelter from the elements. Appropriate shelter must be provided in the
enclosure for the zebras for their protection and comfort.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
Housekeeping
***There were tractors and associated equipment stored in the pasture that the zebra roam. There are also several trailers
within the pasture. Zebra were also seen standing among a pile of wood for building and fencing. Hazardous items in the
pasture where the zebras roam can lead to animal injury or illnesses. The materials and equipment should be kept in such
a manner that protects the animals from injury. Unnecessary equipment and building materials must be removed and kept


in a designated area away from the animals for their health and safety.

*** A feed trough near the small barn has a hole and a crack in the bottom surface with rough edges. The hole is large
enough for a muzzle or extremity to pass through. Items in disrepair must not be kept to protect the animals from injury.
The feed trough should be repaired or replaced.
3.132 Repeat

Employees.
At the time of inspection, 35 zebras were being cared for by one person with no experience or adequate knowledge of the
species. One of the escaped zebras was captured but escaped a temporary enclosure after the inexperienced caretaker
improperly secured gate. Animals being cared for by an inexperienced employee(s) can lead to inappropriate care of the
animals and undue harm or injury.
The licensee must ensure that adequately trained employees are utilized under the supervision of a person who has
knowledge of the care of zebras to maintain a professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices as set forth in the
Subpart F standards of the Animal Welfare Act.

This is the 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license.

and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection prior to
