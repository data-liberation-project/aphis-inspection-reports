FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The enclosure in the gift shop area with a glass front, housing the rabbit, has an area in the bottom corner by the
entry door where the mesh wire that is covering the wood appears to have been chewed and has multiple sharp
points. This mesh wire is detached and curled at the bottom creating an area which is unsafe for the enclosed
animal. This is an entrapment risk and the sharp points may cause injury to the enclosed rabbit and must be
corrected. All sharp points and loose wires must be eliminated, and all gaps repaired to minimize the risk of injury
to the animal.
To be corrected by: 2 April 2016.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- The ring tailed lemurs are currently being housed in a wire dog crate style enclosure that is 48 X 30 X 29 inches.
This crate contains a small igloo style, plastic dog house that serves as a nest box that is 16 X 16 X 24 inches and
sits on the floor of the wire dog crate style enclosure. This enclosure is located in the front area of the gift shop.
There is a small public barrier around the NHPs. The licensee's representative stated that the lemurs had not been
moved to another enclosure for the last 30 days at least. They were moved into the gift shop in January 2016 when
their outside enclosure was not warm enough this winter. This set up does not allow the 3 square feet per NHP as
required by the AWA. The primates must be provided a secure, appropriately sized shelter or be moved to an
outside enclosure appropriate for spring and summer weather.
