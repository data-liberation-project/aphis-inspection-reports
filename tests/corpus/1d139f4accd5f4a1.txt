SANITATION.
*There are eight fallow deer being temporarily housed in a stall in the barn that has a brown material on the walls of
the enclosure. Some debris was noted on the ground. Some cobwebs with trapped dust/dirt are present in the upper
back corners.
*The shelter structure for the two calves contains straw bedding. The bedding contains numerous fecal piles such
that the cows can't avoid the piles when seeking shelter/lying down inside.
Excessively dirty enclosures with a build-up of dirt and fecal material can create an environment for disease spread
and contamination of the animals. Fecal material and debris must be removed from the enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent contamination and to minimize disease hazards. Correct by Feb. 6, 2020.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
