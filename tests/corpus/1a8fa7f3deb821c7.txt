2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30 pm on
01-May-19.
The licensee's daughter was home and said that her mother was not home and she did not know when she would
return. I called the licensee's phone but could not leave a message. I sent a text message to the licensee without a
reply until the next day.
Additional Inspectors
Mcgruder William, Animal Care Inspector
