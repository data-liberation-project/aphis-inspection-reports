INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Inspectors reviewed the anesthesia and sedation protocol and associated surgical records including spay, neuter
and dental procedure records. According to the protocol, animals will receive continual monitoring while under
anesthesia. However, at least five procedures were performed without any associated anesthetic monitoring
records. Also, the protocol states that the animals will receive a sedative of diazepam and acepromazine prior to
induction of anesthesia. The anesthesia records and medical records do not have any recorded sedation
medications, and only record the induction medications of ketamine and xylazine. The protocol also states that
animals will be given a post-operative dose of meloxicam; however, the anesthesia and medical records do notinclude any dosing information for this medication. Continuing review of animal activities is necessary to ensure that
they are conducted as
stated in the approved protocol, and is required in order to ensure that all activities are conducted in compliance
with the Animal Welfare Act regulations. The IACUC must conduct continuing review of activities in order to ensure
that all animal activities are conducted as stated in the approved protocols and in compliance with these regulations.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Inspectors observed two bottles of expired medications. One bottle of Dopram expired in August 2015, and one
bottle of Alcohol expired in September 2015. Inspectors also observed a transfer bottle of Chlorhexidine and a
transfer bottle of Novlasan, neither of which were marked with expiration dates from the stock solution bottles.
Expired medications may not work as expected, may be contaminated, and could harm the animals if used. The
facility must not use the aforementioned products, and must develop and implement a program to monitor
medication expiration dates in order to ensure that expired medications are not used in or on the animals.
