ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In pen 23 is a brown and white guinea pig with discharge accumulated around both nostrils. There is also a
yellowish discharge accumulated in the right eye. There is a rattle heard when she breathes and she extends her
head and neck, sneezing or coughing frequently, then rubbing her face with her front foot.
In pen 24 is white, cream, and brown guinea pig that has discharge accumulated around both eyes. The lids of the
right eye appear red and swollen. There is a significant amount of yellowish discharge dried around the right eye
and present in the corner of the eye. The left eye appears less swollen with a small amount of discharge present on
the lids.
In pen 20 is a black, white, and gold guinea pig with a hazy right eye. The hair around the eye is moist with dried
debris adhered to the hair in front of and below the eye. The lids appear swollen and a portion of the cornea is
raised and white. The left eye also appears moist with swollen lids, though the eye is clear.
These guinea pigs require veterinary care for their health and well being. Licensee must use appropriate methods
to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries. These animals must be examined by a licensed
veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and plan shall
be maintained for examination by APHIS officials

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The floor of the animal housing room is structurally unsound. The painted wood of the floor is warped, bowed, and
in areas appears saturated with moisture. The floor is weak and holes are present. On inspection today, a new
hole was created simply by walking around the northwest corner of the pens. The floor does not prevent pests fromentering which may introduce disease hazards. The moisture and instability prevent maintenance of housekeeping
standards. Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to protect the
animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals.

3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The guinea pig enclosures and racks are made of wood which are no longer impervious to moisture. Urine and
other fluids have penetrated the wood in some areas, soaking through to the opposite side or leaching through to
the pen below. These pens can no longer be effectively sanitized. This allows disease hazards to grow which may
be a threat to the health and well being of the animals. Enclosures for guinea pigs, including their racks, shelving
and other accessories, shall be constructed of smooth material substantially impervious to liquids and moisture.
The guinea pig enclosures and racks must be replaced, repaired, or resurfaced so they are substantially impervious
to moisture.

WATERING.
The water receptacles remain too dirty. Wet bedding and a dark brown substance is adhered to the water
receptacles, water lines, and accumulated underneath them. The wire mesh of the primary enclosures near the
water lines and pipes is encrusted with a dark material and is rusty. There are buckets on top of the racks on the
north side of the facility which hold water before it goes down to the animals. The buckets have cobwebs on them
indicating they have not been recently cleaned. These environments are ideal for bacteria and other health hazards
to grow, posing a health risk for the animals. All watering receptacles and water holding buckets shall be cleaned
and sanitized when dirty.

3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Several of the primary enclosures remain too dirty. There is wet, soiled bedding accumulated in the corners, often
near the feed and water. Feces are accumulated in many of the self feeders. Some enclosures are extensively
soiled such that the guinea pigs do not have a clean area to congregate. Many enclosures have cobwebs and
bedding hanging from the ceilings. Urine and other moisture has penetrated into the wood structure of some of thepens. There is a dark film present on some of the walls, wire, feeders, and water lixits. The environment of these
dirty pens is ideal for harboring disease hazards which may be harmful for the guinea pigs. Primary enclosures
shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris. Sanitization includes
washing them with hot water (180 degrees F) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, or by washing
all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled
surfaces with live steam. A regular schedule for cleaning and sanitization shall be developed and maintained to
prevent recurrence.
