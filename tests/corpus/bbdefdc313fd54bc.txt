ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00pm on
12-Oct-17.
When I arrived at the facility at 2:00 pm, no one answered the door when I rang the doorbell. I called the facility
representative at 2:00 pm and texted him at 2:15 pm. The facility representative called me back at 2:20 pm, stating
that he was not in the area and could not meet with me to do the inspection on this day.
