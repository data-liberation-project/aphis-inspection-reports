ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In May 2015 a female capuchin named "Helper" was found dead in her enclosure. The facility failed to notice
"Helper's" poor body and dental condition. Routine medical care was not conducted in accordance with the facility's
written program of veterinary care. The animal had been examined by the attending veterinarian approximately one
month earlier, but facility records did not indicate any problems or concerns with this animal. The necropsy report
describes the animal as "emaciated" and gives her a body condition score of 1 out of 5, which is the lowest
possible. Her dental condition is described as "severe" and indicates that other than three canines, all teeth were
worn down to the gumline. The actual cause of death was listed as an immune mediated disease. The facility
stated that they did not realize how poor her body condition had become, and indicated that she seemed to be
eating normally until the time of her death.
The facility program of veterinary care states that routine care of primates will be, at minimum, a biennial physical
exam including dental exam, routine bloodwork, recording of bodyweight, and thoracic or full body radiographs.
Although examinations were conducted there are no recorded weights for "Helper", and no indication of bloodwork,
radiographs, or any notes on her dental condition.
Animals with severely worn teeth may appear to be eating normally, but might actually be unable to properly grind
food leading to inadequate digestion and absorption of nutrients. The facility must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care, including preventive screenings and physical exams. The facility must ensure that they
are following the written guidelines in their Program of Veterinary Care, and must also ensure that proper medical
records are being maintained.
Correct from this point forward.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All surfaces that house animals must be maintained on a regular basis. Two outside enclosures of the Stevens
building/sheltered facility, housing one capuchin monkey and the other housing three spider monkeys, the concrete
flooring has large cracks and a few places where the concrete is missing, leaving a small hole in the floor. These
cracks are long and deep. Cracks in hard surface flooring where animals walk can be a hazard to the feet andtoe/finger nails. Nails can become lodged and torn. Also, proper cleaning and sanitizing these cracked areas of
flooring cannot be adequately done. Deep cracks in animal areas can harbor diseases and feces that cannot be
washed out, properly cleaned and sanitized. The facility must replace these areas of the flooring to ensure that
good cleaning and sanitization can be done and the monkeys are in a safe environment. This will help in the good
health and care for the animals in this building. Correct by 08-26-2015.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Premises that house animals must be in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to protect the
health of the animals. The flooring in two outdoor concrete enclosures of the Stevens building, housing one bobcat
in each, has large cracks in the floor. Deep cracks in animal areas can harbor diseases and feces that cannot be
properly washed out, cleaned, and sanitized. Also, cracks in hard surface flooring where animals walk can be a
hazard to the feet and toe nails. Toes nails can become lodged and torn. The facility must replace these areas of
the flooring to ensure that good cleaning and sanitization can be done and the bobcats are in a safe environment.
This will help in the good health and care for the animals in this building. Correct by 08-26-2015.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
