Sanitation.
The water of the pool inside the capybara enclosure is not being adequately cleaned. The water is cloudy and
brown/yellowish in color. There is fecal matter floating around and buildup of brown material at the bottom of the pool.
The capybara pool does not have a filtration system and relies solely on manually water changes. Capybaras are
semiaquatic animals that normally defecate and urinate in the water. There was potable water for drinking in the
enclosure. Accumulation of excreta in water features can affect the health and well-being of the animal. Excreta shall be
removed from primary enclosures and water cleaned as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and make sure
the water quality does not cause a health problem.
