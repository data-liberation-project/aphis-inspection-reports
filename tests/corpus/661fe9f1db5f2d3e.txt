HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Prepared food for the animals housed in the attached garage is in uncovered dishes in the refrigerator in that area.
The inside of the refrigerator and the outside of storage containers, especially on the top shelf, have black
dirty-looking coating. The licensee stated that the seal on the door was failing and causing a mold problem in the
refrigerator.
The uncovered food is at risk of becoming contaminated by the mold growing in the refrigerator; the spores will be
distributed by the fan in the commercial-style unit.
Food contaminated by mold poses a health risk to the animals. The refrigerator must be kept clean, and the food
covered to prevent contamination. If the door seal is the problem, it must be repaired or replaced.

3.78(d) CRITICAL
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Talbot, a ringtail lemur, died since the last inspection. The licensee stated that the lemurs were left in their outdoor
enclosure overnight instead of bringing them in to the enclosure in the attached garage. At 2:00 am one morning,
coyotes came into the yard from the hills behind the property. They got close enough to the outdoor enclosure that
Talbot reportedly was frightened to death. There is no compliant perimeter fence around the enclosures on the patio
by the house.
A perimeter fence is required to prevent other animals from getting close enough to the animals in the enclosure to
cause them harm.
Correct immediately by only using the enclosures on the patio and driveway when they are under direct supervision,
until a compliant perimeter fence is in place.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a licensee.
An IES investigator also accompanied the inspection.
