ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has a Program of Veterinary Care but it is not complete and does not accurately represent the
practices currently conducted at the facility.
On the Program of Veterinary Care the vaccination schedule for puppies says "Annual". The licensee stated that
the puppies are vaccinated more often than once a year.
The section for Ectoparasites says "57% Malathion as needed". There is no dosage, route of administration, and
how often the treatment will be given.
The section for Blood Parasites says "Ivomec". There is no dosage, route of administration, and how often the
treatment is to be given. There is also no indication of any testing to be conducted and how often this testing will
occur.
The section for Intestinal Parasites says "Strongid T, Ivomec, Panacur". There is no dosages, route of
administration, puppy deworming schedule, and adult deworming schedule. There is also no indication of which
animals are to receive which of the three listed dewormers.
The section for Method of Euthanasia indicates that the licensee will perform the euthanasia and says "Injection
succinylcholine at kennel by owner". This method of euthanasia is not approved by the American Veterinarian
Medical Association Guidelines for Euthanasia. The licensee stated that he does not perform this method of
euthanasia and all euthanasia is performed by a licensed veterinarian.
Failure to have a complete and accurate written program of veterinary care does not ensure that the dogs are
receiving veterinary care consistent with currently accepted veterinary medical practices. The program must be
amended to reflect the practices of the facility. It shall include product dosage, route of administration, the
frequency of use, any testing to be completed, and the frequency at which this testing shall be done. The program
must also be amended to accurately reflect the puppy vaccination and puppy and adult deworming schedules. The
program must also be updated with the current method of euthanasia. Correction date: April 15, 2017

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Male Bichon ("Remington", microchip #837383097) has areas of moderate hair loss on his body. The areas are
most noted on the left side of the body. The area of hair loss along the left rib cage also contains three dark colored
scab-like sections within it and the skin is slightly reddened. Two areas of hair loss are located on the left hind leg.
One area is near the knee and the other area is along the lower leg. The skin in both areas is slightly reddened and
contains numerous small dark colored bumps and lesions. On the inside of the left ear flap there is a round, dark
colored lesion and the edges of the lesion feel thickened. This dog is not currently receiving any veterinary
treatment for the above described condition.
Hair loss and poor skin health could cause pain and discomfort to the dog and could indicate an underlying heath
issue. This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective
treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
The licensee mixes Albon in the water supply for the puppies. The bottle of Sulfadimethoxine that is currently being
added to the water expired in September 2016. Expired materials may lose their effectiveness and the health of the
animals could suffer. The licensee must dispose of this expired product or clearly label it so it is not used for the
dogs. The licensee must ensure that all products used for the dogs have not expired in order to support the health
and well-being of the animals. At the time of the inspection the licensee re-labeled the bottle so that it will not be
used for the puppies.
2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has two small bottles that each have a hand written label. The label on the first bottle says
"Tranquilizer, name of the veterinary clinic, exp. 01-03-18". The label on the second bottle says "Tranquilizer, name
and address of the veterinary clinic, 1cc/10#, exp. 03-18". The licensee stated that he did not know what the actual
product was inside the bottles.
Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information (name of product and active ingredient,
strength of the product) in order to ensure they are administered appropriately to the animal (dosage, route of
administration and frequency).
Medical products used as tranquilizers could be controlled substances and if it is administered by an individual whois not a veterinarian or directly supervised by a veterinarian, than the individual’s training should be documented
and approved by the attending veterinarian as part of the facility’s program of veterinary care.
Therefore, the licensee must document in writing that they have been adequately trained by the attending
veterinarian on the use of the tranquilizer to ensure proper dosing rates and administration in order to protect the
health and welfare of the dogs. Written documentation of such training must be provided upon request.
The licensee also said that he has a stethoscope and has been taught by the attending veterinarian how to listen to
the dog's heart rate after it has been tranquilized. The licensee must also have written guidance from the attending
veterinarian on the training he has received and any further training on appropriately monitoring vital signs, handling
of the animals during and after administration, recognizing when medical intervention is necessary and determine
what steps to take.

3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An enclosure containing two Golden Retrievers has a sheltered area constructed of cattle panels. One dog was
observed sticking his head through the openings of the panel. The dog's head could become entrapped in the
openings resulting in a possible injury.
There are two enclosures containing Cocker spaniels. The slated floors in these enclosures are broken resulting in
holes in the flooring. One hole located near the food receptacle is large enough for a dog's foot to possibly pass
through it which could result in injury. There is a total of nine dogs housed in these enclosures.
Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept
in good repair, protect the animals from injury and contain the animals securely. The licensee must modify the
cattle panel in a manner that will not allow the dog to put his head through any openings. The licensee must also
replace the damaged flooring or alter it in a manner that ensures that it is safe for the dogs. The licensee must
ensure that all enclosures are kept in good repair and contain the animals safely and securely at all times.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the whelping areas in the basement each enclosure contains a whelping box constructed of wood. In one
enclosure, containing one adult dog, the top edges of the whelping box has been excessively chewed andshredded. In at least four enclosures, containing a total of fifteen dogs, the upper edge of the plastic water bowl has
been excessively chewed and shredded. Chewed and damaged surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized
which could increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned
and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace the chewed surfaces or alter them
in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitizing of the surfaces.
Correction date: April 15, 2017
3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the two enclosures containing four adult Golden Retrievers the sheltered areas each contain one food bowl. At
least one bowl has mouse feces mixed in to the dog food. When the inspectors crouched down to examine the food
bowl they smelled a strong odor of mouse urine. Mouse feces were also observed along the interior frame work of
the sheltered area. At the time of the inspection there was not pest control for these enclosures. Contamination by
mice could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.
An effective program for the control of insects, birds, and mammals that are pests, must be established and
maintained by the licensee in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs and to reduce contamination by
pests in animal areas.
