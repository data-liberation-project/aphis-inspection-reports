2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Three IACUC approved protocols did not contain a complete description of the proposed use of animals. It is the
responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that the investigator provides a complete description of proposed activities
that involve the use of animals in order that these activities may be adequately reviewed and determined to be in
accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. A system should be in place to ensure that a complete description of each
procedure is provided to the IACUC.
To be corrected from this day forward
An exit briefing was conducted with facility representatives.
