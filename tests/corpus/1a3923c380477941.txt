2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
During inspection, 2 animals were identified with conditions requiring veterinary consultation:
A male Red Coati had lesions on the soles of 3 feet. The lateral toe of the right hind foot appeared swollen, and the sole
had an area, approximately 0.5 inches long, that was oval in shape, flattened, red and irritated. The lateral toe of the right
front foot similarly was swollen with a pea sized red, irritated, flattened area on the sole. Four Smaller red lesions were
seen on the sole of the left front foot located mainly on the thumb, lateral finger, and palm area. The region surrounding all
the affected areas were white.
The male capybara had some thinning of the hair over the mid-section of his spine, the affected area comprising
approximately 1/3 of his back. At the bottom of the hair thinning section, about at the hip area, there were 2 circular
lesions, stacked one below the other, approximately 0.5 inches in diameter each. The top lesion was white with a mild
scab while the bottom lesion was moderately ulcerated and crusty. An approximately 1.5-inch-long area of hair loss could
also be seen on the left side of his face, below his eye.
The licensee had not identified the conditions affecting these two animals, therefore had not contacted the veterinarian for
guidance on care. Failure to promptly identify injuries delays treatment and may cause undue pain and distress in animals
with such conditions. A more rigorous method of daily observation of all animals must be implemented to properly assess


their health and well-being. Direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is required for timely
diagnosis and adequate medical attention. The veterinarian must be consulted in order to establish a treatment plan for
the Red Coati and Capybara mentioned above. To be corrected by March 30, 2022.
2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
Pulling up to the facility there were 3 sheep, 2 goats and a mouflon observed along the road outside of their primary
enclosure fencing . The owner stated that he forgot to close the fence and therefore, the animals got out. This handling
mistake could have resulted in animal escape or grave injury from vehicles on the road. The handling of all animals shall
be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, and
unnecessary discomfort. Correct by April 6, 2022.

Housing facilities, general.
The lemur enclosure with four moms and two babies had a heating lamp in their den box. The cord to the den box was
partially inside of their enclosure without a protectant or covering and the heating lamp did not have a mesh cover to
prevent the animals from touching the bulb. Also, the fencing panels used to construct their enclosure had gaps between
the wires large enough for the babies to get out. The owner stated that at five weeks of age he would immediately pull the
babies from the moms but if the animals decide to leave mom earlier, they could potentially escape. Lemurs could chew
or pull unprotected electrical cords and come in contact with exposed heating lamps which both could result in grave
injuries. The large gaps between the wires of the fencing can result in injury or escape of the baby lemurs The housing
facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so to protect the animals from injury and to contain
the animals securely. Correct by April 6, 2022.

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The non-human primate enrichment plan for the lemurs was incomplete and did not describe:
- The specific provisions in place to address the social needs of this species known to exist in social groups in nature.
- The special attention provided to the 1-year-old female lemur named Tink who is being hand-reared by the licensee,
individually housed and unable to hear and see non-human primates of her own or compatible species.
A well-documented and complete enrichment plan covering social grouping provisions as well as special attention
provided to singly housed individuals is extremely important to ensure the psychological well-being of the non-human
primates. The facility must develop in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards and as directed by
the attending veterinarian a plan for environmental enhancement that addresses social needs, environmental enrichment,
special considerations and restraint devices. To be corrected by April 8, 2022.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
During the inspection one of three kinkajous were trying to get out of its enclosure and became lodged in between the
fencing. The animal was able to get three quarters of his body through and was observed becoming frustrated as he
struggled to get free. Since the animal can’t be handled the owner was unable to assist him immediately. Eventually, the
animal was able to back out of the fencing without any apparent injuries. The animal should not be able to get its body
through the fencing for its safety and to keep the animal contained. The kinkajou’s enclosure must be constructed to
contain the animal and to protect the animal from injury.

The kinkajou’s den box contains three kinkajous. The den box has been missing its fourth leg and the nails have been
protruding from the structure. The owner was asked to put his weight on the den box to check its sturdiness. It was
observed that the leg perpendicular to the missing leg was not supporting the structure at all. The left back leg and front


right leg were holding up the structure along with the perching branch going across the front holding it up against the
panel fencing keeping it upright. The den box was not secured properly, and the opening is not appropriate for the
animals’ paws. The den box must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

The singly housed red mountain coatimundi’s den box had become unhinged and dropped allowing it to be wedged in
between the panels and platforms, which obstructed the animal from getting out. The owner stated it occurred over the
weekend. Once the den box was removed and put on the floor, inspectors witnessed the coati getting into the enclosure
displaying how the weight of the animal’s body on the straight-edged opening could cause injury to the paws . The den
box is not properly secured to the enclosure to stay elevated and the edges of the opening of the den is not constructed to
protect the animal from injury. The facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriated for
the animals involved.

In several areas along the primary enclosures’ fencing containing the capybara, goats, sheep, and mouflon there was
significant space that allowed the animals to go under it. Inspectors observed the male goat going under the fencing
during the inspection. The owner stated that he thought the capybaras were getting out by going under the fencing as
well, which could possibly attribute to the hair loss and abrasions on the capybara’s back. The fencing should not allow
the animals to get out contradicting its purpose to contain the animals appropriately and protect the animals from injury.

In the primary enclosure for the capybara, goats, sheep, and mouflon there was a pile of discarded wooden pallets with
exposed nail heads. There were also holes in the ground at the entrance of the natural spring that constantly gets
washed out and was being filled with scrap concrete and construction materials with some contents having metal stakes


and rebar still attached to it. On the opposite side of the pond within the enclosure there was a plastic barrel that was the
remains from a broken platform that has not yet been removed. The animal’s primary enclosure has many items in it that
isn’t specifically for the animals and isn’t safe for the animals. The holes need to be filled with appropriate materials to
prevent injury.

An African crested porcupine had chewed the shade cloth that covered both their enclosure along with the white-nosed
coatimundi’s enclosure. Shredded pieces of the tarp could be seen along the inside and outer edge of the animal’s
primary enclosure. Inspectors observed a capybara chewing a similar tarp during the inspection. Other animals that have
access to this enclosure could possibly ingest the scattered materials along with the African crested porcupines. The
animals’ facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility is currently housing several animals outdoors but does not have a perimeter fence of sufficient height in place.
His inventory includes coatimundis, ring tailed lemurs, kinkajous, capybaras, African crested porcupines, and a kangaroo,
all of which require a 6-foot perimeter fence. The perimeter fence currently in place has a height of approximately 3 to 4
feet on 3 sides and approximately 5 feet on the back side. At the time of inspection, 2 capybaras were given access to a
primary enclosure adjacent to the road that was not surrounded by a perimeter fence. The lack of an adequate perimeter
fence presents a safety risk to the animals within the facility in that there isn’t an adequate secondary containment system
to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or a sufficient barrier to keep animals and unauthorized persons
out. The facility must ensure that the above listed animals being housed outdoors are enclosed by a 6-foot perimeter
fence at least 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosures. To be corrected by July 22, 2022.
3.131(a)



Sanitation.
There was an excessive amount of feces on the floor of the enclosure housing three kinkajous. Feces could be seen
dispersed throughout the entire floor with most of the accumulation located in the area in front of the kinkajous’ shelter. A
large amount of the feces was old, dry, and disintegrating into a crumbly mass. The licensee explained that the enclosure
was vacant until that morning but since the gate was left open, the goats came in and defecated there. The feces wasn’t
removed and the enclosure was not cleaned prior to introducing the kinkajous to the enclosure. Excessive excreta can
lead to odors, the spread of disease, attract vermin and overall animal discomfort. Enclosures must be cleaned, and
excreta removed in between occupancy as well as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained
therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. To be corrected by March 30, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
