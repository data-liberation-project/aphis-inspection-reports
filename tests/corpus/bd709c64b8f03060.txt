2.50(a)

Time and method of identification.
There are dogs on the premises that are not correctly identified.
-In the second building inspected, there is a litter of 5 dogs that the licensee states are about 5 months of age. These
dogs have no individual identification.
-In third building inspected, there are three Cavalier King Charles Spaniels that are 11 weeks and being housed with two
other dogs who are not from their litter. These dogs do not have individual identification.
-In the 4th building inspected there are 2 weaned puppies not being housed with their dam. These puppies do not have a
cage card or other individual identification.
Correct identification of dogs facilitates the inspection process and assists in the tracking of movement of regulated dogs.
The licensee must identify all live dogs on the premises. To be corrected by 8 June 2022.
2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The inventory for dogs at this facility is incomplete.
-The licensee stated that she is missing 3 pages from the documents presented for acquisition of dogs on hand. This
document showed 112 dogs present and there were 167 dogs inspected.


-There is incomplete acquisition information (addresses and USDA license number or vehicle license number) for many of
the dogs.
-There are no identification numbers listed for all puppies born and sold on the list maintained for the inventory
requirements.
Incomplete record keeping interferes with the tracking of movements of covered dogs and interferes with the inspection
process. The licensee must make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning each dog or cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her
possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer
or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her
control. To be corrected by 8 June 2022.
3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
An open bag of food was being stored in the 4th building inspected. Open bags of food are at risk for contamination. The
licensee must ensure that all open supplies of food and bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting
lids to prevent contamination and spoilage. To be corrected by 31 May 2022.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There are 15 "self-feeder" food receptacles in the 4th building inspected that have a buildup of food debris in storage
section of the receptacle. Build-up of food debris can lead to spoilage or contamination of food. The licensee must ensure
that food and water receptacles for dogs and cats be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods
prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food
waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. To be corrected by 8 June 2022.


3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee has recently acquired a new attending veterinarian and has not developed a written program of veterinary
care with the new attending veterinarian. The lack of a program of veterinary care leaves the facility without direction and
oversight to provide adequate veterinary care and to meet the husbandry needs of the animals. The licensee must follow
an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and signed by the attending
veterinarian. Dealers must keep and maintain the written program and make it available for APHIS inspection. The written
program of veterinary care must address the requirements for adequate veterinary care for every dealer in § 2.40 of this
subchapter. To be corrected by 8 June 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with state inspectors and the licensee.
