Notification of change of operation.
On the morning of July 11, 2022, I drove to the address that the registrant submitted on her application. The person who
answered the door indicated that the registrant did not live at this residence. I drove to the address the complainant
provided and found the registrant. She said she had moved but did not notify Animal Care of her change of address.

It is important to update any change of operations by certified mail to Animal Care, 2150 Centre Ave., Mailstop 3W11, Fort
Collins, CO 80526. This helps our program to enforce the Animal Welfare Regulations in an efficient and cost effective
manner.

A registrant shall notify the Deputy Administrator by certified mail of any change in the name, address, or ownership, or
other change in operations affecting its status as an exhibitor, carrier, or intermediate handler, within 10 days after making
such change.

Contingency planning.
On the inspection conducted on July 11, 2022, the registrant did not have a written or otherwise documented contingency
plan available for inspection.

A contingency plan needs to be available on inspection to insure that a plan has been thought out and would be
implemented in case of vehicle mechanical/power breakdown, accidents, animal escapes, or natural disasters most likely
to be experienced. This planning and implementation helps to minimize the number of adverse effects on
the health and well-being of animals in an emergency event or disaster.

Dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to
provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and care of their animals in the event of an
emergency or disaster.
