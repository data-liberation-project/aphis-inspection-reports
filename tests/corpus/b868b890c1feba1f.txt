FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The hotwires for 2 enclosures (one housing 2 black bears and a second housing one black) were not functional
at the time of this inspection. The facility employee stated that the bears ripped down the hotwires approximately 10
days ago.
These hotwires are in need of repair or replacement. These serve as added means of containment for the
enclosures. The facility must ensure that all animal enclosures are maintained to adequately contain the animals
and protect them from injury.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED
3.127(c) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The enclosures for the lion named Dandy, the tiger Peaches, the tiger Tonka, and the ligers Kira and Mika are
excessively muddy and have standing water around the perimeters. All of these big cats have muddy feet and legs
up to the hocks and elbows. The lion Dandy is also muddy on his chest and abdomen. The only dry are for these
animals are their shelter boxes. This does not allow these animals the ability to remain clean and dry. These
enclosures require additional substrate or drainage to ensure the enclosures provide the animals a dry area. The
weather has included rain in the past couple days: however, the licensee must ensure all animals have the option to
remain dry and are provided an area to remain clean and dry if they choose. Currently, the animals are forced to
walk in mud and water to perform any normal activities including urination and defecation. This can be stressful on
the animal and may also expose them to unnecessary disease hazards. Correct this by providing enclosures that
allow the animals to remain clean and dry during all times of the year.
Correct by: 5 pm on 3/20/16**Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility employees.
This inspection did not include records.
