Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
*** A female pig in the animal adventure area still has overgrown hooves. Overgrown hooves can be painful and may lead
to lameness issues. The facility representative stated on this inspection that the attending veterinarian examined this
animal a few days after the last inspection. USDA inspector confirmed that visit with the veterinary clinic staff. When
asked, the facility representative stated that they have not had time to trim the pig's hooves since the last inspection.
Failure to provide adequate veterinary care for this pig may lead to pain and suffering in the animal. Correct this by
ensuring the attending veterinarian is contacted concerning the condition of this pig and following all recommended
treatments or procedures.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
This facility does not have accurate records for the 8 pigs on hand. The facility representative stated that these pigs were
brought to the facility by an employee and she has not added them to the on-hand records. A facility of this size, which
has frequent animal movements and births, must ensure that records are maintained to disclose the information required
in this section for accurate record keeping practices. This is especially important in the event of a disease outbreak.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
