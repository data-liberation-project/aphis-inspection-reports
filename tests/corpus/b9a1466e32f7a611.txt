FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The winter housing stall for the porcupines needs to be addressed. There are several uncovered outlets in the
enclosure that are active that the animals can have contact with and there are several sections of paneling that are
being chewed and peeled away from the wall. These areas of concern need to be maintained in good repair for the
safety of the animals.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
*** The prairie dogs are housed in an enclosure that is fully enclosed with two vents on the side walls in an indoor
building kept at 78 deg F. When the door was opened to examine the animals, the air was very stale with no air
movement. Some method of ventilation needs to be in place to move air around the enclosure for the health of the
animals.
