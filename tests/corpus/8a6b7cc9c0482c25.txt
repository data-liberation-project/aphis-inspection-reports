Facilities, general.
In the zebu pasture, there is a shelter with torn and bent metal siding. The left wall of the shelter is comprised of four
metal panels attached to the underlying wood supports. The lower front panel has a large hole about 2-3' wide with sharp
metal edges bent in multiple different directions. The lower back panel has a smaller hole, about 2-4" wide with sharp,
bent edges. The facility representative covered the outside of the shed with a panel to prevent the animals from putting
their heads through the holes, however, the jagged edges on the inside of the building are still present.
Structures or shelters in disrepair with sharp metal edges can cause injury or harm to the animals.
Correct by covering, replacing, or removing the jagged edges of the shelter to ensure that the housing facility is
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
Behind the pig shelter and adjacent to the feed storage area, there are various remnants of an old structure on the
ground. The remnants include wooden boards with nails protruding, pieces of barbed wire, and wire panel fencing.
Additionally, there are several feed bags and other equipment covering the floor of the feed storage area which make it
difficult to observe the areas surrounding the food storage containers.


Accumulations of trash and other materials in the buildings or on the grounds can cause injury to the animals and make it
difficult to facilitate husbandry practices or pest control.
Correct by ensuring that the buildings and grounds are kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from
injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
