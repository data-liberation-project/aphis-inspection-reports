ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 0830 on
21-Sep-16.
Inspector arrived at facility site at 0830, but the door was locked and there was no response when the bell was rung.
Attempted to call the phone number but apparently that line is no longer functional. There was another phone
number on the door of the facility, so that was called. This led to an automated phone directory - message was left
at a specific extension. Waited for approximately 1 hour but there was no response. A second phone call was
placed at 1330 hours and another message left on the main line. Returned to facility site at approximately 1530
hours but the building was locked and there was no response to the bell. There were no return calls from the
facility.
