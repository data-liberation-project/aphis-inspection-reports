3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
One arctic fox chewed through a screen and escaped its enclosure. The facility is currently working to trap the fox. Three
Patagonian cavies dug under their enclosure fence and escaped their enclosure. The facility is currently working to
capture the cavies. Having enclosures from which animals can escape puts the animals at risk of injury, predation, and
malnutrition. Per the regulations, outdoor facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
