Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
On Wednesday, March 23, 2022 at approximately 10:00 am, the licensee refused to allow APHIS inspectors to complete
an animal welfare inspection. The licensee was home but stated he was too busy for inspection as he had to pick up
someone to help his wife and had to donate blood in the afternoon. He had left a message with the inspector the previous
week stating he would be available Wednesday and Thursday before noon. He left a message today again stating his
hours of availability were Wednesday and Thursday before noon. The inspectors informed the licensee he would be cited
for a refusal and he said that was acceptable to him.

The exit briefing was conducted with the licensee and the report was given to the licensee's wife.

Additional Inspectors:
ROBERT MARKMANN, ANIMAL CARE INSPECTOREnd Section
