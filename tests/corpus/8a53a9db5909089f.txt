FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** On October 17, 2015 at approximately 1:00 pm a giraffe had gotten its head caught in a gate separating two
paddocks. The staff allowed the animal to try and free itself without intervention for 45 - 60 minutes. At this time a
park guest had spooked the animal causing it distress and at that point the attending veterinarian decided to sedate
the animal. After the animal was sedated the staff proceeded to support the animal using a rope to harness its rear
end and neck. At this point the animal started to go down prompting the veterinarian to reverse the sedative. In the
meantime the facility used a battery operated reciprocating saw to free the animal and the animal went down in
sternal position. The facility reversed the sedative two more additional times because the animal was unable to
stand. Over the course of the next 2 to 2.5 hours the animal attempted to stand but was unable to. At approximately
5:00 pm the animals condition started to deteriorate. The attending veterinarian decided at about 5:30 to euthanize
the animal. The gate was immediately removed after the animal was freed. The gate that the animal had trapped its
head in was not designed appropriately for this species and could not prevent the animals from injuring themselves.
The enclosure must be constructed and designed to protect the animals from injury. The facility corrected the
problem by removing the gate immediately after the animal was freed.

** During the inspection as I walked up to the giraffe feeding station I saw two park guests feeding a giraffe. Further
down the walkway within the barrier fence, approximately 30 feet away, there was a public attendant not paying
attention to the guest. Another public attendant at the goat feeding and petting station was very attentive and
properly monitoring her area being very aware of the animals and the public. It was stated that they should be
monitoring their areas as the latter demonstrated and that this was more of an employee issue. The giraffe feeding
station attendant was not monitoring the area as instructed. This was corrected when the Director instructed the
employee to move closer to the station once it was addressed by the inspector.
The Director refused to sign the inspection report as instructed by their Corporate office. The report was left with the
Director.This was a focused inspection of the giraffe incident.
The inspection was conducted with the Director and Attending Veterinarian. The exit interview was conducted with
the Director.
