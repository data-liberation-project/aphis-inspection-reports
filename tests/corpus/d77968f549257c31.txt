3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are four outdoor enclosures without adequate wind and rain break at the entrances to the shelter structures.
Failure to provide a barrier from the wind and rain (or other weather conditions) can result in a dog that becomes
wet and uncomfortable. In some weather, a dog that does not have a barrier from the elements is unable to
maintain a safe body temperature. All dogs must be provided with shelter from the elements which includes wind
and rain breaks at the entrance to shelter structures. This was corrected during the inspection.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At the time of inspection, one outdoor enclosure contained six small breed dogs that had access to one shelter
structure. This one shelter structure did not provide enough space for all of the dogs to access the shelter.
Inadequate shelter structures allow the dogs to be exposed to the elements which can result in discomfort from wet
conditions and temperature extremes. The licensee must ensure that outdoor facilities for dogs or cats include one
or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal in each outdoor facility, and that are large enough to
allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. This was
corrected during the inspection.
3.6(a)(2)(ii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A can of spray paint was located on the floor of one enclosure housing 3 dogs. Chemicals in contact with the dogs
could cause injury. A method shall be developed to keep chemicals away from the dogs. This was corrected during
the inspection.
3.6(a)(2)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Dogs were observed squeezing back and forth through openings in the divider fence between two enclosures. Dogs could injure themselves squeezing through the holes in the fence, expose them to incompatible dogs, or
access enclosures that do not meet their needs. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so dogs
are securely contained. This fence was repaired at the time of the inspection.
3.6(b)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are four cat enclosures that do not have an elevated resting surface. The use of elevated resting surfaces
satisfies a behavioral preference for many cats. The licensee must ensure that each primary enclosure housing cats
must contain a resting surface or surfaces that, in the aggregate, are large enough to hold all the occupants of the
primary enclosure at the same time comfortably. The resting surfaces must be elevated, impervious to moisture,
and be able to be easily cleaned and sanitized, or easily replaced when soiled or worn. Corrected during the
inspection.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an excessive accumulation of feces in one enclosure. These feces were piled in front of one dog shelter
which required the dogs in this enclosure to walk through to access the shelter. Excessive accumulation of feces
can increase the disease transmission risk as well as soil the dogs. Feces must be removed from primary
enclosures on a daily basis. These feces were removed at the time of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
