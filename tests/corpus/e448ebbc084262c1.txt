2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Male Cavalier dog #56 was found with signs of significant dental disease. This dog has tartar build-up on both
upper and lower arcades of teeth on both sides of its mouth. In addition, there is gum recesssion on both sides of
the upper premolars. The gums are also reddened in the areas of gum recession. This dog requires veterinary
attention. The licensee must have this dog examined by the attending veterinarian to determine needed veterinary
care. Failure to provide veterinary care for dental problems can lead to various health problems and can be painful
to the dog. The licensee must follow recommended treatment and maintain records of such exam and treatments
for future inspection by APHIS officials.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLAINT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The outdoor wash downs on both sides of the main kennel continue to have an excessive accumulation of feces
and staining. The licensee stated that these are being cleaned twice weekly. It is obvious by the condition if these
washdowns today that they are not being cleaned as often as necessary to satisfy accepted husbandry standards.
The licensee must ensure that these washdowns are cleaned as often as necesssary to reduce disease hazards,
minimize odors, and satisfy accepted standards. Correct this by cleaning and maintaining these areas on a more
frequent basis.
THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS UNCORRECTED
