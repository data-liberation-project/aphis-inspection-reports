FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure containing seven elk and four deer is constructed of woven wire fencing. Along multiple areas of the
fencing the woven wire has broken creating sharp points at the level of the animals. A fence post from a previous
project is lying in the enclosure and has a section of woven wire attached to it. This section of wire is creating sharp
points that the animals could come into contact with as they move around the fence post. Sharp points could
increase the risk of injury to the animals.
Outdoor housing facilities must be kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury. The facility must remove
the sharp points or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury risk towards the animals. The facility must
ensure that the fencing remains in good repair at all times.
