3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are six metal feeders which have rusted away leaving sharp metal edges at the interior portion that the
rabbits eat out of. These feeders need to be replaced so that they are structurally sound and then maintained in
good repair to protect the rabbits from injury, to contain them, and to keep predators out.
