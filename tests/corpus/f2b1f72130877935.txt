RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection on February 26, 2014, records of animal births and deaths were not maitained for the
guinea pigs. Records must be kept on guinea pigs for animal tracking, assessment of the animal care program, and
to comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. The licensee must ensure that records on animal births and deaths
are kept and maintained.
Correct from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
