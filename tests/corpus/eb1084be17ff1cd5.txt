3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- In the outdoor portion of the sheltered part of the kennel, there was an excessive accumulation of feces in the
cages and in the wash down below the runs. This affected the majority of the runs. Waste accumulation increases
the risk of contamination to the dogs, and also creates noxious odors that are an attractant to flies and other pests.
Excreta must be removed from the enclosures every day, and the wash downs must be cleaned as often as needed
to prevent excessive accumulation of waste.
