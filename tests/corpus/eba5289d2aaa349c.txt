HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The feed storage area for non-human primates had rodent droppings on and around the feed sacks. There was an
excessive amount of spilled grain on the floors and shelves. During the inspection we saw two mice run out of the
area where the feed is stored. No evidence of pest control could be found under the shelves or around the feed
storage. Rodents and pests (vermin) must not have access to stored feed as vermin can contaminate feed.
Contaminated feed can make many animals sick. The feed storage area must be maintained clean. Effective
measures to control pests must be put in place.
Correct by 5/8/15.

WATERING.
The nonhuman primates housed indoors were observed to have empty water bottles during inspection (except for
the squirrel monkeys by the door and a ruffed lemur). After the water bottles were filled, we observed that each
affected animal immediately went to the water bottles and were drinking non-stop for more than a minute each.
Some animals (patas monkeys and 2 spider monkeys) were observed to empty the filled water bottle and then
continue to drink after it was filled a second time. The animal keeper said that bottles were last filled yesterday
morning (at least 24h prior to our inspection). The amount of time the animals drank suggested that they were very
thirsty. Lack of adequate water for non-human primates can cause them discomfort and lead to serious health
problems. The non-human primates must either have a continuous supply of water available to drink or water must
be offered twice daily for at least 1 hour each time.
Correct immediately.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The enclosure housing two snow macaques had about six inches of soiled material underneath it. The material
contained soiled bedding, feed, old fruit, feathers and other material. There was a strong ammonia odor in the backroom around this enclosure. Strong odors from soiled material can cause animals to get sick. Soiled material must
be removed daily from inside of non-human primates' enclosures and the area underneath and around the
enclosure must be cleaned often enough to prevent odors, disease hazards, insects, and pests.

SANITATION.
*In the barn there is a white deer being housed in a stall. The bedding was observed to be completely soiled with no
dry spot available for the deer to lie down. The zookeeper reported that the stall is cleaned once a week and the
reason for the filthy stall was due to the deer spilling her water bucket.
*In another area of the barn there is a capybara being housed in a stall. The stall was observed to have two large
piles of excreta with what appeared to be mold growing on it. The zookeeper reported that the stall was last cleaned
about two weeks ago.
Excessive animal excreta/waste and soiled bedding in enclosures increases the risk of disease in the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned regularly and frequently to decrease the risk of disease and provide for the overall
health and wellbeing of the animals.
