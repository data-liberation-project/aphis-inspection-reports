3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
(a) Cleaning of enclosures.
***In the Bear enclosure the waste material drain was full of liquid, shavings and fecal material. Waste materials that
are not removed from the enclosures can soil the animals and increase the risk of disease by attracting pest and
providing a harboring place for them. The licensee must remove the waste material from the enclosure and assure
that all enclosures are cleaned as required.
This was a focus inspection.
The inspection was conducted with the facility representative.
The exit conference was conducted with the licensee via telephone.
End of report.
