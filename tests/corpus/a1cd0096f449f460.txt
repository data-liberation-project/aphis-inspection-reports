2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** The petting zoo did not have a public attendant present during the inspection while the park was opened. There
was a woman taunting the llama. The public attendants were inside the barn periodically checking the petting zoo
area. It was noticed by an attendant that the woman was aggravating the animal but nothing was mentioned to stop
the interaction. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all
times during periods of public contact. The facility immediately assigned a public attendant to the petting zoo area.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** There was a young goat that was outside of the outdoor primary enclosure. The goat was placed back in the
enclosure by an employee only to escape through the paneling on the gate. The enclosure must be constructed of
such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. Please repair the gate to properly
contain the animals.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the curator.
