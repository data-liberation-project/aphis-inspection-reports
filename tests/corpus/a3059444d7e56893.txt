ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 on
03-Jan-18.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 12:00pm and knocked on the door. There was no answer. I called the
primary number listed on the account and spoke with the licensee's wife. She stated that he was out delivering
rabbits and would not be back until close to 4pm.
