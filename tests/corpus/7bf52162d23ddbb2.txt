2.131(d)(4)

Handling of animals.
The facility exhibits animals to the public, allows public feeding and is advertising that visitors may bring treats to feed to
the animals during their visits. Allowing visitors to feed food that they bring to the animals does not ensure that only
wholesome food and food appropriate to the species is being fed. Discontinue advertising that visitors may bring food to
feed the animals on exhibit and only allow public feeding of animals with food provided by the facility. Corrected at the
time of inspection.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The facility allows 19 fox to be housed outdoors in 4 pens. These 4 pens do not have a perimeter fence that entirely
surround the pens or the property. Lack of a secondary containment system in the form of a perimeter fence does not
ensure that animals are contained and does not prohibit entry of animals and unauthorized persons from the enclosures.
Establish a perimeter fence around the 4 outdoor pens. Correct by: 1 January 2022
