3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Two metal doors, several metal enclosure panels and the back wall of the Shelter Kennel building had an
accumulation of brown to black debris or grime on their surfaces. This indicates that daily spot cleaning and
required sanitation are not taking place. Thus, this can increase the disease potential for the seven adult dogs.
For the prevention of an accumulation of waste on the surfaces and disease hazards, all surfaces must be
spot-cleaned daily and have required sanitation.

3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There was stagnant waste water around the edge of the concrete flooring for the shelter kennel housing 11 adult
dogs. This waste water was brown to green in color and had numerous insects on the surface of the waste water.
Infestation of vermin, pests and insects , along with odors can be present with waste water that is not rapidly
eliminated. Thus, this can increase the disease hazards for the dogs.
For the prevention of an infestation of vermin, pests, insects, odors and disease hazards, all waste, waste water and
drainage systems must rapidly eliminate waste or waste water.
