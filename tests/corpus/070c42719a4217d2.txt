FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The goats were released from their primary enclosure to graze in the woods next to their enclosure. The goats
were free ranging about 50 yards away from a busy major roadway. These goats must be contained to prevent
possible injury or death that could result from being struck by a car. This must be immediately corrected by
returning the goats to their enclosure.
Correct by: Corrected at the time of inspection.
