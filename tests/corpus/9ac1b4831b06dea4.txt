Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The facility's environmental enhancement plan does not include special considerations for infant and juvenile nonhuman
primates or nonhuman primates that are unable to see and hear other nonhuman primates of their own or compatible
species. The facility is currently hand raising a juvenile ring-tailed lemur which is housed indoors adjacent to a sloth.
During the inspection the animal appeared healthy, however, there were no special considerations documented for this
juvenile, singly housed nonhuman primate.
Certain nonhuman primates at various life stages or in certain circumstances require special attention regarding
environmental enhancement to ensure the psychological well-being of the animals when they are separated from a social
environment.
Exhibitors, as directed by the attending veterinarian, must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for
environmental enhancement which includes special considerations for infant and young juveniles and individually housed
nonhuman primates that are unable to see and hear nonhuman primates of their own or compatible species.
