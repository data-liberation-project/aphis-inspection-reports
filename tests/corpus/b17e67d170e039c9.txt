Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
-The licensee has an enclosure used to hold hamsters sorted for euthanasia. Two hamsters were found dead in this
enclosure on inspection. The licensee stated that hamsters are sorted, and then euthanized once a week.
-The licensee acquired two guinea pigs approximately one week ago. The licensee has been treating two guinea pigs
with Fungisan for patches of hair loss, with scaly and scabby skin.

Daily observation of all animals is required. If daily observations are accomplished by someone other than the attending
veterinarian a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian;

Animals held for euthanasia must be euthanized promptly to ensure their death is humane. If problems of health are
noted by the licensee they must be communicated with the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment to ensure the
health of the animals.
