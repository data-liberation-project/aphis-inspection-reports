Facilities, general.
There was a dismantled wooden spool and a free section of fence found loose on the ground in the bovine enclosure.
One of the spool ends had four long metal screws sticking up from the wood. There were also several wooden segments
from the dismantled spool in the enclosure. The pen enclosed one bovid.



Keeping fencing secured and extraneous items out of the enclosure minimizes the risk of injury to the enclosed animal(s).

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor
and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.

Corrected at time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the General Manager.
