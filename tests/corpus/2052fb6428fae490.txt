ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
(2) The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the
availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care;
* A female Beagle ( no identification, BD: 7/13/09) was extremely thin. She had a tucked abdomen, ribs easily
palpable, veterbrae and shoulder blades prominent, and long bones could be seen. She also had a significant build
up of dark brown material on her canine and cheek teeth on both the upper and lower jaw. Poor body condition in
dogs can be due to inadequate nutrition, parasites, or other underlying medical problems. This dog needs to be
evaluated by a veterinarian and treatment plan administered as directed.

* A cream female Pekingese (# 4A6847731E) has a thick brown crusted right eye. The left eye is bulging with a dry
looking build up on it. This dog was evaluated by a veterinarian on 12-19-11 with advised treatment to apply eye
drops/ointment daily to the eye as needed. The attending veterinarian also noted the eye issues on 12-13-13.
Facility representative indicated that she was applying opthamic gel to the eye. The opthalmic gel was available at
the facility, however there was no treatment record available to indicate that the dogs eye was being treated, nor did
either eye appear to have been recently treated due to the dry matter on the left eye and the crust build up on the
right eye. This dog needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian and treatment plan administered as directed.
** To be corrected by 9/20/14
* Medical evaluation records for ten dogs were recorded to have tooth abcesses, and three dogs were noted to
need dental cleanings. These findings were documented by the attending veterinarian. When asked about the follow
up treatment for these diagnosed conditions, the facility representative indicated that no further treatment occurred.
Failure to provide follow up treatment as directed by the attending veterinarian for diagnosed conditions can cause
pain, stress, and allow progression of illness or disease. Licensee must develope and adhere to a dental routine
that will allow for dental treatment to occur in a timely manner to reduce health issues, minimize pain and stress and
improve the overall health of the dogs.** To be corrected by: 9/25/14
*** All medical records/treatment plans must be contain accurate and complete information about the affected dog
and be available for review by the inspector.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(f) Drainage and waste disposal
* A cream male Pekingese was housed in the same enclosure as a dead black and tan female Daschound (no
identification/"Tawnie Sue"). The enclosure was emitting a foul odor and when the enclosure door was opened, the
dead dog was discovered in various stages of decomposure. Facility representative was unaware of the deceased
dog. The dead dog must be removed immediately from animal areas to minimize stress and disease hazards to any
animal(s) within the enclosure/animal areas. * Deceased dog was immediately removed.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(a) Cleaning of primary enclosures.
* All the primary enclosures (containing 36 dogs, 15 puppies total) had an accumulation of more than a day's worth
of feces, hair, wet shredded newspaper, dirt, grime and left over dog food built up on the floor, walls and enclosure
sides. The dogs and puppies were seen walking on and through this build up of waste. This type of accumulation
can cause soiling of the dogs, odors, attract pests and other disease hazards. Licensee must remove all the organic
material and material waste daily or more often as necessary to prevent accumulaitons of any type to reduce
disease hazards, odors, prevent soiling of the dogs and allow for proper and effective sanitization procedures to
occur.** To be corrected by: 9/20/14
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(c) Housekeeping for premises.
* In the building housing the dogs, various enclosures had an accumulation of unused items: clippers, electric cords,
used syringes, empty bottles and various other items on top of them. These items were not involved in the daily
care of the animals. There was also a build up of dust, dirt and grime throughout the facility. This type of
environment may attract and house pests and increase disease hazards. The placement of these items also
minimizes observation of some of the dogs. Licensee must must keep the facility clean, relocate unused items/trash
to appropriate areas to facilitate cleaning, pest control and reduce other disease hazards for the dogs.
