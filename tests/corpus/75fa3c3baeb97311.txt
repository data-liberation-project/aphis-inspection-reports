3.56(b)(1)

Sanitation.
According to the facility animal records, sanitize rabbit cages was not documented every 30 days in August 2020,
November 2020 and April 2021. The checklist the facility uses to document rabbit care did not have the sanitize cages
dated and signed off on by the facility personnel for the three months identified. Sanitation of the primary enclosures
every 30 days minimizes disease hazards for the welfare of the rabbits.

Correct from this day forward.
