ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The approved written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) did not include llamas and deer. All covered species
should be addressed in the PVC to ensure the facility has a program to follow concerning the care of all the animals.
Failure to do so could adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals. A complete and accurate written
Program of Veterinary Care with consultation from the attending veterinarian must be in place.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-Wooden shelter boxes in the outdoor dog kennels for canines, (cid:28)Charlotte(cid:29) and (cid:28)Golden Retriever #1(cid:29) had large
openings or holes in the elevated, wood platform flooring inside these shelter structures. These openings are
located just inside the entrance and contain ragged, splintered wooden edges.
-The top of the entrance opening to the shelter box for canine, "Ashes" had heavily worn jagged edges. Also there
was a heavily, worn and ragged wooden platform in disrepair adjacent to this shelter box which had a hole/opening
in one corner with chewed, splintered edge pieces.
The facility owner stated that these dogs have created these large openings/holes in the shelter box'(cid:25)s flooring and
in the raised platforms from consistent chewing and digging. The large openings and splintered, jagged wood may
cause an animal to become injured or entrapped. Housing structures for dogs must be designed and constructed to
be structurally sound. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury. A system of
maintenance and repair of housing facilities must be in place.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The indoor cat area: All three rooms of this indoor facility had several cobwebs on ceilings and walls. There was abuildup of a dirty, brownish, oily grime on several ledges/sills and on lattice panel dividers in a room housing several
hairless (Sphynx) breed cats. One room contained a chair which was heavily worn with shredded fabric and
exposing the underlying foam-type cushioning. Animal areas inside of housing facilities and adjacent areas or
objects within animal areas must be kept clean to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. All surfaces that
come in contact with the cats must be spot-cleaned daily. These areas must be cleaned more frequently and
sanitized every two weeks.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The outdoor,dog kennel for a canine,(cid:29)Tula(cid:29), had several, exposed, protruding wires in an approximately 8 inch
section along a lower portion of the chain link fencing.The primary enclosures must be constructed, kept in good
repair and maintained to ensure no sharp points from protruding wires cause the animals to be injured,trapped, or
harmed. Licensee stated that "Tula" would be moved to a different enclosure until repairs are made to this kennel.
A system of maintenance and repair of all primary enclosures must be in place.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-A wooden den box used for a Lion, Zuma, had worn, ragged splintered edges with exposed nails along the bottom
portion of the entrance.
-Enclosure #17 housing a red fox contained a wooden den box with one side which has partially separated from a
corner. The separated wood panel is creating a protruding cornered, edge as well as a gap with exposed
underlying nails.
Sharp points from the exposed nails and splintered edges or gaps in the wood may pose a risk of harm or injury to
the animals. All parts of the primary enclosures must be constructed,kept in good repair and maintained to ensure
the safety and well-being of the animals. A system of maintenance and repair must be in place.

SANITATION.
A pen housing two llamas has an excessive buildup of excreta within the pen. Also, there was a large amount of
excreta piled up directly outside of and directly next to this pen which attracted an increased presence of flies to the
area. Excreta should be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained and to
reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of this enclosure should be more frequent andeffective to prevent the buildup of excreta.
Exit interview was conducted with facility representative, Dr. Jeffrey Lee, VMO and Dr. Tyler Fields, VMO.
