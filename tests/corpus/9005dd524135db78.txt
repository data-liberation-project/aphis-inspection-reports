1. Protocol #03167: The animal records for Guinea Pigs used under this protocol were reviewed during the
inspection. According to the records, injectable anesthetic and sedative had been administered to the animals for
an IACUC approved procedure. While the standardized dose was noted, the volume of each of the drugs
administered to the guinea pigs was not documented in the animal records by investigator.
Per this Section of the Regulations, all scientists and personnel involved in animal care should be trained in the
proper use of anesthetics, analgesics, and tranquilizers. The currently accepted veterinary medical standard when
performing anesthesia includes recording of the volume of anesthetic and sedative medications that were
administered to the animals.
The research facility needs to address this item identified for this protocol.
Correct by 8/14/15.
NOTE - Inspection conducted 6/29/15 and 6/30/15. Exit interview held on-site 6/30/15 with facility personnel.
