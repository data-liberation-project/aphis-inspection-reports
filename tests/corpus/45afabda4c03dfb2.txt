INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
On two IACUC approved protocols involving weanling cats and retired breeding male cats undergoing surgery, pain
medications were given, but they were not given at the dose and frequency described in the approved protocols.
Analgesics and anesthetic drugs should be given at the appropriate doses for each animal in order to ensure that
pain and distress associated with the procedures are minimized. The IACUC should approve these drug dosages
based on current veterinary care standards for each species and for the level of pain and/or distress that may be
experienced by the animals. The IACUC must ensure that the research personnel follow these approved dosages.
With respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall review proposals to
conduct activities involving animals, or to make a significant change in an ongoing activity involving animals,
Activities involving animals must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals.
To be corrected by 10/31/2014.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Improperly labeled and expired drugs intermingled with current supply in three different locations (2 locations in
Pathology building and one laboratory in Zoology building):
**Acepromazine expired 01-14
**Ketamine combined with Acepromazine in a vial which was not labeled with expiration date
**Beuthanasia D vial labeled "B9" with no corresponding log sheet for this vial which was opened and not full but 2
log sheets were found for "B8" vial of Beuthansia D
**AnaSed expired 10/13
**Acepromazine expired 11/13
The use of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice
and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when
expired drugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The research facilitymust ensure that all medications used have not gone past the recorded expiration date. Improperly labeled
compounded medications must be labeled with an expiration date and should be stored appropriately for all the
components to remain effective.
A better system for ensuring that all drugs and medical materials to be used in regulated animals are current,
labeled and stored properly, and that logs used to record and track the use of controlled substances are accurate
should be developed and implemented by the research facility.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Guinea pig ID# 126585 on an IACUC approved protocol was found by research staff on 7/26/2013 to be in poor
condition. The weekend staff did not report any concerns with this animal but it was found dead on 7/29/2014. This
guinea pig should have been evaluated to determine if euthanasia should be performed but it died without
appropriate assessment or intervention.

MISCELLANEOUS.
Two dog fights, one on/around 2/14/2014, involving two beagle dogs ID# 126111 and 126099, and one on
3/14/2014, involving two beagle dogs ID#'s 126114 (Blossom) and 126098 (Dolly), occurred during student
socialization sessions and resulted in injuries to all 4 dogs. The fights were reported to the LAR and the injuries
treated by LAR veterinarians.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in manner that does not cause
trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
To be corrected by 10/31/2014.
Accompanied on the inspection conducted on 6/17-19/2014 by facility representatives and two APHIS AC VMO's.
Redacted records for review by APHIS AC VMO's were requested and received between 6/19/2014 and 8/5/2014.Exit interview conducted with the Institutional Official and facility representatives on 6/19/2014.
