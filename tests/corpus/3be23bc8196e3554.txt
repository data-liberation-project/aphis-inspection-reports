The written program of veterinary care was not present at the time of this inspection. The continuation sheet to

2013. The complete written program of veterinary care must be present for traveling exhibitors to provide adequate
guidance to the animal care staff to maintain the health of the animals. The written veterinary program must be
available for APHIS officials during inspection so that the plan can be reviewed to determine if the program covers
the animals present and that the plan is being followed.
