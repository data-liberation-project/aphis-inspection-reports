CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***Within the sheltered buildings, at least four enclosures housing dogs had a build-up of dirt and grime on the in/out
doors. Dirt and grime on surfaces in contact with the dogs can harbor disease-causing organisms. The licensee
must ensure that primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris and other disease hazards. TO BE CORRECTED BY: January 29, 2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
