CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Hard surfaces inside the primary enclosures of the marmosets and tamarins are not being spot cleaned daily. These
enclosures are in need of cleaning to remove exceta from inside the enclosures on the enclosure bars, PVC pipe
tubes and cubes. The trays underneath the enclosures are being spot cleaned daily. Exceta has built up on some of
these enclosure items to the point of caking onto them such that the non-human primates can't avoid coming into
contact with the excreta when they use these items/move around the enclosure. Numerous small black gnat/fruit fly
like insects were noted in the building/enclosures. Excreta must to be removed regularly to prevent the nonhuman
primates from becoming soiled and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. All hard surfaces must be
spot-cleaned daily. Correct by 11/3/19.
