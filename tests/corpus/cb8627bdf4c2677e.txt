ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:00am on
30-Jan-18.
** I arrived at the facility at 9:00 am and called the owner. No one answered so I left a message that I was there to
conduct an inspection. I waited for 30 minutes and called again. There
was no answer. I left the facility at 9:30am.
