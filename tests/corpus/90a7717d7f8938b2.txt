ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 7 year-old, male fallow deer was observed to have a partial weight bearing lameness of the right hind limb with a
severely overgrown, cork-screw shaped hoof. Discussion with the attending veterinarian and veterinary records
review indicate that the deer sustained a severe injury to its right hind limb due to being caught in a fence on
03/05/2014. The attending veterinarian stated he is currently aware of the overgrown hoof however he does not
recommend hoof trimming at this time due to the stress of sedating this animal in the high, summer temperatures.
According to records, the deer has not received any pain relieving medications or treatments for its chronic
lameness condition.

Lameness along with severely, overgrown hooves often indicates pain and discomfort to the animals. Although this
animal has been examined by a veterinarian, there is currently no treatment plan in place to address any associated
pain or discomfort resulting from its condition.
The licensee must obtain an evaluation of this animal's current condition by a veterinarian which includes an
appropriate treatment plan for the issue cited above. The outcome of this consultation must be provided to the
inspector upon request, as well as a documented plan which addresses hoof care and ensures the relief of any
pain/discomfort. Additionally, any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log
and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when the medication is administered to the animals should be
included along with any follow-up instructions.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Goat enclosure: There was a wooden picnic table in disrepair with several protruding nail heads and sharp, nail
points. Also, there was an ice chest on top of this table with torn, plastic sides exposing two sharp, metal screws
and underlying foam material. Any foam-type objects may pose a risk of foreign body ingestion to the animals.Sheep enclosure: The wire fencing material in several areas of this enclosure had sharp points turned up and
protruding into the enclosure.
Zebra enclosure: There were a few metal livestock fence panels in disrepair resulting in protruding, sharp, metal
points/wires into the enclosure.
.
Sharp, protruding points or edges in areas of contact with the animals may lead to injury. All enclosures must be
kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges or other hazards in order to protect the animals from
injury and properly contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and maintenance must be in
place.
