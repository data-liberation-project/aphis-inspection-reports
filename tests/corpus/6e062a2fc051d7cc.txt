CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
"Echo" a 15 week old Mini Australian Shepard arrived SAN on Delta flight 1792 connecting from ATL and originated
from Columbus, MS on Delta flight 5372, on waybill #006 GTR 66087744. Echo's crate did not have a consignor's
declaration stating when the dog was last offered food and water, and instructions for feeding and watering during
transport. Failure to complete a written consignor's certification regarding feeding and watering could have a
negative impact on the well-being of the animal. The airline should ensure that complete information is provided on
each crate, by the consignor, prior to taking possession of the animal.
To be corrected from this time forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
"Echo" a 15 week old Mini Australian Shepard arrived SAN on Delta flight 1792 connecting from ATL and originated
from Columbus, MS on Delta flight 5372, on waybill #006 GTR 66087744. Echo is approximately 24 inches from
nose to base of tail and approximately 20 inches tall at the head when standing. The small airline compliant travel
crate Echo was in was only approximately 17 inches long, 13 inches tall and 12 inches wide for internal dimensions.
Echo was too big for the 100 series airline compliant primary enclosure. While standing, the dog's head was higher
than the crate, and the dog could not sit or lie comfortably in the crate. The length of the crate was also insufficient
for the length of the dog, and the water and food dishes loose inside the crate contributed to the lack of space.
Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats must be large enough to ensure that each animal
contained in the primary enclosure has enough space to turn about normally while standing, to stand and sit erect,
and to lie in a natural position.
To be corrected from this time forward.

FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
The food/water receptacle for a transport enclosure containing "Echo" a 15 wk old puppy (Delta airway bill 006 GTR66087744) was loose on the floor of the enclosure. The receptacle is not securely attached to the inside of the
primary enclosure so that it can be filled from the outside without opening the door. This could affect the health and
comfort of the puppy since feeding and watering cannot be accomplished from outside the crate and could result in
escape, if the door is opened to feed or water the animal.
Accept for transport only primary enclosures with securely attached food and water receptacles so that the animals
may be safely fed and watered without escaping their transport enclosure.
To be corrected from this time forward.
Exit interview conducted with facility representativie at the cargo terminal.
