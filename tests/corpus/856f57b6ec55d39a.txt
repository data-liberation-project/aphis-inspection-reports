2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*An adult female Beagle (m/c# 4812710C39) was missing a large amount of hair on her rump, tail, and chest. The
skin in these hairless areas on her rump and chest were moist, reddened, and had numerous tiny scabs. The skin
on her tail was dry and scaly. The licensee had not sought veterinary care for this dog and was not treating the skin
condition. Skin problems can be painful, may indicate an underlying medical condition, and can worsen with time.
The licensee must have this dog examined and treated by a veterinarian within 48 hours.

**The teeth of three dogs were examined during the inspection. A male Yorkshire terrier (m/c#494-151-7460) had
few teeth remaining, but there was a buildup of a hard, brown substance on the teeth he did have. A female
Maltese (m/c# 095 627 602) had a buildup of a hard, greenish-brown substance on her teeth that was so thick that
all the individual teeth could not be seen. A female Yorkshire terrier (m/c# 091 312 883) repetitively licked her lips
and moved her mouth. She had a severe buildup of hard brown material on her teeth; her gums were reddened
along her teeth. During the inspection, a molar tooth fell out of her mouth. Teeth and gum problems can be painful,
can affect the animal's ability to eat, and can result in tooth loss. The licensee stated that none of the dogs had
received dental care in two years even though the Attending Veterinarian had noted that 42 dogs needed dental
cleaning on his last visit to the facility. The licensee must establish an effective program of dental maintenance and
care.

***Several dogs had excessively long toenails: a female Beagle (m/c# 4812710C39), a female Beagle named
Biscuit (no other ID), a female Maltese (m/c# 095 627 602), and a female Maltese (m/c# 050304787). Excessively
long toenails can become entrapped and torn or can result in abnormally positioned toes, which is painful. The
licensee must establish an effective program of toenail maintenance.
3.3(c)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
One, of the two florescent lights in the indoor portion of the sheltered housing area is not working. There is not
sufficient light in this area of the facility to perform the daily tasks of caring for the dogs or to access their well-being.Adequate light is needed to maintain good housekeeping practices, adequately clean, adequately inspect the
animals, and for the well-being of the animals. The licensee shall provide adequate light to permit routine inspection
and cleaning of the facility, and observation of the dogs, as well as to provide a regular diurnal lighting cycle for the
dogs. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 8/11/2015
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was tall grass and weeds along the fence-line and around the edges of the outdoor housing areas. Tall grass
and weeds provide optimal breeding grounds for rodents and pests. The licensee shall control weeds, grasses, and
bushes so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control, and to protect the health and well-being of the
animals. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 8/11/2015
This inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
