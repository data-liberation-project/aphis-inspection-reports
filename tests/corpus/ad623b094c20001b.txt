2.40(b)(3) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult tri-color (tan, white, and black) in row A, rack 2, 5th enclosure from the top was observed with a severe head tilt.
The animal appeared lethargic and was hunched in the back corner. The animal did not attempt to move when touched.

One juvenile (brindle & tan) guinea pig in row A, rack 6, 2nd enclosure from the top was observed with hair loss on the left
side of the nose that was approximately 1/2 inch in diameter. The underlying skin was crusty with scabs present.

An adult tri-color guinea pig (tan, black, and white on nose and head) guinea pig in row B, rack 4, 3rd enclosure from the
top was observed with a mass under her chin. This animal had a firm, but moveable mass on her neck approximately 1
inch in diameter.

There were no observation or treatment records for the above three animals. The licensee stated that he did not observe
these conditions prior to today's inspection. A new written program of veterinary care (PVC) was established with a new
attending veterinarian since the previous inspection report. The above three conditions are listed in the new PVC with
written instructions about the conditions and treatment recommendations. The PVC state that ear infections (head tilting)
needs to be caught early to prevent irreversible damage to the inner ear. The licensee did not have any medications on

hand to treat any of the three conditions listed above. There were no treatment records present for three guinea pigs
listed on the previous inspection report with veterinary care conditions including head tilt and masses under the chin.

A failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the attending veterinarian can result in a delay of
care provided to animals and can prolong animal heath problems. All animals must be observed daily to assess their
health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed.

The three animals with veterinary conditions identified above require examination by a veterinarian to prevent worsening
of the conditions and unnecessary suffering. Additionally, the licensee must provide documentation of such examination
and treatment to APHIS officials upon request.

Remains uncorrected.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
