Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC is responsible for conducting regular reviews of activities related to the care and use of animals to ensure that
all activities are in accordance with the facility protocols, SOPs, and Animal Welfare Regulations.

During this inspection, an ophthalmology procedure using rabbits was observed. There was one individual working with
three rabbits under varying stages of anesthesia. One rabbit was lying in a plastic container, presumably recovering from
anesthesia. Around the corner, the technician was working with two other rabbits. One of those rabbit was in an induction
chamber and the other was fully anesthetized on the procedure table being maintained with a mask and inhalant
anesthesia. When entering the area, the rabbit in the plastic container appeared dead.
The protocol for this procedure states:
” Animals will be placed on a warming pad following removal from anesthesia and continued visual monitoring will be
performed until the animal is recumbent.”
The SOP for procedures involving anesthesia for the facility states:
• The animal must be monitored carefully during the surgical procedure: i.e. the animal’s respiratory rate and
characteristic, response to noxious stimuli (e.g. tail pinch, toe pinch), and when possible heart rate and body temperature.


• The animal may not be left unattended anytime during surgery.
According to the attending veterinarian, anything involving anesthesia is consider surgery and falls under this SOP.
The rabbit in the plastic container did not have a warming pad and was not being monitored continuously since the
technician was working with 2 other rabbits around the corner. There were no records or notes indicating that heart rate or
body temperature were being monitored.

During the walk thru of one of the rabbit rooms, the cage card for a rabbit that had recently undergone a procedure was
reviewed. The cage card indicated an Azlet Pump had been replaced for the 3rd time. The protocol for this procedure
states “A syringe pump may be used with any of the above injection techniques to precisely control article delivery”.
There was no mention of the pump needing to be replaced or the time frame for the replacement in the protocol. When
the attending veterinarian was asked about this procedure, he was unaware that the pumps were being replaced.

The facility needs to ensure the principal investigator for these protocols is conducting activities in accordance with the
description of that activity outlined in the protocol and approved by the IACUC.
