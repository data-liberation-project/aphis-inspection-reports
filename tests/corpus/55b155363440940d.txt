2.50(c)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Dogs and cats were not accurately identified by official tags on the door of the cage or run. Throughout the facility,
animals had been moved among the enclosures and the tags on the enclosure did not match the animals in the
enclosure. Examples of this include: Fred(cid:25)s tag on Fonsie(cid:25)s run and Sandy & Andy(cid:25)s tags on the enclosure that
housed Johnny, Finnegan and Rocky. All animals must be properly identified by a tag hanging on the enclosure,
and a matching tag accompanied by a photo in the animal records. The ID system must be current and ID tags must
match the animals in the enclosures at all times.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Plywood platforms in dog runs: Plywood platforms were warping and separating, creating a gap and an unstable
surface that could result in injury to the dogs. In particular, the platforms in Vica(cid:25)s enclosure and Johnny, Finnegan
& Rocky(cid:25)s enclosure were not structurally sound and were not in good repair. A system of maintenance must be in
place to ensure that the enclosures are in good repair.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Fonsie(cid:25)s dog house: Mattress provided for the animal was worn and soiled, with a hole in the outer cover and could
not be easily cleaned and sanitized. Bedding that is not able to be cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when
worn or soiled because it can harbor pests and has the potential to cause disease in the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Wire mesh patches on dog gates and fences: Wire mesh had been used to patch the outside of chainlink fence
enclosures, but there were exposed sharp edges that could injure the dogs if they extend a nose or paw through the
gap. This was especially true on the edges of gates where there is a larger gap for a nose or paw to extend to the
outside of the enclosure. In particular, the gate on Fonsie(cid:25)s run and Albert(cid:25)s gate had exposed wire points that
could possibly injure the dogs. A system of maintenance must be in place to ensure that the enclosures are in good
repair.
