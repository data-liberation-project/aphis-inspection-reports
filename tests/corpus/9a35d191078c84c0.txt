ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 5:30 pm on
25-JUN-19.
The inspector arrived at the facility at 5:30 pm and spoke to a household member who stated that the licensee was
not home, but may be on his way. The inspector waited for 30 minutes and then spoke with the household member
again who had called the licensee, but said that he may still be quite some distance from the facility. The inspector
then left the facility.
