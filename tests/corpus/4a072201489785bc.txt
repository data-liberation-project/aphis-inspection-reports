2.40(b) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female serval used for exhibiting had been declawed. The licensee stated that the declawing had been done
solely for the purpose of handling during exhibition. Declawing of exotic/wild cats is not considered appropriate
veterinary care. Declawing can cause considerable pain and discomfort to the animal and can result in chronic
health problems such as arthritis and lameness. Except for the treatment of medical conditions, as prescribed by a
licensed veterinarian, exotic/wild cats may not be declawed.
Correct by: From this day forward.
Exit interview conducted with licensee via phone on the day of inspection and again on May 12, 2017.
