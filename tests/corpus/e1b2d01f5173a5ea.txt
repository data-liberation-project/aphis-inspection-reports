Housing facilities, general.
There are many primary enclosure walls where the plastic coating has worn off of the metal wire. Many of these wires are
broken or in various states of deterioration. This has resulted in several walls that have approximately 2 inch holes in
them. These walls are not in good repair and are a potential injury hazard for the dogs. Correct this by repairing or
replacing these areas.

3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
There are many surfaces in contact with the dogs that are dirty and require cleaning. This includes doggy doors and
entryways, walls and tops of enclosures, and the floors of several enclosures. These surfaces are covered with organic
material and have various degrees of staining. These dirty surfaces are a potential disease hazard to the dogs and do not
satisfy accepted cleanliness standards. Correct this by cleaning all surfaces in contact with the dogs on a daily basis.

3.6(a)(2)

Primary enclosures.
Several whelping boxes have carpets that are worn and are severely frayed. The loose frayed ends are a potential
ingestion hazard to the puppies should they choose to eat these. The licensee must ensure that all carpets are free of
this fraying to protect the puppies from injury. Correct this by replacing and maintaining these carpets.

3.9(b)

Feeding
Several of the self-feeders have caked feed on the metal flow control door on the inside of the feeder. This caking of
feed can be a source of mold and deterioration of the feed and can be a potential disease hazard to the dogs. Correct
this by cleaning and maintaining all self-feeders.

3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There is an excessive accumulation of feces and spent feed under the outdoor runs on building #3. This accumulation is
contributing to the odors in this facility, may contribute to pests such as flies, and will increase disease potential to the
dogs. Correct this by increasing the frequency of cleaning under these primary enclosures.
