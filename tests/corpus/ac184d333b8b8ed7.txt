3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The enclosure housing one Zebu bull has damage that compromises the integrity and strength of the fence. The wooden
board second from the bottom, that is located on the left-hand side of the wooden fence, has been split into two pieces
leaving a gap approximately 1.5-2' in size. The corresponding upright support board on the outside of the fence post has
also been knocked loose. When the Zebu bull frolics and plays in the pasture he pushes up against the wooden fence and
the fence notably leans about 6-10" out at the top. Additionally, the top wood board located above the water buckets is
not attached to the fence on the far right side.

Failure to maintain enclosures can allow for gaps which can result in injury, entrapment or escape of animals.

Correct by ensuring all facilities are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
