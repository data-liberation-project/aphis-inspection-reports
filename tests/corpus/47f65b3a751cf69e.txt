2.75(a)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee does not have a completed Record of Acquisition (APHIS Form 7005) for the dogs on hand. There is
missing information for all of the dogs. Properly completed acquisition records are necessary for identification of dogs to
facilitate record-keeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare. The licensee must record
acquisition and identification information for all dogs on hand on Form 7005 and must be able to produce these records
upon request by the Inspector.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
