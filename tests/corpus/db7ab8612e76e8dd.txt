SANITATION.
***Goat Pen: The gutter is hanging off the roof of the main shelter. Rain runs off the roof and collects in front of the
shelter. Shelters should be kept in good repair to keep water away from the entrance of the shelter and to prevent
injury. The gutter needs to be reattached to allow water to drain properly and to prevent injury to animals. Correct by
