2.40(a) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee had a Program of Vet Care dated in 2018. He stated that the attending veterinarian had not been out to the
facility "in a while." Upon contacting the listed attending veterinarian, she expressed surprise that she was listed as the
attending veterinarian and stated that she had neither been to the facility nor had a valid vet-client-patient relationship with
that facility since 2018. She was unaware of several illnesses and deaths that had occurred at the facility and any ongoing
issues. Lack of a valid program of vet care and an attending veterinarian puts animals at risk for improper treatment of
disease and injury and can lead to suffering and death. All dealers must have an attending veterinarian who provides
adequate veterinary care to their animals. Correct by establishing and documenting a written program of veterinary care
with an attending veterinarian that regularly schedules visits to the premises. Correct by 5/19/21
2.40(b)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Several animals that had been documented at previous inspections were absent from the facility at this inspection. The
licensee did not have disposition records or medical records and stated that the animals had died from various causes.
According to the licensee, a necropsy was performed on some of the animals after their death but no documentation was
provided. The animals that died and their presumed causes of death, if any, are 3 wallabies, including a joey in pouch,


from toxoplasmosis, 2 fennec foxes from pancreatitis, a groundhog, a white-nosed coati from anemia, a genet, and
approximately 5 blackbuck from lumpy jaw. The attending veterinarian had no knowledge of these deaths or illnesses and
stated that several could have been prevented or treated if she had known. Lack of appropriate prevention, diagnosis, and
treatment led to the suffering and death of these animals. The licensee must maintain and follow a program of vet care
that includes appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Correct immediately.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
