2.31(d)(1)(2) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Consideration of Alternatives.
1. Protocol #15-20 includes a procedure that would be considered more than momentarily painful or distressful but
the protocol approved by the IACUC did not contain a written narrative description of the methods and sources used
to determine that alternatives were not available to that procedure.
2. Protocol #15-15 includes several procedures that would be considered more than momentarily painful or
distressful and the written narrative of the animal use proposal referenced the use of a database search in the
consideration for alternatives. However, the database search contained in the protocol that was approved by the
IACUC did not include a consideration of alternatives for one of the surgical procedures described in the protocol.
Per this Section of the Regulations, whenever a proposal for animal use contains procedures that may cause more
than momentary pain or distress to the animals, the investigator is required to consider alternatives to those
procedures and provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that
alternatives were not available. This requirement is important to ensure that all procedures involving animals
minimize pain and distress to the animals.
The IACUC needs to address this deficiency that was identified for these two protocols.
2.31(e)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Complete Description of Animal Use.
1. Protocol #15-20 and Protocol #15-12 that were reviewed during the inspection did not contain a complete
description of the proposed animal use. These two protocols that had been approved by the IACUC were missing
details pertaining to surgical procedures and/or missing details pertaining to the monitoring parameters for theanimals post procedure.
Per this Section of the Regulations, proposals to conduct an activity involving animals must contain a complete
description of the proposed use of the animals so the IACUC can determine that the components of the proposed
activities related to the care and use of animals are in accordance with all of the requirements outlined in this
subchapter.
The IACUC needs to address this deficiency that was identified for these two protocols.
