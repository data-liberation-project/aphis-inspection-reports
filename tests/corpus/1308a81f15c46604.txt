CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The ring tail lemurs night house had an accumulation of old feces in it and on the dirt floor there were piles of
feces as well. The entire enclosures were not spot cleaned daily. Excreta must be removed from inside each indoor
primary enclosure daily and from underneath them as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of
feces, to prevent the nonhuman primates from becoming soiled, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and
odors. Dirt floors, floors with absorbent bedding, and planted areas in primary enclosures must be spot-cleaned with
sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta, or as often as necessary to
reduce disease hazards, insects, pests, and odors. Perches, bars, and shelves must be kept clean and replaced
when worn. If the species of the nonhuman primates housed in the primary enclosure engages in scent marking,
hard surfaces in the primary enclosure must be spot-cleaned daily. Correct by February 15, 2017.

EMPLOYEES.
*** Based on non-compliant items cited during this inspection, as well as the fact that there is only one paid full time
employee it does not appear that the licensee has an adequate number of employees to carry out an acceptable
level of animal husbandry and maintenance for this facility. Without adequate personnel or time to properly performthe required functions of a licensee, the facility can fall into further disrepair, waste and debris can accumulate, and
the animals may not receive adequate care causing negative health and sanitary issues to occur. The licensee must
have adequate labor to provide adequate husbandry for the animals. Correct by March 8, 2017.
