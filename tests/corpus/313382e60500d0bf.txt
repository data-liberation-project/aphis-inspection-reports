ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30 AM on
12/15/2015.
Called both phone numbers and left messages, left a business card in the garage door and waited 30 minutes to
see if I received a phone call from the messages.
