3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are at least three sections of the doe/buck dividing fence that have damaged top rails and fabric. The most
severe damage includes a broken and protruding top rail at the far end of the deer enclosure. The damaged top
rails and fence fabric is due to fallen trees and/or branches.
Damaged top rails and fabric leave the fence structurally unsound and in disrepair. All of the damaged sections
must be repaired or replaced to maintain structural strength, contain the deer and protect them from injury.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
PERIMETER FENCE: There are several areas of the perimeter/deer enclosure fence that have gaps at the base
that are covered by large stones. One section of this fence, adjacent to the dirt road, has obvious signs of digging
at the base. From the digging marks in the dirt and the stone that has been pushed into the enclosure, it appears
that an unwanted animal was trying to gain entrance into the deer enclosure.
The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. An appropriate method
to secure the base of the perimeter fence must provided to ensure the safety of the animals housed therein.
BOTH OF THE ABOVE ITEMS ARE TO BE CORRECTED BY: MAY 21, 2017
