3.131(c)
SANITATION.
*** The barn housing sheep at the second location needs to be addressed. There is an area that is currently used to
store trash and discarded items. The facility states that they are cleaning and have an intention of throwing the
items away but it has not occurred yet. This area of trash and clutter can become an ideal breeding ground and
living area for pests. In addition there are some old rusted, broken fence gates in a pen adjacent to the sheep that
have been stored there for a month with the intention of going to the scrap pile. The facility needs to keep the area
clean and trash items need to be discarded in a timely manner to facilitate good housekeeping practices. This
needs to be addressed for the cleanliness of the facility.
