2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One cinnamon colored raccoon was seen limping on its right front leg. The animal held the leg up both while
walking and while at rest. Altered gait or reluctance to use a limb is a sign of pain and can be caused by injury or
other medical problems.
One black and white skunk was seen curled up in its nesting box and did not move the entire time it was observed.
This lethargic behavior was unusual compared to all of the other skunks at the facility. There was also a creamy
green discharge on the side of the animal's face. Lethargy is not expected in this species under these conditions as
evidenced by the behavior of the other skunks. Lethargy can indicate a variety of medical problems and illnesses. A
creamy green discharge can indicate infection or other medical problems.
One albino ferret was heard making a coughing noise during the inspection. This ferret had a swelling on the left
side of the neck, under the chin. Coughing and any abnormal swelling can be caused by a variety of medical
problems and can be painful.
The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are numerous ferret and raccoon enclosures with broken wires that protrude into the enclosures. Sharp,
protruding metal points can cause injury to the animals
There are numerous ferret enclosures with gaps or holes where the wire in the floor is broken. These holes are
large enough to possibly allow an animal to escape.There is a gap between the floor and wall along the length of one raccoon enclosure. The body weight of the animal
when it runs along the enclosure wall causes the gap to widen can could cause injury if a limb becomes entrapped.
There is bent metal flashing on the egress tunnel of one fox shelter. The bent metal has a ripped edge that is jagged
and has some points, both of which can cause possible injury.
The licensee must ensure that all housing facilities be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor facility housing the raccoons has areas of standing water on the dirt floor. The water is mixed with
animal waste and is collecting under and around the enclosures. There is an excessive number of flying insects and
other pests present on the affected areas. The licensee stated that when the animals are watered some on the
water runs over the water receptacle and onto the floor where it starts pooling up. There's not an adequate drainage
method in place to rapidly eliminate excess water.
Improper drainage under and around the enclosures does not ensure a clean, dry environment which can lead to
health hazards for the animals. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water from the
housing area.

3.129(b)
FEEDING.
There were three enclosures where the ferret food was placed on a rusted and dirty metal platform. There were two
metal (cid:28)self feeders in ferret enclosures that contained small amounts of caked food that appeared to have mold
growing on it. There were at least two enclosures where the ferret food was pushed off of the feeding platform onto
the part of the wire floor that the ferrets were using as a toilet area. Food that is contaminated with fecal waste and
other contaminants can cause decreased appetite and nutrition. The license must ensure that food receptacles be
kept clean and sanitary and shall be placed to minimize food contamination.

3.131(a)SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures.
There were at least three ferret, three raccoon, and seven skunk nest boxes that had a build-up of wet excreta and
dirt on the floor. Maggots were seen in the excreta of some of these nest boxes. At least four raccoon enclosures
had an excessive amount of feces on the wire floor portion of the enclosures. (Some covering 50 to 75% of the
available floor space and some in a pile about 4 inches deep.) There were at least four ferret enclosures with an
excessive build-up of feces with mold growing on the surface. Excessive excreta in primary enclosures can
contribute to odors, insects and other pests, and can play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure
that excreta be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to
minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Pest control.
The raccoon and ferret building both have an excessive number of flies in the housing area. The flies are on the
feed and in and around the enclosures containing ferrets and raccoons.
The presence of pests can lead to health hazards for the animals. The licensee must establish and maintain a safe
and effective program for the control of flies and other pests.
To be corrected by: August 31, 2015.
The facility's surgical and veterinary care practices continue to be under review.
