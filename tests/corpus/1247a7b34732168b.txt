2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection process a sugar glider was in an isolation enclosure and had been there for approximately a
week, after she had been found in the bottom of her primary enclosure. The animal had been injured and the right
eye appeared damaged and an area between the eyes was scabbed over. Although the animal is currently
ambulatory and eating; at the time of injury the eye was likely painful and the condition of the animal was not
communicated to the attending veterinarian. When animals are injured or ill, this information must be conveyed to
the attending veterinarian in a timely manner, so he has authority over care and prompt treatment can be
administered. Methods of communication must be addressed when animals are sick or injured to assure their
health care needs are being met.
This animal was taken to the vet prior to the inspector leaving the facility.
