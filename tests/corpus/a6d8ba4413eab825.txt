INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
This institution's IACUC meets twice a year and the unaffiliated position has been vacant for a year with no
unaffiliated member present at either of the last two IACUC meetings/semi-annual reviews. The unaffiliated
member is a requirement under the regulations, filling a vital role in the IACUC's functions by serving the
community's interest in the proper care and treatment of animals. The unaffiliated position must be filled prior to any
future IACUC activity.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Institution's Compliance Officer.
