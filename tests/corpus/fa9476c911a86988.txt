SANITATION.
** In the shed there were two palates of feed. On the second palate there was a presence of feces with some corn.
On the same palate there was also an open bag of grain with bugs on it. A safe and effective program for the control
of insects and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Also to further help prevent contamination of
feed, a better storaging system may help minimize the presence of pests. Correct by September 15, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Corporate Director.
