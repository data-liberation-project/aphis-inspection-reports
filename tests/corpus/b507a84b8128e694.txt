HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The paint is flaking off of concrete surfaces in the indoor portion of the sheltered macaque enclosure. The majority
of the wear is along the base of the walls and the floor. Flaking paint shows that the surfaces are not being
maintained so that they are readily cleaned and sanitized which can play a role in disease transmission. The facility
must ensure that surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow
them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. To be corrected 9 April
