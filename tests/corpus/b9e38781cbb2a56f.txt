ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a gray/black wolf "Jack" approximately 6 to 8 years of age that appears to be quite thin. The fur coat on the
back and above the pins of the pelvis is puckered up, which shows the bony protrusion of the skeleton. The thigh
muscle and shoulder areas also appear very lean and slender, the coat appears dull with the puckering of fur over
the bonier areas on the body. While the licensee advised the wolf appears to be eating normally, they did agree he
has not been this thin in the past, and does look a bit thinner than usual. A veterinarian has not been contacted for
proper diagnosis or treatment at this time.
The lack of proper diagnosis or treatment of an under weight animal in a timely manner can cause a treatable
condition to become chronic and cause unnecessary pain or discomfort for the animal.
The veterinarian must be contacted for proper diagnosis and treatment of the animal. Proper records should be kept
of the diagnosis and treatment, if required, after the veterinarians consultation.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are several animals that have not been included on the current inventory of the regulated animals, including
1-coati, donkey, 3-hedgehogs and arctic fox. There are several dates of acquisition and disposition that are missing
on the inventory for multiple animals, and several past animals that have paperwork of their disposition, but no
acquisition paperwork to allow for proper traceability.
Complete and accurate records are required for proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.
The licensee must add all animals on their inventory with all the proper dates acquired and dates they die or aresold/transferred/exchanged. Complete records of all animal born on property or brokered must be kept and made
available.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The primary enclosures of the lion, tigers and bears are within a perimeter fence where the public is not granted
entry, only the staff have access to these areas.
In the lion enclosure there are several areas at the bottom of the fencing on the south side where the fencing is not
attached to the bottom metal bar that holds the fencing to the ground. In these areas the fencing can be pushed or
pulled away, that could allow for a paw to go under, or for another animal to possibly dig and gain entry into the
enclosure. There is an area under the main door into the enclosure that has an area of dirt dug out that allows for
the lion to extend her front leg, up to the elbow, out into the path where she could come in contact with a staff
member at the gate. She was lying with her leg out, in the path, during the inspection.
There are multiple areas along the south side of the bear enclosure that has been dug out, leaving holes up to 4-6
inches deep. These areas were caused by the bears digging at the bottom of the fencing to get pieces of dog food
fed through the fence.
Any holes or loose fencing at the bottom of enclosure walls is a possible source of injury for the animals if they were
to get their paws or heads through the holes. As well as a mode of escape for the regulated animals, or entry point
for some other animal into the enclosure.
The den box in the wolf area has been dug under and around causing the structure to become unstable in some
areas, where the dirt is missing, resulting in a hole under the sides. There are several missing or warped boards
that need to be repaired or replaced to provide a solid structure for the wolves to go in, and climb on.
Broken or unstable structures can be a possible source of injury if the structure collapses in the den hole, or under
the weight of an animal on top of it.
The licensee must keep all structures in good repair. All holes along the enclosure fencing must be filled and any
loose fencing along the bottom of the lion, tiger or bear enclosures must be secured to prevent any possible
escapes, body parts protruding through or sites of entry for other animals into the enclosure.
