ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 130pm on
01/14/2016.
There was no response to knocking on the door. I was able to contact the licensee by phone who advised they were
at work and unable to come to the facility. They advised at this time they are not doing any transports due to not
having a van. The licensee will contact me when they get their van and begin their transport business.
My contact number is: 618-315-3649
