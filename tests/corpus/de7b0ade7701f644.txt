2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
On 10 June 2021, an animal caretaker allowed the giant anteater to be in the center aisle of the off exhibit barn while he
was cleaning its normal enclosure. This is not an animal space and the anteater injured herself while in this space. Animal
access to areas not intended to house animals can result in accidents, injury or escape. The licensee must ensure that
the handling of all animals be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. To be corrected by 15 April
2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
