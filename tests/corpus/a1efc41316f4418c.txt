FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fencing for the zebra enclosures is loose in some areas and has a numerous trees and other vegetation
growing through it. Vegetation growing near and through enclosure fencing compromises the integrity of the fence.
Loose fencing is more likely to cause animal injury or escape. Facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility does not have a perimeter fence. Some of the zebras are routinely allowed out of their primary
enclosure to roam the property. A perimeter fence protects the animals in the facility by restricting outside animals
and unauthorized persons from having contact with the animals in the facility, and also functions as a secondary
containment system. Without a perimeter fence the animals are at a higher risk for escape and injury. A perimeter
fence shall be constructed which is of sufficient height and distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to
prevent physical contact between the zebras inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter
fence. A variance may be applied for to the Administrator.

SANITATION.
There is a large amount of clutter and accumulated items on the facility including buckets, tools, vehicles, fencing,
old feeders, and various other items. Some of the items are inside the zebra enclosures. Some of the zebras are
also allowed to roam outside of their enclosure which gives them access to everything. This puts them at risk for
entrapment and/or injury. Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair.
