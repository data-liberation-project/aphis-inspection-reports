3.140(a) CRITICAL
CARE IN TRANSIT.
On November 14, 2018 Mr. Novack transported a Pzrewalski’s horse from a NYC zoo to a zoo in central OH. This
horse had not settled down during its entire transport from NY to OH. Nearly halfway through the transport Mr.
Novack contacted the NYC Zoo and the OH zoo personnel to inform them of the situation. It was agreed upon, by
Mr. Novack and the OH facility, that he would proceed to the destination. Mr. Novack arrived at the OH facility at ~
7:30 - 8:00pm. While he was in their parking area the horse was still audibly hitting the sides of the trailer. However,
no additional attempts were made to contact the staff of the facility. Nor was there any attempt to remove this
Pzrewalski’s horse from the transport enclosure. This horse was found deceased the following morning. Measures
will need to be taken to ensure that all animal transports are done safely and no animals in obvious physical distress
are transported in commerce.
