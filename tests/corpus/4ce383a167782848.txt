INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Item IACUC 2.31 b 3 ii
At the time of inspection the IACUC membership for this new facility was reviewed. It was noticed that the person
indicated as a non affiliated member is in fact part of another registered research facility.
This institution therefore does not have a properly constituted IACUC as required by the AWA.
Facility needs to obtain a properly qualified non-affiliated person for its IACUC. No actions by the IACUC can be
done until it is properly constituted.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Item IACUC 2.31 c 3
At the time of inspection the IACUC records for this newly registered facility were reviewed. The Semiannual report
done in Sept of 2014 failed to have any IACUC members signatures attached. In addition the fact they do not have
a properly constituted IACUC, because they do not have a properly qualified non-affiliated member means they
must first obtain a non-affiliated member for the IACUC.
The facility must insure the semiannual report is completed in accordance with the requirements of the AWA.
