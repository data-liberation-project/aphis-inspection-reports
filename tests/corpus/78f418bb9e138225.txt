3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two camels were being housed in an enclosure that held an accumulation of stored items including metal fence
panels, roofing panels, a wooden pallet, rope, and a wheelbarrow. All of these items were at ground level and one
of the camels was seen walking on and moving a fence panel. It wasn't clear if the camel was trying to free it's foot
or attempting to move the panel.
Animal housing should be maintained in a manner to protect the animals from injury. Equipment and supplies
should be removed from animal enclosures to protect them from injury. Correct by February 7, 2019.
3.127(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was no shelter from inclement weather in two enclosures housing two camels in each enclosure. Both
enclosures contained muddy areas from recent rains and it began raining during the inspection. It was 53 degrees
Fahrenheit at the time of the inspection and the forecast for the low temperature the night following the inspection
was 45 F. More rain is forecated for the area for four of the next ten days as well as temperatures of 33 and 34 F
on two nights.
The inability to take shelter from rain, especially cold seasonal winter rains, could cause discomfort to the animals
and adversely impact their health. The licensee stated that she submitted fecal samples to a veterinary lab after
noticing one of the animals had lost weight. She was told by the lab that whip worms were detected in at least one
sample. Health conditions (such as weight loss and parasite burdens) may be exacerbated by wet and cold
conditions.
The facility should ensure that animals housed at the facility have access to shelter that will adequately protect them
from inclement weather.
3.127(c) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Deep mud is accumulating in large puddles on the low side of one sloped enclosure. The camels are unable to
avoid the mud that surrounds their only water source. The back legs of one camel were observed to be shaking
while standing still at one point. The legs of both animals were covered in mud and both were seen holding
alternating legs up and out of the mud at times.
Standing in deep mud may cause distress to the animals and may also adversely impact their health. The licensee
should ensure that adequate drainage is provided to keep mud and water from accumulating in the animal
enclosures.
Correct by February 7, 20193.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
Four camels were being fed directly on the ground. There were no feeders in the enclosures and hay was mixed in
mud inside one enclosure where the animals were being fed. Additionally, the licensee stated that fecal samples
obtained from the camels had tested positive for whip worms approximately three weeks prior to the previous
inspection.
Food should be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination. Food may become contaminated when fed
directly on the ground, especially given the history of an intestinal parasite infection. Additionally, food may be less
palatable when mixed with mud and fecal material.
The licensee should ensure that the animals are fed in a manner that it wholesome, palatable, and free from
contamination.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
