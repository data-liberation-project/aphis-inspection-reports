3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The north and south hallways, which are occupied by dogs during group socialization, have concrete floors. There
are areas that appear porous and cannot be cleaned and sanitized as required. Waste material and other debris
can accumulate in small crevices increasing the potential of disease hazards in these areas. The surfaces of
housing facilities must be constructed and maintained in a manner that allow them to be readily cleaned and
sanitized.
