PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In an outdoor enclosure housing a a shetland sheepdog and a Scottish terrier, the water bucket is secured to the
fence with wire. This wire was loose and had a free end protruding into the shelter. Dogs drinking from this bucket
are at risk of injury due to the exposed sharp wire point. This wire must be removed or secured, and sharp points
throughout the facility repaired as needed to protect the health of the enclosed animals. This affects two animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Multiple enclosures throughout the facility had an excessive accumulation of feces, including both old and newer
piles of waste. This affected the first three outdoor enclosures, and at least four of the boxer enclosures.
Accumulation of fecal material increases the risk of contamination to the enclosed animals. Waste and fecal matter
must be removed as often as necessary to maintain appropriate husbandry standards and to adequately protect the
health of the enclosed animals. This affects at least 11 animals.
