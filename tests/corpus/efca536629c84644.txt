2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** While inspecting the facility a parent picked up a ferret to let her daughter touch it. The ferret got close enough to
bite the little girl on the lip and broke the skin. The child was escorted by the parent and owner immediately to tend
to the wound. The ferret was not harmed and was returned to its primary enclosure. The ferret did not have any
physical barriers other than the open top glass cased primary enclosure in which the owner allows the animals to be
handled by customers as long as they utilize sanitizer prior. The animal must be handled so that there is minimal
risk to the animal and to the public, with sufficient barriers in place to assure the safety of both. Correct by May 1,
