2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 1 year old male Shetland Sheep had almost complete hair loss over its back. The licensee stated the hair loss
started a couple of weeks ago. The licensee has not yet contacted the Attending Veterinarian about the sheep's
condition. Hair loss can indicate an underlying medical problem that may be contagious to other animals or even
humans. In addition, the severe amount of hair loss could make it difficult for the animal to stay warm especially in
the severe cold and weather the local area has had recently potentially resulting in the death of the animal. The
licensee must contact the Attending Veterinarian and treat the sheep per his/her instructions. Correct by 2/22/19.
Note: The licensee has contacted the Attending Veterinarian in regards to this animal.
3.127(b) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At least four sheep and one goat have died during the months of January and February 2019. When asked how the
animals died, the licensee stated they died from the cold. One sheep was found outside, another found near the
entrance of the shelter, and the other two sheep and one goat were found in the shelters. The shelter at the very
least isn't giving the proper protection from the weather. Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic
conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection from
the weather. The shelter needs to be evaluated and improved or fixed so no animals are dying from the cold.
Correct by 2/22/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
