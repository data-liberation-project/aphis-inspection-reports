3.53(c)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Rabbit enclosures measured 30 inches by 36 inches, providing 7.5 square feet of space. Some enclosures were
divided by a solid barrier, creating 2 enclosures of 3.75 square feet of space. 27 rabbits, all acquired on 30
November 2017, were housed either as a pair in the undivided enclosure or as a single animal in one half of the
divided enclosure. All animals appeared to be approximately the same weight and 3 representative animals were
weighed at 9.12-9.2 pounds. Rabbits weighing over 8.8 pounds are required to have 4 square feet of space in order
to meet the regulations. Adequate floor space in primary enclosures is essential in order to safeguard the health
and well-being of the rabbits. Overcrowding can result in stress, disease, and injury. Primary enclosures should be
measured and the rabbits weighed so that rabbits can be redistributed into housing where they have adequate floor
space and suitable companions.
