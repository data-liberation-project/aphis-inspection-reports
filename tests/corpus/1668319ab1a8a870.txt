2.35(b)(8)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
- In 2015, 16 dogs were acquired from 4 non-licensed vendors for an active protocol. Of the 4 vendors, only 1
provided the required certification stating that the animals were born and raised on the person's premises. Further
facility documentation revealed that a total of 10 dogs acquired from 3 vendors were not born and raised on the
vendors(cid:25) premises. The facility IACUC discovered this noncompliance in Fall of 2015 and issued a letter of
reprimand to the responsible Primary Investigator, requiring that future dog purchases meet all requirements of the
Animal Welfare Act. However, the IACUC did not require the Investigator to definitely identify the ultimate source of
the animals which had already been acquired. In order to ensure that these dogs are appropriate research animals,
the facility must make every possible effort to trace these animals and ensure that they were properly acquired by
the vendors. This is a critical element of the Animal Welfare Act. The facility must identify the ultimate source of
these animals within 45 days of this inspection. All findings must be communicated with the USDA.
Correct within 45 days
2.35(c)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
- Four dogs acquired for an active protocol were no longer at the facility, and there were no records of disposition
available. The Primary Investigator stated that the dogs were evaluated, found to be unsuitable for the project, and
were returned to the vendor. The animals were never actually purchased by the facility, but only held temporarily.
Any animal purchased or acquired by the facility must have a corresponding disposition record that meets all
requirements of the Animal Welfare Act. Accurate disposition records are critical to enable the IACUC and/or USDA
to track the movement of research animals.
Correct from this point forward.
3.56(b)(3)
SANITATION.
- The current cage sanitization procedure for rabbits on an active protocol is not adequate. The facility is using a
product labeled "Top Performance Cherry-256". The current procedure is to fill a large (~110 gallon) rubber tank
with the disinfectant, then dip the cages into the tank. The facility employees stated that they mix the bin with 1gallon disinfectant and then fill the tank with water. This solution is kept for approximately six months, and used
every couple of weeks. The bin is located in a corner of the rabbit room, and was adjacent to a cage with a rabbit
inside.
The label directions for the product are to mix 1/2 ounce of disinfectant for every gallon of water. The label also
states that a new batch of solution should be mixed daily. The current facility practice is to use a batch for several
months, adding water as needed to keep the tank full. Further, this product is labeled as "corrosive" and indicates
potential health impacts if inhaled, ingested, or contacted. Locating an open tank of this mixture next to the rabbits
could possibly have a negative impact on the rabbits. No animal health impacts were noted during the inspection,
but this practice seems to constitute a potential risk.
- The facility must evaluate this sanitization process to assess the efficacy and the safety. Sanitization must be
conducted in an appropriate manner to ensure the health and welfare of the animals.
