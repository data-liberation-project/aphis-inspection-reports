2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for this facility lacks specific guidance for the care of animals. There
is no specific guidance for internal parasite control and treatment of conditions for the various species, only a list of
drugs. The PVC lists Ivomec for parasite control two times a year, however the facility rotates drugs and the second
drug used is not listed. Specific dosing, route, and schedule of administration is not included for the drugs included
in the PVC. Specific guidance from the attending veterinarian is required for all drugs used by the licensee.
The current PVC indicates that the attending veterinarian is responsible for all euthanasia(cid:25)s. According to park
personnel, animals are also euthanized via gunshot in several situations. If gunshot is to be utilized as an
emergency or otherwise primary form of euthanasia it shall be conducted by a trained individual. Euthanasia via
gunshot shall be conducted in a manner which alleviates suffering and does not promote any further pain or
distress in the animals. The attending veterinarian needs to create specific guidelines for the facility in regards to
euthanasia and the use of gunshot. The PVC section for euthanasia needs to consider all recommendations made
by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) within the latest guidelines on euthanasia (2013).
Additional specific guidance is required for the Program of Veterinary Care. Failure to have specific accurate
guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also does
not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by
developing and implementing a complete, accurate Program of Veterinary Care for all animals housed at the facility.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A black female rabbit that had babies within the last few weeks was shaking and not steady on her back legs when
moving around the barn. Her left back leg was wet and matted. Her babies are nesting approximately 3 feet off the
ground in a washbasin that she has to navigate and jump into. In her current condition there is a high potential that
she will have difficulty accessing the babies for nursing and care which can put them at risk. The condition of this
animal was not observed by the staff until pointed out by the inspectors. Daily observations lead to early detections
of animal health issues and can assist the vet with a thorough history to help with diagnosing problemsThe large male red kangaroo in the digester building that is blind in one eye had his head tilted and was still walking
in circles around the pen continuously for several minutes during the inspection process. This circling is an
abnormal behavior pattern that could indicate potential health care issues. The facility still has not communicated
this animal and its condition to the attending vet to receive guidance and have assistance with encouraging normal
behavior patterns for the animal(cid:25)s health and well- being.
3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The rabbits have been moved into a barn off site in a large sectioned off pen. All of the rabbits are now free roaming
throughout this barn. This barn houses birds and has farm equipment, excess wood and miscellaneous items and
debris. Additionally two rabbits have had litters, one in a washbasin 3 feet off the ground and the other had her litter
under a chair in the hay on the floor. These babies could easily get stepped on or injured without having a primary
enclosure that contains them safely. The rabbits need to be housed in an enclosure that can contain them for their
safety and well-being.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The current kangaroo diet is a combination of rabbit pellet, sweet feed, flake corn and hay. There was unknown
concentrations of minerals in the diet fed and no mineral blocks or vitamin E which can lead to a vitamin deficiency.
Additionally kangaroos are prone to lumpy jaw which can also be due to the wrong diet. The diet of these animals
still needs to be evaluated by the vet to assure the animals are receiving a diet that meets their nutritional value for
their health and well- being
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The open wood shelf over the corner of the adult pig enclosure had several miscellaneous items and an open box of
rat poison. There is a potential for these items to fall into the enclosure and be a hazard to the pigs. This area needs
to be kept clean and in good repair for the safety of the animals.
The main park needs to have a clean sweep done. There were several red cups seen in both sections of the park,
an old concrete feeder that still needs to be removed and multiple down trees and limbs that need to be removed to
keep the area safe for the animals.
