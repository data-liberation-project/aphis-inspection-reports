3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor portion of the dog enclosures are constructed of wire and are raised up off the ground. The facility
representative stated that last summer or fall a tree fell on the first three outdoor enclosures on the east side. The
tree has significantly damaged the enclosures. The damage consists of bent fence panels and plastic dividers,
broken wires, sharp points and large gaps in the fence panels and gates. There are at least five adult dogs that can
access these damaged enclosures. One adult female dog was observed coming out of one access door, running
between gaps created by the bent enclosure dividers and entering an access door in a different enclosure.
The sharp points and broken wires could cause injury to the dogs. The large gaps in the fencing could entrap a
dog, allow a dog to fall from the enclosure or allow another animal to enter the enclosure. The damaged fencing
and dividers fail to keep the dogs' in their specific enclosures which could result in compatibility problems.
Housing facilities must be constructed and maintained in a manner that keeps the dogs safe from injuries, contains
the dogs securely, and restricts other animals from entering. The licensee must repair the damaged enclosures or
alter them in a manner that makes them safe for the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all housing facilities are
safe for the dogs at all times.
