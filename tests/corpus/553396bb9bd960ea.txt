ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
One expired bottle of Isoflourane (expiration date 20 Aug 2014) was found on a shelf in the procedure room. The
procedure utilizing this anesthetic agent had been removed from the protocol in May 2017. Expired medications
may have compromised efficacy and potency and use of such does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The
institution needs to ensure that medications are not being used past their expiration date. Expired bottle was
disposed of at the end of the inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
