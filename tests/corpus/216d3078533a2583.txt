ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a 3yr old Great Dane (M) "Diesel" #55, Blue in color that has chewed up ear tips on both ears. There are
round scabs on both sides of both ear tips, with some areas that are pink with some blood seepage. There is a
black/tan Dapple Dachshund (F) #106 that has excessive tarter buildup on all of her molars, with red receding
gums with areas of gray soft material between the gum line and tooth. She also has a sunken right eye. There has
been no treatment of the ear injuries at this time, and no documentation of the eye issue with the Dachshund or
information on the dental program of tooth care for this dog. The veterinarian has not been contacted in regards to
these issues by the time of the inspection.
Untreated injuries can be painful to the animal and start as a treatable injury that can become chronic or permanent
if not treated as soon as the issue is observed.
The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of any injuries. All chronic
conditions or birth defects should be noted by the veterinarian along with any treatments required during flare ups of
the condition. These records should be kept by the licensee.
