FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
-In the llama enclosures, there are three shade structures and an area where trees provide shade to the animals.
Llamas also have access to a small barn that is enclosed on three sides and does not provide any cross
ventilation.There is not sufficient shade space provided for the number of animals housed in the llama housing
areas.
-In the goat enclosure, there was one shade structure provided for the five goats. This is not a sufficiently sized
shaded area provided to comfortably protect all animals in this enclosure from the direct rays of the sun.
Failure to provide sufficient shade to allow all the animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight
could cause overheating or discomfort to the animals. Additional shade for the animals is required to be in
compliance.

WATERING.
Each llama enclosure has one water source available for the animals. In one enclosure, run-off- water coming from
a
roof was flowing into the llama's water receptacle, possibly contaminating the water. In another enclosure, there
were
over 100 animals sharing one water receptacle. Given the elevated ambient temperature the day of the inspection,
additional water sources may have been necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. A system should be in
place and maintained to ensure sufficient amounts of potable water is accessible to the llamas as often as
necessary
for their health and comfort.

SANITATION.
Llamas housed in enclosure number one have access to a small barn. The barn has a moderate accumulation of
fecal material and other debris collecting along the side walls. In addition, there is old caging material, buckets, a
television set, wood, irrigation equipment, and metal and wire scraps being stored. Failure to remove fecal material,
trash and other discarded items from animal housing areas could increase disease hazards and vermin infestation
in
these areas and/or lead to injury. Premises including buildings and surrounding grounds must be kept clean, free of
clutter and in good repair in order to protect the health and well-being of the animals, to prevent the harborage of
vermin and pests, and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. A system of maintaining effective
housekeeping practices must be in place.
