Facilities, indoor.
Some interior surfaces in the building for the guinea pigs are not substantially impervious to moisture. The ceiling and
some of the wall surfaces are constructed of treated wood or treated particle board that has not been sealed. Some areas


of the ceiling show signs of water damage. The painted surfaces of the cage changing and drying station has worn off and
the surface has multiple scratches and dings. The support poles for the two newer racks are unpainted and showing signs
of water damage. The floor is compacted dirt.

Interior surfaces of indoor housing for guinea pigs should be maintained in a manner that renders the surfaces
substantially impervious to moisture. All interior surfaces must be sealed to prevent moisture from seeping through and to
facilitate sanitization.
