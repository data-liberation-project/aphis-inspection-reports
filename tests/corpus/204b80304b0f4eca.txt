3.14(c)

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
One dog transport enclosure (AWB 074 45417131), was accepted with an incomplete certification that food and water
was offered 4 hours prior to delivery. The absence of this certification does not assure that the animal will be offered food
and water at required frequencies when in transport for 12 or more hours. Assure certifications that animals are offered
food and water during the 4 hours prior to delivery are compete and securely attached to their enclosures in a manner that
makes them easily noticed and read.
3.15(a)(9)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
Three transport enclosures were accepted without suitable absorbent material inside. One cat (AWB 074 47140111) and
two dogs (both on AWB 074 45417131) had a blanket and pet bed present on the bottom of their enclosures. These are
not suitable absorbent materials and could potentially allow the animals to become soiled in excreta.
Assure all transport enclosures contain a suitable absorbent material that is safe and nontoxic.
