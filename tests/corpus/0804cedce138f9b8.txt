3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure for two rhinoceros is constructed of four strands of metal cable supported by heavy posts. One
section in the back of the enclosure was damaged by a fallen tree. At this point in the fencing the height of the
cables is diminished by half, and the tree protrudes into the enclosure. This opening in the enclosure fencing could
present a risk of escape or entanglement.
Animal enclosures must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals
involved, they must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.
The tree was removed at the time of inspection, and new cable was added to achieve adequate height, but
additional repairs are needed to the concrete footing, and this will be accomplished as the ground dries out, by June
1, 2019.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a section of this facility’s perimeter fence that does not adequately fulfill the requirements described in
3.127 (d). The purpose of the perimeter fence, as described in this subsection, is to prevent people and animals
from passing under or through the fence and entering the premises, and also to act as secondary containment, in
the event that an exhibit animal should escape its enclosure. Additionally, the perimeter fence must be at least three
feet from the enclosure fence to prevent contact through the fencing. At the time of this inspection the following
problem was observed:
- A gate in the perimeter fence, which serves as the parking exit, is left open and unattended throughout the day.
Whereas the entrance gate is visible to the nearby office area, and employees are available to monitor and close
the gate if needed, this exit gate is more remote, and not easily monitored. The gate is just behind the primaryenclosures for cheetahs and striped hyenas.
Failure to provide an adequate perimeter fence could put the well-being of the animals at risk, due to the possibility
of harmful unauthorized contact with people or animals, including exposure to animals that could introduce
diseases, and also due to the risk of inadequate containment in the event of an escape. The facility should continue
with its plan to complete the perimeter fence and bring all sections into compliance.
This inspection was conducted 3/13 - 3/14/19, with an exit interview on 3/19/19. The inspection and exit interview
were conducted with facility representatives.
