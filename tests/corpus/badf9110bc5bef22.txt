2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
MISCELLANEOUS.
-Improper lock placement caused two incidents (3/1/2019 and 4/25/2019) of non-human primates (NHP's) getting
out of their enclosure and the uncontrolled interaction with other NHP's in the secure room led to injuries that
required surgical repair (suturing, partial digit amputations, and distal tongue loss). Involved animals received
veterinary treatment. These incidents were reported to the overseeing ACUC and OLAW and the facility has
implemented changes to decrease incidents of NHP's exiting their primary enclosures.
-In relation to an ACUC-approved handling procedure a marmoset sustained a femur fracture that required
amputation. The injury was successfully treated resulting in the marmoset being able to ambulate well (observed in
inspection). Bone fractures cause pain and the loss of a limb is considered a serious adverse effect to an animal.
This incident was reported to USDA, the overseeing ACUC, and OLAW. Corrective actions were implemented to
prevent further recurrences.
-On 10/25/18 the facility found a peromyscus mouse was found to have got its head caught between the
polypropylene enclosure and the lid. Necropsy findings had signs of rapid hypoxia. It wasn’t clear how the mouse
got its head caught, possible warping in enclosure might have contributed to the incident. Increased attention to
enclosure warping and the manner in which enclosure lids are closed were corrective actions reported by the lab.
This is the first incident of this type that the lab is aware of and reports no further occurrences of entrapment have
happened since. This incident was reported to overseeing ACUC.
Correction: Ensure corrective actions are followed to prevent further occurrences of incidents.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
This was a routine inspection of the animals, animal housing areas, records and protocols maintained under the
LSVC IACUC conducted from 7/9 - 7/11/2019 and the exit interview was conducted on 7/12/19. Additional Inspectors
