2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The six puppies at the facility did not have identification.
Lack of identification does not ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record
keeping requirements. The licensee must ensure that all dogs less than 16 weeks of age are identified by an official
tag as described in Sec. 2.51, a legible tattoo approved by the Administrator, a microchip, or a cage card (if
maintained as a litter with their dam and housed within the same primary enclosure).
