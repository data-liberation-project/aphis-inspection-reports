ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Boston (microchip #1856764) is observed to have a thin body condition, pale gums and a distended
abdomen. The facility representative stated the the dog's condition has been deteriorating over the past two to
three days and that he is monitoring the dog's condition. The facility representative called the Attending
Veterinarian (AV) at the time of inspection, but the AV was not called prior to today. Not providing timely veterinary
care can cause pain and distress to the animal and may worsen the condition. The AV evaluated the dog prior to
the exit briefing. Corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
End of report.
