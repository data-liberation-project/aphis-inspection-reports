Over the course of this inspection 2 adult sugar gliders were found to have previously unobserved, undiagnosed and
untreated eye conditions. These animals are housed in a large
building divided into several rooms kept in unsanitary conditions with extensive buildup of excreta and food all over their
cages and an infestation of mice and roaches.
Inside room 4, an sugar glider (cage ID #161) has a sunken and open right eye. A whitish wet concave organic matter
occupies the eye socket, while the other eye is round and dark and healthy.
Inside room 7, there is an adult sugar glider (cage ID #13) with the right eye has a greyish milky hue to it while the left is
dark and healthy.

Additionally, 6 sugar gliders were observed as having wet fur and bodies. In none of these occasions was there a leaking
water source in or around the cages.
Inside room 1, a sugar glider (cage id#45) was observed being wet throughout more than a third of its body. It was visibly
shaking and a mushy, runny, dried brownish organic material indicative of animal excreta was seen on top of the nesting
tube.
Inside room 3, a sugar glider (cage id#63) was observed being wet throughout the bottom half of the animal. The animal

did not react when coaxed.
Inside room 10, a sugar glider (cage id#171) was observed as being wet and had the appearance of having a thin and
poor body condition. Its hip bones were observed through its skin and wet fur.
Inside room 10, (cage id#225), 2 sugar gliders were observed as being wet throughout their entire body. A reddish wet
protrusion extended from one of their noses.
Inside room 10, a sugar glider (cage id#597) was observed as being wet throughout its entire body and a wet, loose
brownish organic material indicative of animal excreta was observed inside the nesting tube with the animal.

Finally, inside room 4, a sugar glider (cage id#53) was observed as having a dark reddish, crusty organic material on top
of its head where there appeared to be no hair, and reddish inflamed skin underneath.

The above listed unobserved abnormalities can be indicative of an underlying disease, injury or illness. The animals must
be examined by a veterinarian immediately for diagnosis and treatment.

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Over the course of this inspection a total of 2 adult sugar gliders were found to have abnormal discoloration of one eye or
seeming lack of on one of their eyes.
6 sugar gliders were found to be wet, shaking or thin, 1 of these also had a small red protrusion on the tip of the nose.
1 sugar glider had a dark red crusty spot on its head with some hair loss.
These animals have not been observed by the facility prior to inspection. These abnormalities can be very can cause
discomfort, pain, impair the vision of the animal, or otherwise be an underlying symptom of an illness, injury or disease.

Without proper daily observation to assess the animals there is no effective way to gauge the health and well being of the
animals. There is no effective way to treat or assess a sick or injured animal
in a timely manner, and there is no effective way to communicate in a timely manner any issues that may arise to the
attending veterinarian. Ensure daily observation of all animals throughout the facility and direct and frequent
communication with the attending veterinarian when needed.

Facilities, general.
Several enclosures throughout the facility were observed to be in disrepair. The facility utilized plastic dipped metal wire
cages. Many cages were noted as containing damage in the plastic dip, exposing bare metal underneath which has since
rusted or broken apart, exposing sharp points or holes in the enclosures. An employee stated to the inspector that at
night some of the gliders in room 7 are able to get out of their cages and will "go visit with their friends". Several
enclosures were observed with breaks in the wire that were to the extent that the animals within could potentially escape,
or rodents could enter the enclosure with the animals. There is a history of animal escapes according to the employees at
the facility. There is also a significant and documented infestation of rodents and insects throughout the facility. Ant
poison powder is used on the floors throughout the facility and rodent poison, though covered with cages, are used on the
floor throughout the facility. There is a significant risk or injury, contamination, contact with pests, poison and/or death to
animals housed in enclosures that are damaged and in disrepair. Repair or replace damaged enclosures housing
animals, or relocate the animals to enclosures in acceptable repair. Correct by 2/28/2022

Sanitation.
During the course of the inspection, an overall and significant lack of sanitation was witnessed, most prevalent in rooms 7,
9, and 10. Excreta and hair were observed collected and caught through the wire floors of most cages, and a dried brown

mushy substance which had the appearance of dried fecal material was present on the tops of a majority of the nesting
structures inside the cages which are round capped pieces of pvc pipe, approximately 4-5 inches round. Pests and
rodents were present and feeding off of the excreta and food waste. The overall smell of waste throughout the enclosed
facility rooms was very pungent and overwhelming causing discomfort to the inspector unless a mask was used. The odor
was still present on the inspector and his clothes even after several hours after the inspection. Inadequate sanitation
poses a direct health and safety hazard not only to the animals. Animals that are subjected to soiled enclosures and food
can become destressed, or sick. 6 gliders were observed to showing signs of discomfort, illness, or disease. All
enclosures and rooms must be adequately cleaned and sanitized and a proper sanitation program must be maintained.

Sanitation.
Throughout the facility grounds, inside animal rooms number 7, 9, and 10, inside the washout trench tubes and inside
both empty and occupied enclosures, there were an insects, small black worms, and mice in an amount which was too
numerous to count. Mice were observed inside a empty cages, eating glider food, in crevices and cracks, running across
the floor. An uncalculatable amount of bugs or different sizes and types were inside the trays underneath the sugar glider
cages. In some instances, many insects were seen inside occupied cages with the gliders. Insects were also observed in
many food bowls which can and will contaminate the animals food source. These food sources were the only source of
food for many caged gliders. In one case, a deceased mouse that was observed two and a half weeks ago my an
inspector in a wash down trench was still there, now decomposed to be point of being skeletonized, an indication that the
wash down trenches in the back rooms have now been utilized in at least that long. Mouse bait stations were observed in
all rooms, however a majority of them are empty and dry. Without adequate pest control, the animals within the facility are
in severe risk of being exposed to disease, and parasites. Sugar gliders are at risk to being injured or killed by rodents or

large numbers of insects. Food and enclosures are become contaminated. at least 6 sliders at the facility are showing
signs of illness or disease. A more effective pest and parasite control plan must be established and implemented.

Employees.
During the inspection of the facility several significant noncompliant items directly affecting the health and safety of the
animals housed within were observed. After speaking with the licensees and two employees of the facility it was learned
that the licensee has had difficulty finding employees to work at the facility. The amount of animals at the facility cannot be
properly and adequately taken care of with the amount of employees available. The facility must have a sufficient number
of adequately trained employees in order to maintain the acceptable levels of husbandry practices set forth in the animal
welfare act regulations.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee and employees.
