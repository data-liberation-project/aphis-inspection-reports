PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
At about 7:15 am on May 27th, animal facility workers found 35 dead guinea pigs in two rooms at the facility. The
facility had increased temperature alarms starting at about 11:13 pm the night of May 26th. Security had informed
facility maintenance of the increased temperature situation and maintenance worked to resolve the situation by
around 6:00 am the morning of May 27th. Despite the high temperatures in a building housing animals, animal care
personnel were not notified and no thought was given to the fact the guinea pigs were being exposed to high,
potentially life threatening temperatures for an extended period of time. Records showed that temperatures were
elevated for around 7 hours and peaked at a high of about 38 degrees Celsius. This is above the 85 degree
Fahrenheit maximum mandated for indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs. One more guinea pig was found dead
on May 28th and three more guinea pigs were euthanized. Necropsy reports showed gross pathology consistent
with heat stress. It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all personnel involved in animal care be
trained in the basic needs of each species of animal housed or utilized at the facility. This lack of training resulted in
unnecessary animal suffering and death. This training needs to be provided to facility personnel.
Correct by: Correct from this time forward. The facility has put in place immediate and long term corrective actions
to ensure that this does not happen again.
