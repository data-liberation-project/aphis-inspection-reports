inches by 24.5 inches for a total of 888.125 square inches of space. The puppies were short 626.875 square

minimizes the dogs from stepping or sitting in their feces and also minimizes the spread of disease. The licensee
must ensure that all enclosures containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet the minimum floor
space requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that enclosure. Correct immediately.
