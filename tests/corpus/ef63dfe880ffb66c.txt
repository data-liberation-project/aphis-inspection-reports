PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
A large dog was checked at the ticket counter on Lufthansa flight # 0455 to Frankfurt, baggage ticket #
0220369385. The crate had a sticker applied that said "Live Animals" on top, but the writing was quite small, with
letters less that 1/2 an inch tall. Primary enclosures should be labeled on top, and one or more sides, with the words
"Live Animal" in letters at least one inch in height. Failure to adequately label the primary enclosure could result in
improper handling of the animal, which could put its well-being at risk.
To be corrected from this time forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
A large dog was checked at the ticket counter on Lufthansa flight # 0455 to Frankfurt, baggage ticket #
0220369385. The dog, a four month old shepherd, was sitting on the bare plastic floor of the crate, without any
bedding or absorbent material. An absorbent material should be present in order to minimize the risk that the animal
will be standing / sitting / lying in its own excrement.
Airline personnel accepting animals for transport should assess the animal and primary enclosure, and assure that
all requirements are met in order to protect the welfare of the animals.

An adult cat was observed in the international baggage claim area at SFO, upon arrival from Mumbai. Its baggage
ticket was # 0220287967. The owner(cid:25)'s feeding and watering certification, attached to the primary enclosure, states

Frankfurt to SFO (cid:19) duration 10.5 hours. Upon arrival at SFO the total travel time since the cat was last fed,according the owner's certification, had been 26.5 hours.
The owner's certification regarding feeding and watering instructions, prominently displayed on the carrier, stated
that the cat was to be offered food and water in Frankfurt, and upon arrival at SFO. The owner had attached two
small bags of food to the carrier - one labeled FRA and the other SFO. The owner, upon retrieving the cat, noted
that neither bag had been opened.
Adult dogs and cats in transport must be offered food and water at least once every 24 hours. The owner's feeding
and watering instructions should be followed during transport. Failure to provide food, and to follow owner
instructions, could be detrimental to the health and well-being of the animal.
