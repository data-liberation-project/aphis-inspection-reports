FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal roof of the enclosure housing the female coatimundi is damaged. Some sections of the roof are missing
and other sections are bent and twisted. The roof appears structurally unsound and continued deterioration could
cause injury to the animal. Housing facilities must be kept in good repair in order to safely contain the animals and
prevent injury. The damaged roof should be repaired or replaced. Correct by: November 12, 2016.

SANITATION.
Several goats, a deer and a calf were housed in an enclosure that contained a large pile of discarded materials.
These items included chain link type fencing, metal supports and other construction type materials. Accidental
access to these items could result in injury to the animals. Accumulations of trash and unused items should be
cleared as necessary from animal enclosures to protect the health of the animals and protect them from injury.

SANITATION.
Excessive numbers of black flies covered the wooden floor of the primary enclosure housing the young male
coatimundi. Hundreds of flies were noted in and around the enclosure. Insects can cause irritation to the animal by
biting or swarming. Flies can also transmit disease causing pathogens. A safe and effective program for insect
control must be established and maintained. Correct by: October 22, 2016.
