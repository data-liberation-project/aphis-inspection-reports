ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process from
2:00pm-3:45pm on 05/18/2016.
I knocked, honked, and called all the numbers I had for the licensees. Contact by text message was finally made
with a licensee at about 3:00pm. They were not available until approximately 6:30pm. The other licensee was
working in the fields and I received a return text message at approximately 9:00pm. A minor family member arrived
at the house at about 3:45pm and stated that there was no alternative to reaching the licensee in the field than what
I had already attempted.
