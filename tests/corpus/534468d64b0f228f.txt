3.131(c)
SANITATION.
3.131 (c) Inside open area of the basement where 24 hedgehogs are being housed is an excess accumulation of
equipment (i.e. filing cabinet, plastic containers w/items inside, books, boxes, water bottles etc.) being stored next or
near the enclosures. Cobwebs were hanging from the ceiling above two of the hedgehog enclosures. These
conditions are unsanitary and not appropriate in animal housing area as they can attract pests which can potentially
carry infectious diseases and impedes proper housekeeping inside the basement area and around the animal's
enclosure.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals and to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
