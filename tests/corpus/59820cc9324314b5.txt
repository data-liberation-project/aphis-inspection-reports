ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***Several of the goats were making coughing or gagging noises during the inspection. The VMO was told by the
facility employee that the goats had been coughing since September and that the veterinarian had come out to the
facility to evaluate the goats. The facility representative stated that the veterinarian had been out to see the goats
but was unable to provide documentation at the time of inspection that showed a veterinary evaluation of the goats.
The licensee must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated in a
timely manner by a veterinarian as part of the facility’s programs of adequate veterinary care and that the facility use
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases, and injuries at all times. The licensee must
ensure that evaluations of the animals made by the veterinarian and facility staff must be documented and readily
available to APHIS upon request and include sufficient detail to demonstrate the provision of adequate veterinary
care.
***There was no program of veterinary care nor acquisition and disposition records available for review at the time
of the inspection.
The facility representative sent a copy of the program of veterinary care to the VMO via electronic mail the day after
the inspection.
The written program of veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the
attending veterinarian in regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that the
written program of veterinary care and acquisition and disposition records are available for review during all USDA
inspections. Each facility shall allow USDA officials to examine records required to be kept by the Animal Welfare
Act.

SANITATION.
***There were two electric cords running through the goat enclosure. One of the electric cords was torn, with the
metal wires coming out of the rubber insulation.
These electric cords do not have electricity running through them, however they could be ingested by the goats.
***A section of metal fencing and plastic mesh is kept inside the goat enclosure when it is not in use. The metal
points on the ends of the fencing were very sharp when touched by the inspector. The plastic mesh and metal
fencing are placed in an area of potential contact with the goats and could lead to injury.
All premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury. All accumulations of
trash shall be cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals. To be corrected by November 8, 2016
