2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility does not have a current written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). Each animal exhibitor shall employ
an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements, and in the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or
consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written PVC, in order to document agreed
standards for preventive health, diet, and other veterinary care issues. The PVC should be made available to APHIS
personnel at time of inspection.
