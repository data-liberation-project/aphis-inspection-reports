HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At time of inspection on the east wall inside the building a hole was exposed. One adult dog was being kept in the
enclosure and could come in contact with the hole in the wall. Open holes left from chewed sheet rock could create
potential health problems if the dog swallows exposed pieces of sheet rock. Exposed pieces of sheetrock or holes
can also provide easy access for & could be used as a living area for any vermin that might be living with the dogs.
Covering all chewed holes in the walls is necessary to ensure the health & well being of all dogs. To be corrected by
06-12-15.
At time of inspection the east wall of the inside of the building around the hole had been scratched and was not
impervious to moisture. The sheet rock was exposed and needs to be sealed to prevent any deterioration of the wall
where one adult dog is being housed. Wall needs to be covered with a material that is impervious to moisture or
painted to protect the animal and the wall. To be corrected by 06-12-15.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At time of inspection all inside enclosures housing 36 adult dogs have a mixture of dried dirt, grease and other
excreta caked on the interior walls. Sanitization of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and
other disease hazards. Unsanitary living conditions exist that could lead to potential contamination, soiling or caking
of the hair coat or disease risks. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are cleaned and sanitized once every
two weeks or more often if needed. To be corrected by 06-13-15.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At time of inspection grass and weeds have grown up in the outside enclosures housing 20 adult dogs and around
the outside concrete enclosures housing 16 adult dogs. Allowing weeds and grass to grow in the outside enclosure
area could provide a living / breeding area for rodents, other pests & vermin. Weed seeds getting stuck on the hair
coat could potential lead to discomfort especially if the dog is not able to rid its hair coat of weed seed. Animal
waste could be difficult to get at & remove from the enclosure if it is being deposited in weeds / high grass.Elimination of weeds & mowing high grass in the enclosure is necessary to ensure the health & well-being of all
dogs. To be corrected by 06-12-15.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
