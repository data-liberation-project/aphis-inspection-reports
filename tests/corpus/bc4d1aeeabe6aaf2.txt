Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
During a review of records, it was observed that the facility only accounts for 35 fallow deer on their inventory records but
there are 52 fallow deer at the facility. Facility representatives stated that fallow deer born this year had not yet been
added to the records in addition to missing some of the adult deer as well.
Exhibitors need to make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose animals owned, held, or otherwise
in their possession and these records need to include any offspring born. Failure to do so can inhibit animal tracking
efforts.
Correct by ensuring that records include correct counts of animals and include all births.

Facilities, outdoor.
There were two large tree trunks that have fallen onto the perimeter fence, behind the bobcat and grivet enclosures,
which have caused the fencing to bow inward. Additionally, the perimeter fence access gate near the alpaca enclosure
has a gap that is approximately 6 inches wide at the top.
Perimeter fences must be constructed so that they prevent animal escape as well as entry of other animals or


unauthorized persons. Areas which sag and have large gaps impact the integrity of the fence by weakening it and
potentially allowing escape or entry of other animals. Correct by removing the tree trunks and closing gaps in the
perimeter fence.

Sanitation.
A large accumulation of rodent feces were found on the floor amongst the food bags in the facility's dry food storage
garage. There was also scattered food on the floor, and numerous piles of supplies which can allow for harborage of
rodents. The facility stated that they have attempted several pest management techniques, however, their current
program does not appear to be effective in eliminating the pests.
Additionally, the area surrounding the fox enclosure is overgrown with weeds and vegetation up to a height of
approximately three feet and to the extent where it was difficult to approach the enclosure in order to observe the foxes.
Failure to maintain an effective program to control mammalian pests can have a negative impact on the the health of the
animals through the spread of disease by contamination of animal areas and feed. Overgrown weeds and vegetation can
also serve as harborage areas for pests and need to be controlled as part of an effective pest control program.
The licensee must correct by implementing an effective pest control program in all animal areas including cutting and
maintaining overgrown vegetation surrounding the fox enclosure.
