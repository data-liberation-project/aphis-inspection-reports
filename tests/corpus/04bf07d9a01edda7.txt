OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
One enclosure in use for two dogs does not have adequate areas of shade. The material in use will not provide
shade throughout the day. Lack of shade may cause dogs to overheat and create discomfort for the dogs. Dogs in
all outdoor enclosures must be provided with areas of shade at all times. Correct by 11 June 2016.

At the time of the inspection (10:15AM) the water receptacle for two dogs was dry. The facility representative
provided water for these dogs while the inspectors were present. The dogs drank off and on for one minute astimed by the inspector's watch. Lack of water may cause the dogs to dehydrate and overheat. All dogs must be
provided with water as often as necessary to ensure their health and well-being. Corrected at the time of the
inspection.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At least two of the water receptacles are green with algae along with some debris on the bottom and insects floating

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Weeds and grass have grown-up to be 2-3 feet tall around the perimeter of the dog enclosures. Uncontrolled
vegetation may harbor vermin and pests. All weeds and grass must be controlled. Correct by 15 June 2016.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Flies were observed around many of the enclosures and on several dogs in both the outdoor as well as the indoor
housing facilities. Some of the dogs were observed snapping at the flies, shaking their heads and taking protection
in their shelters. Flies can transmit diseases, cause distress to the dogs, and create trauma to the dogs. A better
method of fly control must be established and maintained. Correct by 11 June 2016.
