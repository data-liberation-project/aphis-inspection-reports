2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the inspection two separate incidences were observed during which visitors to the facility were feeding and
petting the goats, zebu, pigs and llama in the petting zoo area without any readily identifiable employees present
within visual distance of the animals and visitors. The inspectors were told that during the first incident the
employees were offsite for lunch. During the second incident the employees were working at a different part of the
facility and could not visually monitor the animal-human interactions. Lack of employee oversight of direct
interactions between the animals and the visitors may lead to injury to the humans and/or injury or distress to the
animals. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times
during periods of public contact. Correct from this day forward.
3.53(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Inspectors noticed that the outdoor rabbit enclosure was empty. The facility representative stated that the rabbits
had gotten out of the enclosure about a week ago. The representative stated that facility personnel have tried but
been unsuccessful in catching the rabbits and that the rabbits are sheltering under a small outbuilding. Inspection of
the rabbit enclosure showed a section where the chicken wire making up one side of the enclosure had become
loose creating a gap through which the rabbits escaped. Three rabbits were noted grazing near the entrance booth
late in the afternoon. The domesticated rabbits living outside of a structurally sound enclosure may be injured and
are susceptible to predators. Primary enclosures for rabbits shall be structurally sound and maintained in good
repair to protect the rabbits from injury, to contain them, and to keep predators out. Correct by July 1, 2016.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several areas of fencing require repair/maintenance:
*Two young goats were noted in the visitor walkway area of the petting zoo. From this walkway they had access to
the parking lot and the drive leading to the main road. The facility representative stated that the goats were small
enough to get through the fence panels of the petting zoo enclosure fencing at will and that as they got older thiswould no longer be an issue.
*Two pigs were noted wandering on the property between buildings and enclosures and around the parking lot area.
*Multiple areas of enclosure fencing had loose fence posts and /or sagging wire fencing including one area where a
tree had recently fallen and still lay across the top of the fence, another area where a tree was removed but the
fence material was stretched and loose and leaning posts with sagging fencing at the far end of the barn camel
pasture. Extra fencing material/gates were stacked and leaning against the fence opposite of the drive through
camel enclosure thus putting unnecessary pressure on the fencing material.
Lack of sound fences can lead to escape of animals, entry of unwanted animals/people and/or injury to the animals.
All outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
The camels and goat cited on the previous inspection report are currently under veterinary care.
