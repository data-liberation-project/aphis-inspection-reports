Facilities, general.
Storage. There are accumulations of spilled guinea pig feed, dust, dirt, clutter, debris, and stacked empty transport
enclosures around the wooden feed bin adjacent to animal room # 2.

Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in areas that protect supplies against spoilage, deterioration, and
contamination from insects and vermin such as rodents. Spilled feed and clutter near food supplies, can attract insects
and mammalian pests. Dust, dirt, clutter, and debris can make it difficult to identify pest problems. The licensee must
ensure that the food storage area is kept clean to prevent contamination of the feed by insects and vermin. Correct by
