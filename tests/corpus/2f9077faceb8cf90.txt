FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
After continued rainstorms, two of the outdoor enclosures that house 7 wolves do not have adequate drainage. The
two enclosures are located on the west side of the facility, and the rain has soaked the soil to create muddy
surfaces throughout much of these enclosures. Proper drainage is necessary to ensure the animals have clean, dry
and comfortable enclosures at all times, and the accumulated mud promotes sanitation and husbandry issues.
The licensee must ensure that all enclosures have a suitable and effective method to prevent the accumulation of
both water and muddy surfaces. To correct this issue, the licensee plans to strip the affected enclosures down to
the rock surface, dig a trenching system utilizing pipes to remove the excess water, and cover the pipes with gravel
and a wooden platform.
The facility's Wolf Encounter Experience is under review.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
