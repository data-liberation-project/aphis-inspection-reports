ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a dead and decomposing newborn guinea pig observed embedded in the feeder. There was feed piled
on top of it and the licensee had not observed the dead animal in the feeder prior to adding more feed. Additionally,
there was an adult female guinea pig that had been housed separately because the licensee had observed a
swollen and irritated genital area which has since resolved. However, the licensee was unsure about the nature of
the condition and had not contacted the attending veterinarian as specified in the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC)
whenever there is a condition identified that the licensee is unsure of.
Failure to conduct a thorough daily observation of the animals and failure to communicate with the attending
veterinarian regarding health issues observed in the animals can result in a worsening of the condition and delay in
appropriate treatment.
The licensee must conduct daily observation to assess the health and well-being of the animals and must
communicate with the attending veterinarian on problems of animal health.
3.25(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several of the guinea pig pens had a wall height of 6.25-6.5in, allowing for for potential escape and injury of the
animals. Housing facilities for guinea pigs need to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals. Failure
to do so can lead to injury or death from falls to the ground, escape from the barn, or becoming trapped outside of
the pen. Correct by increasing the height of the sides of the pens so that the animals within cannot climb or jump
out.
3.25(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The guinea pig pelleted feed is being stored either uncovered in plastic buckets or in the original bags with open
bags not stored in secure containers. Bedding is being stored in open bags on the ground.
Feed/food and bedding that is stored inappropriately can result in deterioration of the food or be contaminated bypests, mold, or other sources and if used, cause illness in the animals.
Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against spoilage or
deterioration and infestation or contamination by vermin.

3.26(d)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In the upstairs guinea pig room, there is an approximately 12in x 12in square of exposed insulation in the ceiling
adjacent to the guinea pig enclosures. The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed
and maintained so that they are substantially impervious to moisture and can be readily sanitized. This exposed
insulation cannot be sanitized and may have a negative impact on the health through the extra exposure of dust and
debris from this insulation. Correct by repairing the ceiling so that this surface can be readily sanitized. Correct by
January 16, 2020.
3.28(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On the upper floor of the building, in the first 4 sets of pens closest to the stairs in the 2nd aisle there are broken
wires around the automatic waterers with sharp points present in the interior of the pen.
Failure to maintain enclosures in good repair and free from sharp points can result in injury to the animals.
Enclosures must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs from injury.
3.29(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
In one of the guinea pig feeders, a neonate carcass, approximately 4in long, was found to be embedded in the feed
with only the head visible initially. The carcass showed evidence of decomposition with the skin darkened, dried,
wrinkled, and a dark skin spot on one side that had a white, powdery areas within it. The carcass had shavings and
feed adhered to it. This same feeder also had fecal pellets observed in with the feed.
When the facility owner was shown the carcass, he explained that since he was adding treated feed to the animals
upon the advice of the Attending Veterinarian (AV) in response to a recent diarrhea outbreak, he was not filling up
the feeders through the back but rather adding the treated feed on top of the front of the feeder. He had not noted
the carcass previously and stated that he likely just added the new feed on top of it without realizing it was there.
The carcass was then removed from the feeder.
Food for guinea pigs must be free from contamination and must be wholesome and palatable. A decomposing
carcass within the feeder will discourage guinea pigs from accessing that feed as well as contaminate their feed,
which can lead to weight loss and increase in disease in the animals. Correct by removing all feed from that feederand ensuring that fresh feed is not added to contaminated feed/feeders. Correct from this day forward.
3.30 DIRECT
WATERING.
There are several water bowls that contain water that is brown in color with fecal material observed floating in the
water. In the enclosures with automatic waterers, the nipples in several enclosures are in need of cleaning and are
coated with a layer of grime and debris.
Dirty nipples and dirty water that contains fecal material may reduce the potability of the water or present a health
risk to the animals in the affected enclosures.
Potable water must be provided daily and open containers of water and water nipples should be cleaned and
sanitized when dirty.

3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Under the clean layer of bedding in several enclosures there is a thick layer (up to 2 inches) of compacted wet
bedding containing a large amount of fecal material. The licensee stated he is cleaning these pens every 2 weeks
although the program of veterinary care specifies cleaning at least once a week. In a couple pens there is an
accumulation of spider webs with embedded pieces of bedding suspended from the top of the enclosure directly
above the guinea pigs contained in the enclosure.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the
enclosure, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
There was an accumulation of spiderwebs above several of the guinea pig enclosures. The spiderwebs extended
from PVC pipes overhead to the sides of the enclosures themselves. Premises, including buildings, shall be kept
clean and in good repair. Spiderwebs over the enclosures can have a negative impact on animal health through the
potential introduction of debris into their enclosure. Correct by cleaning and maintaining buildings that house guinea
pigs. Corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.Additional Inspectors
