ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
APHIS inspectors arrived at the facility at 8:51 am on 20 May 2015. After arrival, inspectors called the telephone
numbers listed in the file in an attempt to request access for inspection. The calls received no answer, and one of
the voice mailboxes contacted was full. At approximately 9:00 am, inspectors spoke with a female employee, who
had just arrived at the facility. After identifying ourselves and stating our purpose for being at the facility, inspectors
requested that she have the owner meet the inspectors at the front gate in order to conduct an inspection. At 9:23
am, inspectors again called the telephone numbers listed in the file. Throughout the waiting period, inspectors
honked numerous times in attempt to gain access to the facility and make their presence known. At 9:40 am, after
receiving no contact from any facility representative, the inspectors determined that the licensee was refusing
access for inspection, and subsequently left the facility. All licenses must allow APHIS officials to inspect and
photograph the facilities, property and animals as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the Act and
assess the health and welfare of the animals.
