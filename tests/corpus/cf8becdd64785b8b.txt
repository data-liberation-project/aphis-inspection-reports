3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Semi" there was seven enclosures housing twenty one dogs that had brown greasy residue on majority of
the floor space and walls of the sheltered part of the enclosures. The licensee stated that they are cleaned and
sanitized every two to three weeks and was planning to clean and sanitize the entire "Semi" building on Saturday.
The accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, and excreta can cause disease and attract pests. The licensee must
sanitize used primary enclosures at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph
(b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent the accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta,
and other disease hazards.
