3.80(a)(2)(ii) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A cynomolgus macaque was found deceased in his cage one morning, having been trapped between the squeeze
bar and cage door overnight. Presumably, the squeeze had been activated by the affected animal or his cage mate
at some point during the night. Necropsy showed bruising from the animal trying to free himself, with no other
significant findings that would have caused death.
This incident was reported to USDA Animal Care. The facility promptly instituted preventative measures, including
the use of chains/locks to prevent inadvertent activation or animal manipulation of squeeze mechanisms, and
reminding staff to check the squeeze mechanisms several times a day.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the nonhuman primates from injury.
CORRECTED PRIOR TO INSPECTION.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
