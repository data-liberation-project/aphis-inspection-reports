The facility has obtained a new attending veterinarian who has been out to the facility, inspected the animals and
has written a program of veterinary care. The written program of veterinary care does require additional information
to be complete in providing for adequate veterinary care for the animals. The additional information required
includes: approved drug use information for all drugs on hand and routinely administered preventative drugs (to
include name of drug, species approved and dosage/frequency of administration), approved capture drugs that
facility administers (name of drugs, species approved and dosage), preventative shampoo name (hedgehog), name
of fly spray to use daily and directions for blood parasite control in bat eared foxes.
This is a focused inspection on the the veterinary care citations on the previous inspection report (2.40a1, 2.40b1
and 2.40b2). All animals cited for veterinary care issues have been evaluated by the attending veterinarian.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.
