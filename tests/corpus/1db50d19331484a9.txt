ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection a guinea pig was found in distress. Licensee consulted the Attending Veterinarian via phone call
and was given authorization to euthanize the animal. Euthanasia solution is kept on hand at the facility. The written
program of veterinary care indicates euthanasia will be preformed only by the veterinarian. The written program of
veterinary care provides guidance for the Licensee and must accurately reflect what treatments and medications are
to be used on the animals to assure appropriate animal care is given. The written program of veterinary care must
be updated so it is correct and accurate.

2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two guinea pigs were found during inspection which have cloudy eyes. The right eye of an adult red/brown and
white female guinea pig is cloudy and appears to have a divot in the central cornea. The hair from the inner corner
of this eye is missing. Licensee stated he noticed this soon after her pups were born near the end of February, but
did not start treatment or consult with a veterinarian. A juvenile grey/brown and white guinea pig has a cloudy left
eye and persistently squints. Examination revealed a possible divot in the cornea at the top edge of the eye. Eye
problems are painful and if untreated may result in loss of vision. These animals must be examined by a licensed
veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Documentation of the veterinarian's assessment, treatment, and plan shall
be maintained for examination by APHIS officials.
