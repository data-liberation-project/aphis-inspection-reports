3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The metal lining in three egress doors in the second building inspected had a rough, deteriorated surface at the
base.
- One plastic floor board in the second building inspected had rough and torn edges from being chewed. The
chewed edges are deeply pitted and dirty.
- Three enclosures in the third building inspected had support bars along the base of the outdoor portions with
peeling and deteriorated rubber/truck bed liner leaving a rough surface and exposed rough metal.
- Two enclosures in the fourth building inspected had support bars along the base of the outdoor portions with a
deteriorated painted metal surface leaving a rough, rusted surface.
Surfaces that are rough, rusted, and deteriorating are not able to be adequately cleaned and sanitized and may play
a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens,
and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility--must be constructed in a manner and made of
materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. The
plastic floor board was corrected during the inspection. The rest to be corrected by 3 September 2016.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives, Kendall Lundy, ACI and Margaret A.
Shaver, VMO in attendance.
