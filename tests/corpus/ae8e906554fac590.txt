FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The metal trays for the mongoose and the woodchuck enclosures have sections that are rusted to the point the
area is flaking off and these areas cannot be effectively cleaned and sanitized. These trays need to be replaced to
facilitate cleaning and keep the enclosures in good repair.
*** The woodchuck enclosure has a wire mesh platform that is broken and bent upwards creating sharp edges in
the enclosure. This mesh needs to be replaced for the safety of the animal.
