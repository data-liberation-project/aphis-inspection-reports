Handling of animals.
No readily identifiable attendants were present during observed periods of public contact with the pigs and the rabbits
during this inspection. One of five attendants on duty was readily identifiable but was not present during periods of public
contact for the above interactions. Not being present and identifiable poses an injury risk to both the patrons and the
animals during public feeding and contact. A responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant
must be present at all times during periods of public contact. Correct by June 24, 2021.

Outdoor housing facilities.
No barrier preventing interaction between patrons and 2 brown lemurs was in place along the bamboo trail. Allowing the
public to interact with nonhuman primates in an unattended manner puts both the patrons and the lemurs at risk of injury
and/or disease transmission. Fixed public exhibits housing nonhuman primates must have a barrier between the primary
enclosure and the public at any time the public is present, in order to restrict physical contact between the public and the
nonhuman primates. An appropriate barrier was put in place during this inspection. Corrected on June 17, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
