3.1(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The water receptacle being used for the wolf/dog hybrids is chewed along its upper edge resulting in a rough,
jagged surface. Surfaces that are rough and jagged cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. All surfaces must
be constructed and maintained in a manner that allows them to be adequately cleaned and sanitized.
3.4(b)(4) DIRECT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Bedding is not provided for the two wolf/dog hybrids in their outdoor shelter. The temperature at the time of the
inspection, as recorded by the inspector's Kestrel was 19.3 degrees F. Lack of adequate bedding may cause
discomfort for the animals as well as may not allow the animals to maintain normal body temperature. Outdoor
shelters for dogs must be provided with bedding when temperatures are below 50 degrees F and additional bedding
when temperatures are below 35 degrees F. Correct by close of business today.
3.81(c)(4) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There is an individually housed marmoset in the barn area with no opportunity to see or hear other compatible
nonhuman primate species. The facility'(cid:25)s environment enhancement plan for nonhuman primates does not address
the special considerations for this individually housed marmoset. Individually housed nonhuman primates are at risk
for behavioral problems if their social needs are not addressed. The licensee must have a written environment
enhancement plan that outlines the special attention to be given to any individually housed nonhuman primate that
is not able to see or hear nonhuman primates of their own or compatible species. These special considerations
must be based on the needs of the individual species and be in accordance to the instructions of the attending
veterinarian.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Wire mesh fences being used to line the enclosure fences in the outside goat enclosure have wire points protruding
into the enclosures. Also, the lower section of this mesh fence is curling upwards into the enclosure exposing this
mesh openings to the animals.
The metal threshold to the raccoon housing is rusted to the point that portions of it turned up into the ramp area
exposing this animal to sharp exposed metal edges.
These areas of sharp edges, wire points and exposed mesh openings can cause injury to the animals. All surfaces
must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Two service entry gates that are a part of the facility's perimeter fence were observed to be left open during the
time of this inspection due to construction taking place within the facility. Also, the public entrance gate, that is a
part of the facility's perimeter fence, does not close completely. When closed, there is still a gap between the gate
and fence of several inches. Open gates in the perimeter fence results in breaches in the fence as thus no longer
serves as a secondary containment system. All gates must be securely closed at all times. Correct by 12 March
