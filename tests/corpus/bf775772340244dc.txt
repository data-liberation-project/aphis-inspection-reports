ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There were at least 4 adult rabbits that had long toenails. These rabbits included a female dark otter Netherland
Dwarf, a female gray Mini Rex and two female red Holland Lops. Some of the toenails on these rabbits were
approximately an inch long and could get caught in the wire flooring of the enclosures. The nails were long on both
front and rear feet of these rabbits. The licensee must trim the toenails of these animals to ensure that the animals
can move normally and prevent the potential for injury. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the
licensee must establish and follow a program of regular toenail maintenance for all the animals to prevent the
overgrowth of toenails.
***There was a young female tan and white rabbit with a lesion on its nose. The nose had a yellowish material that
appeared cobblestone and crusty-like in nature. This material covered the animal's entire nose and some of the
surrounding fur. The skin appeared reddened along the edges of some of the material. The animal turned its head
away when the licensee attempted to touch the nose area. This animal was not receiving veterinary care for this
condition which could be due to an infection, illness or other veterinary medical condition. The licensee must have
this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate
treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that the treatment plan is followed
***There was a female chinchilla with a mass on its chest/abdominal area. The mass was approximately the size of
a golf ball, appeared pedunculated, and would slightly move/swing and could touch the bottom of the wire cage
when the animal walked. The more ventral portion of the mass had a thin amount of hair to no hair on it. There was
also an approximately 1/4 inch linear reddened lesion located in the hairless region of the mass. According to the
licensee he had noticed the mass at least since May of this year. He said that the mass seemed to get smaller when
the chinchilla was nursing in May but, afterwards, it grew again. The licensee had not contacted a veterinarian
regarding this animal's condition which could be due to a variety of veterinary medical conditions. The licensee
must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and an
appropriate treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that the treatment plan is followed
TO BE CORRECTED BY: December 15, 2014.***There were two bottles of Sulfadimethoxine solution with labeled expiration dates of 12-13 stored inside the
animal facility. According to the licensee, he would add the solution to the animals' drinking water approximately two
times a year for four to five days. The usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to
be an acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the
dosage level and expected results when expired drugs are administrated could be changed or may not work as
anticipated. The licensee must estblish and maintain a program to ensure that all used medications have not gone
past the labeled expiration date. TO BE CORRECTED BY: December 11, 2014.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

***Within the indoor building housing rabbits and chinchillas there was a build up of hair, debris and some cobwebs.
At least 15 rabbit enclosures had an excessive amount of hair on the tops, fronts and/or sides of their enclosures. A
build up of hair and/or debris was also present on and around the water lines in front of the rabbit enclosures.
Cobwebs were present on portions of the ceiling and along some portions of the walls of the building. Also, some
fecal material was observed on the floor scattered away from the primary enclosures and near the corners and
edges of the building. At least 6 used nesting boxes, that had not been cleaned and contained a variety of bedding,
hair and excreta within them, were sitting on top of some of the rabbit enclosures. The build up of hair, debris and
cobwebs increases the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that the premises remain clean in order
to protect the health of the animals and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
