2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 2 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. A brown and white adult guinea pig in Pen 64 was
observed on its side and appeared unable to sit, stand, or walk. The animal appeared lethargic and was kicking the front
and rear legs occasionally. A brown and white adult guinea pig in Pen 66 was observed with the right eye that was red
and protruding with a bulging, yellowish circular area in the center. The licensee said daily observation had been
performed approximately 4 hours prior to the inspection and the animals with health conditions were not observed and
were not being treated.
The lethargic guinea pig on its side and the guinea pig with an abnormal eye may be in pain or distress and failure to seek
treatment can result in worsening of the condition.
The licensee must communicate with the attending veterinarian to evaluate these animals and determine an appropriate
plan for diagnosis and treatment.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
