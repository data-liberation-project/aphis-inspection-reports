3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1) The shelter for the Alan Front 7 pasture (housing 14 sheep) has the plywood rotted/worn away on the lower right
front inside wall leaving sharp, jagged edges to the wood panel. There was a board that had broken off to a sharp
point loosely attached to the bottom of the back wall. Animals lay against the walls of the shelter and may be injured
by the jagged wood. The lightning rod for the shelter is detached from the roof and is hanging down by the left side
of the shelter entrance. The cable for the lightning rod is also detaching from the upper front outside left wall of the
shelter and there are nails dangling from the cable. Animals may be injured if the nails or lightning rod fall to the
ground. The outside metal surface of the shelter has rusted sharp edges that may injure the animals if they rub or
lay against the sharp metal edges. There were hoof tracks and bare ground indicating the sheep spent time in the
shade behind the shelter where there were sharp metal edges.
2) The shelter for the Left Horse Paddock 5 pasture (housing 16 sheep) has the wood rotted/worn away on the
lower back inside wall leaving sharp, jagged edges to the wood panels. Animals lay against the walls of the shelter
and may be injured by the jagged wood.
3) The outside metal surface of the shelter for the Patterson(cid:25)'s Field 3 pasture (housing 41 goats) has rusted sharp
edges that may injure the animals if they rub or lay against the sharp metal edges. The rain gutter on the back of
the shelter is no longer securely attached and must be repaired to prevent it falling and providing a source of injury
to the animals.
These animal shelters must be repaired to prevent injury to the animals. The facility must establish and maintain
a program to keep the animal enclosures, including shelters, structurally sound and in good repair. This is a repeat
citation under this paragraph that remains uncorrected.
The inspection was conducted 3 November to 5 November 2015. An exit interview was conducted with facility Vice
President; David Oelberg, VMO; and Mary Geib, VMO.
