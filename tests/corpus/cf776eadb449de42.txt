**** In the second whelping building a male Chihuahua named T-Rex has an accumulation of dark brown material
coating the entire surface of the cheek teeth and canine teeth to the point where the teeth are no longer visible. The
gum line has receded from the surface of the front teeth and the cheek teeth. These signs are consistent with the
presence of dental disease, can be painful, lead to the development of other health problems, and can inhibit the
ability of the animal to eat normally. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and
appropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided to
the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

**** In the second whelping building a five year old male Chihuahua named Spanky is sitting motionless in his
enclosure and appears to be having trouble with his vision. The owner stated that he is blind and his sight has been
gradually getting worse over the last three or four months. Throughout the inspection, Spanky never left the rear
corner of his enclosure. Spanky's eyes are both fully dilated and unresponsive to the light. The owner stated that the
vision loss has not been evaluated by a veterinarian. The loss of vision could be neurological, infectious or from
some traumatic injury. Untreated or undiagnosed injuries can negatively affect the health and well-being of the
dogs. This animal must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment administrated.
Documentation (health records) should be available on all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended
treatment must be part of the documentation. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary

hard with many small lumps inside the larger tumor. Boop also has an accumulation of dark brown material coating
the entire surface of the upper cheek teeth. There was a creamy white discharge along the gum line. The gum line
is red and swollen and has receded away from the teeth. These signs are consistent with the presence of dentaldisease. The buildup of abnormal material on teeth with a discharge at the gum line can be painful. It can impact
the ability of the dog to eat, affecting the health and well-being of the dog. Dental disease can be painful, lead to a
decrease in appetite and infection in the mouth. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian
and appropriate treatment plan administrated. The outcome of this examination must be documented and provided
to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all
times.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** In an outdoor enclosure, a year old female Sharpei named Sissy has a creamy greenish discharge coming
from her left eye. The owner stated that Sissy had bilateral entropion surgery on her eyes when she was six weeks
old . The documentation from the attending veterinarian states the surgery was performed on 1/2/13. The dog holds
the eye partially closed. This could be due to an infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions.
The attending veterinarian had not been consulted nor had any treatment been provided at the time of inspection.
Eye problems can be painful causing discomfort which affects the health and well- being of the dog. The licensee
must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

**** In an outdoor enclosure a female Schnauzer named Heidi has matted hair on the legs, neck, shoulders and
back covering approximately 80 percent of the body. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris
and moisture and affect the skin. It can foster skin infections, affect the animal's mobility or be able to defecate
normally. Matted hair does not maintain the same insulating qualities of normally groomed hair. The licensee must
remove all matted hair and establish an effective program for coat maintenance for the health and well- being of all
the dogs at the facility.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**** In the indoor whelping building the feet and legs of Pomeranian puppies were observed passing through the
enclosure floor openings numerous times. Three puppies are in contact with the affected flooring located in indoor
housing. Flooring that allows the feet and legs to pass through any openings can be stressful and could lead to
possible injury. In addition, the daily activity and mobility of the puppies is affected. The licensee must ensure that
all flooring does not allow any feet or legs to pass through any openings in the flooring. * To be corrected by 10-15-14.
