ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:35 pm on
25-Feb-19.
Knocked on door of the residence, no answer. Then called licensee's cell phone and left message. Was notified
shortly thereafter that the licensee was away on errands and couldn't get back in a reasonable time for an
inspection.
