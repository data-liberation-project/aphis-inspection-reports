2.40(b)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility maintains controlled drugs obtained from the attending veterinarian for the purposes of emergency
immobilization of the fisher, red and grey foxes, bobcats and coyotes in case of escape, including two different bottles of
expired telazol (2016 and 2017), and expired xylazine (2019). Expired drugs may have lost potency and sterility and the
effect of the drugs may be unpredictable, potentially leading to injury, illness or death. The facility must ensure the
availability of appropriate equipment to comply with standards of veterinary care, including tranquilization and anesthesia.

2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A wild opossum entered the red fox enclosure; five days later the male red fox was found dead. Daily observations of the
animal were not adequate to identify a bite wound and the resulting life threatening illness, so that the Attending
Veterinarian could initiate treatment. Timely and accurate information on animal health must be communicated promptly
to the attending veterinarian.



Correct from this date forward (October 07, 2021).
3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
Critical:
On 09/21/2021, a dead opossum was found in the red fox enclosure, apparently killed by the male fox, who was found
dead on 09/26/2021, with a bite wound perforating the rectum that is thought to have led to infection and sepsis,
presumably causing the death of the fox. Multiple trees with branches hanging over the chain link fence surrounding the
enclosure may have provided a method of entry for the opossum, or it may have entered through a gap in the top of the
chain link over the center of the large gate at the side of the enclosure. Enclosures must be maintained in good repair to
ensure safety and prevent access by wild animals that may harm the animals in captivity.

Non-critical:
A roughly 6 by 8 inch section of the floor of entrance to the mountain lion den box was cracked, split and part of the upper
white layer was removed exposing the wood underneath. Cracked and deteriorating den box floors may present a hazard
for injury and are difficult to clean properly to ensure santitation standards are met. The facility shall ensure the housing is
maintained in good repair and is structurally sound to protect the animals from injury.

3.127(d)



Facilities, outdoor.
Multiple sections of the perimeter fence had gaps at the bottom edge, including two approximately 16 inch by 24 inch
sections by the stream, several areas approximately 6 inches by 10 inches in height behind the raptor enclosures, and a
similar gap between the two halves of the gate near the bear enclosure. Gaps in the perimeter fence of this size do not
restrict wild animals from access underneath the fence, potentially leading to contact with animals in the enlosures, as
demonstrated by the presence of a wild opossum in the red fox enclosure prior to the death of the male red fox. The
facility must ensure that the perimeter fence is maintained in good repair and restricts access by wild animals underneath
it.

Corrected during the inspection.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
Multiple refrigerators (located near the fox housing, in bear housing, and in the facility kitchen) had black mold on the
seals of the doors, as well as on the door of the large walk-in freezer in the kitchen. The grout around the kitchen sink
and mink swimming pool had black mold growing on and in it. Mold may be responsible for contaminating food and
enclosures resulting in illness in animals. Multiple small trees were observed overhanging the red fox enclosure,
potentially providing a method of access for wild animals into the captive animal enclosure. The facility must keep the
premises clean and in good repair to ensure the health of the animals.

3.131(d)

Sanitation.


Rodent feces were observed on kitchen counters, in kitchen drawers, and in support areas for the bear and white tail deer
that were used for feed storage. Rodents may carry infectious diseases and harbor ectoparasites that can affect captive
animals. The facility shall establish an effective program for pest control.
