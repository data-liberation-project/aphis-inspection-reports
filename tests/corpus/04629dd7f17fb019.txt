2.40(a)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Program of Veterinary Care instructs the licensee to administer Ivermectin as a heartworm preventative to all
adult dogs once a month from April through December. The licensee informed me the dogs were last given
Ivermectin on May 20th, 2017. In addition the dental procedure calls for the licensee to "apply fluoride". The
licensee has never applied fluoride and doesn't even have it in stock. Not following the Program of Veterinary Care
doesn't ensure that the dogs are receiving proper treatment or care. The Program of Veterinary Care must be
followed from here on out.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Flies were observed throughout the entire kennel. Dead flies were observed on the window sills and floor. Live flies
were observed flying throughout the kennel, within the enclosures, and at times dozens of flies would be flying
around or landing on individual dogs. One female dog nursing puppies was observed to have about 6-12 flies on
one of her teats. Flies can be an annoyance to the dogs and are capable of transmitting disease. The licensee has
a pest control program in place, but the preventative is clearly not working and needs to be reevaluated. The
licensee should consult with the Attending Veterinarian and develop a new plan for controlling the flies throughout
the kennel. Correct by 8/7/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
