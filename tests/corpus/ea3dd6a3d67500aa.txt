2.33(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
Study and brood stock animals are not being attended over weekends and holidays. Animals are provided food by
automatic feeders to last them through the weekend, but there is no one observing or checking them during this time. On
the daily observation records the weekends and days around holidays were blank for many days. Each research facility
shall have a person providing daily observation of all animals to access their health and well being. The observation may
be done by a person other than the attending veterinarian as long as there is direct and frequent communication so timely
and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well being is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian.
