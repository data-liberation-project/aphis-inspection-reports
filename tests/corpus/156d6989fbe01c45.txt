2.40(a)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** There were two great pyrenees puppies that was diagnosed with sarcoptic mange by the attending veterinarian.
They were being housed along with 3 young llama(cid:25)s. The attending veterinarian stated that she wanted all of the
animals to be treated with injectable ivermectin. Instead the llamas were treated with oral ivermectin by the owner.
The owner stated that he did not know that he was not supposed to treat the animals orally. Since the owner was
said to have already treated the animals the veterinarian was unable to treat with the injectable for fear of overdose.
There are no records of the oral ivermectin being given, the amount, dosage and route in which the medication was
administered to the animals. To ensure the proper medication was given and the condition was treated
appropriately the attending veterinarian should have the appropriate authority to make sure the provision of
adequate veterinary care has been given to the animals.
