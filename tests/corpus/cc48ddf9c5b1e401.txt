2.33(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
A room containing 11 adult rabbits in building A was not checked over the weekend by staff. The staff had been notified
that the room was in use. The rabbits were last checked on Friday afternoon (1/22/2021), and then not again until
Monday morning (1/25/2021). The rabbits were assessed by a veterinarian on Monday (1/25/2021) and appeared
healthy. The animals still had water and hay present. A daily observation is required to ensure that any issues are then
conveyed to the attending veterinarian for assessment. Corrected prior to the inspection.
2.38(f)(1) Critical

Miscellaneous.
An adult female pigtail macaque (#Z15297) was left in a trapping run for at least 12 hours without access to food or water.
The animal was observed in the morning of 4/19/2020, but was not present in the compound in the afternoon. Although
the staff looked in the trapping run, they did not see her. In addition, the staff believed the animal had been moved. The
next morning, the animal was found in the trapping run. The macaque was moderately dehydrated, given immediate
treatment, and had recovered by the next day. Physical harm or unnecessary discomfort may occur if handling of all
animals is not done as expeditiously and carefully as possible. A specific plan with correction dates must be developed
by 3/25/2021.


3.80(a)(2)(iii) Critical

Primary enclosures.
During the overnight hours, an adult male pigtail macaque (#L11117) broke two locks on the connector between two side-
by-side cages, and managed to push the cages apart. This event allowed both the male macaque and his cage mate, an
adult female pigtail macaque (#T02319) to escape into the room. Both animals as well as several other nonhuman
primates housed in the room were injured. A total of seven animals were injured. The injuries were mainly to the hands
and fingers of the animals, and also included minor facial lacerations in the male pigtail macaque. All of the animals were
treated by the attending veterinarian and recovered from their injuries. Enclosures that do not securely contain the
nonhuman primates and prevent accidental opening of the enclosures can lead to injuries of the animals. A specific plan
with correction dates must be developed by 3/25/2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
