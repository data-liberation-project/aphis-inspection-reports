2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30 on
13-Feb-18.
I arrived at the property at approximately 11:30am, knocked on the front door and rang the doorbell repeatedly. I
received no answer. I then called the contact number and left a voicemail regarding the fact that I was present and
wished to preform an inspection. I waited half an hour and left the property.
