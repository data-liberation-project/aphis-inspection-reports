PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** There is a long crack in the glass of the orangutan enclosure #3, approximately 34" in length. The integrity of
the glass is compromised and can potentially lead to injury or escape.
Primary enclosures should be constructed of a suitable material as appropriate for the species contained therein to
prevent escape or injury. The glass must be replaced to ensure the enclosure is structurally sound to contain the
animals. Correct by May 22, 2015
NOTE: A work order has been submitted and replacement of the glass is scheduled.
The exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
