2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
At least 4 litters of puppies were found to have no individual information recorded on cage cards. The information
provided on the current card system was adequate for the other litters of puppies. Failure to properly identify
animals makes animal traceability very difficult to impossible and may impede follow-up of any safety, health and
welfare concerns. Puppies need to be individually identified with all necessary information. Correct this by ensuring
proper identification to all adult dogs and puppies at the facility.

Inspection and exit interview conducted with Licensee and Veterinary Medical Officer, Michael Neafsey.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “delivered by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector delivered the
original inspection report, which occurred on 17-August-2016.
