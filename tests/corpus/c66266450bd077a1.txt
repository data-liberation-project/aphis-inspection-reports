FACILITIES, INDOOR.
This inspection was focused on the rabbit barn only.
In the rabbit barn, there were two areas that were no longer substantially impervious to moisture or readily sanitized.
On the floor of the aisle between the male rabbits the surface of the floor had flaked off, exposing porous concrete.
This area of floor was approximately two feet by two feet in size, spanning more than half the aisle that can no
longer be readily sanitized. Above the rabbit enclosures, the vent for the swamp cooler had rusted edges and fur
caked on the edges. The rusted areas can no longer be readily sanitized. A system of maintenance must be in
place to ensure all interior surfaces are maintained in accordance with the regulations to ensure the health and well
being of the animals.
