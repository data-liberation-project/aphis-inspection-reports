ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(a)(b)(c) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available
to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process. Since there is no itinerary indicating where the
licensee is located when not exhibiting, USDA could not conduct an inspection.
At 1300, on 06/02/2016, USDA did not know where to locate a responsible adult to accompany APHIS Officials on
an inspection.
The itinerary does not give locations when not exhibiting. Since Mr. Davis is on continuous travel status, he needs
to include all locations when exhibiting and when not exhibiting.
To be corrected by 6/21/2016 with a complete itinerary submitted to the Regional office to include:
The name of the person who intends to exhibit the animal and transport the animal for exhibition purposes, including
any business name and current Act license or registration number and, in the event that any animal is leased,
borrowed, loaned, or under some similar arrangement, the name of the person who owns such animal;
The name, identification number or identifying characteristics, species (common or scientific name), sex and age of
each animal; and
The names, dates, and locations (with addresses) where the animals will travel, be housed, and be exhibited,
including all anticipated dates and locations (with addresses) for any stops and layovers that allow or require
removal of the animals from the transport enclosures. Unanticipated delays of such length shall be reported to the
AC Regional Director the next APHIS business day. APHIS Regional offices are available each weekday, except on
Federal holidays, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
