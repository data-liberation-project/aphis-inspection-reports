ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****Three adult dogs had excessive matting of their hair coat. There were clumps along the back and hips and
numerous twists of the hair along the sides, legs and ventral area. Matted, twisted hair can pull at the skin and
cause discomfort and possible injury to the skin. The condition of the underlying skin under matted hair cannot be
observed nor treated. Matted, twisted hair cannot insulate the dog for protection from the sun and temperature.
The owner must ensure that the matted hair is removed. Any skin conditions must be appropriately treated. The
owner must have a regular schedule of grooming to prevent matted hair.
Female Yorkshire Terrier (m/c 051-817-008) had matted tufts and twists of hair along the back legs and hips.
Male Maltese (m/c 092-304-052 ) had twists of hair on the face, back legs and hips and clump of feces hanging
under the tail
Female Yorkshire Terrier (m/c 473-A73-6B10) had clumps and twists of hair on the hips, sides and back.
