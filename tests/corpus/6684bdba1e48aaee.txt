PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
Approximately, 55 white transport enclosures housing hamsters and guinea pigs were not properly labeled. The
"Live Animal" label on top of the transport enclosures were only 1/2 inch in height. The sides of the transport
enclosures were not marked with the words "Live Animals" and the enclosures did not have arrows or other
markings to indicate the correct upright position of the containers (see air waybill number 006 LAX 71436783).
Carriers and intermediate handlers must not transport live animals unless the primary enclosure is clearly marked
on top and on more or more sides with the words "Live Animals" in letters a least 1 inch in height, and with arrows
or other markings to indicate the correct upright position. Failure to label primary enclosures properly can result in
animals being transported incorrectly and can put animals at risk for injury.
