FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength
Within the shelter for the "camel pen" and "dry lots" there are areas on the ceiling where the plastic covering the
insulation is worn and/or completely absent. This has exposed some of the insulation and in some areas the
insulation is falling down from the ceiling. There was a small amount insulation located on the ground within two
pens in this area. There are seven camels, sixteen zebu and four watusi located in this shelter.
On the outside of the Zebu shelter, there is a large area of rusted metal running along the bottom of the shelter. The
rust has eroded the metal. This erosion has created holes in the metal and jagged edges. The rusted area runs
along nearly the entire East side of the shelter. There are twenty zebu located in this portion of the facility.
Failure to maintain animal housing facilities can lead to animal illness or injury. Housing facilities shall be structurally
sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from illness and injury.
