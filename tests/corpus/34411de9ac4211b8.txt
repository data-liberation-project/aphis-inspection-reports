2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are two goats, "Spot" and "Jr.", with rear hooves that are in various stages of overgrowth with some mild
cracking of the hoof along the lateral edges. One alpaca, "Demi" has overgrown toenails on both front feet such
that they curl inwards towards each other and almost touch. If left uncorrected, overgrown toenails and hooves can
lead to joint or foot problems. To avoid future problems a regular program of hoof/foot observation and trimming
needs to be maintained. Trimming should occur as frequently as is necessary to maintain a normal hoof and foot
posture. Correct by June 19, 2017 then continuously thereafter.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
