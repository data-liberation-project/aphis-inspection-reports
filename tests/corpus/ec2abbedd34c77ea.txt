3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The front gate attached to the perimeter fence had a 6” gap along its bottom edge and the rear gate had a 10.5” gap
along its bottom edge. The perimeter fence had three areas where a burrowing animal (likely a gopher tortoise) created a
den directly under the fence line. These burrows created gaps up to 8” deep under the fence. Animals and unauthorized
people can use these gaps to enter and exit the area and gain access to the animals behind it. The perimeter fence must
be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary
containment system for the animals in the facility.
To be corrected by the next re-license inspection.
