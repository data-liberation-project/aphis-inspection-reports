2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:16 am on
03-Aug-17.
A relative answered the door and when asked for the licensee told me "She just left for work." I called the primary
phone number and was told that she would be returning after 2:00 p.m. Upon calling licensee's cell number it went
straight to voice mail. I left a voice message and placed my business card in the mailbox. I left the premises at
11:56 a.m.
