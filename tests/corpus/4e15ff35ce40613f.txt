3.28(c)(1)

Primary enclosures.
The guinea pigs are housed in shoebox-type enclosures. The enclosures measure 21.5 inches long by 13 inches wide by
9 inches high. After subtracting the floorspace with inadequate height (less than 7 inches) due to the feeder feature in the
lid, the effective floorspace is about 221 square inches. This is enough space for the enclosures with two animals, but is
inadequate for the one enclosure holding three animals. The animals do not exhibit signs of distress in their current
enclosure.
The guinea pigs currently weigh about 500 grams each; guinea pigs over 350 grams require a minimum of 101 square
inches per animal.
Adequate space to move about and make normal postural adjustments is important to the health and well-being of the
animals.
Correct by moving the affected guinea pigs to an appropriately-sized enclosure by 2/11/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel.
