2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the drug log for controlled substances it was discovered that on 6/2/17 a kudu antelope (animal ID # 112081)
was euthanized with euthanasia solution that had expired in January, 2017. Records for the controlled drugs,
overall, were inadequate, as assigned bottle ID numbers were listed on the log, but bottles present in the cabinet
were not numbered, and there was no corresponding inventory sheet available to show corresponding lot numbers
with expiration dates, and the assigned bottle ID numbers.
The use of expired medications could be harmful or ineffective. The facility should ensure that appropriate
measures are utilized when it is necessary to euthanize animals covered under the animal welfare act regulations,
including the use of pharmaceuticals that are in-date and properly handled. The same goes for all medications used
for covered animals, and records should be adequate to substantiate appropriate usage of drugs.
To be corrected from this time forward.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility does not have a perimeter fence that adequately fulfills the requirements described in 3.127 (d). The
facility is in the process of expanding and enhancing the perimeter fence at present. The purpose of the perimeter
fence is to prevent people and animals from passing under or through the fence and entering the premises, and
also to act as secondary containment, in the event that an exhibit animal should escape its enclosure. At the time of
inspection the following problems were observed:
- Around the back side of rhinos the fenceline is not complete, and so they are not encircled by an eight foot
fence, as required, since they are classified as dangerous animals;
- In some areas the fencing is comprised of a wire mesh with openings close to the ground that are up to sixinches in height and width. Such openings could allow animals to pass through the fence;
- A gate in the perimeter fence, which serves as the parking exit, is left open and unattended throughout the day.
Whereas the entrance gate is visible to the nearby office area, and employees are available to monitor and close
the gate if needed, this exit gate is more remote, and not easily monitored.
- When closed after hours, the entrance gate has a nine inch gap underneath the gate, which could allow animals
to pass under the gate.
These are examples of where the perimeter fence falls short of meeting expectations. Failure to provide and
adequate perimeter fence could put the well-being of the animals at risk, due to the possibility of harmful
unauthorized contact with people or animals, including exposure to animals that could introduce diseases, and also
due to the risk of inadequate containment in the event of an escape. The facility should continue with its plan to
complete the perimeter fence and bring all sections into compliance.
To be corrected by 3/22/18.
This inspection was completed on 9/21/17 and 9/22/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the animal collection manager and other facility
representatives.
