ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The approved written program of veterinary care (PVC) did not include the wallabies, prairie dogs, goats, cavies,
sheep, deer, rabbits, porcupine, and coatis. All covered species should be addressed in the PVC to ensure the
facility has a program to follow concerning the care of all the animals. Failure to do so could adversely affect the
health and well-being of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Metal fencing material wrapped around the bottom of a tree has come undone and can potentially cause injury to
the covered petting zoo animals housed in this area. Failure to maintain enclosures in good repair could injure the
animals. A system should be in place to ensure enclosures and all animal areas are structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

WATERING.
In the deer, goats and pigs enclosure, a water receptacle contained a moderate accumulation of greenish-brown
material along its inside surface. Failure to maintain water receptacles in a clean and sanitary manner can adversely
affect the health and well-being of the animals. The facility should ensure all water receptacles are clean and
sanitized as required.
