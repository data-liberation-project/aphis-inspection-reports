3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
Five sugar gliders disappeared from a new enclosure a couple of days after being moved into the enclosure. The facility
discovered there was an approximately five-foot tall vertical PVC pipe in the middle of a fake tree that did not have a
cover. It was well hidden and not identified prior to the animals being moved into the enclosure. The five gliders fell into
the pipe and were unable to escape. All five gliders were found dead.
The facility is responsible for ensuring enclosures housing animals are structurally sound and in good repair. Future
mammal enclosures need to be thoroughly checked before moving animals into the enclosure.

Space requirements.
A Patagonian cavy and a capybara are being housed in an approximately 20’ x 6’ enclosure with a small pool for the
capybara. The cavy is fed in a 3’x3’ enclosure within the 20’x6’ enclosure and housed in the 3’x3’ enclosure overnight
because the facility has concerns about aggression from the capybara. These enclosures do not allow either animal the
opportunity to perform normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement such as running,
playing, foraging, or hiding.


The cavy needs to be moved to a different enclosure that allows him unlimited time outside of the 3’X3’ enclosure. This
will allow the capybara a small increase in space which could be used to provide him a hiding area.
Animals need to be provided with appropriate space to perform normal postural and social adjustments to prevent stress
and abnormal behavior and to encourage normal movement and exercise to maintain adequate health.

Employees.
While walking through the facility during this inspection, it was observed that many of the animal enclosures were in
various stages of daily maintenance but very few employees were noted. The facility was asked how many full-time
mammal keepers were supposed to be on staff. The answer was 5. They were then asked how many mammal keepers
were on staff. The answer was “2 mammal keepers show up reliably, the others show up occasionally”.
Lack of adequate employees can result in inadequate animal care. If mammal keepers are only showing up occasionally
then the mammals are not receiving adequate care consistently.
The facility needs to ensure there are adequate employees consistently to provide the animals with appropriate care such
as ensuring new enclosures are safe before animal are moved into the enclosure.
