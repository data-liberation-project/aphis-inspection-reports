FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the gate to the tiger enclosure the ground has eroded away creating a gap of about 6 inches between the
ground and the fence. There is also a 4-inch gap between the door and the post. This is enough for the tigers to
reach their paws through.
On the backside of the lion enclosure, the ground has eroded away creating a gap of approximately 6 inches high
and 37 inches long between the ground and the fence. This is enough for the lions to reach their paws through.
This situation puts the animals at risk of injury in the event that one of their limbs become trapped in one of these
holes or animals can reach and injure some employee working in the area, also this issues have reduced the
structural integrity of the enclosures.
The primary enclosure fence must be in a good state of maintenance, and built and maintained in a manner that
protects animals from injury and contain them.

3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is a perimeter fence that surrounds just the lion and tiger enclosures. There are several sections of this fence
where the ground has eroded away and created a gap. There is no support bar or wire along the bottom edge of
the fence.
The areas of erosion combined with the lack of bottom support for the fence has reduced the structural integrity of
the fence and could allow persons or animals to travel underneath it.
The perimeter fence shall be in good repair, and constructed and maintained so that it prevents unauthorized
persons and animals from going through it, and also must function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the zoo. Licensee must correct this by replacing the eroded soil along the fences lower edge or by other means that will
minimize the gap and ensure that people or animals can not travel under it.

FEEDING.
There are 3 Nubian goats, who are nursing at this time that are in poor body condition (thin). It can be observed in
the goats that the bones of the hip and the spine are markedly protruding. The animals are currently being fed with
Mazuri all purpose for Hoofed livestock.
The diet shall be prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size and type of animal.
Failure to provide an adequate diet will result in malnutrition with the risk of a compromised immune system, less
ability to handle the stress, and poor body condition.
The licensee shall consult with the Attending Veterinarian concerning proper diet and the amount to feed the
different
animals, and shall document the feeding plan, and then that plan must be implemented.
Correct immediately.
