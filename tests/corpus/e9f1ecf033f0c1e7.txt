ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Two adult male dogs were observed in need of dental care. An adult male Poodle, microchip # 152106481A,
was observed with significant coatings of brownish material on the canine and cheek teeth as well as an
accumulation of brownish material that obscured the outline of the tooth on the left upper side. A male adult West
Highland Terrier, microchip # 089297547, was observed with accumulations of brownish material on the lower left
cheek teeth as well as extensive discoloration of the canine and cheek teeth. The gum line of the left lower canine
was receded significantly with a grayish coloration to the edges of the gums in this area. These dogs had been
identified by the attending veterinarian in May, 2014 for required dental work. Since that time the owner had
provided dental work to these dogs at the time of grooming approximately two months ago but at this time the dogs
are still in need of a more thorough dental cleaning to remove the accumulations on the teeth. Both dogs should be
examined by a licensed veterianarian for these dental issues. To be corrected by: 09/10/14
