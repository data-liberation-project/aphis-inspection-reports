2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During a birthday party held in the facilities Learning Center a serval lunged at and scratched a child. The facility
schedules birthday parties and uses requested educational animals at these parties. The facility allows the public to
touch the 4 year old serval on the back if the serval is sitting. This animal has been used in this way for 3 1/2 years
and was being handled by a keeper with over one year of experience with this animal.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
The facility is not currently using the serval for programs and will not allow public contact with the serval again. The
facility is also re-evaluating all of its public contact policies. Appropriate measures must be taken to prevent injury
to the public and to the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Director of Animal Programs and Education.
