FEEDING.
During inspection on May 6, 2015, APHIS officials observed a male Himalayan bear that was grossly obese. This
animal had a sagging abdomen and obvious fat over the hindquarters. The attending veterinarian is aware of the
bear(cid:25)s status. The bears are fed a variety of foods, however, a large amount of bread was observed inside of the
enclosure. The licensee, in conjunction with a licensed veterinarian, needs to re-evaluate the current dietary regime
and implement weight reduction feeding plan that is prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size
and type of the animal for their health and well-being.
