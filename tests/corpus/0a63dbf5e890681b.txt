Contingency planning.
At time of the inspection, the facility was experience a failure of the HVAC system which allowed the temperature in the
facility to rise to at least 89 degrees. This temperature is above the regulatory requirement for many animals housed at
this facility .
The contingency plan present at time of the inspection does not address a HVAC failure. This could be reasonably be
anticipated considering the age of the building and demands placed on the HVAC system in the extreme summer heat.
Dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan to
provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and care of their animals in the event of an
emergency or disaster (one which could reasonably be anticipated and expected to be detrimental to the good health and
well-being of the animals in their possession).

The facility was experiencing HVAC issues at time of the inspection . The temperature inside the facility near the rabbit
exhibit was 85 degrees. The animal care manager stated to inspectors he would have fans brought to this area or could


move the rabbits to a cooler part of the facility . Approximately 1.5 hours later, the temperature in this area had risen to 89
degrees and fans had not been provided nor had the animals been moved. One rabbit was laying stretched out next to
the cool brick wall in the exhibit . This is a sign the rabbit may be experiencing discomfort due to the temperature increase
. At inspectors request ,the rabbits were removed to a cooler part of the facility. Indoor housing for rabbits shall be
provided with auxiliary ventilation when the ambient temperature is 85 degrees or higher to provide for the health and
comfort of the rabbits. CORRECTED DURING INSPECTION
