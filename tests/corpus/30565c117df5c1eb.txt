2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
The facility is operating as a dealer without a valid USDA Animal Welfare Act license. The facility consigned the following
animals at the September Triple W Alternative Livestock auction in Cookeville, Tennessee without a valid license: three
lemurs (auction tags 114-116), two ferrets (102) and a total of sixteen guinea pigs (103-108 and 174-176). The auction
consignment paperwork for the facility lists a USDA license number submitted by the facility to auction personnel but it is
a license that has been inactive for over a year and was in another facility's name.
A valid license is necessary to protect the health and well-being of the animals and to comply with the Animal Welfare Act
and Regulations.
The facility needs to obtain a USDA license or discontinue regulated activities.

NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED UNTIL A USDA LICENSE IS OBTAINED.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with two facility representatives at the auction.
