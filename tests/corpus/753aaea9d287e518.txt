ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two dogs had veterinary care issues that had not been addressed by the Attending Veterinarian. The first dog was
a black male Shipoo puppy born 10/4/17. The puppy had been given lactated ringer fluids by the licensee. After
receiving fluids the puppy lost its hair in the area surrounding where the needle had been inserted under the skin.
At least three scabs were observed in this area. In addition this puppy's left eye was clouded over. The licensee
had observed the hair loss on the back, but had not noticed the eye prior to inspection.
An adult female West Highland Terrier (microchip #004-368-822) had a puncture wound on the right side of the
back of its neck. The licensee had not observed this prior to inspection.
The Attending Veterinarian had not been contacted for either dog. Hair loss and scabs on the Shipoo can indicate
that the puppy had some kind of reaction from the fluids it was given or it may have some kind of external parasite
which may be contagious to other dogs. The area may be itchy and irritating to the dog and without treatment the
puppy's condition may worsen. A clouded over eye indicates there is something wrong with that eye. The puppy
may have impaired vision and it may be painful to the puppy. The puncture wound on the West Highland could be
painful and if left untreated could become infected and cause systemic problems.
The facility must have these animals evaluated by the attending veterinarian and follow the prescribed treatment
plan. Correct by 12/14/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
