Primary enclosures.
During inspection a ring-tailed lemur was outside the primary enclosure withinn the building it was contained in. The
licensee stated it gets out from in between the panels and has been doing this for awhile without incident. A lemur that
gets out of the primary enclosure can potentially injure itself or other animals within the building. The primary enclosure
must be fixed so the lemur is safely contained.

Facilities, general.
The white arctic fox was seen trotting loose in the sheep/zebu pen. The facility representative said that it was in its new
pen this morning for feeding but must have gotten out. We paused the inspection and gave the facility time to catch it.
The licensee said it was caught without incident and we confirmed it was back in its old enclosure where it had been
contained prior. The facility plans to keep it in the old enclosure until the new area can be closely looked over to ensure it
can't get out again. Loose animals could get injured or injure other animals. Ensure that if it is moved to the new
enclosure that the new enclosure will safely contain it.



Some enclosures have areas in need of repair:
-Muntjac: The fence-line by the gravel path has a gap between the path and bottom of the fence.
-Bison: The fence has an area in disrepair by where they are fed hay. It is leaning and the top rail is detached.
-Male pig: the side of its shelter was broken.
-Sika deer: There is an old section of chain-link fence (no longer used for containing animals) that has fallen over inside
pen where the sika can get to it.
-Female Camel: A section of wire panels in the corner of the female camel's enclosure has fallen over. On the west
fenceline a piece of a fallen tree is leaning on part of the fence and the fence is leaning into the enclosure by the creek.
These areas, if left in disrepair could cause injury or allow animals to get out. Ensure that all enclosures are maintained
structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(b) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The bison are beginning to lack natural or artificial shelter. Many trees in the enclosure that at one time provided
adequate natural shelter (windbreaks and shade) have died and been removed, leaving less natural shelter in their
enclosure. The facility said they plan to get another area ready that has more natural cover. For their protection and
comfort, ensure that the bison have adequate natural or artificial shelter that is appropriate for the local climatic
conditions.
3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
The two brown bears' enclosure, the bisons' enclosure and the male pig's enclosure lack adequate drainage. The brown
bear's have dry shelters but most of their enclosure has mud or standing water, including areas where they are fed and
have drinking water.


The male pig's enclosure's dry spot is limited to its shelter that is bedding to straw.
The bisons' pen has two spots (feeding area and northeast corner of pen) that they can get out of mud or water but their
area to drink water has standing water and most of the pen has mud.
Excess mud and water can cause discomfort for animals and create unsanitary conditions for them. The facility reports
that wood chips are on hand to buildup areas once machinery can be operated. Ensure that these animal's enclosures
are maintained so excess water is rapidly eliminated.
