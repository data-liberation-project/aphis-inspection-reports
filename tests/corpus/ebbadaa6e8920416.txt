ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One male bulldog named Gus microchip # 074-881-620 has an irregularly swollen area of tissue growth about
1inx3/4inx1/2in with some spots of redness on the end of his lower lip. The owner reports that an injury occured
several months ago that may not have healed and that it seems that the area has gotten larger in the last month or
two. The veterinarian has not yet examined the growth but is coming out for a kennel inspection tomorrow and can
look at it at that time. Timely veterinary care is necessary to adequately diagnose and treat diseases and injury.
*The 500 ml bottle of ivermectin being used to deworm the animals expired 7/2013. The written program of vet care
states that the adult dogs are to be given ivermectin monthly after 6 mths of age. Records available for review show
that ivermectin is not currently being given every month. It has been given on 1/28/13, 10/25/13, 11/30/13, 2/12/14
and 3/10/14. Preventative medications need to be given monthly to ensure adequate prevention and/or control of
diseases. Expired medications may no longer be effective so only in-date medications should be used.
The facility shall maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the appropriate methods to prevent,
control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries.
