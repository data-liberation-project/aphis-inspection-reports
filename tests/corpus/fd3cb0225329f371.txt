SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The ambient temperature in the indoor portion of the large dog sheltered building was 45.2 degrees F according to
the inspector's Kestrel thermometer. The ten dogs housed in this building do not have bedding or resting surfaceson the cement floors of the enclosures. Lack of resting surfaces in the cold can result in a dog that is uncomfortable.
The licensee must ensure that dry bedding, solid resting boards, or other methods of conserving body heat must be
provided to the dogs when temperatures are below 50 degrees F in the sheltered housing. To be corrected by 15
January 2020 when the temperature in the sheltered building is below 50 degrees F.
