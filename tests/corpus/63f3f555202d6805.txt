HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the female bulldog barn building, the sheet metal siding along the cement floor has rusted to the point it is no
longer structurally sound and rusted to the point that it is creating sharp points that could injury the dogs. The male
barn also has areas of sheet metal that are rusted or deteriorated to the point that it is no longer structurally sound
and creating sharp points. A gate frame in the outdoor kennel area is rusted to the point that it is no longer
structurally sound and created sharp points that could injury the dogs. Injuries from rusted metal can be painful and
uncomfortable for the dogs. Owner must ensure that all metal used on the buildings and around the dogs is free
from rust, corrosion, is structurally sound and protects the dogs from injury. To be corrected by 09-25-2014.
The female building and the male building had areas of concrete floor of the building where the concrete had
cracked creating holes where dirt, old food and other debris has accumulated. These cracks in the concrete can
harbor harmful bacteria and other vermin that could adversely affect the health and well-being of the dogs. The
cracks must be repaired so the floor is impervious to moisture and easily cleaned and sanitized. All debris must be
removed from the cracked concrete and the area repaired or replaced so that it can be easily cleaned and sanitized.
Licensee must ensure that all the surfaces the dogs come in contact with are impervious to moisture, free of
cracks, and easily cleaned and sanitized. To be corrected by 10-02-2014.
In the whelping building one enclosure had a plastic Rubbermaid lid covering the dog door opening. The plastic
was chewed around the base and part of the frame was broken. The chewed edges cannot be adequately cleaned
and sanitized. The dog door openings on the male barn were covered with a cloth type material that was torn and
tattered. The strains of material around the torn edges could be ingested by the dogs. The material had a dark
brown substance buildup on them. The cloth like material must be impervious to moisture so it can be easily
cleaned and sanitized. The were several shelters in the outdoor section that had areas that were chewed, usually around the openings and
along joints where the shelter are fastened together. The chewed areas cannot be adequately cleaned and
sanitized and must be repaired or replaced so they can be adequately cleaned, sanitized and routinely maintained.
Several shelter appeared dusty and stained. All the surfaces in contact with the dogs must be routinely maintained
so they can be easily cleaned and sanitized.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were at least seven dog doors that had a buildup of grease and grime on them. The door must be routinely
maintained to prevent the buildup. The areas can harbor bacteria or other vermin that could adversely affect the
health and well-being of the dogs. Owner must ensure that all the dog doors are routinely cleaned and sanitized.

3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
They were several enclosures, at least four that were equipped with shelters that were not large enough for all the
dogs. One enclosure with 2 Rhodesian Ridgeback(cid:25)s measuring 40 inches and 38 inches in a shelter that was 38
inches wide and 46 inches wide and 38 inches tall. When both dogs are in the shelter neither have enough room to
allow normal posture positions in the shelter. There were other enclosures containing three or more in an
enclosure with one shelter. A Pomeranian and two Pekinese were in one enclosure. Three Pekinese were in one
enclosure with one shelter. The shelter must be large enough so all the dogs have enough room to sit stand and
lie in a normal manner. When the dogs are not allowed adequate space or additional shelters in a group enclosure,
fights and territorial disputes can flare up causing injuries and undo stress for the dogs. Licensee must provide
adequate space for each of the animals in all enclosures. To be corrected by 09-24-2014

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The area in the back of the male building, next to outdoor enclosures had a buildup of leaves and other matter. The
debris pile was along the edge of the concrete slab, consisting of feces, old food and other debris. Several flies
were observed around the pile of debris, landing on the old food and fecal matter. During the inspection licensee
advised inspector(cid:25)s that one female Shar pie mix dog had problems with flies during the summer. The female Shar
pie(cid:25)s ears were missing hair and scabbed over from old fly bites. The licensee must establish some means of flycontrol in this area of the facility. The fly strike can cause the dogs discomfort and wounds that can be painful.
Licensee must ensure that all the dogs are adequately protected from flies and other vermin. To be corrected by
09-21-2014.
