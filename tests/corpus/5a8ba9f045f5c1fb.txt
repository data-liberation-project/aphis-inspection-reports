3.11(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Inside a sheltered building housing adult dogs and puppies there was a sink containing several miscellaneous items that
also had evidence of pests. The sink contained a stack of bowls with some brown dirt/grime on their surfaces, a heat
lamp, plastic scoop, pieces of insulation-like material and some other miscellaneous items. On the bottom surface of the
sink, some black to brown pellets were observed that appeared to be mice droppings. There was insulation material
stored under the sink which was visible since there was no door to cover the material. There was another sheltered
building, housing a dam and her litter, which had a walkway with some food waste that was scattered across much of the
floor; there were also some areas on the floor with smears of brownish material that appeared to be fecal material.
According to the licensee the floor had last been cleaned/swept prior to the weekend. Accumulations of trash, junk, waste
products, and discarded matter can increase the risk of pests and could negatively impact the health and well-being of the
animals. The buildings and surrounding grounds of the housing facilities must be kept clean and in good repair to protect
the animals from injury, to facilitate husbandry practices required in this subpart, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and
living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin at all times. The licensee started to address these areas of the
sheltered buildings after the inspection of the animals and facilities. To be corrected by: May 19, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
