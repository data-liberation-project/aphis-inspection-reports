Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30 AM on
01/27/2015. The inspector talked with the licensee, who was at home, but is unable to accompany her for an
inspection. The employee who normally goes on inspection had a work change with his day job and was not
available. The licensee must ensure that a responsible adult is available for an inspection during normal business
hours.
