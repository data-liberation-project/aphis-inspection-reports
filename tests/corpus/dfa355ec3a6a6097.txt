Indoor housing facilities.
In a primate building, animal hospital room #302 housing 14 pig-tailed macaques, there was a temperature deviation on
July 10, 2021, the temperature was above 85 degrees F for at least 5 hours. The maximum temperature reached 87.51
degrees F at 10am. This temperature deviation in room #302 also occurred on July 21, 2021, housing 15 pig-tailed
macaques, for at least 4 hours and on July 22, 2021, housing 14 pig-tailed macaques, for at least 7 hours. Temperatures
reached a maximum of 87.85 degrees F on July 21st at 3pm and 88.49 degrees F on July 22nd at 4pm.

The facility manager informed me that an alarm should go off when temperatures are above 83 degrees F for greater than
20 minutes, however the alarm was not working and he was unsure when it stopped working. When the temperature
deviation was identified on July 22nd, animal technicians opened inside doors and placed fans to provide increased air
circulation. The HVAC unit was reset and functioned normally after the reset.

High temperatures can be uncomfortable to non-human primates and may lead to overheating and other medical issues if
prolonged. The indoor housing facilities must be sufficiently cooled when necessary to protect the non-human primates'
health and well-being and must not rise above 85 degrees F for more than 4 consecutive hours when non-human


primates are present.

Correct from this date forward.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In a primate building housing 226 pig-tailed macaques there was significant amount of rodent feces in the ceiling light
plastic coverings of every primate enclosure. There were also rodent feces at the junction of the wall and floor in several
locations in this building. The staff stated they have seen mice and have installed door sweeps, live traps, and put foam
around the foundation of the building, however none of these steps have alleviated the rodent problem.

Pest control measures must be maintained to prevent the harborage of pests, i.e. rodents. Effective pest control
measures must be identified and implemented to eliminate breeding and living areas for the rodents to minimize exposure
to pathogens that may cause illness. An effective program for control of pests must be established and maintained so as
to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
