** Each exhibitor shall have an attending veterinarian who shall provide adequate veterinary care to its animals in

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** There was an incident on July 14, 2016 where the white female adult Bengal tiger escaped its primary enclosure
due to an employee leaving all of the gates ajar. At the time of the incident the “Zoo Camp” children were on the
premises. An intern noticed after the employee opened the gate that the other gates were not closed and ran to
close the gate before the tiger exited the second containment. During public exhibition any animal must be handled
so there is minimal risk of harm and to assure the safety of the public. The facility corrected this by dismissing the
employees involved and reassessed employee training.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the tigers’ and lions’ night houses there are roofing issues that allow water to drain into the ceiling. The wood
has a whitish growth on it and the boards around the edge of the housing are degraded and needs to be replaced.
The roof is flat and it requires repairs to rectify the leaking occurring that can potentially get the animals wet from
inclement weather or injury them if it falls on them.
** Also in the tiger and lions enclosure the night house sliding gates that would give the animal’s access to the
keeper’s area are not secured with such strength appropriate for the species contained. There is a pin lock that can
easily be removed and the lion’s enclosure is not structurally sound and has too much range in its motion.
** In the bobcat’s enclosure there was a possum in the corner that had burrowed in. The fencing around the outsideof the enclosure was no stapled enough and allowed the possum to crawl in. The possum could possibly carry a
disease that can be harmful to the animals. The enclosure should be of such strength to contain the animals and to
prevent injury.
These deficiencies must be repaired or replaced to properly contain these animals and prevent injury.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** The perimeter fence behind the commissary has an abundance of foliage growing through the fence potentially
compromising the structural strength which could allow unwanted animals to climb in the perimeter fence and
escaped facility animals to climb out. The fence must be maintained to prevent this from occurring for the health and
safety of the animals and public. Correct by September 25, 2016
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
** In the ceiling of the tigers’ night houses there were pest living amongst the debris that has collected over time.
There was also a neonatal rodent crawling in the keeper’s area of the tiger’s facility.
** In the bobcats enclosure there was a live possum that had found its way in to the enclosure. He dug a hole on the
perimeter of the primary enclosure and burrowed out during the inspection.
** The pest control program needs to be reevaluated and revamped to accommodate the needs of the animals and
control the insects and mammalian pests on the premises. Correct by September 25, 2016
This was a focused inspection of the tiger and lion enclosure, program of veterinary care, bobcat enclosure and
perimeter fence.
