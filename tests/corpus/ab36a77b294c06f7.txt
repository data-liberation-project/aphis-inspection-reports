2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
1.There is a male Japanese Chin type dog approximately 10 years of age named 'Ki Jack' that does not have official
identification. The dog has an accumulation of greenish-colored mucus covering both eyes. Not having clear vision
can cause discomfort and affect the health and well being of the dog. The presence of eye discharge can be a sign
of injury, infection or other potentially painful veterinary medical conditions. The potential for injury exists if the dog
is not able to see clearly.
The dog was also observed having matted hair on his abdomen. The matted hair area is approximately 1 inch wide
and 4 inches long. Excessive matting causes pain and discomfort to the animal. In addition, matting can foster skin
infections and can hinder the animal's ability to move of defecate normally. The licensee needs to remove the
matted fur on the dog. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must establish and follow a
program of regular coat maintenance for all of the dogs to prevent the development of excessive matting.
On the dog's nose there is a crusty appearance of scabbing caused by numerous fly bites. Fly bites to the nose can
lead to open sores which can cause further disease risks or infection for the dog. Left untreated it could delay the
healing process affecting the health and well being for the dog. Fly bites need to receive veterinary care to prevent
further fly biting and then the nose can start to heal.
2. There is a tan colored male cocker spaniel named ' Poo Bear' with no official identification. The dog has an open
wound on the back of its neck. The wound is approximately 3.5 inches in length and 1.5 inches wide. There is dried
blood on the wound and around the edges in the fur coat. The cause of this injury is unknown. The open wound can
be painful causing discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection which affects the health and well being of the
dog.
Around the dog's nose there is a sore caused by fly bites that is open and areas where the wound is starting to
appear dried and crusty. Pieces of fur are stuck to the moist portions of the wound. Fly bites to the nose can lead to
open sores which can cause further disease risks or infection for the dog. Left untreated it could delay the healing
process affecting the health and well being for the dog. Fly bites need to receive veterinary care to prevent further
fly biting and then the nose can start to heal.
3. There is a male golden retriever named 'Henry James' with an open wound approximately 3 inches in diameter
on top of its left ear. The wound appears moist with a bright red and pink color. There is a hairless area outlining thewound. The licensee believes a pickup camper shell that blew into the enclosure during a storm struck the dog
causing the wound. The open wound can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection
which affects the health and well being of the dog.
*The licensee must have the above animals examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of these consultations must be documented and provided to the inspector
upon request.

2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are at least 36 dogs that do not have an official form of identification. The licensee stated that only the golden
retriever dogs have been microchipped. Official identification is needed to ensure that each animal's identity can be
known with certainty and to facilitate the inspection process. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are officially
identified by collar, tattoo or microchip.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A Golden Retriever is in an enclosure with cattle panels that allow the dog to stick its head through the openings on
the west side. The dog could possibly get its head caught and cause an injury. The panels need to be replaced or
modified so the openings are small enough so the dog cannot stick its head through the openings. The enclosures
must contain the animal securely and restrict other animals from entering.

3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. The far northwest red and white housing facility has outdoor pens constructed of metal panels. On these panels
there are areas that have completely rusted through the material.
2. The southwest housing facility has outdoor chain link kennels. On the bottom right of one of the gates there is an
area that has rusted completely through the metal pipe frame.
*Rust can erode and deteriorate all metal surfaces to the point that the metal surfaces can no longer be readily
cleaned and sanitized because a smooth surface no longer exists. Excessive rust affects the structural strength ofall metal surfaces. Licensee must ensure that this and all other surfaces are free of rust and of good structural
strength.

3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. The northwest building containing golden retrievers has a metal dog door on the west end that has been chewed
by a dog and has a sharp point.
2. The far northwest red and white housing facility has outdoor pens constructed of metal panels. On these panels
there are areas that have completely rusted through the material. The rusted areas have sharp points.
3. The southwest housing facility has outdoor chain link kennels. On the bottom right of one of the gates there is an
area that has rusted completely through the metal pipe frame. This has created a sharp point that the dogs can
come into contact with.
*The potiential for injury exists if the dogs come into contact with the sharp points. The licensee must ensure that all
metal surfaces be maintained in a manner so there are no sharp points.

3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The majority of the housing facilities have an excessive accumulation of exceta on the floor where the dogs are in
contact with it. There is a mixture of fresh and old fecal residue that has dried out and appears white covering at
least 60 percent of available surface flooring. A mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta are on the bottom portion
of the interior and exterior walls of the housing facilities.
Cleaning and sanitation of surfaces that are in contact with the dogs is necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt,
debris, excreta and other disease hazards. Unsanitary living conditions and potential transmission of diseases exist
when surfaces are not cleaned and sanitized. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized
when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
1. Inside the far northwest red and white building there is a bird nest above an enclosure containing one dog. Bird
droppings are on the floor, on the sides of the enclosure and on the food receptacle.
2. In the north center building containing four dogs there are two bird nests. There is an accumulation of bird
droppings in the bedding area.
3. Inside the barn on the east side there is a bird nest above an enclosure with one dog. There are bird droppings
on the side of the walls and in the bedding area.
*Surfaces caked with bird droppings cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must establish an
effective program of bird control and ensure all bird droppings are removed from the kennel area for the health and
well being of the dogs.
