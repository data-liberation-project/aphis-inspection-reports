RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
The facility's acquisition and disposition records relating to at least three sources have been found altered by a
facility representative. There are breed types listed on the facility's records that do not accurately reflect the
information provided by the sellers.
A record of disposition form APHIS 7006, was used to document a transaction that occurred between the broker
and a Class 'A' licensee on 2/15/2016. The broker purchased nine puppies from the seller. Seven Bichon/Poodle
mixes and two Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso mixes are listed on the seller's APHIS 7006 copy. The broker’s copy of the
APHIS 7006 indicates a change was made to the breed type for two Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso puppies after the
transaction was completed.
The puppy identified by seller’s ID number (21BM16) on the APHIS 7006, has had its breed type changed to
Shih-Tzu/Havanese by facility representative(s). The health certificate issued by the broker’s veterinarian lists the
puppy as a ‘Shih/Hava’. The other Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso puppy identified by ID number (22BM16) on the APHIS
7006, was changed to ‘Shihmalt’ (Shih-Tzu/Maltese). This puppy is also listed as a Shih/Malt on the health
certificate.
A focused inspection was conducted on April 20, 2016 at the seller's facility. The seller stated that he has not owned
or sold any Havanese type dogs. The seller also stated he was unaware of any dog breed/type information being
changed on the APHIS 7006 during or after the transaction.
The APHIS 7006 was used to document a transaction that occurred between the broker and a Class 'A' licensee on
3/25/16. The record lists two Bichon and two Chihuahua puppies identified with numbers provided by the seller. On
the broker's copy the male Bichon (#PP-16-49), has had its breed name changed to Bichon/Maltese. The female
Bichon (#PP-16-50), has also been changed and is listed as a ‘Bichonpoo’. The broker's acquisition and disposition
records list the male Bichon (#PP-16-49) as a Bichon/Maltese and the female Bichon (#PP-16-50) as a
Bichon/Poodle. A health certificate issued on 3/29/16 by the broker’s veterinarian, lists the female as a ‘Bich/Poo’.
The male is listed as a ‘Bich/Malt’ on a health certificate dated 3/30/16; also provided by the broker’s veterinarian.
A hobby breeder documented the sale of seven Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso puppies on an APHIS 7006 dated 3/11/16.The broker changed the breed name of six puppies from Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso to Shih-Tzu/Cavalier. The seller
used the identification numbers: #1, #2, #4, #5, #6 and #7. The male Shih-Tzu/Lhasa Apso (#3) was changed to
‘Cavachon’. The altered breed names were wrote on the broker's copy of the APHIS 7006 in section 'F' by a facility
representative. The broker’s acquisition/disposition records and health certificates show six of the puppies listed as
Shih-Tzu/Cavalier King. The other puppy is listed as a Cavalier King/Bichon.
A facility representative stated that records are changed if they believe the puppies do not fit the conformation
and/or color of the breed listed on the sellers’ copy. When records are altered and not consistent with records
provided by the breeder/seller, it can mislead the purchaser of the true breed of the aforementioned puppies,
impede the ability for APHIS officials to track and verify the dogs being purchased and increase the risk of disease
transmission to both animals and humans in the event of an outbreak (brucellosis, parvovirus etc).
