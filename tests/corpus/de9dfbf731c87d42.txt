ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** A current written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is not available for review, although the attending
veterinarian has conducted a site visit. The PVC ensures that a standard system of veterinary care is in place and
acts as the facility guide for the husbandry and care of the animals. The program should be developed and/or
reviewed, signed, and dated at least once a year by the veterinarian and facility representative. A written PVC must
be developed by the attending veterinarian and reflect the current care the animals receive to ensure the overall
health and well-being of the animals.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***Kulan Enclosure: The barrier fence is constructed with a single rope connected to multiple poles in front of the
primary enclosure. The barrier fence is inadequate to prevent the public from coming into direct contact with the
animals. During public exhibition, animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and
to the public. The barrier fence must be constructed in a manner that would ensure the safety of the public and
prevent harm to the animals contained within the enclosure.
3.81(c)(4) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***The spider monkey is single-housed in an adequately enriched environment. He is unable to see other
non-human primates but is in close enough proximity to hear lemurs. An environmental enrichment plan should
address the needs of individual non-primates housed alone that do not have visual and auditory cues from other
non-human primates. Special consideration must be given to non-human primates that are singly housed. A plan to
ensure the psychological health of the spider monkey must be developed with the attending veterinarian,
implemented accordingly; and included in the written environmental enrichment plan.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.***The brown ruffed and ringtail lemurs are in appropriate social groupings and have an adequately enriched
environment.
***The spider monkey is single-housed in an adequately enriched environment.
However, there is no current written environmental enrichment plan available nor is there documentation of
enrichment provided.The environmental enrichment plan must be developed, and reviewed by the attending
veterinarian to ensure the non-human primates have their psychological needs appropriated addressed. A written
environmental enrichment plan must be developed with the attending veterinarian and implemented accordingly for
the psychological health of the animals. Additonally, the environmental enrichment plan must be available for review
by an APHIS inspector to ensure compliance with the standards of the Animal Welfare Act.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength.
***Lion Enclosure: The enclosure is 80 feet x 70 feet and 12 feet in height with no overhang or electric wire. The
enclosure is constructed of the appropriate gauge chain link fencing attached to 12 foot high steel poles, 4 inches in
diameter. Within the enclosure, a 7.2 foot high pyramid-type structure, on which the lion can rest upon, is located
approximately 15 feet 2 inches from the front enclosure fence. There are tall tress (4) with deep roots - no lower
branches - along the right side and back (approximately 8 feet) and on tree on right side is approximately 4 feet
from the enclosure fence. The enclosure currently houses a ~2 year old male lion. Primary enclosures must be
constructed in a manner that will ensure containment of the animal. Based upon known physical and behavioral
characteristics of exotic cats, additional containment measures must be made to the lion enclosure to prevent
escape.
NOTE: The enclosure was evaluated by the exotic cat specialist in June 2014 and recommendations were provided.
***Potbelly Pig Enclosure: A portion of the buried wire fencing is exposed and bent upward. The corner edge of the
fence is pointed and could potentially be a source of injury to the animals in the enclosure. Fencing must be
constructed in a manner that prevents the animals from escaping or injuring itself. The buried fence must be
designed and covered in a manner that prevent the potbelly pigs from exposing and pulling up the fencing for their
safety an d proper containment. Correct by May 15, 2015 (new issue)
