ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female French Bulldog #125 had a quarter size bare skin area on the right cheek. The hairless area on the cheek
was round and the skin was normal color, but was flaky. The licensee was aware of the issue, but had not done
anything for the dog. Skin conditions on dogs can cause irritations to the dog.
The licensee was following a different protocol than the program of veterinary care for routine shots and deworming,
and also added Metronidazole and Albon without consulting their attending vet. There were also medicines on hand
that had no directions from a veterinarian. Giving medications to dogs or puppies without the direction of a
veterinarian may harm the animals.
The licensee must consult a veterinarian about the skin condition, giving medicines without veterinary direction, and
update the program of veterinary care to reflect what is being done in the kennel.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were at least 5 self feeders that had a build up of grime inside the feeders. Along with the grime a few of
those feeders had caked food in them. Dirty feeders can contaminate the food, which can harm the dogs. The
licensee must clean and sanitize the feeders at least every 2 weeks or more often if necessary.
