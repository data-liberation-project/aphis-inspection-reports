3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
There are several areas of the facility that need repair.
- In the dog yard, the dogs have bent the wire fencing away from the fence post, exposing sharp edges of wire and
creating a loose area of fencing. Sharp points on fencing can lead to potential injury and loose fencing can cause a risk of
entrapment.
- In the stable paddock there is weed fabric directly inside the gate that has been torn up and has rough edges. Directly
under the gate there is a plastic piece installed that has broken off in multiple areas, leading to jagged and sharp points.
Exposed and torn fabric can pose an ingestion hazard, especially in young animals and lead to further illness or disease.
Sharp edges of plastic can lead to potential injury of the animals housed within the enclosure.
- In Stall 1, there is some rusting of the metal frame on the right wall in the bottom right corner. Brownish-orange material
was easily removed by touching the surface. The overlying paint is also starting to peel away. The bottom third of the
enclosure walls is created from “Trex” decking with the upper two thirds painted concrete. Directly to the left of the
leftmost stall door, the concrete has several areas of chipping paint that are actively peeling. Rusted metal cannot be
adequately sanitized due to the irregular pitting of the surface. Additionally, peeling paint can be ingested by the animals
and lead to illness or disease.


Correct by December 1, 2022 by making sure all housing facilities for dogs are kept in good repair and protect the animals
from injury.
3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The primary enclosure for the three dogs is not being sanitized every 2 weeks. The facility spot cleans daily and does a
“deep cleaning” every 6 months. For spot cleaning, a combination of detergents and disinfectants are used. However, the
primary enclosure including all walls, floors, and hard surfaces is not being cleaned and sanitized on a routine basis.
Proper sanitization of primary enclosures is important for reducing disease hazards such as: potential odors, dirt, debris,
and food waste, which can lead to an increased risk of illness or disease. Correct by November 8, 2022 by sanitizing the
primary enclosure at least once every 2 weeks following one of the methods prescribed in 3.11b(3).
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The "Cow Hab" pasture fencing contains some locations of disrepair. To the left of the gate at the ground level,
approximately 6 feet of the bottom-most horizontal wire of the metal fencing is separated from the rest of the fence,
leaving sharp edges of vertical wire exposed. Additionally, to the right of the gate, the top wire is separated from the rest
of the fence, exposing sharp vertical wire angled into the pasture. In "Pasture 2" an area of wire fencing has some sharp
areas of exposed wire edges where a supporting fence post was recently replaced. Additionally, the fence has not been
reattached to the supporting wood post. Sharp points on fencing can lead to potential injury.

Correct by December 1, 2022 by maintaining all housing facilities in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals.
