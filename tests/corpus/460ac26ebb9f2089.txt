Exercise for dogs.
There was no written exercise plan for a wolf hybrid that was recently acquired.

Dog hybrids are legally considered dogs for the purposes of the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations. Dogs require
exercise to maintain optimum health and welfare.

Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. The
plan must be approved by the attending veterinarian and must include written standard procedures to be followed in
providing the opportunity for exercise. The plan must be made available to APHIS upon request.
