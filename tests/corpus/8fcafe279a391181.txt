ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***One brown and white, adult, female sheep had a matted coat that needs to be sheared. The wool over her hind
quarters contained mats of varying sizes.
Matted hair coats can cause discomfort for the animals and lead to skin disease and other medical conditions. The
licensee must remove the mats and ensure that all animals have their hair coats routinely maintained in order to
prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases associated with excessive matting. Additionally, the facility must
ensure that the recently sheared animal receives adequate protection from the elements to prevent any discomfort
from cold temperatures.
***Four alpacas (one brown, one tan, and two white) have overgrown hooves. The two white alpacas and the brown
alpaca had toes that were curling in a sideways direction, due to lack of adequate hoof trimming.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful to the animals or
cause injuries. As part of the facility’s program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all
animals receive appropriate hoof care in a timely manner.
***A white, adult, wether, named “Murphy,” was observed to be in poor body condition, with protruding hip bones,
spine, and ribs. The bones of his spine, hips, and each rib were easily felt by both APHIS inspectors upon palpation.
Poor body condition can be an indication of health issues, including parasitism, poor dentition, malnutrition, and
systemic disease. The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems
are evaluated by a veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and appropriate holiday
care for all of the animals at the facility. The animal mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain
accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plans for the problem cited above. The licensee must ensure that all
animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the
program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.2.75(b)(1)(i)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The licensee did not have complete records regarding the acquisition and disposition of regulated animals. For all
of the regulated animals, the name and address of the person from whom the animals were purchased or acquired
was missing. Additionally, the vehicle's license number and state and the driver's license number and state were
also missing.
The licensee informed APHIS personnel that 2 alpacas, 2 goats, and 2 or 3 sheep had been on loan to another
facility last year and not been in his care. These animals were re-acquired by the licensee and were on his premises
at the time of inspection. The facility records did not indicate the animals’ departure or arrival from the licensee’s
premises, nor did they state the name of the facility/person from whom the animals were re-acquired.
Records containing the required information for animals acquired for use in regulated activities, including those
offspring born on premise, are necessary in order to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to
ensure their humane care and use. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain updated records of acquisition and
disposition of all animals that fully and correctly discloses the required information, as mentioned in 2.75(b)(1) of the
Animal Welfare Act.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In an enclosure containing four sheep and five goats, there were two nail heads sticking out of a wooden shelter
structure, where the animals could come into contact with them. Additionally, a piece of the chain-linked fencing had
broken, creating a sharp point that was pointing into the enclosure. On a different wooden shelter structure, there
was a screw protruding above the entrance way, which could come into contact with the animals.
***In an enclosure containing six alpacas, two llamas, and one sheep, metal wires used to create a shelter structure
were pointing outward into the enclosure.
***In the enclosure containing the juvenile, Highland steer, there were several wire points protruding from the
damaged shelter structure into the enclosure.
***The wire fencing along the fence line that is shared between the Highland steer enclosure and the enclosure
containing six alpacas, two llamas, and one sheep, was in disrepair. The bottom of the wire fencing was not
tethered down, and it was curling upwards into the Highland steer enclosure, creating gaps underneath the fencing,where the animal could injure himself. There were numerous portions of the wire fencing that had broken, exposing
sharp metal points that could injure the animal.
***Along the far fence line of the Highland steer enclosure (the fence line opposite the gate), the soil was eroding,
creating a gap underneath the wire fencing. The soil was very loose, and fell out from under the inspector’s feet as
she approached. APHIS inspector measured the gap with her tape measure to be ten inches in height. Along that
same portion of fencing, additional metal wiring had been attached to the fencing. This metal wiring was in disrepair,
as it leaned into the enclosure so the top of the wiring was parallel to the ground. Other portions of the wiring were
lying on the ground, and metal points were pointing into the enclosure. There was a second gap along this far fence
line that was seven inches in height. Surrounding this gap, the metal wiring had numerous sharp points pointing into
the enclosure.
***In the Highland steer enclosure, there was a gap beneath the metal fencing along the side of the enclosure that
was opposite the fence line shared with the alpaca, llama, and sheep enclosure. The gap was several feet long, and
measured to be as high as nine inches. Additionally, this portion of the fence was unstable. The metal structural
pole did not provide adequate support to the fencing, allowing the fencing to be easily movable by APHIS
personnel.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***There was not an adequate shelter structure in the enclosure containing the juvenile, Highland steer. The
licensee stated that the shelter structure had been damaged by the high winds; the tarps that had made up the roof
were ripped and falling into the enclosure. The structure is no longer functional to protect the animal from either
inclement weather or sunlight. The enclosure does not contain any additional shelters for the animal, either natural
or artificial.
All animals must be provided shelter to prevent discomfort, pain, and suffering. The licensee must provide natural or
artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection
and to prevent discomfort to such animals.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
***In an enclosure containing six alpacas, two llamas, and one sheep, there was an accumulation of feces. The
piles of feces covered approximately half of the enclosure.Excessive accumulation of animal waste can increase risk of disease and affect the well-being of the animals.
Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards, to
reduce disease transmission, and to prevent animals from becoming contaminated or soiled. The licensee must
clean this enclosure and ensure that all enclosures housing animals are cleaned as often as necessary to promote
normal husbandry standards.
