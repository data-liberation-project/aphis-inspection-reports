ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On inspection, a female golden retriever puppy with ID 1626 born on 11/14/2014 was determined to be in need of
veterinary care. The left front paw appeared swollen and was larger than the right front paw. On closer examination
there was a skin abrasion near the metacarpal pad. The animal put weight on the limb. The son of the licensee had
identified the injury earlier that day but no treatments were given and no veterinarian was contacted in regards to
the puppy(cid:25)s condition. According to the son, the puppy got its foot caught in between the food receptacle and
flooring. The animal had discharge around both eyes, but was receiving treatment for the eyes according to the
Program of Veterinary Care. Animals not provided appropriate veterinary care will often not improve and will lead to
the worsening of the original condition along with secondary infections. Injuries to the foot often lead to secondary
infections and can cause permanent loss of function in that affected limb. All animals must be provided appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in a timely manner and all treatments must
be approved by the veterinarian either by the Program of Veterinarian Care or by direct communication. At the time
of the exit interview the attending veterinarian arrived and treated the animal. Corrected at time of exit.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
