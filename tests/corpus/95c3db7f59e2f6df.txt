ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:13am on
11-Jun-19.
We were at the facility and called the licensee. Licensee reported that the secretary was gone so he had to run the
office for the day and wouldn't be available and the licensee provided a schedule of availability.
