2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
There was no written program of veterinary care available for inspection. The staff was unsure whether a current
written Program of Veterinary Care was in existence, and they were unable to locate any such document.
A written program of veterinary care helps to ensure that the facility and the attending veterinarian are in agreement
on issues such as animal husbandry, preventive care, emergency care, and euthanasia of animals. The program of
veterinary care should be reviewed by the facility and the attending veterinarian at least annually, to ensure that it is
current and adequate. Failure to maintain a written program of veterinary care could put the welfare of animals used
for future animal activities at risk, and also makes it difficult for USDA / APHIS / Animal Care to assess the facility's
program of animal care and use.
To be corrected by 11/15/15.
2.35(a)(1)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
The facility did not have any minutes available for inspection from their Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) meetings. Failure to maintain records on meetings of the IACUC makes it impossible for USDA
/ APHIS /Animal Care to adequately assess the facility's program of animal care and use, and compliance with the
Animal Welfare Act Regulations.
To be corrected by 11/15/15.
2.35(a)(3)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
The facility did not have any semi-annual reports, from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)
reviews of the facility's program and facilities, available for inspection. Failure to maintain records regarding IACUC
activities makes it impossible for USDA / APHIS /Animal Care to adequately assess the facility's program of animal
care and use, and compliance with the Animal Welfare Act Regulations.To be corrected by 11/15/15.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
