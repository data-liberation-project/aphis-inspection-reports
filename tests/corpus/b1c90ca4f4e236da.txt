SANITATION.
There is a large pile of trash ( feed sacks , discarded large metal items and old wood ) next to the front gate. This is
next to the pen for the goats ,llama and calves. There are weeds growing in the trash pile. Allowing trash to
accumulate serves as an attractant for such pests as rodents and snakes which may injure or transmit diseases to
the animals. Accumulations of trash must be placed in designated areas away from animal housing and cleared as
often as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
