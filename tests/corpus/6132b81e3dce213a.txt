2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** Animal numbers on Form 7005's versus those counted during the inspection were significantly different. 28
adult dogs were counted on hand during the inspection with 32 listed on the Form 7005's. Additionally, 3 foxhounds
were not listed on the on hand record Form 7005's but were counted during the inspection. The Form 7005's for
puppies also had at least 53 puppies listed as being born and added to the Forms but have no disposition dates
recorded. Failure to maintain accurate records impedes in the inspection process and makes animal tracking
difficult to impossible. It is especially important to have current, complete and accurate records in the event of a
disease outbreak. Correct this by maintaining complete and accurate records.

3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** Seven large breed dogs (Dobermans, hounds) are being housed outdoors with 55 gallon plastic barrels as their
shelters. The primary enclosures for these dogs are under a roof and there is a solid fence around the chain link
enclosures. The roof and walls does give the dogs some protection from rain and wind. These barrels, however,
are not large enough for these dogs to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner or to turn about freely. During
inclement weather, these dogs may not be able to stay warm and dry enough to maintain their health. Correct this
by providing these dogs shelters with adequate space.
