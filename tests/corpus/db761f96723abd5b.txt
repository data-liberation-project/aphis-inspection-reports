ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Appropriate Methods of Treatment
At least 5 Chinchillas have a crusty yellow discharge around one or both eyes. Some of these Chinchilla's cannot
see because their eyes cannot open on their own. This has been an ongoing problem which has been assessed in
the past. However, the problem persists and the licensee is currently treating it with Ciprofloxacin. The licensee
states that the Ciprofloxacin was prescribed by a Veterinarian, but there are no instructions on how to administer the
drug, what dosages to give, or how long to treat the animals. Medication given without proper diagnosis, or without
the authorization a veterinarian can have harmful side affects, and may cause further health problems. The 5
Chinchillas displaying eye irritation must be seen by a veterinarian and a treatment plan must be created and
followed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength
In at least 6 enclosures, there are blocks of wood being used as enrichment. The animals have chewed these wood
blocks to the extent that they are exposing nails which were inside them that now poses an injury hazard. Direct
injury and infection can occur by exposing animals to sharp or rusted objects. Remove any enrichment containing
sharp or rusty objects. Correct by 06/10/2014
DIRECT/REPEAT
Enclosures housing approximately 25 chinchillas contained a tray on the floor in the past which the animals had
direct contact with. These trays have since been removed, exposing 1 inch by 1 inch metal wire flooring
underneath. At the time of the inspection, A newborn chinchilla was observed stuck with the top half of its bodyhanging down through the floor. The chinchilla had to be physically pulled out by the licensee. The floor no longer
protects the animals from injury, as the gaps between the wire are much larger than the feet of the chinchillas.
Materials that come in contact with the animals must protect the animals from injury. Ensure that the enclosures are
structurally sound and maintained appropriately.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Lighting
There continues to be sections of the facility which to not have adequate lighting and a flashlight has to be used to
properly inspect some animals and enclosures. Without adequate lighting, there is no way to conduct daily
observations of the animals and enclosures. Adequate lighting must be available in areas where animals are
present.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
Water Receptacles
There continues to be many sections of the watering line that has an excessive buildup of hair, cobwebs, and
excreta built up on them. Unclean watering lines can contaminate the water supply which can affect the animals in
a negative way. All watering lines must be cleaned or replaced in order to assure a clean supply of water to the
animals.
3.131(a) DIRECT REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures
There was an excessive accumulation of excreta and food waste in many of the primary enclosures. Some animals
currently cannot find adequate areas in their enclosure where they can stand or walk without being in waste. There
were multiple primary enclosures and enclosure runs throughout the facility that had an excessive accumulation of
wood shaving waste, cobwebs, fur, and dust. The facility failed to maintain the primary caging of these animals in a
sanitary condition. Unsanitary conditions can lead to biological disease hazards and can affect the comfort of the
animals as well as their health and well-being. Eliminate the buildup of waste material from the primary enclosures
and maintain in a clean and sanitary condition.3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Housekeeping
The facility has an overly excessive accumulation of soiled bedding, excreta, feed, non used cages, enclosure parts,
and construction material throughout the facility. These areas can contain insects or vermin, can contaminate clean
materials, or can make the atmosphere inside the facility unsafe to breathe. The facility must be cleaned and any
unused hardware must be moved somewhere away from active enclosures. Correct by 6/20/2014
3.132 DIRECT REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
Employees
There were numerous repeat and/or direct noncompliances identified on the inspection. The licensee stated that in
order to properly clean some areas, other areas must be neglected. The licensee also stated that he has hired an
employee on a part time bases, however the employee has not started working in the animal facility yet. Without an
adequate number of trained employees, both the animals and the facility itself do not receive the proper amount of
care that is required for good husbandry practices. The licensee must attain enough employees to adequately and
properly care for the animals and preform all husbandry requirements.
