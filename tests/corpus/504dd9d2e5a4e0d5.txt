3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* A mixture of dried dirt, grease and other excreta was observed on three plastic dog igloo shelter houses and
along the bottom of an estimated six sheets of tin. Three dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces which are
located in outdoor housing. The affected area covers approximately 20 to 30 percent of the plastic igloo shelter
structures and 15 to 20 percent of the sheet tin located on the east side of the enclosure. Sanitization of surfaces is
necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, excreta and other disease hazards. Unsanitary living conditions and
potential transmission of diseases exists when surfaces are not cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure
that all surfaces are cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks or more often if needed. Correct by
10/23/14.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 10/9/14 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of inspection report was sent by certified and regular mail.
