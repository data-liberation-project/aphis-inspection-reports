FEEDING.
There were 2 adult brown bears present at the time of inspection on travel status with the food available for them
being a large amount of bread, some carrots and some romaine lettuce. Their main food source at the time of
inspection is bread. Bread with carrots and lettuce as supplements does not comprise a wholesome and nutritive
diet for adult brown bears and may be more appropriate as a treat. The diet must be prepared with consideration
for the age, species, condition, size, and type of animal for their health and well-being. The licensee corrected this
item at the time of inspection by going to store and bringing back a large amount of fresh fruits and vegetables.
This item was corrected at the time of inspection and must be corrected from this point forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the licensee. This inspection was conducted at the Shriner's Auditorium in
Wilmington, MA on Apr 22, 2016.
