EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
There was no written exercise plan for the facility, although the dogs were provided with large enclosures. It is
important that the dogs have opportunity for their natural movements in play, exercise and socializing with other
dogs and humans to promote good physical and mental health. A written exercise plan that is approved and signed
by the attending veterinarian is important to indicate that the dogs have the opportunity for exercise. The licensee
must have a written exercise plan, signed by the attending veterinarian, on hand at the facility.

WATERING.
In the outdoor enclosures there were 4 water receptacles that had a green residue on the inside surface. The water
appeared to have a faint green tinge to it. Clean water receptacles are important to promote good health to the
animals and reduce the risk of disease. The water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized and maintained.
