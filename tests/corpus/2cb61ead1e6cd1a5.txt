2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Facility representative could not locate the acquisition and disposition records, and the Program of Veterinary Care.
If the representative does not have access to the records, then one solution is to keep the originals in the files and
make a copy of the records for daily use. This is important to ensure the well being of the animals and that they are
being properly cared for.
