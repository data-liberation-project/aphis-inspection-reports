2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The 8 alpacas which were in the park all summer were not sheared this past summer season. Temperatures this
past summer were consistently in the upper 90s to 100s. A white alpaca in the inner park is covered with thick ropy
hair over its trunk. When this alpaca was palpated through the thick hair, its ribs, spine and pelvic bones could
easily be felt. The only feed observed for these animals was a small amount of wet hay. This animal hair needs to
be thinned to remove some of the knotting and check the skin underneath. In the future, all fleece producing
animals need to be sheared on a regular basis before summer heat. The alpacas need to be checked by the
Attending Veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment of weight loss and shearing recommendations.
The written Program of Veterinary Care states the wolf hybrids will be given monthly heartworm preventative. The
keeper records reviewed for the past 6 month do not indicate any administration of heartworm prevention
medications to regulated canids. The Attending Veterinarian needs to be consulted about how to proceed with
blood parasite prevention for these canids.
3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The four wolf hybrids are in two enclosures made of wood posts and wire fencing. The wood in these enclosures
have not been cleaned and sealed to make them water impervious. Other species including, but not limited to,
avian and hoof stock have previously been housed in these enclosures. All surfaces which come into contact with
dogs need to be water impervious. To be corrected by 12-11-15.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The shelter (behind the primate barn) for several donkeys and 12 sheep is in disrepair. On one end there is a loose
post and board. In the side there is a hole large enough for small sheep to go through. A shed type building used
for feeding and shelter for 3 ibex has a hole in the floor, a warped floor board, and loose boards and a gap at theentrance. The ceiling of this same building is molded plastic insulation. The back corner wall board in the shelter
for the 3 alpacas in the inner park is loose and has nails protruding. The baby aoudad was seen going under a gap
in the enclosure fence into the adjacent closed area. The 3 alpacas in the inner park are in a 3 board wood
enclosure fence which they routinely leave to eat grass, as evidenced by the fecal piles. Behind the USDA barn a
tall chain link divider fence has a 1.5 foot gap at the bottom that the deer are using to duck under the fence. There
is a large tree root exposed there. Between the root and the small hole the deer could injure themselves. A few
baby deer are going back and forth under the gate into the Christmas light area, exposing them to possible injury in
this area.
All animals need to be contained within their enclosures to prevent possible injuries or entrapment in the adjacent
areas. All structures need to be repaired or replaced to prevent injury or escape of animals.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Bagged commercial bread being fed to the hoof stock is stored in an open trailer. This trailer is not covered to
protect the food from the rain, predators &/or pests. The plastic trash cans used to transfer the opened bread to the
fields have dirt caked on the insidesl. Large cardboard boxes containing individual boxes of crackers for an
upcoming event are stored in the old elephant barn. In at least three areas, these boxes were torn open down to
the crackers, apparently by a raccoon as evidenced by tracks seen in the mud in the barn. Food is to be stored in
facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. To be
corrected by 11-11-15.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence has gaps in several areas including: along the bottom next to the access drive from the parking
lot, including a large rodent hole; the black cloth material used as a blockade next to the public parking lot is down in
one large section and the fencing under it is loose at the bottoms and seams as seen when a peacock walked
through it; a rectangular gap in the upper fence near the old admissions building; the 2(cid:29)X4(cid:29) wire fence along the
main road next to the zoo has multiple areas of gaps up to 8 inches and easily moveable fencing.

The perimeter fence shall be maintained in good repair to restrict animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it and having contact with the animals, and so it can function as a secondary containment system
for the animals in the facility.
3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS. A juvenile bear is being housed in a concrete den measuring approximately 20 feet by 10 feet and 5 feet high. This
bear is rotated with two other groups of bear. Two other bears are housed individually in dens on the days they are
not rotated out. These dens are approximately 10 feet by 10 feet and 5 to 6 feet high.
All housing areas where animals are being kept shall have sufficient space for them to make normal postural
adjustments and freedom of movement. For bears this includes the ability to stand on their hind legs. Even though
these bears are rotated through a larger area, the amount of time they are spending in what used to be just shelters,
but now serves as a primary enclosure for long periods of time, requires more space to be provided.
To be corrected by 1-29-16.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The enclosure with the two juvenile bears housed at the primate barn is excessively muddy and dirty with at least 12
fecal piles. There were at least 3 pile of feces in the concrete tunnel den box for a female bear. This is her only
shelter from the elements and because it is small, there is nowhere for her to lie down without lying in feces. The
concrete den type shelter housing the single juvenile bear who is rotated out into the waterfall enclosure is
excessively dirty with feces and food wastes. A strong odor was smelled at the back doorways of the den and the
bear could be heard sloshing through standing water in the den.
The tiger Kashmire was housed for 2 days in the back up rotation enclosure when seen during this inspection. The
tiger was wet and muddy on both sides from the chest back to its tail. The enclosure was wet and muddy on one
side and feces and a urine puddle were on the other side. There is not a dry area for the tiger to lie out of the wet
areas. At another back up enclosure with a locked up tiger, a foul odor resembling rotted meat was detected. The
gravel area at the end of the concrete pad appeared brown and dirty. The wooden boards on the outside frame of
this den have a black grime covering them.
A small pile of hay was in the small building used as a second shelter for three ibex. The wood floor under the hay
pile has a black layer of grime and numerous roly poly bugs.
Two attached bones from a dead animal limb (possibly a deer) were found in the USDA barn. No other remains
were seen. Observations and cleaning in this barn need to be conducted more often to help determine what may
have happened to this animal.
All enclosures need to be adequately cleaned on a regular schedule to prevent contamination of the animals, to
minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
3.131(c)SANITATION.
Numerous areas throughout the park contain areas of discarded non-animal related materials. Inside the safari,
near the storage semi-truck are unstacked pallets, rusted barrel lids, old and fresh fecal piles, and pieces of fencing.
Behind the USDA barn, there is an old tire, metal posts, half buried chain link fencing, and tarps. Beside and
behind the enclosure containing 3 alpacas are piles of discarded building materials. These and other areas near
animal housing areas need to be cleared of extraneous materials.
Several animals are allowed free access in these areas. There is a risk of injury or entrapment. These areas also
serve as breeding areas for pests and vermin which can potentially harm or transmit disease to the animals.
To be corrected by 1-8-16.
3.133
SEPARATION.
Keepers notes show a baby alpaca died on 7-24-15 possibly due to injury from co-housed goats. This mother of
this alpaca died two weeks before of unknown causes. There had been no previous incompatibility issues in the 3
years they were housed together. Animals need to be carefully observed for compatibility and separated to prevent
discomfort of injury. To be corrected with future animal housing.
