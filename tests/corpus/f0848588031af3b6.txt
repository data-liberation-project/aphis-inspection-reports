ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Access and inspection of records and property.
1. The inspector arrived at 4:15 PM on 8/7/14 to conduct an inspection but there was no one on the premises. The
inspector contacted the Licensee by phone and learned that he was at a distant off-site location and was not
available to accompany the inspector on an inspection.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other facility representative available
to accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility
and animals.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of this Licensee. Report delivered by e-mail 8/8/14.
