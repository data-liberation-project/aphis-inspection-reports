FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Enclosures on the left side of the building (with your back to the wall) have broken wires on the panels on the back
side of the enclosure. The broken panels expose wire points to the guinea pigs. Wire points could cause injury to
the guinea pigs. Ensure that surfaces guinea pigs can touch are smooth and free of points.
