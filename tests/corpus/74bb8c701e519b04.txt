HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The off exhibit primary enclosures for 10 capuchins has peeling paint on the walls and rusted areas on the shift
doors. There is broken concrete on the off exhibit flooring such that the underlying porous surface is exposed. The
broken surface of the primate flooring, as well as the peeling paint and rust, need to be repaired or replaced to
prevent accumulation of debris, dirt, and fecal material under the damaged surfaces. These areas cannot be readily
cleaned or sanitized. To be corrected by: Feb 29, 2016.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor shelter for one capybara has one wall which is warped and has pulled away from the shelter framing.
This warping of the shelter wall has created a gap of approximately 4 inches where the animal could potentially
injure itself. The wall of this shelter box must be repaired or replaced in order to be structurally sound and to
prevent injury to the capybara. To be corrected by: January 29, 2016.
In the interior holding area for two raccoons in the animal health center, there is peeling paint on the walls and
exposed sheet rock at the junction of the wall and the ceiling. There are holes approximately 3 inches in diameter
at each of the upper two corners of the animal shift door in this same enclosure. These holes are through the entire
wall thickness where the raccoons could reach in and potentially injure themselves. The peeling paint, exposed
sheet rock, and holes at the corners of the shift doors must be repaired or replaced in order to prevent injury to the
two raccoons. To be corrected by: January 29, 2016.
Along the bottom of the off exhibit holding building for the two bear and two cougar, there are several holes
approximately 3-4 inches in diameter just above the surface of the concrete floor. These rusted areas and places
where the metal siding is not securely attached to the wall framing provide entry points where insects and rodent
pests could potentially gain entry to this building. Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in
good repair to protect the health and well being of the animals housed within them. To be corrected by: February

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
On the west side of the zoo, there are multiple piles of construction debris, tree limbs, and mulch which are in close
proximity to the perimeter fence so that it can no longer function as a barrier to protect zoo animals by keeping
unauthorized persons and animals out of the zoo. The perimeter fence must be constructed and maintained so that
it protects the animals in the facility by restricting unauthorized persons and animals from going over it and having
contact with the animals in the facility. To be corrected by: January 29, 2016.
In the southwest corner of the zoo, there is a section of concrete block fence which appears to be sinking, therefore
creating a 2 inch vertical gap between several rows of block. This gap can be seen through the entire width of the
concrete block wall. The structural integrity of this section of the zoo perimeter fence has been compromised to the
point where it can no longer function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the zoo. The perimeter
fence must be constructed and maintained so that it protects animals in the facility. To be corrected by: February
29, 2016.
