SANITATION.
Inside of the porcupine enclosure, there is an excessive amount of feces that has accumulated on the left side of
the enclosure. Excreta should be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained and reduce disease hazards and reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of this enclosure should be more
timely and effective to prevent the build-up of excreta to minimize disease hazards.
To be corrected from this day forward.
Inspection and exit interview conducted by APHIS personnel with facility representative.
