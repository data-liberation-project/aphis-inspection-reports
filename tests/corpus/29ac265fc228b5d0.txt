3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the main sheltered building there are nineteen (19) enclosures whose expanded metal type doors have
excessively rusted surfaces which are rough and pitted. The doors need to be repaired or replaced to insure they
can be properly cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other
furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility--must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that
allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. Interior surfaces and
any surfaces that come in contact with the dogs must be free of excessive rust that prevents required cleaning and
sanitization, or that affects the structural strength of the surface.
Affects twenty-three adults. Correct by 2 July 2015
