INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Semi-annual reports for September 2015 and March 2016 both indicate there have been problems controlling
the temperature and humidity in the animal rooms. Recent daily activity or animal room logs (April and May) show
there is still a wide fluctuation of the humidity and temperature outside of what the facility recommendations are.
The records reviewed indicate that facility management has been notified on several occasions but the problem has
not been corrected. The IACUC records do not show a specific plan of correction or an identified correction date. A
properly controlled environment for these animals is necessary to protect them from developing illness, and to
provide for their health and well-being. The HVAC or environmental controls for the animal rooms shall be reviewed
and a plan put in place including correction dates.
The discussion and initial plan of correction to be made during the next IACUC meeting.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with the Director of Operations.
