2.38(b)(1)(4)
MISCELLANEOUS.
At the time of inspection, 9 rabbits were housed in 4 sq. ft.(cid:29) enclosures containing a round food bowl which was
taking away useable floor space. USDA requested documentation of a recently measured weight or to weigh one of
the visually larger rabbits to confirm adequate floor space. The facility did not have a documented weight nor was
the scale available for use. The facility must ensure that the USDA inspector is able to review the facility, property,
and animals necessary to enforce the provisions of the AWA.
Correct from this point forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
