2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Records of acquisition were incomplete. Records were missing for multiple animals including 17 adult rabbits, 2 ring-tail
lemurs, 6 prairie dogs, and 9 buffalo calves. Accurate recordkeeping is important for animal traceability in the event of
disease outbreaks or stolen animals. Correct by 10/1/22 by maintaining accurate and complete records of acquisition and
disposition in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act.
2.134(a)

Contingency planning.
The facility does not have a written contingency plan which meets the requirements of the Animal Welfare Act. The
program of veterinary care includes a statement about preparing for emergencies, but there is no stand-alone contingency
plan that addresses the elements required under the Animal Welfare Act (emergency situations, tasks, chain of command,
and resources needed). Contingency planning is essential for protecting animals in the event of emergencies. Correct by
10/1/22 by documenting a contingency plan in accordance with the requirements in the Animal Welfare Act, and by
training employees on the contents of the plan.
3.76(a)

Indoor housing facilities.


An adult female ring-tail lemur is housed in a building (the feed shed) which was 88.6F at the time of inspection
(approximately 12:30PM). The building has one small wall air conditioning unit which was running and was set at 67F. At
4PM the temperature was 90F indoors. Temperature control is important for animal welfare to prevent animals from
becoming uncomfortable or stressed due to temperature extremes. Correct by 9/14/22 by ensuring that primates housed
indoors are kept within temperature parameters described in the Animal Welfare Act.
3.81(c)(1)

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The facility's enrichment plan for nonhuman primates does not address the needs of infants and young juveniles. The
facility acquired a young female ring-tail lemur about 2 months ago (the animal was approximately 4 months old at the
time, she is 6 months old now). This lemur is currently singly housed in a small enclosure with one rope toy. The animal's
only source of enrichment is daily handling by keepers. Primates, especially infants and young juveniles, have complex
social and environmental needs. Failure to address these needs can result in stress, poor development, and the
development of abnormal behaviors. Correct by 10/1/22 by updating the enrichment plan in collaboration with the
Attending Veterinarian to address the needs of infant and young juvenile primates.

Watering.
Two adult wart hogs housed in an outdoor enclosure did not have access to clean drinking water. There was one
automatic water drinker that was functional in the enclosure, and it contained a large amount of brown organic material in
addition to bright green clumps of algae on the water surface. The water in the drinker was cloudy and brown. An
employee stated that the water drinkers had last been cleaned 2-3 days ago. Animals without access to potable water in
clean water receptacles may suffer from disease or dehydration. Correct by 9/7/22 by providing animals with potable
water in clean and sanitary water receptacles. Corrected at the time of inspection.


3.131(d)

Sanitation.
A live rat and a large amount of rodent droppings were present in the feed shed, where feed and medication is stored,
and where a wallaby and a lemur were housed. Two bags of feed had holes in the them with rodent droppings nearby.
There were rodent droppings over large areas of the floor and on a counter top. Rodents can cause contamination and
spoilage of feed, and rodents can carry diseases that are harmful to animals. Correct by 11/1/22 by establishing and
maintaining a safe and effective program for the control of pests including rodents.

This inspection was conducted with the Safari Park Manager and exit interview were conducted with the Safari Park
Manager and the Director of Operations.
