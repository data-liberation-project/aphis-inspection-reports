ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One of the two sheep did not lose its winter coat throughout the hot summer months and its now Fall where the
ambient temperatures are still over 90F. This sheep appears to have more woolly fibers and matted so it needs to
be groomed as needed and sheared when the temperatures could cause discomfort and overheating. Each
exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care.
