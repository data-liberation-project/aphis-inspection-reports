During inspection, multiple animals had veterinary care issues that had not been followed up with by a Veterinarian.
The following is the list of animals along with their veterinary care issues that had been noted during inspection:
---A tannish colored Russian Dwarf Hamster was squinting with its right eye. The same hamster also had hair loss
on its tail. The tail appeared to be dried up and may have had feces caked on it.
---A tan colored Russian Dwarf Hamster also had its right eye sealed shut.
---One Russian Dwarf Hamster (tan colored with black markings) had hair loss on its left rear leg that extended
around its abdomen. The same hamster had a growth or mass behind its right front leg.
---A tan Russian Dwarf Hamster had a reddish abscess on its left side of the muzzle.
---A black and greyish Winter White Hamster had hair loss around its right eye and was also squinting with the
same eye.
---A tan and greyish Roborovski Hamster had its right eye completely sealed shut.
---A tannish colored Roborovski Hamster had its left eye completely sealed shut.
Eye problems can indicate underlying health issues, can be painful, or may spread to other animals. Hair loss can
also indicate an underlying health issue and may be contagious to other animals. Abscesses can be painful and
can result in infection which can result in death to the animal. Growths or masses indicate underlying health issues,
can be painful, and can result in death if left untreated. The licensee must ensure that these animals are evaluated
and treated per the attending Veterinarian's instructions. Correct by 1/8/16.

The licensee doesn't have a process or procedure in place for the staff to conduct daily observations on the small
animals in the store. This has resulted in multiple veterinary care issues of the small animals that went untreated.
Daily observations helps ensure that the population is healthy. Any animals noted to be unhealthy or acting
abnormally during the daily observations can be followed up with by the attending Veterinarian. A program must be
put in place to ensure that all animals are being observed on a daily basis. Correct immediately.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
