ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a black female Cocker Spaniel #63 with an eye problem. The conjunctival tissues and third eyelid of the
right eye appear to be red and swollen, with a small amount of mucous drainage exuding from the eye. The eye
itself is clear and appears to be smaller than the left eye, and the dog is not squinting or apparently painful;
however, the appearance of the eye suggests that an infection or inflammation is present. The eye is very sensitive
and problems left untreated can lead to blindness. The dog must be examined by a veterinarian and a treatment
plan must be established and followed.
