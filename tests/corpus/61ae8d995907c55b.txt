3.19 a Terminal Facilities Placement
On June 23rd, 2021 Worldwide Flight services received dogs in transport from Aeroflot Airlines at cargo building 75 JFK
airport in New York. The primary enclosures containing dogs were held in an area of the cargo building where other
cargo items were commingled. This resulted in fork- lift trucks being driven around the primary enclosures containing
dogs, which has potential to cause harm and stress to the animals.
Registrant needs to ensure that live animals are not commingled with inanimate cargo in animal holding areas.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative .
