2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility’s program of veterinary care did not include written provisions and outlined care for the newly acquired
species. The written program of veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the
attending veterinarian regarding the veterinary care of regulated animals. The facility should ensure that the written
program of veterinary care is available for review during all USDA inspections.
Each applicant shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and
regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the applicant.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility did not have complete acquisition records. There were no acquisition records for the newly acquired pig, with
information incomplete for the acquisition of the three goats.
Acquisition and disposition records, including offspring born at the facility, are necessary to accurately track animals being
used in regulated activities and maintained on the premises.. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of
acquisition/disposition of all animals that fully and correctly disclose the required information.



This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
