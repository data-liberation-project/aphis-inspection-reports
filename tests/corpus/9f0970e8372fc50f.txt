2.31(c)(7)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
An IACUC approved protocol includes intubation for maintenance of anesthesia during terminal surgical procedures in
pigs. In several animals enrolled on this protocol, a tracheostomy was performed instead of intubation. This procedure is
not described in the approved protocol. Significant changes to ongoing animal use activities, including changes to the type
of procedure being performed, must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC.

All proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities must undergo IACUC review
and approval before being conducted.

To be corrected by June 30th, 2022.

This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on May 26th, 2022 and a final exit interview was conducted
with the IACUC Chair on May 31st, 2022.
