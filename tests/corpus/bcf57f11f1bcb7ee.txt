INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In July 2013 a survival procedure was performed on a guinea pig which had been described in the IACUC approved
protocol as a terminal procedure. Documents reveal that the animal was placed on post-operative analgesia but the
appropriateness of the procedure and the analgesia regarding a significant change in animal use activities must be
evaluated by the IACUC to review and approve, require modifications in, or withhold approval, for the health and
well being of the animals. This item has been addressed by the IACUC and no further issues have since occurred.
This item has been corrected.

EMPLOYEES.
Three investigators conducted a procedure on a guinea pig in July 2013 as a survival which was approved by the
IACUC as a terminal procedure. Neither did the investigators complete post-operative monitoring forms which, in
part, act to facilitate communication with the animal care staff nor did they document once a day observations of the
animal. One of the investigators involved was not approved by the IACUC to do work on that procedure. The
IACUC must ensure that there is supervision of the employees to maintain the prescribed level of husbandry
practices for the health and well-being of the animals. The IACUC has addressed this item with several measures
one of which was augmenting training of the laboratory investigators.
This item has been corrected.
This was a focused inspection of IACUC documents. An exit briefing was conducted with the Director of Regulatory
Compliance and the Attending Veterinarian.
