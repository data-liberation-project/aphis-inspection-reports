3.107(b)
SANITATION.
Food preparation/kitchen: There is a brownish-yellow, raised, foamy substance attached to an area near a pipe at
the junction between a wall and the ceiling. This substance is located directly above stainless steel buckets of ice
used to chill food items. Facility representative stated the substance was spray foam, insulation and demonstrated
the ability to manually peel-off layers indicating the friability of the substance during inspection. Surfaces containing
substances such as foam are porous and may trap debris or bacterial organisms and inhibit proper cleaning and
sanitization. Kitchens and other food handling areas where animal food is prepared or stored must have surfaces
which can be readily cleaned and sanitized to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.
