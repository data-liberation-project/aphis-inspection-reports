FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The majority of the black metal sugar glider enclosures have rust across the front of the enclosures. It is very
difficult to clean rusty enclosures which may affect the structural integrity of the primary enclosures. The indoor
housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair in order to protect the sugar
gliders from injury. Replace or repair. Correct by October 31,2014.

SANITATION.
Some of the sugar glider primary enclosures had fruit flies accumulating in the bottoms of the black metal cages.
There were fruit flies flying around the sugar glider cages and thru out the indoor building housing the sugar gliders.
Insects may cause disease and may contaminate food in the sugar glider cages. A safe and effective program for
the control of insects should be maintained and established with the attending veterinarian. Correct by September
