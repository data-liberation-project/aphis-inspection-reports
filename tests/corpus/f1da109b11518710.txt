2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Shih Tzu had its right eye slightly clouded over. Upon closer examination, I observed the eye to actually have
an indentation near the center of it. The licensee was about to treat the eye with an ointment. I asked the licensee if he
was authorized to treat the eye. He stated he was. I asked to see his Program of Veterinary Care. The Program of
Veterinary Care states the Attending Veterinarian needs to be contacted if there are injuries to the cornea. There is
nothing in the Program of Veterinary Care that authorizes the use of any ointments on the eye. I informed the licensee
that I did not see anything that authorizes him to use any ointments to treat any eye injuries and the Program of
Veterinary Care in fact states he should contact the Attending Veterinarian.

Not following the Program of Veterinary Care doesn't ensure the Attending Veterinarian has the appropriate authority to
make sure the dogs in the licensee's care are being adequately treated for veterinary care issues.

The licensee must contact the Attending Veterinarian and treat the dog per his/her instructions. All future treatments must
be done according the Program of Veterinary Care or per the Attending Veterinarian's direct instructions.


This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the

End of report.
