2.75(a)(1)(v)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Date of disposition or date of death was incomplete for two female maltese dogs (dog #3 and dog #13, dob 2016
and 2012 respectively). Dog #3 and dog #13 were no longer at the facility and the licensee reported not being sure
if they were donated or passed away last year. APHIS 7006 must be kept up to date and accurate to meet
regulatory requirements. Accurate and current records can be important for animal health monitoring. Ensure that
animals on hand and corresponding disposition forms are kept up to date and accurate at all times.
Correct from this point forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
