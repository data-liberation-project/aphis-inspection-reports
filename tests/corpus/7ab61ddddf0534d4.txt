FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength.
The walls in the indoor portion of the housing facility for the two North American river otters are made of painted
cement blocks. The paint is peeling in several areas in all four enclosures. The thresholds in each doorway and one
corner of one enclosure have chunks of cement rock that have been worn and/or broken off. The surface where the
cement block is worn and/or broken is uneven and porous.
The ceiling within this housing facility is made of wood. There is a section of ceiling over the human walkway that
appears dark and water stained. There is a joint between two pieces of wood in this area that is separated. There is
a white substance visible in the gap between the two pieces of wood. The facility representative states that she
believes this is Styrofoam insulation. This same substance was seen on a perch within one of the animal
enclosures.
Failure to maintain surfaces within housing facilities can prevent proper cleaning and sanitizing of enclosures and
can lead to health hazards for the animals. The affected surfaces must be repaired or replaced so they are
structurally sound and all surfaces in housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair.

SANITATION.
Pest control.
The "lower diet kitchen" is used to prep and/or store diets for two red pandas and fifteen Egyptian fruit bats. There is
rodent feces on a cart containing kitchen items. The cart is located between a food prep table and a refrigerator.
The cart is in close proximity to the barrels containing feed for the animals. There is rodent feces present on the ledge of the wall immediately adjacent to one animal enclosure within the
indoor portion of the housing facility for the two North American river otters.
The open feed bag for the red pandas has the top rolled down and is located in a leak proof container with a tight
fitting lid within the "lower diet kitchen". When the bag was opened for inspection a cockroach was seen within the
bag. Several live cockroaches and other insects are present along a wall that is immediately adjacent to the diet
kitchen. The majority of the insects are located under a rodent bait box located in this area.
The presence of pests can lead to health hazards for the animals. A safe and effective program for the control of
pests, including insects and mammalian pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and
well-being of the animals and to reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
