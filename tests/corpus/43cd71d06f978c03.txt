ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female, black and brown, long-haired dachshund with microchip ID # 097-536-527 , unknown date of birth and
located in pen number 63, was found to have firm, dark material on teeth of the upper left and upper right dental
arcades. There was noticeable gum recession and inflammation in several areas along both upper arcades with a
spotting of blood over the right upper premolar area. A loose tooth with loss of surrounding gum tissue was also
found on the upper left dental arcade.
Dental tartar buildup on teeth with recession of gum tissue and concurrent inflammation and loose teeth are signs of
dental disease. Dental disease may directly impact the health of animals by causing pain and discomfort while
chewing, ongoing infection and tooth loss.
The above described dog needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian within the next 7 days and a treatment plan
established for treatment of the conditions found. Written documentation of evaluation by a veterinarian and the
establishment of treatment also need to be available to the inspector upon his/her request.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
