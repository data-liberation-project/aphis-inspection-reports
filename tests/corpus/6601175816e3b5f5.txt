Housing facilities, general.
Outdoor enclosures #2, #3 and #4 housing a total of 5 dogs has ground metal fence panels along the sides with multiple
sharp edges and several are bent upward. There are several areas where the metal panels have holes underneath
where the animals can step into and get caught. The sharp edges and holes in the metal fence panels presents an injury
hazard to the animals. Maintain all housing facilities so that they are structurally sound and kept in good repair so that
they protect the animals from injury.
