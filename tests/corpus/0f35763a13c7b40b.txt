ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1030 on
20-FEB-20.Upon arrival I called the phone number listed and waited 30 min. The licensee contacted me later that
afternoon and future hours of operation were discussed.
This is the first attempted inspection.
