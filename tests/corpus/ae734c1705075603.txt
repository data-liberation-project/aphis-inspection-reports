2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
At least five dogs that were retained for use as breeding stock were not identified as required by regulation.

Use of an approved method of identification, such as an official tag or microchip, is necessary for many reasons including
to assure proper care, treatment and handling of dogs by facility personnel and ancillary personnel, such as the attending
veterinarian.

All dogs must be properly identified, such as by use of collars and official tags as the facility presently uses for
identification.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The program of veterinary care (PVC) signed by the Attending Veterinarian was not updated to include details of the
head-to-toe physical examination, vaccination schedule and parasite control programs.



The PVC provides the healthcare requirements established by the attending veterinarian for the dogs and the licensee
must follow those requirements to assure optimum health for the dogs.

The facility must contact the attending veterinarian to update a complete PVC as required by Animal Welfare Act
regulations.
