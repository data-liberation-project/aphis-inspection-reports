HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There is a space between the metal barrier and a tree which is large enough for members of the public to enter the
camel ride exhibit. Anyone who entered this area could become injured. Camels may kick if approached and
spooked from behind. The handler was told about this non compliance on during this inspection and during the
completion of this inspection on March 31, 2016, no corrections were made.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.

FEEDING.
There needs to be an appropriate diet approved by the attending or treating veterinarian for the 12 year old thin
male camel Gabrielle. According to the handler during the inspection this camel was initially thin due to the winter
months and noticed he lost weight in the last several months after he shed his winter coat. It was stated that
Gabrielle was not getting enough food due to the rest of the camels during feeding and he was being very choosey
with the varieties of food. It was stated Gabrielle at times would not eat from on to 3 days having to change different
products of feed with no evidence of approval from the attending veterinarian. After there was no improvement a
veterinarian on site did recommended a diet on two occasions but there was no evidence that the complete diet is
being followed. To ensure this camel is being fed an adequate diet there needs to be a diet approved and followed
by the attending or treating veterinarian. I did observed the camel during two days of inspections and he was eating
and active. This camel will be transported to the attending veterinarian as an appointment has been scheduled next
week.
Food shall be of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good health. The diet shall be
prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. Animals shall be fed atleast once a day except as dictated by veterinary treatment, normal fasts, or other professionally accepted
practices.
