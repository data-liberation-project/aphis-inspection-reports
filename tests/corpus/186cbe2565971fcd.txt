ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:20 AM on
28-Nov-18.
Due to the Production Manager being out of town, the Barrier Supervisor being on the job less than a month and
technical difficulties with the video equipment an inspection was not conducted today.
