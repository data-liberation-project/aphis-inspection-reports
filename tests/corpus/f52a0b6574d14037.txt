ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of the inspection the attending veterinarian had not visited the site, nor reviewed the written program of
veterinary care, in over fourteen months.
Although some animals had been taken to the veterinarian's clinic, it is the responsibility of the animal exhibitor to
have the attending veterinarian visit the site and review the written program of veterinary care at least annually, as
well as when problems or changes arise, in order that the veterinarian is able to provide necessary preventive care
and husbandry advice, in addition to treating any medical problems.
To be corrected by 7/7/14.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
