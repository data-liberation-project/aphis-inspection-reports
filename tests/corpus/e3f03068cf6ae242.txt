2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Several expired and improperly stored medical materials were found intermingled with current and properly labeled
items during the inspection:
**Encephalomyelitis vaccine/Tetanus Toxoid expired 12/14 and Leptospira Bacterin expired Jul 2014 in the North
Barn refrigerator
**Artificial tears expired 3/12 and 4 syringes with clear fluid with an "F" on the plunger stored in the crash box in the
surgical suite
Drugs that are expired or are in containers that do not at least identify what the medication is, how it should be
administered, and when it expires are not safe or appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat
diseases and injuries since the expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience pain and
distress due to mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or due to unexpected side effects.
The facility shall establish and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
Accompanied on the inspection and exit briefing conducted with IACUC Chair, the AC VMO and the AC Intern.
