Primary enclosures.
Two enclosures housing nursing dams and their puppies had 1 inch by 1 inch plastic coated wire flooring. One enclosure
housed a single chihuahua puppy and its mother, the other housed 4 poodle puppies and their mother. Inspectors
observed the chihuahua puppy and 3 of the poodle puppy’s feet passing through the flooring.

Flooring that allows dogs’ feet to pass through may lead to injury and cause discomfort, pain, or mobility issues.

Primary enclosure floors must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the dogs’ feet and legs from injury from
this day forward.

Feeding
Inspectors identified two enclosures, one housing a male shih tzu and one housing a female chihuahua, that had caked
and moldy food present in the self-feeder tray.


Inspectors identified one enclosure housing 2 shih tzus that had a thick buildup of caked food present in the corner of the
self-feeder tray.

Dog food that is caked and moldy is not considered wholesome and palatable and may lead to reduced feed
consumption, poor nutrition, and poor body condition.

Food must be uncontaminated, wholesome, palatable, and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain the normal
condition and weight of the dog. The licensee must remove all caked and moldy food from the self-feeders and ensure
that all food remains of good quality at all times.

Watering
One female Klee Kai was present in an outdoor exercise yard and had no access to water. Inspectors asked the licensee
to provide the dog a bowl of water and when given water, she drank leisurely for approximately one minute.

Dogs that do not have access to water may become dehydrated and reduced water consumption may lead to additional
medical problems.

Potable water must be continuously available for the health and well-being of the dogs, unless restricted by the attending
veterinarian.


To be corrected by: From this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
