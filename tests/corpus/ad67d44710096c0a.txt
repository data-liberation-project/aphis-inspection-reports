2.33(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Animal #44652 has overgrown nails. Some of the nails are overgrown to the point that the toes are distorted from
their normal position. Review of records of the rest of the herd show many with intervals of 5-6 months or more
between trims or even noting the feet were checked.
Overgrown nails can result in physical problems such as degenerative joint disease and gait abnormalities.
Animal #44652 was trimmed at the time of inspection.
This was previously cited for this animal and others on the report dated 9/21/2016.
Clementine, aka C-Cow, has dried rumen fluid down her side from a leaking rumen fistula cap/flange. Records
review shows that it was addressed nearly two weeks prior by adjusting the flange and ordering cleaning and
application of petroleum jelly to skin irritation under the flange every other day for ten days. This treatment was not
documented to have happened as ordered.
Rumen fluid trapped under the rumen fistula flange is irritating to the skin and can cause discomfort and infection.
This was corrected at the time of inspection by clipping and cleaning the drainage from the area around the fistula
and ordering another course of treatment for the skin irritation under the flange.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Razor, a horse at the therio barn, was standing out in a muddy paddock eating from a feeder where his morning hay
was placed. He had to stand in mud more than fetlock-deep in order to eat.
Additionally, the ground at the gate between the barn and the pasture where the mares go out was similarly muddy.
The horses had to pass through the mud to go from barn to pasture.Chronic exposure to mud can predispose horses to hoof and skin problems, affecting their health and comfort.
Ongoing maintenance of horse facilities is necessary to ensure that mud doesn't become a problem.
Razor's situation was corrected at the time of inspection by moving him to a different stall/paddock that was not
affected by mud.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted on April 11-12 and April 16 with facility personnel.
