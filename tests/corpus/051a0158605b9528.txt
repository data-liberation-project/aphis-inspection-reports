Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There are goats and sheep that recently arrived at the facility. The inspectors observed two Jacobs sheep and one
angora goat with front hooves in need of trimming. Allowing the hooves to become overgrown may lead to lameness. All
of the hoofstock shall be observed and hoof trimming provided if necessary.

3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The lemur enclosure housing the 2 ringtail lemurs has an excessive accumulation of feces that appears to have
accumulated over more than a day. Excess accumulations increase the risk of disease hazard. It is concentrated toward
the front and around the feeding area on gravel and other surface material where the lemurs have access. The surfaces
must be raked or spot cleaned with sufficient frequency to allow the lemurs freedom to move without contacting the
excreta to protect them from contamination.

3.80(a)(1)

Primary enclosures.


The enclosure housing the 2 ringtail lemurs has a board that has fallen from the platform. The board has flipped over
exposing four pointed nails. These nails could cause punctures or injury if the lemurs come in contact with it. The board
shall be removed and the structure repaired or replaced to protect the lemurs from injury. Corrected by end of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the manager.
