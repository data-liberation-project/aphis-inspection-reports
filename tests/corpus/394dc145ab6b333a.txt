SANITATION.
***In 28 enclosures, housing 40 hedgehogs, there was an excessive accumulation of feces present on the
enclosure bottoms. Additionally, the APHIS VMO noted an excessive amount of flies and fly larvae present in the
enclosures and an overwhelming odor. Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for
appropriate animal husbandry standards, to reduce disease transmission, and to prevent the animals from
becoming contaminated or soiled. The licensee must clean these enclosures and ensure that all enclosures
housing animals are cleaned as often as necessary to promote appropriate husbandry standards.
