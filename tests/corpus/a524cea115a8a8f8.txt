PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
While some enclosures were constructed of plastic and others of painted plywood, two enclosures had fronts made
of pressboard (OSB). Moisture had penetrated the OSB on these two enclosures and, on one of the enclosures,
had caused deterioration to the point that it was no longer structurally sound. Moisture penetrating the surface can
lead to disease in the animals and loss of structure that might lead to injury. Correct by assuring primary enclosures
are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs and are constructed of smooth
material substantially impervious to liquids and moisture. Correct by: 1 December 2016
