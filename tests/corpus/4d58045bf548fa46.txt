SANITATION.
All pens in the weaning barn have a build up of manure and urine . Most of the pigs housed in these enclosures
have manure caked on their bodies. Licensee states the barn is cleaned about every 3 days . An acccumulation of
manure to this extent does not provide a healthy environment for the pigs.Cleaning more frequently will minimize
disease ,odors and prevent contamination of the animals. Enclosures housing animals must be cleaned as often as
necessary to prevent a build up of manure and contamination of the animals
