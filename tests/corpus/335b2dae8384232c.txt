2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One rabbit is in need of veterinary attention regarding an injury to its left eye. The licensee reports she received the
rabbit yesterday, and it had been attacked by a cat prior to her taking it in. Since acquiring, the attending
veterinarian has not been contacted to allow an evaluation of the injury and recommended treatment options. Upon
inspection today, the rabbit had copious amounts of discolored, mucoid ocular discharge draining from the left eye.
The build-up surrounding the eye appeared hardened, and was yellow-to-green in color, with the underlying skin
moderately inflamed and reddened. The eye itself was clouded and very inflamed, making it difficult to visualize.
Eye injuries can be painful and distressful to the animal, as well as progress to infection if not treated appropriately.
The attending veterinarian shall evaluate this animal to ensure the injury is diagnosed and treated appropriately.
Correct by having this rabbit examined by a licensed veterinarian(s) for diagnosis and treatment no later than close
of business October 9, 2019.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee did not have records that contained the required information regarding the acquisition and dispositionof several animals on the premise. There were no records of acquisition for three rabbits, eight pigs, and five goats.
Additionally, no disposition records were available for one alpaca that was sold.
Acquisition and disposition records are necessary to be able to accurately identify and track animals being used in
regulated activities, and aid in biosecurity surveillance to reduce the risk of transmission of diseases amongst
animals. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition and disposition of all animals that fully
and correctly discloses the required information.

3.52(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor primary enclosure containing five rabbits does not have additional protection or fencing to prevent
contact from predators. The rabbit enclosure is raised off of the ground, but lacks an additional barrier to enclose
them. There was one additional rabbit housed separately. It was also kept outdoors in an enclosure that was placed
directly on the ground beside the home of the licensee. Rabbits are prey species, and being housed outdoors
makes them more vulnerable to attacks by predators. Additional protection is warranted to minimize the occurrence
of predation. Outdoor housing facilities for rabbits shall be fenced or otherwise enclosed to minimize the entrance of
predators.
