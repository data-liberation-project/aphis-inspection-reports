MISCELLANEOUS.
In November 2015, litter boxes were set up in a cat room for a routine urine collection. For this process the litter
boxes are lighter than usual, and despite extra weight being added to prevent the boxes from being flipped over,
three young cats flipped the box and were trapped and died as a result. The facility has implemented corrective
action and this event has not recurred.
