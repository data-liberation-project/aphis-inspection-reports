2.134(a)

Contingency planning.
At the time of the inspection, the licensee did not have a written contingency plan in place.
A written emergency/contingency plan is required to help ensure animal health and well-being in the event of an
emergency or disaster; without this tool, animals may suffer illness, injury or death due to unpreparedness should an
emergency or disaster strike. The licensee must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the
humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster
(one which could reasonably be anticipated and expected to be detrimental to the good health and well-being of the
animals in their possession). The contingency plan must include all of the information and documentation as detailed in
Section 2.134(a-c) of the Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations. Correct by 11/1/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
