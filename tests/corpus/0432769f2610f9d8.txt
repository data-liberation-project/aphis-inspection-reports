ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:45 pm on
08-JUL-19.
I arrived and knocked on front door, no one answered. I honked the horn. I called licensee and left a message. I
texted licensee. I spoke with licensee whose schedule was so full it made inspection unfeasible, she agreed to
attempted inspection. I left facility at 5:20 pm.
