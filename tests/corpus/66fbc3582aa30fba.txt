ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brownish colored Shih-tzu dog, identification number 0A01271978, has watery eyes. The right eye is very crusted
and watery around the upper and lower eyelids. The area of the eye appears to be swollen, with the top of the
eyelid toward the center of the face appearing to be somewhat be raw. Also, the left eye appears to have a slightly
intruding point coming out of the pupil. The licensee had no medical records to show dates the dog was examined
by the attending veterinarian and what diagnosis and treatment had been prescribed. Eye discharge can occur due
to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful. The licensee must have this
animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of
this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all
animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. This dog must be seen by a veterinarian to determine what is
the best action to be taken to help improve this dog's eyes. Correct by 06-13-2014..

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The Double decker sheltered kennel building has at least three doggy door inserts that are worned and chewed,
leaving holes in siding. Missing siding can allow feces to get behind and in-between the wall. These areas cannot
be cleaned and properly sanitized efficiently. The licensee must repair these areas to help insure that cleaning and
sanitizing can be done properly. This will help in the good health and well-being of dogs. The licensee needs to put
into place a good maintenance program that monitors and repairs surfaces when needed. Correct by 06-25-2014..
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The water receptacles in the outdoor facility need to be cleaned. The three large water containers that dogs have
access too needs to be cleaned more often. The water has a green color, containers have a green slime covering
the inside bottoms/sides, and one of the containers has what appears to have moss connected on the bottom
floating to the top. The licensee must assure dogs have clean water daily and sanitize the containers at least once
every two weeks and more often if needed to prevent an accumulation of debris and other disease hazards. The
licensee must put into place a good plan that daily monitors the water receptacles and quality of water given todogs. Correct by 06-12-2014.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outdoor housing has weeds grown in the enclosure fencing. The east and south side of the enclosure fencing
have weeds and grass that needs to be mowed/controlled to help with pest control. Also, along the east fence a
pile of boards and weeds need to be removed to help control the living areas of rodents/snakes. These
boards/weeds/tall grasses can allow rodents, pests and other vermin to infiltrate the facility. The licensee must
remove these weeds and have a clear break between the tall weeds/building materials and the dogs' enclosure
fencing. This will help insure the good health and well-being of the dogs in this sheltered facility. Correct by
