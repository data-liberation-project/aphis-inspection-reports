PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
In July 2014 a rabbit was anesthetized for two minor procedures, one of which was a partial closing of the eyelid,
which requires post- procedural analgesics and 2 days of special monitoring. Two days after the procedure the
animal care staff noted the animal was injured and provided veterinary care at that time. Upon contacting the
investigators they were informed of the procedure. Had the investigators done proper post-procedural care which
includes notifying the animal care staff of the procedure verbally or with post-operative forms that document their
observations and the provision of analgesia the injury may have been noticed in a timely manner and prevented
additional pain and/ or distress to the animal. The facility has taken steps to prevent future recurrence of this by
retraining the investigators and implementing an augmented communication and documentation process.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Social grouping. There were two sub-adult female macaques housed singly at the time of inspection. They had
previously been housed together and had been deemed compatible. During a housing change 2 weeks ago they
were separated into individual enclosures. They were not under a veterinary or IACUC exemption from the social
housing requirement. The facility must ensure that the social needs of non-human primates known to exist in social
groups in nature are provided for the health and well-being of the animals.
