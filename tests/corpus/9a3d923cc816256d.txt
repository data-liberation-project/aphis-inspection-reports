FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two metal-clad exterior doors on the east side of the warthog building that are rusted along the entire
bottom edge of both doors to a height of approximately 8 inches above ground level. There are areas on both doors
where the sheet metal is is curling upwards from the bottom, exposing the wooden door core material. These areas
of rust and curling metal provide entry points where insect and rodent pests could potentially gain entry inside this
building which houses one Red river hog and one warthog. Outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound
and be maintained in good repair to protect the health and well-being of the animals housed within them. To be
corrected by: August 31, 2015.
There are two metal-clad interior stall doors on the west side of the warthog building that are rusted along the
bottom edge of both doors to a height of approximately 6 inches above ground level. There are areas on both doors
where the sheet metal is curling upwards from the bottom, exposing the wooden door core material. These areas of
rust and curling metal could potentially injure the Red river hog and the warthog which are housed in these animal
stalls. Indoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and be maintained in good repair to protect the health
and well-being of the animals housed within them. To be corrected by: August 31, 2015.

However, due to insufficient staffing for facility maintenance, the repair work on the warthog building has not been
completed in the past 14 months. Insufficient staffing for facility maintenance is a concern because it affects animal
safety and well-being. A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain animal
facilities in a timely fashion. To be corrected by: August 31, 2015.
