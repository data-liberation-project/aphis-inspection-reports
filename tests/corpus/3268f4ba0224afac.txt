2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On 27 December 2019, a guest and an employee were bitten by South American Coati "Gus" during a public
interaction session causing skin abrasions. The incident was self reported on 28 Dec. 2019. The facility was
allowing public interactions without adequate barriers or direct control of the animals. Two employees were present
while the two coati were allowed free physical contact with the seated guests within the enclosure. The incident
occured when Gus lost interested in the target and treats and began exploring.
Coatimundi are relatives of the raccoon and have strong teeth and claws. They have the potential to cause serious
injury to a person.
During public exhibition animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of injury to the animals and the public.
Some of the ways this can be achieved are by a barrier between the public and the animal, a harness on the
animal, or training that requires the animal to respond immediately to commands.
Corrections implemented by the time of the inspection include immediate discontinuation of the use of "Gus" in
guest interaction session, and continued harness and target training for both coati.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
