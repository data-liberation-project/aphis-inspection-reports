2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male chocolate and tan party Pomeranian, "Rico" (0A02171112), which was included on the report for the last
inspection on September 4, 2019 for a dental condition had not been treated as directed by the veterinarian for its
dental condition. During this inspection, the dog would repeatedly pull away while attempting to look inside of the
dog's mouth. However, it could be observed that the dog's teeth still had a large accumulation of yellow to dark
tan/brown to black build up covering the majority of the teeth. The build up appeared heavier on both sides of the
back teeth. The dog's gums were reddened and had receded along some of the teeth as well. According to the
licensee, the dog had been taken to a veterinarian for an examination. After speaking with the veterinarian, a
recommendation of a dental cleaning for the dog had been made to the licensee to be performed as soon as
possible. According to the licensee and the veterinarian, there had been no arrangements to schedule a dental
cleaning at the time of inspection, approximately two months after the dog's veterinary examination.The dog was
currently not receiving any treatment. The lack of treatment for this dog's dental condition can increase the risk that
the condition will continue or worsen. The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum
tissue and tooth structures. This condition could be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and
negatively impact the overall health of the animal. The licensee must ensure that the veterinarian's treatment
recommendations for the dog's dental condition are followed for the health of the dog. The licensee must ensure
that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The licensee was not properly identifying puppies that were less than 16 weeks old. There was a Miniature Pinscher
puppy that was approximately 7 weeks old which was housed with five other Miniature Pinscher puppies from a
different litter. There was no dam in the enclosure with the puppies. Although the puppies had a cage card, they did
not have a required USDA approved method of identification since the litters were co-mingled. Another puppy,
which was an approximately 3 month old Saint Bernard, did not have any identification according to the licensee.
This puppy was recently acquired by the licensee and was housed with three other dogs in the whelping building.
Identification is required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate
record keeping requirements. The licensee must ensure that all dogs less than 16 weeks of age are identified by anofficial tag as described in Sec.2.51, a legible tattoo approved by the Administrator, a microchip, or a cage card (if
maintained as a litter with their dam and housed within the same primary enclosure). To be corrected by November
27, 2019
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were multiple surfaces within the housing facilities that were chewed and/or in disrepair. A fiber board wall
covering appeared to have been chewed along its edge near the entry door of the indoor portion of an enclosure
housing Siberian Husky puppies. One of the igloo style shelters for two adult Siberian Huskies in an outdoor
enclosure had a hole on the top of the tunnel portion of the unit. The back of a wooden shelter for an outdoor
enclosure housing a Saint Bernard had a hole in the top corner of the unit large enough for the dog to stick its nose
out of. There were two water receptacles within an outdoor enclosure housing adult dogs that had edges which
appeared to be significantly chewed with roughened edges. There were also chewed edges on the flaps for some of
the shelter units in the outdoor enclosures. A couple of enclosures had chewed edges on or near the edging of the
in/out access doors in the whelping building. Surfaces which are not maintained on a regular basis can interfere with
cleaning and sanitization as well as decrease the function of a structure’s purpose. The licensee must ensure that
all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis at all times. To be corrected by November 27, 2019.
3.10 DIRECT REPEAT
WATERING.
A female Pomeranian and three of her puppies were housed in an indoor enclosure within the whelping building.
The puppies were observed lying inside of a metal-type receptacle, which was their water bowl according to a
facility representative. There were no other sources of water provided inside of the enclosure. During the inspection
around 1:45 pm, the inspectors asked a facility representative to fill the receptacle with water. After the bowl was
placed inside of the enclosure for the dam and her puppies, the dam was observed to immediately start drinking
from the bowl continuously for over 1 ½ minutes. The puppies also started drinking from the water bowl consistently
a few seconds after the dam started drinking. A small amount of water remained on the bottom of the receptacle
after the dogs stopped drinking. When asked about the last time the dogs had been given water, the licensee stated
that they had all been given water yesterday evening. The absence of water can cause dehydration and can lead to
serious illness in the animals. The licensee must ensure all animals have access to water as often as necessary to
ensure their health and well-being. A facility representative corrected this non-compliance during the inspection.
3.11(a) DIRECT REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were at least 13 enclosures throughout the facility housing dogs that contained greater than a day's worth offeces. This included the outdoor portion of enclosures in sheltered buildings as well as enclosures within the
whelping building. An enclosure within the whelping building housing three Saint Bernards and one Boxer had an
accumulation of fecal material in the outdoor portion of their enclosure that was mashed, smeared and splattered
which covered most of the entire outdoor flooring. The dogs in this enclosure, with ages around 3 to 6 months old,
also had the fecal material visible on their hair coats including on their paws, legs, tails, sides and backs. There was
not enough room for all of the dogs to occupy the outdoor portion of the enclosure without walking, standing, sitting
or lying in this material. Some of the other enclosures contained enough feces that the dogs were walking through it
to maneuver through the enclosure. There were feces that had been mashed and/or smeared into the floors of
many of the enclosures. When asked when the enclosures were last cleaned, the facility representative stated that
the outdoor portions were last cleaned on Sunday. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease
hazards and create an unhealthy environment for the animals. The licensee must ensure that all waste material is
removed from the primary enclosures daily as required.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were hard surfaces in contact with the dogs that had a build-up of dirt and grime. Some of the enclosures
within the sheltered buildings housing adult dogs and/or puppies had a build-up of dirt and grime on the floors
and/or walls. There were at least 2 food receptacles with a build-up of grime as well. The build-up of dirt and grime
can increase the risk of disease hazards in the dogs. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures and food
and water receptacles are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or more often if necessary to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease hazards.
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Several miscellaneous items and debris are accumulating near the outside of the whelping building and outside
enclosures as well as in an area behind the sheltered buildings in the central area of the outdoor facility. Some of
the accumulated items include bags of trash, buckets, propane tanks, bleach bottles, self-feeder with leaves,
perforated flooring, parts of carriers, empty feed bags and other various small and large debris. This accumulation
of debris and miscellaneous items creates possible breeding and living areas for rodents on the premises adjacent
to the housing facilities which increases the risk of disease to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that the premises
are kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste products and discarded matter at all times.
This inspection was conducted with the licensee and facility representatives on November 13, 2019. An exit
interview was conducted with the licensee on November 14, 2019.Additional Inspectors
