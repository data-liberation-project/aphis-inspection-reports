3.13(b)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee has not maintained vaccination and deworming records for all the puppies born on the premise.
Failure to document the vaccine or dewormer name and administration dates for the adults and puppies can make it
difficult to verify that the Program of Veterinary Care is being followed as written and that the dogs are receiving the
appropriate preventative care.
Medical records for dogs must contain the name of all vaccines and treatments administered and the dates of
administration.
