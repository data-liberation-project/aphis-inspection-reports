ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The pot belly pig that was being housed to the right of the main gate, and next to the chickens, was in need of
attention. This pot belly pig was noted to have crusty, dry, flaky skin along its entire back. The attending veterinarian
will need to be made away of this situation. All treatments will need to be completed and documented to ensure the
health of this pot belly pig.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During this inspection it was noted that they had recently acquired two Black and White ruffed lemurs. Their
enclosure is just inside the main gate. However, the barrier fence is only 1' away from the primary enclosure. The
general public can easily put their hands into this exhibit and the lemurs and easily reach out and touch the general
public. To ensure the safety of both the lemurs and the public, this barrier will need to be moved back so that there
is no direct contact between the animals and the public.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
This facility has recently acquired two black and white ruffed lemurs. All exhibitors that house primates must have
an environment enrichment plan to promote the psychological well-being of all primates. This plan was not available
at the time of this inspection. Therefore, an enrichment plan will need to be developed and approved by the
attending veterinarian.

3.125(a)FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. The dromedary camel pen and the donkey pen share a common fence line, down the width, of the two
enclosures. However, a tree has fallen on the back right corner of the donkey pen. Due to the close proximity of the
camel pen, this tree will need to be taken off the fence. And the fence will need to be repaired. Measures need to be
taken to ensure the integrity of the fence lines are secure.

2. The goat pen that houses 8 goats and has an elevated shelter barn that is in need of attention. The shelter barn
is approximately 4' off the ground. There is a ramp that allows the goats to access the shelter. The door to the
shelter appears to be a painted metal surface. However, the paint has begun to peel away. The entire middle is
bare but the edges have loose pieces of paint. To ensure the health of these goats, this door will need to be
addressed.

3. The same shelter noted in #2 also has chicken wire around the base. It appears that the goats have broken
through the chicken wire and are now gaining access under the shelter. Due to the fact that the chicken wire is
loose and broken, there are several jagged edges. To ensure that the goats are not injured on this wire it will need
to be addressed.
