Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Several metal roof planks from the investigator’s office, and two animal shade platforms were observed to have extensive
corroded sharp points and edges. Buildings and facilities at premises where nonhuman primates congregate and use,
must be kept in good repair, and be free of jagged edges or sharp points in order to protect the animals from traumatic
injuries. To prevent potential injuries to the nonhuman primates in the colony, the facility must repair or replace as all
corroded roof planks on all affected buildings within the premises.
