Facilities, general.
1. In 2020, a male Elk was observed with a section of wire wrapped around its antlers. The attending veterinarian was
contacted and the animal was provided care and sedated in order to remove the wire. Enclosures need to be maintained
in good repair in order to prevent injury to the animal. The elk fencing was observed to be in good repair at this time.

2. At the time of this inspection, the fencing for the red deer pasture had two areas where the wire was loose from the
support beams, jagged and broken. This can cause harm to the animals should they get caught. Fencing needs to be
maintained and repaired when needed to prevent the animals from getting injured or caught. The facility has added this
repair to their fencing maintenance plan.
