2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available at the time of inspection. The owner stated that he
had not had the veterinarian out this year. There were dead animals within the facility at the time of inspection. A
written program must be available at the facility to assure personnel have accurate instruction for the care of the
animals. Failure to have specific accurate guidance does not ensure the attending veterinarian is aware of the
current practices at the facility and also does not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate
veterinary care to the animals. Correct this by developing and implementing a complete, accurate Program of
Veterinary Care. To be corrected by: 20 January 2017
2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A litter of weaning age rabbits died prior to the inspection, The owner stated that they had developed diarrhea.
Three other rabbits were found dead during the inspection but The veterinarian had not been contacted. A failure to
conduct adequate observations can result in a delay of care provided to the animals and prolonged animal suffering.
All animals must be observed daily to assess their health and well-being. Problems of animal health, behavior, and
well- being shall be addressed in a timely manner. Direct frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is
necessary to ensure that animals are treated appropriately. Correct by ensuring timely communication of
information to your veterinarian and maintaining documentation of this communication for review by APHIS officials.
Correct from this point forward
3.56(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The wire enclosures were generally covered with cobwebs and had accumulations of hair, some also had
accumulations of feces that had not fallen thru the wire floors. Dust and organisms can be collected in these
accumulations and lead to disease in the animals. The areas under the wire floored enclosures contained significant
buildup of feces and liquid which had accumulated to the point that it extended into the isles. The owner stated that
the facility was generally cleaned weekly, on Thursday, but that his help had been sick. Buildup of excreta can
increase the risk of disease in the animals. Waste must be removed and properly disposed of to minimizeinfestation, odors and disease. Correct by assuring primary enclosures are kept reasonably free of excreta, hair,
cobwebs and other debris by periodic cleaning and the areas underneath are cleaned at least once each week as
required by section 3.56(a)(3).
3.56(b)
SANITATION.
The enclosures did not appear to have been thoroughly cleaned in the last 30 days. When asked about cleaning,
the owner stated that the enclosures were scrubbed to remove debris and sprayed with bleach solution when the
rabbits were not in them. He indicated the sprayer on the top of the corner shelf which appeared unsanitary and
covered with dust. Failure to adequately sanitize enclosures can lead to disease in the animals. Correct by washing
all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant at least every 30 days. To
be corrected by: 23 January 2017
3.56(c)
SANITATION.
The facility was generally not clean as evidenced by cobwebs, dust and debris throughout. According to the
licensee the cleaning employee had not been at the facility this week. Regular cleaning is needed to facilitate the
husbandry of the animals and prevent the introduction of disease. Accumulations of cage parts, boxes and other
debris were present on top of the cages and throughout the facility. These items appeared to have been in place for
some time. The presence of these items impedes the ability to properly clean and provides harborage for pests.
These factors can lead to disease in the animals. Correct by keeping premises clean and free of accumulations. To
be corrected by: 30 January 2017
3.57 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It was evident from the condition of the facility that not enough employee man hours were being used to clean and
maintain the facility. The owner stated that he had one individual to help but that this individual was currently sick. If
the current number of employees is unable to provide the required man hours to facilitate the care, cleaning and
maintenance then more employees are needed. Failure to provide for sufficient operation of the facility can lead to
disease in the animals. Correct by providing a sufficient number of employees (man-hours) to maintain the
prescribed level of husbandry practices set forth in 9 CFR.
This inspection was conducted with the owner on 1/13/17 and all of the issues identified and necessary corrections
were discussed verbally at that time. The report was delivered and exit interview was were conducted with the
owner on 1/17/17.
