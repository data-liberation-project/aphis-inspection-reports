ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:38 pm on
17-NOV-16.
Inspector arrived at the facility at 1:38 pm and the door to the pet store had a closed sign on it. The inspector called
the listed phone number twice. Both calls resulted in an automated system that stated the phone number has been
disconnected or is no longer in use, therefore the inspector could not leave a message. The inspector waited 30
minutes and then tried knocking on the pet store door. There was no answer so the inspector then left the facility.
