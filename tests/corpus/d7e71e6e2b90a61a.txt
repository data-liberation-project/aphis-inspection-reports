ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a female Maltese (900111881525817) that would consistently scratch at her ears. Upon closer
observation of her left ear, it was observed to have a thickened cobblestone appearance near the ear canal which
extended outward toward the hair on the tip of the ear. The dog’s left ear also had a couple of small circular areas
with scab-like material covering them near the edge of the ear and closer to the hair line. The right ear had a section
around its canal that also had a cobblestone and thickened appearance. Both of the ear canals had some hair that
appeared dark red to burgundy in color. According to the licensee, he had noticed that the dog had been scratching
at the ears for the past 2-3 weeks. He stated that he had initially used a mite treatment in the ears but did not see
an improvement. He then said he had tried a different product and showed the inspector an ear drop product which
contained oils. When asked about the last time the dog’s ears had been treated, the licensee stated it had been
about three days ago.The licensee had not been in contact with a veterinarian regarding treatment for the dog’s
ears. Also according to the licensee, he did not think he had seen any improvement in the dog's condition since he
had noticed that the dog was itching at her ears. This dog’s condition could be due to an infection in the ears and/or
other veterinary medical condition which could continue to persist or worsen. The licensee must communicate with a
veterinarian regarding this dog’s condition in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. The licensee
must ensure that the treatment plan is followed and that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times. To
be corrected by: September 20, 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
