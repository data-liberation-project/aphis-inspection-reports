2.5(d)
DURATION OF LICENSE AND TERMINATION OF LICENSE.
Regulated activities have continued to occur despite operating from a new, unapproved site/location. A site
inspection was conducted on 5-18-16. The purpose was to approve the new site to conduct regulated activities.
Three non-compliant items were cited on the report inspection. The report also contained a statement reading that
"no regulated activities may be conducted from this site until all non-compliant items are corrected". A combined
total of 61 sugar gliders, hedgehogs, chipmunks, and prairie dogs have been sold since that time. Licenses are
issued to specific persons for specific premises and are not valid at a different location. Selling animals from
unapproved facilities doesn't ensure the animals health and well-being.
The new site must be inspected and approved prior to conducting any regulated activities.
To be corrected: Immediately
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
