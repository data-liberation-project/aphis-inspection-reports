2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 200pm on
04/23/2014.
Multiple attempts have been made to contact this licensee with negative results. The licensee has never returned
any phone messages or tried to make contact with this inspector. On this date I stayed in the driveway for 25
minutes honking the horn several times after knocking on the trailer. There were 2 cars in the drive and the TV was
on as it could be heard when I knocked on the trailer. There was a tall male who came to the window of the back
door and watched me in the driveway, however they would not make contact. I tried leaving messages however the
home phone is now disconnected and the cell phone was set to not take any messages. This licensee has actively
refused to communicate with the inspector to allow an inspection and has continually made no effort to work out any
arrangements for future inspections. Attempts have been made on multiple days and times with no results, and the
licensee has not communicated any 'optimal times for inspection' options after repeated messages and 'attempted
inspections' requesting this information.
Please contact this inspector at 618-315-3649 ASAP in order to sort out optimal times for inspections.
