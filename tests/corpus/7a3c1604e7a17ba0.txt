2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee has a container of Probiotic supplement and a container of powdered Calcium supplement. Each container
does not list instructions on use for the supplement. The attending veterinarian has verbally approved the use of these
supplements and they are currently being given to approximately 5 nursing dams.

The appropriate use of supplements and assurance that those supplements are safe and effective are important for
proper medical treatment. All medications and supplements must be properly labeled, including instructions for use written
on the container or included in a written program of veterinary care signed by the attending veterinarian.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility uses cage cards as the record of acquisition for the dogs born at the facility. There were two litters of puppies
with their dams with no official identification number assigned to them; Dam "Rainy" (microchip number
900217000348534) had 6 puppies born on 27-May-2022 and Dam "Sparkles" (microchip number 9330003201123274)
had 1 puppy born 9-June-2022.


The Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005) is missing acquisition information for several
dogs. The facility uses microchips under the dog’s skin as the form of official identification for the following adult dogs.
Certain acquisition information was corrected at the time of inspection.
**Full addresses were missing for the following dogs: Tippy (900217000348528) , Propsy (900217000348542), Queenie
(9910030009017864) (fixed), Shammie (91003000997797) (fixed), Shiloh (900217000348533), Sparkles
(933000320123274), Jelly (9330003201123251), Ebony (900217000348195) (fixed), Boomer (900217000348206) (fixed),
and Boodle (900217000348192) (fixed).
**Missing the USDA License number of the person whom dogs were purchased from for Queenie and Shammie.

The licensee is assigning official identification numbers to puppies right before they are sold. An 8-week old Shih Tzu-
Bichon male was not assigned an official identification number until the time of its disposition from the facility on 16-June-
2022.

Accurate acquisition information is necessary for APHIS officials to make positive identification of animals during
inspection and to properly trace their movements. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain an approved method of
documentation which fully and correctly disclose all information concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired,
owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or
otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her
possession or under his or her control.
The licensee must record the acquisition information on an approved document for all puppies and ensure all required

acquisition information is properly and accurately documented at all times.

3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The lack of complete medical records makes it difficult to determine if the animals are receiving vaccines, preventative
medical procedures, and treatments as prescribed by the veterinarian.

**The attending veterinarian did head to tail exams on all dogs on 15-February-2022
**The licensee gave parvovirus and distemper vaccines on 15-February-2022
**The licensee dewormed adult dogs on 15-February-2022
**The licensee dewormed Rainy's 6 puppies (DOB 27-May-2022), Sparkles' 1 puppy (DOB 9-June-2022) and Phoebe's 6
puppies (DOB 3-June-2022) sometime last week.
The lack of medical records makes it difficult to determine if the animals are receiving the vaccines and preventative
medical procedures and treatments. This information is needed for APHIS inspectors to ensure the medical care is being
provided by the licensee.

Female Shih Tzu "Tippy" (Microchip number 900217000348528) is receiving Clavamox every 12 hours for 7 days after a
c-section was performed by the veterinarian on 3-July-2022. The licensee states "Tippy" is receiving medications as
prescribed by the vet but is not writing down the dates and times the medication is being given. The number of pills left in
the package supports the licensee is giving the Clavamox twice a day.

The licensee must complete and maintain updated medical records including the dates of treatment administration and

the identity of the animal, including identifying marks, tattoos, or tags on the animal and the animal’s breed, sex, and age;
Provided, however, that routine husbandry, such as vaccinations, preventive medical procedures, or treatments,
performed on all animals in a group (or herd), may be kept on a single record.
