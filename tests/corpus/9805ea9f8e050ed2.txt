2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One cinnamon colored male Chihuahua that the facility representative estimated at 15 years old (microchip number
086-333-327) has a heavy coating of dark brown matter on his upper teeth. The dog was also missing all of its
bottom teeth. The abnormal buildup of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth
structure, be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally and harm the health of the animal. The licensee
must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate plan administered. The outcome of this
examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all
animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
To be corrected by August 11, 2014.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative at time of inspection.
