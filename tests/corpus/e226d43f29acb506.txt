ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care was present, but lacked details on routine vaccinations for all the species present on
the premises and included a veterinarian that is no longer in practice. The Program of Veterinary Care documents
the agreement between the attending veterinarian and the licensee in order to ensure that the animals are provided
appropriate care and must be complete and accurate.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the upper level adult pig pen, there were exposed wire ends within the enclosure against the hiillside fence.
- In the lower pen with the 4 male goats, the shade cloth had fallen and had a hole in it.
The enclosures must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury, and a system of maintenance must
be in place to ensure that the enclosures are in good repair.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the lower goat enclosure (including the 3 Angora goats) adjacent to the sheep, there was very little shade
available in late afternoon, the hottest part of the day. Temperatures at time of inspection exceeded 90 degrees F.
Only two to three goats out of more than twenty were able to fit in the shade offered by the shade structure due to
the angle of the sun, and the Angora goat was panting, despite lying down in the shade. The adjacent pen had a
similar issue, where the shade structure does not provide adequate shade in the afternoon. Sufficient shade must
be provided to allow all the animals to find shade and protect themselves from direct sunlight.Correction date 20 Dec, 2015

SANITATION.
-In the main cow enclosure, there are more cows present than normal due to the drought and lack of forage on
grazing land, and therefore an increase in the level of manure. The increase in manure has attracted an abundance
of flies that are congregating on the cows and adjacent reindeer, especially on their eyes.
-In the alpaca enclosure, there is also an excess accumulation of manure attracting flies, and the flies are excessive
on the alpacas and the adjacent pigs.
Fly traps were present throughout the facility but were not charged thus not effective at controlling the fly population.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination and minimize
disease hazards, and a safe and effective program for the control of insects shall be established and maintained.
