PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The concrete floors and the straw bedding in the rabbit runs were damp and the building had a strong ammonia
odor. The dampness could have been from excessive rain water seeping up through the concrete or inadequate
cleaning of the cages. Either way the bedding and the floors were damp with most of the rabbits having no way to
escape the damp floor and remain dry and clean. Primary enclosures must allow the rabbits to remain dry and
clean.
The licensee needs to determine exactly what is causing the dampness and excessive odor and correct
accordingly. If it is caused by inadequate cleaning then the number of rabbits should be reduced or the rabbit runs
need to be cleaned more thoroughly and frequently. If the cause is seepage of water through the concrete then the
concrete needs to be water proofed. Changing the type of bedding and providing more elevated areas for the
rabbits to get off the floor may also assist with allowing the animals to remain dry and clean.
To be corrected immediately.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee.
