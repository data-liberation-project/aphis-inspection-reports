2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
The individual has been exhibiting a male camel without a USDA license. On 1-April-2022, the camel was exhibited at a
local high school track meet. On 30-July-2022, the camel along with a llama and a miniature horse were exhibited in a
town celebration parade.
When the inspector inquired about the camel being exhibited, the individual stated they were told by someone, whom they
could not remember in this conversation, that camels were exempt from being licensed because they are an agriculture
animal used for milk. The inspector asked if they were milking the camel to which they replied no. The individual runs a
petting zoo made of all farm animals; goats, llama, chickens, ducks, lambs and calves. The individual stated the big draw
to the petting zoo is the camel.
Failure to have an active Class "C" license does not ensure the animals are exhibited in an appropriate and humane
manner than adheres to the Animal Welfare Act. The facility must become licensed with a class “C” license before
conducting regulated activity.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
