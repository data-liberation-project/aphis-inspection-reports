ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1505 on
15-May-18.
We arrived at the facility at 3:05pm. The licensee's teenage son came out to greet us. He called the licensee and
she stated that she would be at work for several more hours and her husband was bed-ridden with an illness. She
asked if her son could take us through the kennel but we declined due to him being under-age. I informed her that
she would receive an attempted inspection in the mail.
Additional Inspectors
