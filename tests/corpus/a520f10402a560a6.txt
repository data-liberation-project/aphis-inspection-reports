3.6(a)(2)(10) DIRECT REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
**** In the indoor whelping building the feet and legs of Chihuahua puppies were observed passing through the
enclosure floor openings numerous times. Three puppies are in contact with the affected flooring located in indoor
housing. Flooring that allows the feet and legs to pass through any openings can be stressful and could lead to
possible injury. In addition, the daily activity and mobility of the puppies is affected. The licensee must ensure that
all flooring does not allow any feet or legs to pass through any openings in the flooring.
** The licensee corrected this flooring issue during the inspection by covering the enclosure floor with a smaller
gauge wire that wouldn't allow the puppies feet to pass through.
Exit interview was conducted with Brittany Light, ACI, Debbie Cunningham, VMO and the facility representative.
