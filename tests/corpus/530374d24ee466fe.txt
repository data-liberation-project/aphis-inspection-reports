2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The documentation of the disposition of the camels referred to in the previous inspection report dated May 6, 2021 was
inadequate. The name of the licensee, address of their location, and identification information of the camels was not
noted. Also, there were no original acquisition documents for the 39 zebra.

Acquisition and disposition records should be maintained and kept to facilitate the tracking of animals and to ensure their
health and well-being. Acquisition records must be created and maintained for the zebra. The address and the
identification of the camels that were transferred to Florida must be documented in accordance with the AWA regulations.
Records of disposition must be created and maintained for review by an APHIS inspector.
2.131(a) Critical

Handling of animals.
On August 22, 2021, the caretaker could only account for 36 of 39 zebras that were brought to the facility that morning.
Three (3) zebras escaped and have been sighted in the surrounding residential areas and farmland for 30 days, at the
time of inspection on September 20, 2021. The zebras most likely escaped during the unloading process which occurred
around 5:30am. The unloading of the zebras was carried out by the owner and experience caretakers.



On September 24, 2021, the licensee was informed by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources that one of the
escaped zebras was found with a leg in a snare trap and deceased along the fence line just outside of the property.

The zebras were not handled in a manner that demonstrated the licensee and staff were knowledgeable of the handling of
zebras. As a result, one of the zebras was injured and died. Appropriate expertise must be obtained to assist in the
capture of the remaining two (2) escaped zebra. Correct by October 4, 2021.
3.127(b)

Facilities, outdoor.
The barn used as shelter from the elements for the 39 zebra needs minor repairs and a heat source. The wood for the
back wall is rotting and there are gaps in the wall that would allow cold air into the barn. One glass pane has a hole in it.
Unnecessary supplies and equipment is stored in one section of the barn.

The barn must be repaired to ensure adequate protection from inclement weather and extremely cold temperatures. The
unnecessary supplies and equipment must be removed to allow enough room for all zebras to seek shelter at one time
and to prevent injury to the animals. A source to adequately heat and maintain an acceptable temperature during the
winter months must be installed for the health and comfort of the zebras. Correct by October 9, 2021.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
There were tractors and associated equipment stored in the pasture that the zebra roam. There was also a couple of piles
of wood for building and fencing. Hazardous items in the pasture where the zebra roam can lead to animal injury or


illnesses. Grounds should be kept in such a manner that protects the animals from injury. Unnecessary equipment must
be removed and kept in a designated area away from the animals for their health and safety Correct by October 4. 2021.
3.132

Employees.
At the time of inspection, 36 zebras were being cared for by one person with no experience or adequate knowledge of the
species. Animals being cared for by an inexperienced animal caretaker can lead to inappropriate care of the animals and
the potential for undue harm. The licensees must ensure that adequately trained employees are utilized to maintain the
professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices set forth in Subpart F of the Animal Welfare Act regulations and
standards and as required by this section. Correct by October 4, 2021

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
