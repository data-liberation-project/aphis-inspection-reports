Housing facilities, general.
There was one container of food for dogs that was lidded yet not leakproof.

Containers of food that are not leakproof are not fully protective of the food from spoilage, contamination, and vermin
infestation, which can cause disease hazards in dogs.

All open supplies of food must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and
spoilage.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by February 12, 2023, or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.
