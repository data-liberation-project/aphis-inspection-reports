RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
***The licensee acted as a broker for nine puppies bound for New York, but could not produce the required
acquisition records for the puppies. Properly completed acquisition records are necessary for identification of dogs
to facilitate record-keeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and tracing of the animals. The
licensee must maintain the required acquisition information for all dogs she acquires and must be able to produce
these records upon request by the Inspector. For puppies acquired from dog breeders that have a USDA license,
the records will include APHIS Form 7006 unless the breeder has obtained a records variance from the Regional
Office. For puppies acquired from dog breeders that do not have a USDA license, the records will include the
following information: the name and address of the person who consigned the puppies, their vehicle license number
and State, their driver(cid:25)s license number and State, the date of the consignment, the puppies(cid:25) official USDA
identification, and a description of the puppies (breed, sex, date of birth or age, color and any distinctive markings).

breeder in Seymour, MO. However, the puppy did not have a Health Certificate when it was picked up by the

abnormality within 10 days prior to the beginning of transport. The licensee must ensure that all dogs are
accompanied by a Health Certificate from a veterinarian prior to transportation in commerce.
