3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The shelters in at least one-half of the 25 outdoor enclosures had an inadequate amount of bedding material for the
current temperatures. Four of the shelters had no bedding material and the rest had a small amount that almost covered
the cement floor. The temperature at the time of the inspection was 35.6 degrees F( Kestrel reading) and the overnight
temperatures have been less than 35 degrees F (local weather reports). Bedding material is important to protect the dogs
from the cold temperatures and to help preserve body heat. Lack of appropriate bedding in cold environments increases
the risks of sickness and hypothermia conditions. Sufficient clean, dry bedding material is necessary to provide protection
when the temperature is less than 50 degrees F. More bedding material is necessary when the temperature is less than
35 degrees F for the dogs to have better protection. The owner must provide sufficient bedding for the dogs and maintain
it.
Correction date: 11 January, 2021
Note: Bedding was provided before the inspector left the premises.

Inspection and exit interview was done with a facility representative.
