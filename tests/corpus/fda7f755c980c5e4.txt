ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:50 AM on
05-Sep-19.
The inspector arrived at the registrant's address at 10:45 AM and rang the doorbell twice and knocked on the door
twice. No one answered the door. The inspector then called the phone number on file for the applicant. No one
answered so the inspector left a voicemail. No one returned the inspector's phone call after waiting 30 minutes, at
which time the inspector left.
