FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** Muddy low areas with little drainage have developed immediately below the PVC feeder tubes in the fallow deer
enclosure. When people are present, in anticipation of being fed, the deer tend to gather in these areas. In so doing
their feet are frequently in the mud, and this, in turn, could lead to hoof problems.
For the health of the animals this situation must be corrected.
This non-compliance was corrected before the inspector left the facility.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility owner on 7/30/14.
