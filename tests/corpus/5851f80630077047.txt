Facilities, general.
There are 31 enclosures that have gaps under either one or both entry gates that lead into the primary enclosure. These
gates are within the lockdown areas, however they can pose a possible hazard if the tiger, lion or leopards were to reach
under the gates with a paw and grab at the feet of a keeper while feeding or cleaning. There are several gates that have
been fixed with a piece of partially buried metal mesh under the base of the gates; however, due to heavy rains and wear
there are several more gates that need to have the gaps fixed.

A gap under the fencing and gates, or vertically between the gates and their support poles can be a potential risk for the
keepers if the regulated animals were able to get a paw through the gaps and grab at their feet or bodies, potentially
causing an injury to the person and/or animal.

All gaps under gates, fences or along the sides of the gates and their support poles should be filled or adjusted in order to
minimize the space that could allow for a paw to get through and make contact with a person.

Sanitation.
The South side of the facility behind the office area known as 'BFE' has an excessive amount of overgrowth of weeds and
grasses that surround the primary enclosures. There are multiple enclosures that have a large amount of overgrowth
within the primary enclosures containing lions, tigers or leopards. The facility had seven of their vehicles break down over
the summer which allowed them to utilize a proper bush hog to keep on top of the mowing. They were limited to a push
mower for the public side of the facility only The south side went through the summer with very minimal upkeep inside and
surrounding many of the primary enclosures.

The accumulation of grasses and weeds around the primary enclosures could hide damaged fencing or breaches in the
perimeter of the enclosure. The overgrowth can also provide an area for vermin and pests to make increased contact with
the regulated animals.

All overgrown vegetation within the enclosures and surrounding the primary enclosures must be kept clean and cut in
order to allow for the perimeter and enclosure fencing to be fully monitored, and to prevent the increase in vermin and
pest contact with the regulated animals.
