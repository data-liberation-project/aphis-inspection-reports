***** At time of inspection the Plan of Veterinary Care could not be located for review. A plan of veterinary care for
the facility must include a written plan in the absence of a full time veterinarian and must include regularly scheduled
visits to the facility. This plan helps to provide guidance to maintaining good health for the animals in the facility and
directions to the facility for implementation of the plan.
An APHIS form 7002 Animal Care plan of veterinary care is being forwarded to the facility by the regional office and
should be filled out by the attending veterinarian and the facility and kept on hand and made available to APHIS
personnel for review upon request.
