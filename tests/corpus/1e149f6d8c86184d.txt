3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
In May 2022, a wolf was bitten by a rattle snake and suffered injury to it's muzzle. Licensee treated this wolf with
antibiotics and steroids, to reduce swelling, based on the attending veterinarian's instruction. During the daily
observations on July 16, 2022, a wolf was found deceased in it's enclosure. It was determined that it succumbed to a
snake bite. A necropsy, conducted on the same day, noted findings that were consistent with a snake bite. According to
the licensee, snakes can enter into the enclosure through the openings of the chain-link fence fabric. Due to these
events, the licensee failed to protect the wolves from injury.
Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained to protect the wolves housed therein from injury and
to prevent the entrance of snakes that can cause such injuries.

TO BE CORRECTED BY: SEPTEMBER 15, 2022

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with licensee.
