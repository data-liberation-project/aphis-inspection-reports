3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the Mine Shaft Exhibit the enclosures of the four prairie dogs and 2 ring-tailed cats both had light fixtures with
exposed light bulbs that were not covered. The exposed light bulbs poses a risk of injury to the animals if it breaks
and glass gets into the enclosures of these animals. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in
place and to ensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and/or escape.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
