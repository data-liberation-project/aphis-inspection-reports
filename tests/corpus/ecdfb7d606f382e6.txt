HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.
The food storage are was noted to have an excessive amount of rodent droppings next to pallets of feed. Rodent
control methods are reported to be used, however the effective use of these methods can't be confirmed with
droppings present. Rodent droppings in feed storage areas can potentially contaminate feed and make animals
sick.
Maintain food storage areas clean and free from rodent droppings at all times to protect animal health and to
evaluate rodent control pratices.To be corrected: 2-13-14

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Ventilation.
Four of the whelping rooms (1, 2, B1, 17) were noted by inspectors to have a strong ammonia odor present. A
slight burning sensation could be felt in the throats of the inspectors in these rooms during the inspection. Strong
ammonia odors can cause animals to get sick.
While maintaining adequate temperature levels, fresh air flow must be maintained.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Excessive feces are present inside many outdoor run areas of the primary enclosures. The feces are not being
removed daily from these enclosures. This left limited areas for the dogs to walk or stand without coming into
contact with the waste. Inadequate daily removal of excreta increases the risk of animals getting sick.
Remove excreta from these enclosures and maintain on a daily basis.
