2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a dead piglet observed in a shed in the pig enclosure. When shown to the facility representative, he was
not aware the piglet had died. There was an accumulation of mud in the upper part of the enclosure where the shed
was located from recent rains. Several piglets were observed to have difficulty ambulating in the deep mud.
It is possible the excessive thick mud was a factor in the piglet’s death. The facility should be observing the animals
daily to be aware of any issues that may impact the health of animals and cause injury or death.
The facility corrected the issue during the inspection by placing a new shed in the lower part of the enclosure where
the ground was dry.
CORRECT BY: Corrected during the inspection.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There were incomplete records of acquisition and disposition.
Complete records of the animals currently being housed including their acquisition and disposition is necessary in
order to accurately track animals to ensure humane care and use of the animals.
Exhibitors must make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose information concerning animals
purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her
control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.

2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.The enclosure housing the single lemur did not have a public barrier to prevent contact with the animal.
Such unauthorized contact poses a possible risk of injury to both members of the public and the lemur.
The facility must handle animals so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient
distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals
and the public.

3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There was no program for environment enhancement for the 3 lemurs. There was one lemur being housed
individually and two lemurs being housed together. The single lemur was unable to see the other two lemurs.
Nonhuman primates have social needs and needs for environmental enrichment which, if not addressed, may lead
to negative effects on their psychological well-being.
Exhibitors must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to
promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must include provisions to address the
social needs of nonhuman primates which exist in social groups in nature.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence around the giraffe enclosure at the top corner was disconnected from the corner post and in need of
repair. The fence around the oryx was bent over in one area and in need of repair. The fence at the perimeter of
the property adjacent to the road and containing the exotic hoofstock was in severe disrepair in one area. The
fence there was essentially missing, with logs piled to prevent animal escape and a piece of black plastic had been
used to span the gap.
Animal injury may result from fencing in poor repair or from attempts of the animal to escape through damaged
fencing or subsequent to their escape.
The facility must be structurally sound and be maintained in good repair.CORRECT BY: Temporary correction-9-4-19. Permanent correction-9-25-19.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The animal feed was stored in two structures near the pig enclosure. Some of the food was stored in closed plastic
bins. However, there were several bags of feed that were being stored directly on the ground and the bags were
opened with no means of securing them closed. In addition, there were rodenticide chemicals in spray bottles being
stored directly above open bags of feed which could possibly contaminate the feed if the bottles leaked. A large
number of bags of feed were piled on the floor on top of each other and next to each other with no space
underneath or around the bags to allow cleaning.
Food contaminated by chemicals or through improper storage may have a negative effect on animal health and
welfare.
Supplies of food should be stored in a manner which adequately protects them against deterioration, molding, or
contamination by vermin.
CORRECT BY: 9-4-19.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
There was a large amount of spilled feed on the floor of one of the animal feed sheds. There were numerous rodent
droppings observed on the floor of the sheds and on top of the refrigerators. The interior of the refrigerators in both
sheds, which were used to store some of the perishable animal feed items, contained unidentified residue and were
in need of cleaning. There were discarded items, used cups and other debris in the grain bin, which presently was
not used for food storage.
Inadequate cleaning and repair may adversely impact the health and welfare of the animals.
Premises must be kept clean and in good repair.
CORRECT BY: 9-4-19.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There was evidence of rodent activity, including numerous rodent droppings observed in the animal feed sheds andobservation of a rat removing a food pellet from a lemur enclosure.
Rodents may carry diseases that negatively impact the health and welfare of animals.
The facility must establish and maintain a safe and effective pest control program.
CORRECT BY: 9-4-19.
The inspection took place 27-28 August 2019.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
