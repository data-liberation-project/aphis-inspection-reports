3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
A section of the wire fence of the enclosure was bowed out, and a gap measuring approximately 18 by 12 inches was
present where the wire had been pulled free from the wooden supports. Damage to the structural integrity of the fence
may lead to the animals escaping or a predator entering the enclosure. The facility must maintain the enclosure in good
repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them safely.

Correction begun after walkthrough.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 01/23/2023, 60 days counted from 1st RL Inspection, or
the applicant will forfeit the license fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your
next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
