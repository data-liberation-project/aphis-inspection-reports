HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the Brown and Black dogs' enclosure there is a 10-15ft section of exposed diamond mesh fencing running along
the ground that has been dug up. This area has the pointed parts of the fencing bent in toward the inside of the
enclosure which allows the dog to come in contact with the pointed structures running along the ground where the
dog runs and paces the fence line.
Sharp or pointed objects that come in contact with the regulated animals can cause injuries if not repaired or
replaced with materials that will protect the animal from those surfaces.
The licensee must repair that area of the fencing where there are sharp points or jagged edges that might injure the
animal.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Currently there are 2 large dogs and 1 cat that are housed in 3 outdoor enclosures located within the perimeter
fence of the regulated animals (lion, serval and snow macaque). There is a buildup of feces in the dog enclosures
that is at least 2 weeks in accumulation. The dogs are able to avoid the excreta by running around the perimeter of
their enclosure and their shelter boxes, however the center of the enclosure has numerous piles of feces.
Proper daily cleaning and sanitization is necessary to prevent possible disease exposure and transmission and
other possible health issues.

The licensee must remove excreta and food waste from primary enclosures daily to prevent an excessive
accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats contained in the primary enclosures,
and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.To correct by: March 23, 2014

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The water bowls of the 2 dogs and cat that are located in the perimeter fence with the regulated animals have a film
of algae in the bowls, with 2 of the cat bowls being full of old leaves and algae in the bottom and around the sides.
The licensee currently is not sanitizing the food and water receptacles at least once every 2 weeks.
Proper daily cleaning and sanitization is necessary to prevent possible disease exposure and transmission and
other possible health issues.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is a shelf inside the entry door of the Snow Macaque (M) that is housed inside a garage that had a buildup of
feces and debris that has not been cleaned or sanitized according to AWA standards and regulations. The food
receptacle is attached to the outside of the enclosure which appears to not have been cleaned or sanitized properly
due to the buildup of old food and debris on the feeder.
The buildup of old food, feces and debris on the solid surfaces inside a primates enclosure can be a vector for
disease transmission or other health issues.
The licensee shall wash all soiled surfaces with appropriate detergent solutions or disinfectants, or by using a
combination detergent/disinfectant product that accomplishes the same purpose, with a thorough cleaning of the
surfaces to remove organic material, so as to remove all organic material and mineral buildup, and to provide
sanitization followed by a clean water rinse.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Currently there is a female lion being housed outdoors in a covered primary enclosure under a covered roof
structure. All four sides or the primary enclosure are of diamond mesh fencing with no wind breaks except for the
addition of a black mesh that is 85% efficient at blocking out sun on the far right side of the enclosure. The licensee
stated that he had built 2 wooden box structures for the lion in the past 4 months but that she has destroyed them
both. The last structure was destroyed and removed 2 weeks prior leaving the lion without any shelter to get into to
escape the extremely cold temperatures, wind or rain/snow if it was to blow into the enclosure.
It is important that the animals housed outdoors have shelters they can get into to protect themselves from the wind,
rain or snow so that they can use it to conserve body heat and provide protection from the elements.The winter has
been extremely cold with temperatures in the negative degree ranges for multiple days, and while the shade cloth
may have prevented snow from gathering in the enclosure, without any kind of shelter to escape in to conserve
body heat, the cold temperatures can cause discomfort and possible health issues. The regulated animals need to
be provided a shelter that is built in a manner to last and allow for the choice of the animal to use if needed.
The lion must be provided a durable shelter that has a roof, 3 walls and a floor to protect her from the inclement
weather.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The licensee now has a diet plan detailed by the veterinarian that does stipulate that "vitamin supplements should
be added at the appropriate ratio" on a daily basis, however the licensee did not have any of the vitamin
supplements to show during the inspection due to running out 2-3 days prior and has not picked up or ordered
more.
It is imperative that a proper diet with supplements as directed by the veterinarian are given regularly to promote
good health and wellbeing of the animals. Improper diets and supplementation can lead to physical health and
behavioral issues if left unresolved.
The diet plan that has been signed by the attending veterinarian needs to be followed in order to provide proper
food and nutrient levels for the regulated animals. The licensee must plan ahead and have the required vitamin
supplements available for the animals on a daily basis and replenish stock in a timely manner in order to prevent the
animals from being without their required dietary supplement.3.130
WATERING.
The water bowls of the 2 lions and Serval have a film of algae in the bowls in the bottom and around the sides. The
female lion has a thicker buildup of algae in the water tub due to it not being scrubbed or washed out properly. The
male lion has algae in the bottom of both water bowls with old leaves in the bowl, and the Servals' bowl had a coat
of dark green algae covering the sides and bottom of the water receptacle.
Proper cleaning and sanitization of water receptacles is necessary to prevent possible disease exposure and
transmission and other possible health issues that can come from algae, old food, dirt and debris buildup in the
water bowls..
Food and water receptacle need to be cleaned properly as often as necessary to prevent an accumulation of algae,
dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.

SANITATION.
There is a Serval cat (M) that is housed in an outdoor fenced enclosure that has at least 2 weeks of fecal matter and
old bones littering the floor of approximately 90% of the floor space. The Serval was lying on the ground during the
inspection on top of and surrounded by excreta. Due to the cold weather the excrement was frozen, however the
only areas without debris was at one end of the enclosure near its water area or up on the shelves where its
climbing perches and shelter are located. The outdoor enclosure is long but narrow which does not allow for much
area for the animal to get away from its excrement if not cleaned on a shorter more regular basis.
A buildup of old food debris and fecal material that the animal can not easily get away from can cause potential for
disease exposure, health issues and discomfort for the regulated animal.Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. In smaller enclosures the fecal/excreta will
need to be removed more often in order to provide a cleaner environment according to AWA standards and
regulations.
