Facilities, general.
>>In the enclosure housing 1 racoon named “Pepper” has a severely frayed hammock hanging in the upper far left corner
which poses a risk for injury if the animal were to become entangled. Maintain all indoor and outdoor facilities so that they
are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injuries. This was corrected during the time of
inspection.
>>In the enclosure housing 1 gray fox named “Juniper” the elevated wood platform has 2 exposed screw heads
protruding outward. One of the boards along the front of the platform is ripped, shredded with sharp edges. The wood
poles utilized as a walking platform leading to the top of the shelter and elevated platform has deteriorated leaving holes
where the animal can get a foot or leg caught in. The exposed screw heads, sharp edges and holes in the walking
platform can cause an injury to the animal and are not in good repair. Maintain all indoor and outdoor facilities so that they
are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injuries.
