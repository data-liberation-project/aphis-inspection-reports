2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There are missing and incomplete acquisition records for three guinea pigs, seven rabbits, and six gerbils at the
facility. The licensee stated that he didn't receive or generate any records for the purchase and acquisition of six
rabbits and six gerbils. The licensee presented acquisition records for three guinea pigs and one rabbit that only
provided the date of sale, the email address and name of the person who sold them. The same person has sold
guinea pigs and/or rabbits to the licensee at least three different times during the previous year. The records for
those acquisitions only provided the date of sale, the email address and name of the person who sold them.
Missing and incomplete records don't allow for proper tracking of animals by APHIS officials.
Complete all acquisition records with the information required in 2.75 (b)(1) of this subpart.
To be corrected: From this day forward
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
