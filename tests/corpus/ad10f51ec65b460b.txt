ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In this inspection were observed three caracals housed in a primary enclosure: two females and one male. The
largest female and the male were noted with some areas of dark skin and hair loss on the flanks, also the largest
female has an crusty area surrounded by reddened and irritated skin on the left side. The owner after being
questioned about the caracals condition and the Attending Veterinarian diagnostic, told the inspector that the
caracals suffer this each spring, and they were using an antibiotic spray to treat the animals, but they had not
contacted the veterinarian yet.

This hair loss condition can worsen, and lesions of this type can become infected and more painful if not treated
according to the recommendations of the attending veterinarian.
These caracals must be presented to the attending veterinarian for examination, diagnosis, and proper treatment.
Documentation of the diagnoses, recommended treatments, and treatment of the animals must be maintained.
Any problems of health, behavior or well-being need to be reported to the attending veterinarian to ensure the
proper handling and treatment.
