3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several of the black metal wire sugar glider enclosures have a brown sticky substance on the wires which may
affect the structural integrity of the primary enclosures for the sugar gliders. The primary enclosures could be rusty
under the brown sticky substance however due to lack of cleanliness it was difficult to determine. The primary
enclosures shall be kept clean in order to prevent corrosion and deterioration of the primary enclosures. The indoor
housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair in order to protect the sugar
gliders from injury. The primary enclosures need to be cleaned to determine if they are structurally sound.
3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The odor in the sugar glider indoor building facilitiy was so strong and pungent that the inspector acquired a
headache during the inspection. The inspector noted that the ventilation equipment was turned off at the time of the
inspection. Since the primary enclosures were not clean, the odor could be a combination of feces, urine,
deteriorated food and soiled bedding/litter or inadequate fresh air or inadequate ventilation equipment. If the
inspector was unable to tolerate conditions in the indoor building these conditions could cause discomfort and
health problems for the sugar gliders. Facilities shall provide adequate ventilation for the health of the animals and
to prevent discomfort in the animals. Adequate ventilation is required to eliminate strong odors. Correct by
11/28/2015.
3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The inspector noted that many of the sugar gliders have a lack of adequate nesting/hiding spots available in the
primary enclosures. Many of the sugar gliders have plastic drinking cups for nesting/hiding areas which are cracked
/broken and have inadequate or no available areas for nesting/hiding. The inspector also noted that sugar gliders
were hiding/nesting in any available space including feeding receptacles. The sugar gliders were noted to be very
active in daylight hours which is an abnormal behavior pattern for a nocturnal species. It is important to have
adequate hiding/nesting space available in order for the sugar gliders to maintain a normal nocturnal behavior
pattern. Enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide normal postural and social adjustments.Inadequate space may be indicated by evidence of abnormal behavior problems. All sugar glider enclosures need
adequate nesting/hiding spaces. Correct by 11/25/2015
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
Many of the food receptacles in the primary enclosures have a brown/black substance on the outside of the
receptacles. Some sugar gliders were using the food receptacles as a bed/resting/hiding spot which could cause
food contamination. Some of the food receptacles were cracked or broken which could cause injury to the sugar
gliders while eating or contamination of their food. Food receptacles shall be kept clean at all times. Replace or
clean. Correct by 11/30/2015.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The primary enclosures for the sugar gliders were caked with a brown sticky looking substance on the black wires of
the cages. The floors had food,fruit flies,feces and litter that was not clean in the cages. The odor coming from the
cages was very strong smelling. This could cause disease and unhealthy living conditions for the sugar gliders.
Excreta shall be removed as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to
minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. All primary enclosures for the sugar gliders need to be cleaned and
maintained as often as needed in order to create an adequate healthy living environment for the sugar gliders.
Correct from this day forward.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
There are several jars in the interior window sills with a liquid inside the jar for capturing fruit flies . The jars are full
of fruit flies and look untouched or recently replenished with different liquid. Also fly strips are hanging from the
ceiling and are full of fruit flies. The jars and fly strips are either full or inadequate to continue being of any
substantial use in capturing fruit flies. Clean all unused jars and fly strips that are inadequate or ineffective.
Buildings shall be kept clean and in good repair to protect animals from injury. Correct by 11/26/2015
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The sugar glider primary enclosures have fruit flies accumulating in the black wire cages due to food and litter
contamination in the enclosures. There were fruit flies flying around the sugar glider cages and thru out the indoor
building housing the sugar gliders. One of the sugar gliders jumped and a cloud of fruit flies was visible in the
enclosure. The fruit flies are in great abundance and due to the rapid ability to reproduce need to be controlled and
eliminated. Insects may cause disease and may contaminate food in the sugar glider cages. A safe and effectiveprogram for the control of insects should be maintained and established with the attending veterinarian.
3.132
EMPLOYEES.
At this time only one owner is available to maintain approximately 150 sugar gliders. The one person is responsible
for all the care of the sugar gliders including cleaning all enclosures, all feeders ,feeding all food, pest control,
maintain building, changing all litter/bedding, and replacing all items needed for enclosures. The person also takes
sugar gliders to the flea market every weekend to sell the sugar gliders. A sufficient number of adequately trained
employees shall be utilized to maintain the professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices. An adequate
number of employees is needed to assure proper care of all the sugar gliders. Correct by11/30/2015.
Exit briefing was conducted with owner.
