Feeding.
The bears are currently being fed restaurant scraps and donated meat along with some produce and dog food.
Inspection of the feed buckets that will be fed today showed that they appear to be very high in fat and caloric content for
this time of year. Some of the bears appear to be over conditioned for the time of year. Diets that are too high in fat and
calories can lead to chronic health conditions for these bears such as arthritis and respiratory issues. The diet for the
bears needs to be prepared considering their age and the time of year. The facility should consult with the attending
veterinarian to develop and follow a bear feeding plan that considers bear age, condition and the time of year. Consult
with the attending veterinarian to develop a diet plan.
