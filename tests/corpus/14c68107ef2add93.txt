3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The vinyl wire flooring for two end enclosures in the top row west side of the Sundowner Kennel, housing a total of
eight adult dogs, was sagging. The flooring was sagging approximately 2 to 3 inches, along where the vinyl flooring
and back wall meet. The flooring was bouncing excessively when the dogs housed in the enclosures walk on it.
The metal panel used to support or strengthen under the vinyl wire flooring was corroded away in areas or is
broken. This sagging flooring could allow for a large enough gap, where the dogs can be injured from getting a leg
or foot stuck. The flooring could give way allowing the dogs to get injured or escape by falling through.
* The hog flooring for the end enclosure on the east side of the Whelping Building, housing one adult dog, has
became unsecured to the side of the building. There is a 23/4 inch gap as a result of the flooring break away from
the building. This could allow the dog to be injured from getting a leg or foot stuck in the gap.
For the prevention of injury and to contain the animals securely, all enclosures must be kept in good repair and must
be structurally sound.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Three enclosures housing a total of three adult dogs, located on the east side of the Whelping Building, had 2 X 4
wood boards on the back wall used to support the metal panel dividers. These wood boards were excessively
chewed and scratched along the bottoms and edges exposing bare wood. These excessively chewed and
scratched wood surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized, thus harboring and increasing the disease
potential.
For required cleaning and sanitization of surfaces in the prevention of diseases, all surfaces must be maintained on
a regular basis. To be corrected by, 10-September-2017.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There was an accumulation of fecal waste stuck in the gap caused from the flooring breaking away from the
building for the end enclosure of the Whelping Building. This indicates daily spot-cleaning and required sanitization
is not taking place and can increase the disease hazards to the one adult dog housed in the enclosure.
All enclosures must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized often enough for the prevention of disease hazards.

3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* One enclosure, housing three adult dogs, has wire tie fastens for the panel divider. One enclosure, housing one
adult dog, has a wire tie used to secure the water bucket. These wire ties have sharp points protruding into the
enclosure approximately 1/2 to 11/2 inches. The sharp points are at head and eye level of the dogs housed in them.
An enclosure has screws exposed from the flooring breaking away from the side of the building. These screws,
approximately 2 inches long, are at head level of the one adult dog housed in the enclosure. All these sharp
protruding points could injure the animals.
All enclosures must be free of sharp protruding points that could injure the animals.
To be corrected by, 2-September-2017.
3.8(c)(3)(ii)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
* An enclosure housing one Bulldog measure total space of 864 square inches (36 inches, length X 24 inches, width
= 864 inches). The dog measure 100 percent space of 1,156 inches (28 inches + 6 X 28 inches = 6 = 1,156
inches). This dog is housed by its self, therefore twice the space is need or 2,312 square inches (1,156 inches X 2
= 2,312 inches).
2,312 square inches for the dog is greater than 864 square inches for the enclosure.For the dog’s health and well-being an additional 1,448 square inches is needed. All single housed dogs must have
twice the exercise space as required.
