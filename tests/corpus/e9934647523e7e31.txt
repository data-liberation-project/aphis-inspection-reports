HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces.
At least one shelter has visible rust. The rust is pitting and flaking along the bottom portion of the shelter. In some
places the metal has completely eroded leaving holes and jagged edges along nearly the entire bottom edge of the
shelter. Rusted surfaces that are pitting and flaking cannot be cleaned or sanitized properly. It can also affect the
structural strength of the shelter. Interior surfaces and any surfaces that come in contact with the dogs must be
repaired or replaced so that it is free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that
affects the structural strength of the surface.

One shelter and some plastic water bowls have chewed and worn surfaces. The edge of the shelter entrance and
the rim of the water bowls have been chewed and the surfaces are rough and jagged. Dirt is embedded in the
chewed and worn areas. Chewed and worn surfaces cannot be easily sanitized which can to lead to disease
hazards for the dogs. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities--including
houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility--that cannot be readily cleaned and

Housekeeping for premises.
There is overgrown vegetation along the fenceline of the outdoor primary enclosures. Vegetation is in direct contact
with the majority of the enclosures. Overgrown vegetation can harbor pests and can lead to disease hazards for the
animals. Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept
clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to facilitate the husbandry practices required in this
subpart, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin. Premises
must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste products, and discarded matter. Weeds, grasses, and
bushes must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control, and to protect the health and
well-being of the animals.

Pest control.
An excessive number of flies are on and around a pile of wet feed that was spilled on the ground. The spilled feed is
located next to a food receptacle in an enclosure affecting at least two dogs. An excessive number of pests can lead

must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce
contamination by pests in animal areas.
