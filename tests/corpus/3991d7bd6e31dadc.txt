CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Several areas of the indoor enclosure for the two squirrel monkeys are not being sanitized often enough as
evidenced by the thick black grime on the 1 X 2 inch wire at the back of the cage and the black scent marking grime
on the 2 X 1 inch wooden frames between the two rooms. The 4 inch wide window spaces between the hardwire
cloth screen also has a layer of dust and debris.
The outdoor enclosure for the two white faced capuchins has several structures with green algae on them, including
the hanging white bucket, two white play pipes, and the siding of their indoor shelter building. The play house for
the two cynomologus macaques has green algae on several sides of it.
All of these structures need to be cleaned more often and sanitized to prevent organic buildup and prevent disease
hazards. To be corrected by 6-8-16.

SEPARATION.
On 5-21-16, the 12 year old female tiger suffered a 2 inch skin deep laceration over her left shoulder blade, believed
to have occurred during a breeding attempt. Although the male and female tiger have lived together for at least 11
years and bred in the past, possibly the female is not accepting the male now. Measures need to be taken to
protect the female from excessive male roughness and from injuries. The caretakers did separate the cats after the
injury, called the veterinarian, and started treatment. To be corrected from this day forward.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
