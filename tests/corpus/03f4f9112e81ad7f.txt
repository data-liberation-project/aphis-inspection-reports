FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During this inspection it was noted that the rabbit enclosure was in need of attention. The facility has recently
removed a portion of the substrate and added a layer of small wire mesh. The mesh was then recovered with more
substrate. However, the areas around the large rocks have protruding pieces of the wire mesh.
To ensure that the animals are not injured on this mesh it will need to be trimmed away.

1. During this inspection it was noted the gate between the donkey and fallow deer pen was in need of attention.
The small wire mesh on the metal gate has begun to detach in several areas. There are broken welds present. To
ensure that the animals are not injured on this gate, it will need to be addressed.

2. There are also green sheets of material that need to be removed from the bison / zebu / Texas long horn and
Jacob sheep / llama enclosures. These curtains were used during the winter months as wind breaks. However, they
have since detached from the shelters and are on the ground by the entrance to the shelters. To ensure that the
animals are not injured on this material, it will need to be removed.
