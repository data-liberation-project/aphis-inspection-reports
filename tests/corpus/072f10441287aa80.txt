2.40(b)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Last spring, on 18 March 2021 Ice Lady was observed to be having discharge from her vulva per the licensee, as noted in
communication in the veterinary records. Attending Veterinarian approved starting Cephalexin initially, then tried Baytril
on 29 March as she was still losing weight and recommended spay, appointment was made and canceled twice by
licensee in April 2021. Attending Veterinarian recommended transport to UC Davis if she was sick and local treatment
was unavailable, and licensee had no way of transporting her.

Licensee called another veterinarian to come out to the facility on 12 May 2021, notes indicated 4 week history of “clinical
signs of pyuria, vomiting and HL ataxia”, vet had potential diagnosis of “r/o UTI, pyelonephritis, hip dysplasia pyometra,
other.” During the visit, the second veterinarian was prepared to give a long lasting antibiotic, but he could not administer
the injection, discussed “further diagnostic measures would require chemical restraint; briefly discussed risks involved”

The facility does not have access to appropriate facilities and equipment in order to give the tigers an injection. Both the
attending veterinarian and the veterinarian who has been out to the facility in the last year have noted in their records: AV
18 March 2021 “recommend spay and would need inclosure to jab stick sedation and he would have to transport to


hospital for surgery”; 2nd veterinarian 12 May 2021 “unsafe to administer SC abx; no appropriate handling facilities.”

During inspection, Ice Lady was noted to visually appear thin, with distinct vertebrae visible along the curve of her back.
This observation is consistent with the visual exam on 12 May 2021, when the second veterinarian described Ice Lady
with “pronounced kyphosis @T-L junction; apparent mild to moderate condition loss.” Following visual exam, free catch
urinalysis and culture was normal, and a message was left with the results and asking how Ice Lady was doing in late
May 2021. At the time of inspection, Ice Lady has not been evaluated by either veterinarian since last May due to the lack
of appropriate facilities and equipment to provide adequate veterinary care.

Appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment and services must be available in order to provide adequate veterinary care,
including injections for treatment or sedation for examination and appropriate transport to veterinary facilities. IceLady
should be fully examined by a veterinarian as a follow-up to evaluate why she has not gained back the weight she lost last
year.

2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection, facility representative told the inspector that Snowman, a 13-year-old white tiger had died last
year of cancer. In communication with the Attending Veterinarian, she was unaware that Snowman the white tiger had
died, and her records only indicated that Snowman had received a script for Meloxicam for his hip problems on 10 March
2020, and the licensee was worried about Snowman with the fires on 2 September 2020. There is no history of a cancer
diagnosis in his medical record with the current Attending Veterinarian.



Following inspection, Inspector called the licensee for additional history on Snowman as no records were available at the
time of inspection. According to the licensee over the phone, Snowman had a previous history of vaccinosis that caused
cancer. The licensee also told the inspector that last year when Snowman got sick and wouldn’t eat the AV directed him
to use Cephalexin on Snowman, as she was out of town. Attending Vet discussed weight loss of both Snowman and Ice
Lady with licensee and recommended (sedated) exam and bloodwork as soon as possible for both animals. Licensee
tried to add food and vitamins, but Snowman continued losing weight and died in approximately March/April of 2021.

Daily observation and a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior and wellbeing are conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

Correct from this day forward.
