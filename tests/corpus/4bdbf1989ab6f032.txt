OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Surfaces that come into contact with dogs must be impervious to moisture. The inside wood surface of the walk in
door and a portion of the wall, of a large shelter, that houses one dog needs to be made impervious to moisture.
The wood is dry and porous. Unsealed wood surfaces cannot be cleaned and properly sanitize. The owner must
make these wood surfaces impervious. This can help keep diseases out and help maintain a healthier environment
for this dog to live.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary enclosures must be kept in good repair and have no sharp points. Two of the wire partitions between four
enclosures of the Sheltered facility have broken wires with sharp points. The wire along the bottom of these
partitions is broke in numerous places where the partition wire and the floor wire are secured together. These sharp
wire points can be a hazardous to dogs. The owner must repair or replace these areas of broken wire. This repair
will help in the safety for dogs and also help secure a good solid enclosure structure. Correct by 12-29-2015.
