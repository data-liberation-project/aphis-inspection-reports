FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is an area of perimeter fence, approximately 7' in length, which measures 5'8" in height around a bobcat
enclosure. This perimeter fence has been constructed this way for several years and the ground has settled
causing the perimeter fence to sink. The Licensee expressed interest in re-building this entire area. The enclosure
containing the bobcat is fully enclosed with a top. Perimeter fencing must be high enough to act as a second
containment area for the animal enclosed and must be a minimum of 6'. Licensee must ensure that all areas of
perimeter fencing are at least 6' in height for all bobcat areas or have the fencing and height approved through the
administrator.
