3.6(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
In the shelter building are 3 enclosures with large breed dogs (Great Dane & Golden Retriever). There is a wire panel top
to the enclosure. For 3 dogs, there is less than 6" distance from the top of the dogs' heads to the enclosure top. Dogs
that are not given adequate head space can decrease the dog’s ability to exhibit its normal behavior or postural
movements. The interior height of a primary enclosure must be at least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in
the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position. The licensee is to provide and maintain an enclosure that has at
least 6" height above the head of the enclosed dogs.
