ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of this inspection a written plan for environmental enrichment was not available for review for the single
lemur. All facilities housing primates must develop a written plan that outlines the activities that will be used to
promote the psychological well-being of the resident primates. This plan must be in accordance with currently
accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides and approved by
the attending veterinarian. It is especially important at this facility since there is a singly housed primate.
A written enrichment plan needs to be developed and implemented. Records indicating the plan is being
implemented as written should be kept. Both the written plan and the records of implementation must be available
for review during USDA inspections.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several metal animal houses had excessive rust along the bottom edges. One metal feeding door and one fence
cross pipe were rusted beyond repair. In all cases the rust had compromised the integrity of the metal. Housing
facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain
the animals. In all cases the rust had developed to the point where there were ragged edges that could cause injury
to an animal.
These rusty components must be repaired to reduce the chances of injury to an animal.
