A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process. This pet
shop is now closed. It has come to my attention that this licensee may be conducting regulated activity at a different
location. If so, please notify USDA of your change of business, so that your new site can be inspected and approved
before reguated activity can be conducted.
