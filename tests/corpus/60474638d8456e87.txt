Care in transit.
On May 21, 2021, fourteen Ossabaw pigs were transported in a cargo van to Indianapolis, which is an approximately 55
minute journey. After arrival at approximately 10:30 am, the pigs were required to wait inside the cargo area of the van for
just over an an hour before unloading was possible, due to staffing limitations of the receiving institution. According to
weather records, the temperature in Indianapolis that day ranged between 77 and 79 degrees F from 11am to noon with
humidity at 50%. There were no methods to record temperature and humidity in the animal transport space, however, it is
expected that inside the cargo van loaded with live pigs, it will be hotter than the outside ambient recorded temperature.
After unloading from the van, the pigs were transported in crates to their final destination. A veterinarian examined them
and found some pigs panting and one with an elevated temperature. They were all given access to water, treated with
cutaneous alcohol, and had fans placed blowing air over them. All recovered with no further treatment. Pigs experience
stress and distress in confined, close spaces for extended periods of time. During surface transportation, it shall be the
responsibility of the driver or other employee to visually observe the live animals as frequently as circumstances may
dictate to assure their ambient temperatures are within the prescribed limits.
