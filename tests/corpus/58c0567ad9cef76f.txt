ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A capybara had a lumpy area on the lower left jaw that was raised, hairless, and was reddened. The facility said
they had not previously observed this lump and has not had the veterinarian evaluate it to decide if it needs
treatment. A raised lump could be a sign of various types of possible sicknesses or previous injury to the jaw area.
To prevent any pain, worsening condition, or spreading to other animals; the facility must have the attending
veterinarian diagnose what the raised lump is and ensure that appropriate veterinary treatment is administered to
the capybara.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The enclosure housing the single male baboon is in disrepair. The middle board on the bottom front of the
enclosure has cracked and warped inward (toward the enclosure) from the top and bottom adjoining boards.
Sunlight was observed through the resulting gap. The baboon could potentially get his fingers stuck or injured in
this area. Additionally, the animal could escape if the condition of the board continues to deteriorate.
Repair or replace the affected board.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The chinchilla enclosure had a hole rusted through the metal resting platform. This hole was big enough that a
chinchilla leg could fit through and it had rough edges around the hole that chinchillas could contact. A hole in an
enclosure with rough edges could cause injury to animals. Enclosures for animals must be free from rough and
sharp edges and maintained in a manner to prevent injury.
3.126(b)FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The indoor area where the serval and skunk are housed has feeder rats and mice housed across the aisle. In this
area, there were strong pungent odors coming from the feeder rodent enclosures. The rodent enclosures were
excessively soiled. These strong odors can cause health problems and discomfort for regulated animals in the
area such as the serval and skunk. The facility must ensure adequate fresh air is available for the serval and skunk
by cleaning the feeder rodent enclosures more often while ensuring that adequate fresh air flow is available at all
times.

SANITATION.
There were excessive amounts of flies in the two-toed sloth room/enclosure during the time of inspection. The flies
were located on the walls and on the floor, but were concentrated on and around the fluorescent light. There were
no provisions for fly control during the time of inspection. Flies carry and spread diseases that affect animals.
Assure that provisions for fly control are implemented and maintained inside of the two-toed sloth room/enclosure.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
