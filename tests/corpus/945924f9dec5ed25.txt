ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There is 1 female camel that had difficulty rising and when standing, was weak in the hind limbs. The VMO
observed the camel while lying down and asked the animal manager if anything was wrong with it. The animal
manager responded "that is the camel that had the broken back about 7 years ago. She just needs to be put down".
The VMO asked the animal manager why he thought the animal needs to be "put down". The animal manager
responded "she is old, she lays down most of the time, has problems getting up and down and she just needs to
go".
The VMO asked the animal manager to get the camel up. When attempting to do so, the camel was reluctant to rise
and on the first attempt, stumbled and fell to the ground from a kneeling position. The animal manager attempted
again to get the camel up, and once in a standing position, the camel appeared weak in the hind limbs. She
appeared to shift her weight to her front limbs and move her hind limbs in a "tucked" position beneath her stomach.
Lameness is an indicator of disease and often pain. It can result from numerous causes including both infectious
and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis and treatment can result in
delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal.
***There is 1 female sheep, which had access to the field, that was squinting her right eye. There was no discharge
from the right eye. Squinting can be a sign of eye disease. Depending on the cause, this condition can be both
progressive and painful.
The licensee must have these animals examined by a veterinarian by 5:00 p.m on November 13, 2015 to obtain
accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the issues cited above. The outcome of this consultation
must be provided to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the veterinary diagnosis, all
diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian, any medications prescribed
along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal health record that list when
the medication is administered to the animals.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of eachanimal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and
the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The chain link material in the enclosure housing 9 goats and sheep is turned up and in with several sharp points.
The fencing material was not maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury or to contain the animals.
Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. The affected
structures must be repaired or replaced and all housing facilities should be maintained and kept structurally sound
to protect and contain the animals moving forward.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***In the enclosure housing 9 goats/ibex, there was an excessive accumulation of feces present on the ground. Due
to the accumulation, the animals could not lay in their enclosure without becoming contaminated by the waste
material. Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry
standards, to reduce disease transmission, and to prevent the animals from becoming contaminated or soiled. The
licensee must clean these enclosures and ensure that all enclosures housing animals are cleaned as often as
necessary to promote appropriate husbandry standards.
***The female brown gobex, cited under 2.40(b)(2) DIRECT on inspection report dated Aug-21-2015, for long
hooves and lameness, has received appropriate care. The VMO observed this animal on today's inspection and had
no concerns regarding its care.
Inspection was conducted with the animal manager. Exit briefing was conducted on-site with facility owner.
