REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.
On June 19, 2014 and July 28, 2014 Air Transport International transported non-human primates from China to
IAH. The transport of these animals by air cargo requires a valid USDA registration. Air Transport International did
not have a current registration at the time of the documented transports.
Any airline, engaged in the business of transporting animals for hire, must register with the USDA as a carrier. A
valid registration helps to ensure compliance with the standards and regulations for transportation in commerce as
required by the Animal Welfare Act. A valid registration must be obtained prior to any transport of regulated animals.

3.87(a)(2) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT NONHUMAN PRIMATES.
A non-human primate, identified by the number 897 written on the enclosure, was transported from China to IAH via
air cargo on July 27/28 2014. Upon arrival to IAH immediately after offloading it was noted that this animal had
several small lacerations on the face. The animal had dislodged part of a metal strip inside the primary enclosure
intended to cover sharp edges of metal mesh used for ventilation. Dried blood was identified on the mesh. A
crumpled piece of metal with sharp points and edges was noted in the enclosure attached to the mesh.
Primary enclosures used to transport non-human primates must be constructed so that the interior of the enclosure
has no sharp points, edges or protrusions that could injure the animal contained within. A carrier must not accept a
non-human primate for transport in commerce unless the enclosure meets this requirement. All future transport of
non-human primates must be done in primary enclosures constructed to safely contain the animals.

3.89(a)FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
Non-human primates transported by air cargo from China to IAH with a stop in Alaska on July 27/28, 2014 were
accompanied by a food and water certification that indicated at least 32 hours elapsed between feeding and
watering of the animals. Every non-human primate 1 year of age or older must be offered food at least once every
24 hours and potable water every 12 hours. These time periods apply to carriers starting from the date and time
stated on the food and water certification provided prior to travel.
Provisions for food and water during transit as required under the Animal Welfare Act are designed to prevent
nutritional deficiency, dehydration, hunger, thirst and animal discomfort. Compliance with the food and water
requirements helps to ensure that compromise to the health, well-being and comfort of the animals is minimized
during transport.
