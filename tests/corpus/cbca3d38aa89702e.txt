2.40(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three elk were found dead by facility staff on 09-30-17. The animals were necropsied and the cause of death was
inconclusive. The facility maintains a daily observation log to account for all of the animals. The staff noted that
"zero" elk were observed between 9-5-17 and 9-30-17. This was confirmed by the Director of Resource
Management. The lack of daily observation of the animals doesn't allow facility staff to assess their health and
well-being.
Assure all animals are observed daily to assess their health and well-being. Assure any problems of health,
behavior, or well-being are reported to the veterinarian.
Correct by: The facility has implemented multiple corrective actions in an effort to prevent future incidents.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Director of Resource Management.
