ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Written Program of Veterinary Care
The licensee has an attending veterinarian and a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). However,
the written PVC is incomplete and inaccurate. Programs of Veterinary Care Plans that are
inaccurate or incomplete make it difficult to ensure that proper veterinary care is being provided.
The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian and develop a complete and accurate
written program of veterinary care that reflects the practices at this facility as well as all
covered species at the facility. The written program of veterinary care will ensure that there is
accurate communication between the licensee and the attending veterinarian, and ensure that all
routine care and preventive care measures are done with the direction and knowledge of the
attending veterinarian.
