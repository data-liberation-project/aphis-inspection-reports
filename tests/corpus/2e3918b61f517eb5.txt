2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There were 17 puppies being housed within enclosures in the whelping room with no visible method of identification
present on the puppies nor on the enclosures.
Without a visible means of identification at the puppy or enclosure level, incorrect identification of animals may
occur. The ability to accurately identify animals is particularly important when having to identify animals for
treatment or medication purposes.
Live puppies or kittens less than 16 weeks of age shall be identified by an official tag, legible tattoo or plastic
identification collar or other suitable means as identified under 2.51.

3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Multiple areas with accumulating items and clutter were observed inside house where dogs are allowed to roam.
There were 17 dogs present in the house (outside of the whelping room) at the time of inspection.
Accumulation of clutter and supplies not necessary for daily husbandry practices may hinder the ability to
adequately clean and sanitize dog contact areas. Clutter may also predispose to vermin and pest infestation.
Animal areas inside housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter, including equipment. furniture, and
stored materials.

3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During inspection there were several missing pieces of linoleum tile and visible gaps in flooring observed in thekitchen and south entry areas. In one gap area, fresh urine was observed running under a recently replaced tile.
There were also visible accumulations of grime and debris in some of the areas where tile gaps were present. At the
time of inspection there were 17 dogs present within the kitchen and living area.
Missing floor tile pieces and exposed gaps between tiles may allow moisture, urine and excreta to build up between
or underneath floor tiles. This makes it difficult to adequately clean and sanitize floors in those areas in which dogs
are being kept.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized, must be
replaced when worn or soiled.
Non-compliance under 3.1 (c)(2) was previously cited on 21AUGUST2019.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Inside the house there are multiple areas with accumulation of grime and debris between floor tiles and under areas
where items are being stored between the kitchen and south entry room area. There were 17 dogs freely roaming in
the house at the time of inspection. There was also a strong odor of urine present during inspection.
A buildup of grime and debris on and between surfaces makes it more difficult to adequately clean and sanitize the
affected surfaces. Strong odors may also be an indication of inadequate cleaning and sanitation. Primary
enclosures and enclosure furnishings used for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of
the methods prescribed in paragraph (b) (3) of this section, and more often if necessary to prevent accumulation of
dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
Non-compliance under 3.11 (b)(2) was previously identified on the previous inspection and report dated
08MAY2018 and 22APRIL2019.
