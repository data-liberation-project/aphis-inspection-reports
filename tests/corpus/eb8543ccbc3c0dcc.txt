FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence enclosing the pig pasture is not sufficient to adequately contain the pigs. The fence is composed of 4x4
welded wire panels attached to T posts and other metal post. Per the licensee the pigs like to lie next to the fence
which causes the panels and the posts to bend outward. This could cause the fence to fall down and allow the pigs
to escape. A fence adequate for pigs needs to be built.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The pig areas next to the barn are a muddy mess. Although pigs like to wallow in mud they must be able to get out
of the mud if they choose. Consistent exposure to mud can cause feet problems and overall poor health. Some
type of drainage or other method for preventing this area from becoming so muddy needs to be implemented. Full
time on a concrete floor is not an acceptable option.

SANITATION.
The large pig area next to the barn has old fencing and other clutter lying around or stuck in the mud. Facilities
need to be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and disease. The old fence could cause
injury from exposed wire or sharp edges. The other clutter lying around could cause injury from sharp edges or
could be eaten causing health issues. This area needs to have all the junk removed.
