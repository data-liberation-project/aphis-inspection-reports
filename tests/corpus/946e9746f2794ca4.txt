2.1(b)(2)(i) Repeat

Requirements and application
The licensee is authorized to posses up to 600 animals for regulated purposes under his current license. During the
inspection of both sites, 605 were observed, counted, and/or listed on the inventories between the two active sites.
Accurate numbers of animals and species must be documented and accurately reflect the license held in order to ensure
that the facility and personnel possess adequate facilities, employees and education to provide sufficient husbandry to the
regulated animals. Cease regulated activities and reapply for a license that properly reflects the number of regulated
animals under the license or reduce the number of regulated animals to a number which is under the maximum threshold
authorized under the current license.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with site employee.
