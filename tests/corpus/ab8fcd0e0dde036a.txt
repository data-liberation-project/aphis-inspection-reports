ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:27 am on
25-APR-19.
Upon arrival I knocked on front door and rang doorbell. I walked to edge of porch to view kennel. Not seeing or
hearing anyone, I went back to my car and honked several times. I called multiple times to both numbers provided
and left messages. I worked on my computer in my car until 1:20, left a note on the front door and drove away at
1:22 pm.
