ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The approved method of euthanasia is carbon dioxide. A pressure regulator is present at the tank however, there is
no flow meter used to deliver the carbon dioxide euthanasia. Sudden exposure to high carbon dioxide
concentrations may be distressful to the animals. AVMA guidelines for carbon dioxide euthanasia require the use of
a regulator and a flow meter to ensure humane euthanasia. The attending veterinarian must be consulted
concerning the proper addition of a flow meter to the equipment used to deliver carbon dioxide euthanasia.
