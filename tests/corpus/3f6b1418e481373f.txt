2.40(b)(3) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection, in the guinea pig breeding room, there was an adult male guinea pig found with an open wound
that extended from the right-side upper arm to the middle of the lower arm. It was approximately 1-1.5 inches in diameter
on the upper arm and between 0.5-1 inches in diameter on the lower arm approximately. There was moderate-severe
swelling around the wound, with a green discharge inside of the wound on the upper arm, along with scab tissue forming
along various parts of it, indicating this wound happened at least several days ago. The guinea pig cried out when it was
picked up and while it was being handled and kept its arm in an upward bent fashion and would not put it down. These
signs indicate the animal was in pain. No one at the facility was aware of the injury prior to the inspection, and daily
observations were completed prior to this inspection. Adequate daily observations, in addition to timely communication
with the attending veterinarian, are essential to quickly identifying diseases and injuries, as well as timely treatment to
eliminate suffering. Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily
observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being. In addition, if daily observations are performed by
someone other than the attending veterinarian, then a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so
that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian.

Classification and separation.
At the time of inspection, in the guinea pig breeding room, there was an adult male guinea pig found with an open wound
that extended from the right-side upper arm to the middle of the lower arm. He was being housed with 2 adult female
guinea pigs, one of which was pregnant. After discussions with one of the facility representatives, it was determined that
the likely cause of the injury was from one of the co-housed females. Animals that are not compatible should not be
housed together as they can cause harm and injury to one another. Animals housed in the same primary enclosure shall
be maintained in compatible groups.
