Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
On March 3, 2022 at 10:00 am, the licensee refused to allow the APHIS inspector to complete an animal welfare
inspection. The licensee stated that he was too busy with his job (located on same property as the licensed facility) to
leave and complete an inspection. He said he didn't care about guinea pigs right now and was working on selling the rest
of his herd and canceling his license. When asked if he was refusing inspection, he stated it was not going to work right
now.
Failure to allow for unannounced animal welfare inspections makes it impossible for APHIS to determine if the facility is in
compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and its regulations.
Correct this by allowing APHIS officials access to the facility for all future unannounced inspections.
