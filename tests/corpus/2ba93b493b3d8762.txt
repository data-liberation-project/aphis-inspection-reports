FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal support bars under the outdoor wire cages for two banks of 27 rabbits are excessively rusting and
actually missing parts of the bars. These bars are no longer structurally sound nor can they be sanitized and need
to be replaced. To be corrected by 8-19-16.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
A new species was added since the last inspection. Groundhogs are now being housed here in metal bar cages.
One groundhog was in a different cage which was more like a tunnel, but only provided 13 inches of vertical height.
These are large full grown groundhogs and a normal postural adjustment is to stand up on rear legs. Enclosures
need to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with
adequate freedom of movement. During this inspection additional space was added to double the size of this
enclosure, thus correcting this deficiency.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
