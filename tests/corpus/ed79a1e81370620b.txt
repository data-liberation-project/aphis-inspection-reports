2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Within an indoor enclosure inside the sheltered building, there was an approximately 7 week old male Yorkshire
Terrier (no ID) that was unsteady when walking and was shivering. A heat lamp was present under the solid floor of
his enclosure and the floor temperature registered 80 degrees F with the inspector's Raytek gun. And, although a
blanket was provided in the enclosure, the puppy still appeared to be trembling. The puppy was observed walking
through a raised doorway and appeared to struggle and seemed uncoordinated going in and out of the doorway.
According to the licensee, the puppy was the smallest of the litter when it was born. She had separated the puppy
from its littermates during weaning because it was so much smaller than its littermates and thought it weighed less
than a pound. The licensee saw that the puppy's head was turned back this morning while it was lying down and
thought that the dog may have had a seizure but wasn't sure. The licensee had not contacted a veterinarian about
the puppy's condition. This puppy's condition could be due to infection, metabolic or physical abnormality and/or
another veterinary medical condition which could cause discomfort. The licensee must have this animal examined
by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment
plan is developed and followed.
***In the ready to use medication storage area, there was a bottle of Ivermectin that had a labeled expiration date of
03/14. During the April 23, 2014 inspection there was also a bottle of Ivermectin with a labeled expiration date of
03/14 included on the inspection report. Medications that are expired and given to the animals may not produce the
desired result. The licensee must remove all expired medications from the ready to use portion of the facility and
ensure that expired medications are not used past their labeled expiration date. As part of the facility's program of
veterinary care, the licensee must make certain that all medications are within the expiration date.
The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structure; construction.***A section of wire flooring was detached from a wooden support for an outdoor portion of an enclosure. The
detached flooring left an approximately 12 inches by 1 inch (at its largest) gap in the flooring. This gap appeared
large enough for a foot of one of the dogs inside of the enclosure, which included Chihuahuas, to fit through.
***One enclosure housing an approximately 7 week old Yorkshire Terrier puppy had walls in disrepair. One of the
solid walls inside of the enclosure had an irregular shaped hole in it that was approximately 5 inches by 1 1/2
inches. The edges around the hole appeared jagged. Under the in/out door of the same enclosure there was also
an area where the wall appeared chewed with jagged edges. Some of these jagged edges were at the puppy's
level.
These items of disrepair with gaps and jagged edges increase the risk of injury to the animals. The licensee must
ensure, at all times, that all animal housing facilities are kept in good repair and that they protect the animals from
injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering. To be corrected by: March 16, 2015.
3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces--(1) General requirements. (i)
***Within the outdoor portion of the sheltered facilitiy, there were sections of the solid walls in the enclosures which
were excessively rusted. There were varying degrees of rust observed in all the outdoor portions of the enclosures.
The rust was mainly present around the wooden frames on the wall and around the in/out doors of the enclosures.
Excessive rust can decrease structural strength and can prevent the required cleaning and sanitization which can
increase the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities are kept free of
excess rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization or that affects the structural strength of the surface.
The inspection was conducted with the licensee, Dr. Erika Leisner (VMO) and William Heine (ACI). An exit
interview was conducted on March 10, 2015 with the same individuals.
