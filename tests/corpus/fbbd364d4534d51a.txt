Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at [3:30 pm] on [25-
Aug-22]. I called/texted the phone numbers provided, knocked on the Shop office door, honked my vehicle horn and
waited 30 minutes.
