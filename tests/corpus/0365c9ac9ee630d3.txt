ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:53 pm on
10-JUL-19.
** I arrived at the facility at 3:53 pm and called the owners. I left a message that I was there to conduct an inspection
and left my contact number. The dogs were out and there was no response or returned call. I called at 4:30 pm
stating that I was leaving the premises and that this inspection would be an attempted inspection.
