ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:20pm on
20-Dec-16.
A telephone message was left and the mother of the licensee returned my call. She informed me that they had a
medical emergency and were not at home and it would be quite some time until someone would be back to the
facility.
