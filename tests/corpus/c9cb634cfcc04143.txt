Facilities, general.
***In an enclosure containing two camels, one zebra, one zedonk, one alpaca and one llama, there is a wire fence panel
with a large hole torn in it, measuring ~10”X20”; the cut ends of the wire protrude into the enclosure.
***In the enclosure housing one male, African crested porcupine named “Quilber,” there is a panel of widely spaced wire
immediately in front of the entrance to the shelter, under which the animal has dug out the ground beneath it. (Corrected
at time of inspection.) There is a space of ~6-10” under the panel, and the porcupine’s feet were noted to pass through
the wire as it went in and out of the shelter; the porcupine had no space to go around the wire and avoid it in order to
enter and exit the shelter. The shelter itself has a rusted-through area at the left bottom of the entrance with sharp edges
forming.
Broken fencing, sharp metal and loose/unsupported panels are a hazard since animals can come into contact with them,
resulting in injury or entrapment. All enclosures must be constructed and maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from illness or injury.

Sanitation.
In an enclosure housing two camels, one zebra, one zedonk and one llama there is a discarded fence panel and a length
of bent pipe that are no longer in use and laying on the ground.

These objects present a potential hazard, since the animals can come into contact with it and it can cause injury or
entrapment. Premises shall be kept clean and free of debris in order to protect the animals from injury.
