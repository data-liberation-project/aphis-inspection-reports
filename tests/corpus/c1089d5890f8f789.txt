OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Wind break and rain break at the entrance
There were 2 plastic shelters, housing a total of 2 adult short-coated dogs, that did not have a wind break or rain
break. Wind breaks and rain breaks provide additional protection for the dogs from inclement weather. Dogs that
cannot remain warm and dry can become ill, stressed, and uncomfortable. The owner must provide wind breaks
and rain breaks for all outdoor shelters at all times.
3.4(b)(4) DIRECT REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the outdoor facility were 7 shelters that did not have bedding or had very little bedding. The temperature at the
time of the inspection was 29 degrees F and the previous nights' temperatures have been in the teens. One Boston
Terrier was observed to be shivering. Lack of sufficient bedding in cold environments increases the risks of sickness
and hypothermia situations. Clean, dry bedding material is important to provide added protection from the effects of
temperatures less than 50 degrees F. More bedding material is necessary when the temperature is less than 35F
degrees for the dogs to burrow into and remain clean and dry and have better protection from the cold. The owner
must provide more bedding for the dogs and maintain it at sufficient levels any time the temperature is less than 50F
degrees and additional bedding must be added when the temperature is less than 35F degrees.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted by the inspectors with a facility representative. Further
discussion was done when the report was delivered.Additional Inspectors
