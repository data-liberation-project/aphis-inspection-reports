PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The kennel facility consists of two sheltered buildings and one occupied outdoor housing area. In the second
smaller sheltered building there is one enclosure which contained one adult and six puppies. During the inspection
the puppies were observed with their feet falling through the raised wire enclosure flooring material. Primary
enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound. The primary
enclosures must be kept in good repair. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have
floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury. If the flooring is of mesh or
slatted construction, it does not allow the dogs feet to pass through in order to protect them from injury.
