Using expired drugs is not an appropriate method to prevent or treat injury or illness. The efficacy of these products
beyond their expiration date is uncertain. Use of these drugs could lead to failure to prevent or treat illness causing animal
harm and suffering.

3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care does not address the sampling of dogs for heartworm, coccidia or giardia. A preventative
dewormer treatment is listed for intestinal parasites but does not address a schedule to sample for giardia and coccidia.
Sampling for parasites is important to know with certainty that the preventative program is adequate to prevent infestation.

The applicant must add a schedule for sampling of these parasites approved by the attending veterinarian to the Program
of Veterinary Care.
