2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Cane Corso, Emit, microchip #709801E, was observed to be holding his left front foot off the ground and
trotting with a slight limp. The dog was not safe for the inspector to handle, but when the licensee tried to handle
the affected foot the dog cried out. The licensee thought the dog may have something in his paw.
A female Dogue de Bordeaux, Brie, microchip #00070CFF26, has a large swollen area beneath the hock on her
right hind leg. There are hairless patches across the outside portion of the swollen leg area. The skin in the
hairless areas is slightly reddened. The licensee had noticed the swelling but had not spoken to a veterinarian
about it.
Non-weight bearing and swollen legs can be a sign of pain and discomfort and can indicate underlying health
problems. The above mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and
treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented and available to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the smaller dog building there are at least four enclosures, housing four adult dogs and seven puppies, which
have the sharp ends of wires hanging from the fences and located at the level of the dogs. In the larger dog
building there are at least six enclosures, housing at least seven adult dogs, which have the sharp ends of wires
hanging from the fences and located at the level of the dogs. There is one enclosure, housing one adult dog,
whose fence panel has broken along the flooring resulting in two metal fence prongs protruding into the enclosure.
Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges. The licensee must remove or alterall the sharp points so that they no longer pose an injury risk towards the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all
housing facilities are free of sharp points and safe for the dogs at all times.

3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the building housing the large breeds, the first two enclosures have areas of insulation that are located above the
access door and in reach of the dogs. The insulation is not covered and the insulation in the first enclosure has
been torn out by the dog. The insulation in the second enclosure had a buildup of dark colored dirt and grime on
the bottom of it. The exposed and torn insulation is not impervious to moisture and cannot be adequately cleaned
and sanitized which could increase the disease risk towards the dogs.
Building surfaces in contact with animals must be impervious to moisture and must be maintained on a regular
basis. Any surface area that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The
licensee must cover or alter the insulation so that this surface is impervious to moisture and can be readily cleaned
and sanitized. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in contact with the dogs are impervious to moisture and in
good repair.
