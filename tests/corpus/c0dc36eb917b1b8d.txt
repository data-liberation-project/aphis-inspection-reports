2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facility did not have a written program of veterinary care. The facility has a part-time attending veterinarian. Facilities
that do not have a full time veterinarian on site must have a written program of veterinary care in order to ensure that
there is an understanding about expectations for the care of the animals. Failure to maintain a written program of
veterinary care could result in failure to ensure optimal care for the animals. The facility should create a new written
program of veterinary care in collaboration with their attending veterinarian.
