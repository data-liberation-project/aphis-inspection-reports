Watering.
A juvenile 2-toed sloth had one water bowl in its enclosure which was empty. Upon the request of the inspector, an
employee filled the bowl with water and the sloth immediately went over to the bowl and began to drink. The animal
continued drinking continuously for 5 minutes.
Animals who do not have adequate access to potable water may suffer from discomfort, thirst, dehydration, or
constipation. The enclosure was warm and the ambient humidity was 50%. Lower humidity may cause some sloths to
require more drinking water.
Correct by January 30th, 2021 by providing potable water as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal,
taking into account the age, species, condition, size, and type of animal. Corrected at the time of inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. This inspection report contains only the direct
noncompliant item identified on the inspection.
