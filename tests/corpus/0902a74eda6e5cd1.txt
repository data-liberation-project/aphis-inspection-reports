FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Medical records showed a kinkajou escaped its cage on 2-3-15 and was killed by a lion cub when it went into its
enclosure. The kinkajou had escaped before this by unlocking the door, but that was stopped with locks. It was not
obvious how the kinkajou escaped. All enclosures must securely contain the animals to prevent injuries.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Inadequate cleaning was observed in several animal areas. The adult giraffes barn has a large area of wet dirt and
piles of feces in the corner the giraffe occupies the most. The three adult tigers had multiple piles of old white
chalky feces in the outside enclosure and the two inside dens were covered with old feathers, dirt, dried feces, and
evidence of rodents. An enclosure with 3 alpacas and a pony has a large pile of wet substrate and feces in the
shelter area. A shed in the enclosure with 9 Nubian goats and 3 pot belly pigs has a pile of dusty dirty bedding with
dried up feces mixed in it. The pig and baby pig were lying in this. The Tractor Ride area is occupied by various
hoofstock from sheep to bison. Throughout the feeding areas and all along the driveways, are excessive amounts
of feces. Animal and food wastes need to be removed from primary enclosures on a regular basis to prevent
contamination of the animals and to minimize disease hazards. Several of these enclosures were cleaned during
this inspection.
To be corrected by 5-25-15.
3.131(d)SANITATION.
Old and fresh rat feces was observed in the corner of the feed room, and at least 2 bags of avian food were chewed
into. The feces were observed under a pile of miscellaneous supplies and under the shelves. Rodent holes were
observed in the kangaroo enclosure tunneling under the storage room. The licensee stated some feeder rats had
escaped and attempts are being made to recapture them, but no traps could be observed because of the amount of
items in the feed room. This area needs to be cleaned and organized to reduce rodent harborage areas and to
make cleaning and observation for infestation easier. To be corrected by 5-29-15.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
