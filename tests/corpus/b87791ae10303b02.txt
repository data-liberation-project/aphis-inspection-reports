OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
At time of inspection throughout the outdoor shelter structures the wood surfaces were no longer impervious to
moisture. Surfaces (chewed wood) that are not impervious to moisture cannot be readily cleaned & sanitized. If
animal waste or urine comes in to contact with an untreated surface it could create a disease risk & or health
problems for the dog. The structural strength of an untreated surface is also affected when the untreated surface
becomes soaked with animal waste or urine on a continual basis. Surfaces that are impervious to moisture can be
readily cleaned & sanitized. This affects forty three dogs and five puppies. To be corrected by 08-20-15.
3.6(a)(2)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
At time of inspection the first two enclosures on the east side of the kennel building were leaning to the west. The
legs of the enclosures had slid off the concrete floor and were standing in the drain. All animals must be securely
contained in the enclosure. The cage must be lifted back up onto the concrete floor and remain level and in place.
Two dogs were affected. To be corrected by 07-25-15.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
At time of inspection at least four open sacks of trash were inside the facility. When premises that are housing dogs
are not being kept clean & in good repair it could lead to injury or health issues for the dog. Accumulations of trash,
junk, waste products, weeds & discarded matter around the premise and inside the building can provide a living /
breeding area for rodents, other pests & vermin. Keeping premises free of trash, junk, waste products, weeds &
discarded matter is necessary to ensure the health & well-being of all dogs. To be corrected by 07-21-15.
An exit briefing was conducted by Cathy Niebruegge, ACI and facility representative.
