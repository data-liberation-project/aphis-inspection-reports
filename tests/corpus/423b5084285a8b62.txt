2.40(a)(1) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The written Program of Veterinary Care was not available for review. A written Program of Veterinary Care is required
when the attending veterinarian is employed on a part-time basis, in order to ensure the facility has a program to follow
and all animals have adequate veterinary care. The written Program of Veterinary Care in consultation with the attending
veterinarian must be available for review.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The animal records were not available for review. Accurate and complete records enable the inspection process and
provide traceability of the animals, which can help protect their welfare. The licensee must ensure that the appropriate
animal records are kept and made available to APHIS officials for review.
3.81 Repeat

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
The plan on environmental enhancement for the lemurs was not available for review. All licensees must develop,
document, and follow an appropriate plan for environmental enhancement adequate to promote psychological well-being
of nonhuman primates. The written plan must be available for review.
3.125(a) Repeat



Facilities, general.
Kangaroo-Wallaby enclosure: There were several sections of the primary enclosure wire fencing which were in disrepair.
Broken wire points were present on the fencing which are protruding into the enclosure in numerous areas. A small
section of fencing was bent upward from the bottom creating a large opening with loose surrounding wires and protruding,
broken wire points. At least two trees in the enclosure were wrapped at the base with loose, broken chicken wire with
sharp protruding points. There was an approximate 40ft section of fencing near the northeast corner of the enclosure
which was loose and bent at the top and folded downward. Additionally, near the western side of the enclosure a large
tree has fallen and is resting on the top of the fencing bending it downward with its weight.

Goat Pen: There was a small section of wire fencing which was bent upward from the bottom creating an opening with
loose wire and at least two wire points protruding into the opening.

Sharp, broken wires within the enclosure could result in punctures or laceration wounds to the animals. Open gaps,
spaces, or bent areas of the fencing with loose wires may cause leg entrapment or other injuries. Objects such as large,
fallen trees resting on the fencing poses a potential injury risk to the animals and impacts the structural integrity of the
enclosure.
Maintenance issues must be identified and addressed in a timely manner to keep the facilities structurally sound and in
good repair, protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fencing at this facility has numerous issues including several sections maintained below the required 6ft
height for the species housed. Vegetation is pressing down on top of the perimeter fence in several areas of the facility


causing it to bend and loosen, reducing the height below 6 feet. In addition, there is a portion of the perimeter fence on
both the southern and northern sides of the facility that are inaccessible due to heavy vegetation and cannot be viewed at
this time. Finally, the northwestern corner of the enclosure adjacent to the house does not have a perimeter fence
present. This section extends for approximately 15 feet in length. Outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a
perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. A perimeter fence must be
constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going
through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. A system must be in place to ensure and maintain
a perimeter fence which is at least 6 feet in height.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
