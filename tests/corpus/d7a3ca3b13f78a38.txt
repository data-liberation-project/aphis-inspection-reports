FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The large fenced enclosure attached the the big red barn at the back of the facility that houses llamas, donkeys, and
a dromedary camel has a red metal trailer box to the left of the pen. The front right corner of this metal structure is
rusted and an approximately 6"-8" piece of rusted metal has curled up from the surface and is protruding into the
animal area. The edge of this piece of metal appears sharp, jagged, and rusted. Llamas were licking the trailer box
in close proximity to the protruding metal. The animals in the pen may be injured by this piece of metal. This should
be addressed.

The black livestock trailer was noted to have areas on the wheel wells that were rusty. There was an area on the
bottom of the right wall that had rusted through. This was just behind the right wheel well and was appropriately 4" x
6" long. These areas will need to be repaired to ensure the health, comfort and safety of the animals being
