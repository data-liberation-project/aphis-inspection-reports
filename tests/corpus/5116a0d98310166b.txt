REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
On August 6, 2015 a USDA VMO and ACI went to the dealer's place of business unannounced. The dealer was
present and allowed inspection of the sugar gliders, which were taken out of their enclosures, and also of the
paperwork which was reviewed by USDA. There are greater than 4 breeding female sugar gliders present which is
above the threshold for exemption for a USDA license. Any person operating as a dealer must have a valid license.

Correct by: This must be corrected immediately for the licensing process to begin on this dealer. The dealer has
since requested an application packet from the Regional Office.
This visit was conducted by Tonya Hadjis, VMO and Jan Baltrush, ACI. An exit briefing was conducted at the time
of the visit.
