HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the second group of squirrel monkey's enclosure there was feces on the branch that is propped up on the night
house to the left of the door entering their building. There was also some feces on the side of the night house where
the branch was propped against. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta or disease hazards for the well being of the
animals. Correct by December 19, 2015.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the llama's enclosure there was a long crack in the concrete. That crack had a rectangular 4 in wide sized hole
in the middle that a llama could get their foot caught in when going to the water trough. To protect the animals from
injury within their enclosure this hole needs to be filled and/or repaired. Corrected by the exit interview.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
** In the commissary where the produce is prepared for the animals there was mud across the floor. The traffic from
the employees retrieving their produce probably contributed to the excessive mud. There was no place to dry your
feet and they had not mopped to minimize the mud. This area should be kept clean to keep the environment
sanitary for the preparation of food for the animals. Correct by December 19, 2015
