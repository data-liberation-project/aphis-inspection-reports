2.40(b)(1) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a longhorn steer named, “Geronimo,” with overgrown hooves. The animal often drags the tips of the hooves on
the ground as it walks, and a slight stumble is seen intermittently. There are prominent depressions around the tailhead,
and the backbone and vertebrae are visible; some muscle depletion is noted through the hindquarters. The facility
representative stated that the veterinarian requested that the facility provide a chute onsite so that work on the longhorn
cattle could be facilitated without the need for anesthesia.
At the time of this focused inspection, the animal was still present and in the same physical condition as noted at the last
inspection. There was no chute available for managing veterinary examination or care. Failure to provide the necessary
restraint equipment or have the animal evaluated and the hooves trimmed by a veterinarian as stated at the last
inspection delayed the delivery of the care and can contribute to worsening health and wellbeing of the animal.
The licensee must make available any appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services to facilitate proper
veterinary care and hoof trimming. The animal must be evaluated, and the hooves trimmed as deemed appropriate by
the veterinarian.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with John Wright and Andrea Cole.
