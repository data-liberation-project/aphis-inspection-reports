The white Lamancha goat in the enclosure with the bridges between different fenced areas has an active nasal
discharge of a white thick consistency that is accumulating and creating a dry brownish crust on the upper lip and a
slight wet cough.
The black with white stripes on the face Lamancha goat in the enclosure with the bridges between different fenced
areas had an active nasal discharge of a white think consistency that is accumulating and creating a brownish dry
crust on the upper lip.
The male reddish brown Nubian goat in the enclosure with the bridges between different fenced areas has an active
nasal discharge of a white think consistency that is accumulating and creating a brown dry crust on the upper lip.
The adult female white and cream goat in the main goat enclosure had an active nasal discharge of a greenish think
consistency that has crusted on the upper lip and nostrils to a point that the restricted breaths were audible.
The licensee had a log book showing that the vet visited on 8/24/15 for respiratory problems in the goats. On
9/8/15 it showed that the vet had visited, and (cid:28)CoRid(cid:29) and tetracycline were prescribed. The licensee stated that the
tetracycline is still in use. The licensee stated that the vet came to re-evaluate the animals in early October, but no
records were available to document the outcome of the visit.
The goats appear not to be responding to the medications. When animals do not respond to the prescribed
treatment, they should be re-evaluated to ensure the treatment is still appropriate for the ongoing medical problems.
The licensee must have the four goats re-evaluated by a licensed veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plan. The licensee must make documentation available upon request. The licensee must
ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: OCTOBER 16, 2016The inspection was at the Gretna, NE location known as Vala(cid:25)'s Pumpkin Patch.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee.
