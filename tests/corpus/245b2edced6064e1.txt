date. A bottle of "Ivermectin" with an illegible expiration date was also included on the inspection report for the May
11, 2015 inspection. The licensee must ensure that all medications for use in dogs are appropriately labeled with
legible expiration dates so that medications are not used past their labeled expiration date. Medications that are
expired and given to the animals may not produce the desired result. The licensee must ensure that all animals
receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

***There were five, 5 week old puppies housed in an outdoor enclosure with several areas of excreta which were
attracting flies and odors. According to the licensee, the enclosure had not been moved nor had the excreta been
picked up since the puppies were first put into the enclosure approximately five days prior to inspection. The
several areas of excreta and the odors and insects that they are attracting increase the risk of disease hazards.
The licensee must ensure that floors made of grass or other similar material are raked or spot-cleaned with
sufficient frequency to prevent or eliminate odors, insects, pests, or vermin.

***There were five, 5 week old puppies housed in an outdoor enclosure. The attending veterinarian has not
approved the practice of housing young dogs in outdoor housing. The potential for stress and discomfort exists if
puppies cannot tolerate outside temperatures for an extended period of time. The housing of sick, infirm, aged or
young dogs in outdoor housing facilities must be specifically approved by the attending veterinarian. The approval
must be specific and list the ages and breeds of dogs that can be housed outdoors as well as indicate the
temperature ranges which they may tolerate. To be corrected by: August 26, 2015.The inspection and exit interview were conducted with Dr. Erika Leisner (VMO), Bill Heine (ACI) and the licensee.
