2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female adult marmoset was noted to be missing hair on its tail. The hairs on the upper 1 ½ inches near the
base of the tail and the hairs on the lower half of the tail appeared short and broken off/barbered. Hairloss can be a
sign of a medical issue or a physiological/stress issue. The facility needs to have a veterinarian evaluate the
marmoset to determine a cause and treatment plan for the hair loss.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female adult marmoset was noted to be missing hair on its tail. The owner stated that she was aware of the
hairloss but had not contacted a veterinarian yet. The facility needs to have a mechanism in place for direct
communication with the veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior
and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian to ensure the health and well-being of all the animals.
Correct from this day forward.
