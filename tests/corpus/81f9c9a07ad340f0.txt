2.31(c)(3) CRITICAL
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An adverse advent causing the death of a bat was reported to the IACUC chair and the attending veterinarian in
July 2015. The event was not reported to the IACUC and therefore was not included in the required 6 month update
to the Institutional Official. The IACUC is responsible for identifying adverse events, determining the severity of the
event, developing a reasonable and specific plan and schedule for correcting the deficiency, and for reporting the
event to the Institutional Official.
The same adverse event occurred again in August 2016. This time the event was reported to the IACUC and an
IACUC subcommittee did investigate the issue. If the 2015 adverse event had been handled correctly by the
IACUC the August 2016 event may not have happened.
The IACUC needs to ensure all matters concerning USDA covered species are reviewed during IACUC meetings.

2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC is responsible for conducting continuing reviews of activities concerning animal research. This includes
ensuring that investigators and others involved in conducting and supporting animal research do not deviate from
the written protocol. This facility does not currently have a method for the IACUC to ensure protocols are being
followed. They rely on their PI’s to act as facility managers. They currently have 4 facilities with 4 different PI’s
overseeing compliance on their own research.
This has caused a problem with consist communication in the past. A good example is the 2015 adverse incident
with the bat. Without someone specifically dedicated to IACUC administration and facility oversight things will be
missed. PI’s with multiple responsibilities outside of the IACUC cannot be expected to adequately act as a facility
manager with compliance oversight.Some method for providing consistent oversight for all 4 animal facilities and ensuring protocol compliance needs to
be implemented.
To be corrected by Aug 1, 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
