ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adequate veterinary care.
The white female whitetail deer (with green ear tag #7404 on the right ear) needs to be evaluated by the attending
veterinarian. There is a bare patch on the right hip towards the base of the tail that is approximately 1 inch by 2
inches in size. The skin exposed is a normal pink in color with no visual scabs or injuries. Adjacent to this area of
hair loss are two quarter-sized swollen hairless bumps along the spine that have a lumpy appearance and typical
pink skin color. Facility staff stated that the bare patch was observed about a week ago but the two quarter-sized
raised lumps had not yet been observed. However, there is no written documentation noting observations for this
animal, facility staff have not communicated this health issue to the attending veterinarian and no veterinary care
has been administered.
Failure to treat veterinary issues can lead to the condition worsening or cause pain, other negative health effects or
death of the animal. This deer must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian for diagnoses, treatment and
recommended follow-up based on the attending veterinarian's instructions. Documentation must be maintained by
the licensee on any evaluations, diagnosis and treatment provided and be made available for review by the
inspector upon request. Correct by May 27, 2015.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Daily observation and communication with attending veterinarian.
Findings on this inspection suggest that adequate daily observation for the white female whitetail deer (with green
ear tag #7404 on the right ear) was not conducted. Additionally, direct communication regarding this health issue to
the attending veterinarian did not occur. There is a bare patch on the right hip towards the base of the tail that is
approximately 1 inch by 2 inches in size. Adjacent to this area of hair loss are two quarter-sized swollen hairless
bumps along the spine that have a lumpy appearance. Facility staff stated that the bare patch was observed about a
week ago but the two quarter-sized raised lumps were identified by the inspector. There is no written documentationnoting observations for this animal and the condition has reportedly changed since the initial observation of the
health issue by facility staff suggesting that daily observation, which would include assessing the health of the
animals, is not adequate. Also noted above, facility staff have not communicated this health issue to the attending
veterinarian and therefore no veterinary care has been administered.
Lack of close daily observation of animals can lead to health issues not being identified and promptly communicated
to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate veterinary care can be provided in a timely manner. This can lead
to the condition worsening or cause pain, other negative effects or death of the animal. The licensee must develop
and maintain a system of daily observation so that health issues can be identified, that frequent and direct
communication of health issues to the attending veterinarian occurs and ensure that it is corrected in a timely
manner to provide for the health and wellbeing of the animals. Correct by May 27, 2015.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Access to records.
The facility's written Program of Veterinary Care was not available for review. This does not allow the inspector to
determine if the plan is current, reflects the care being provided to the animals and is appropriate for the species of
animals. The written Program of Veterinary Care must be made available for review upon further requests during
inspection. Correct by June 1, 2015.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the Park Superintendent.
