HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
** The primary enclosures(cid:25) for the muntjac, llamas, pigs, goats and sheep did not have a public attendant. On the
first day of the inspection, when the facility did not have any public visitors at the park, the Executive Director stated
that they would have an attendant accompany the public groups when they entered the park. That was not
displayed on the second day of the inspection. While discussing the exit briefing there were two public groups
present at different ends of the petting zoo area feeding animals without any public attendant. All petting zoo areas
should have monitoring by a public attendant that is responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable at all times
during public contact to ensure the safety of the animals and public. Correct by October 11, 2014

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The ceiling of the larger night house for the 4 Patas monkeys has water damage. The water damage and rotting
wood is affecting the structural strength of the ceiling and the building is not being maintained in good repair. The
damaged ceiling maybe allowing rain water into the enclosures which may be wetting the animals. The constant
moist conditions have allowed mildew and mold growth which can be hazardous to the animals health and
well-being. Also the male Patas monkey is having some kind of moisture issues. It is damp and moist and there is
still some areas of wood above the entrance that are exhibiting signs of moisture. There is a slight smell of mildew
and there are insects that favor moist and damp conditions present in the night house. There may still be some
underlying source of water leakage present in the night house that needs to be addressed to alleviate the moisture
and dampness. The male Patas monkeys night house does have some patch work but there may be another issue
contributing to the moisture issue. The ceiling must be repaired or replaced, and maintained to ensure that the
building is structurally sound and kept in good repair.
3.75(d) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** There was no light in the largest night house for the 4 Patas monkeys. Not having a light in this night house
made it difficult to access the conditions. If not for the flash on the camera the damage of the ceiling would have
gone unnoticed. The night house can't be inspected adequately to determine compliance (or non compliance) withthe applicable husbandry requirements, as well as to assess the condition of the deteriorated/moldy wood that is
currently present. Housing facilities shall have adequate lighting for carrying out the husbandry requirements in
accordance with the regulations as well as assessing the condition of the building materials.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
** In the ring-tailed lemurs night house that housed 8 lemurs there was an abundance of ants and in the Mona
guenon's night house there was an abundance of roaches. Insects can be a disease hazard and contaminate the
bedding. The facility must establish an effective pest control program to control insects and ectoparasites to
promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the enclosure containing 4 pigs and 5 llamas there were two cow panels leaning against the animals shed
haphazardly placed where the animals could injure themselves passing between the shed and a small holding pen
adjacent to the shed. Also the holding pen has a piece of sheet metal from the roofing on an adjacent shed that
protrudes outward that could possible injure one of the taller llamas if held in this pen. The cow panels were last
used when the animals were being caught to apply insect repellent and had been stored there since. Any materials
that do not serve a purpose for the animals within and that could potentially injure the animals should be removed,
replaced and/or repaired to prevent this from occurring. Corrected immediately.
** On the west side of the pigs and llamas enclosure there are two holes big enough for a small mammal to gain
access. Since there are perimeter fence deficiencies in these areas there is a high potential of an animal to gain
entry to the primary enclosure. One hole could possibly allow one of the pigs to escape. These holes should be
constructed of such strength and maintained to properly contain the pigs. Corrected by the exit interview.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** In the goat, sheep and llama's primary enclosure there is a shelter that has two sides and does not adequately
keep the animals from being affected in windy and rainy conditions. The artificial shelter provided must be
appropriate for the local climatic conditions for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent
discomfort to such animals. Correct by October 14, 2015.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. ** The entire perimeter fence has deficiencies on each side that could potentially allow unwanted animals access to
the park or allow animals to escape if their primary enclosures are breached. On the west side of the perimeter
fence, near one of their deficiencies close to the west side of the pigs primary enclosure, there are holes in the
fence big enough for a medium sized dog to get it. With the current deficiencies on the pig(cid:25)s primary enclosure this
could allow the animals to escape. On the north side of the perimeter fence there are many breaches in the fence.
These areas of deficiencies are extensive and the entire perimeter fence should be thoroughly checked and
repaired.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
** In the muntjac's kennel there was an abundance of roaches living in its pine straw bedding. There are many
things that can be done to minimize pests infestation such as increasing the frequency of cleaning and changing out
bedding in the animals enclosure, modifying the pest control program (consulting attending veterinarian before
introducing any chemical treatments and/or using a different bedding that does not provide favorable living
conditions for the pests. Whichever methods are considered and implemented there shall be a safe and effective
program established and maintained for the control of insects and ectoparasites. Correct by October 14, 2015
The inspection was conducted with the Executive Director and the Conservation Program Coordinator. The exit
interview was conducted with the Conservation Program Coordinator.
