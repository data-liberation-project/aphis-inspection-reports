ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 900am on
12-Mar-19.
The facility is empty and has a For Lease sign on the door. The inspector called the licensee with no answer and
the licensee never returned the phone call. There is proof that he is conducting regulated activity in Florida and it
appears as though, he no longer lives in Oklahoma and his Oklahoma license may need to be cancelled.
