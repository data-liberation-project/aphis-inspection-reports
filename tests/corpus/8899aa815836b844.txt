3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
On August 6, 2021, facility staff discovered evidence that six chipmunks had been predated by a raccoon that entered
their enclosure. Following the incident, facility staff added additional wire mesh to cover any potential entrances.
Approximately two weeks later, the raccoon was trapped by facility staff and relocated. There have been no further cases
of predation.
Failure to provide an enclosure that protects the animals from predation can lead to injury or death of the animals. The
outdoor housing facilities for the chipmunks must be structurally sound and constructed in a way that protects the animals
within from injury. A corrective plan with a reasonable timeline for completion must be developed and initiated.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
