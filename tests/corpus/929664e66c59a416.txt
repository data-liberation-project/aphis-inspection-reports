ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 a.m. on
06/24/2015.
Arrived at the facility around 11:00 a.m. and knocked on the door several times, no one came to the door. I went
back to the vehicle and waited half an hour before leaving.
