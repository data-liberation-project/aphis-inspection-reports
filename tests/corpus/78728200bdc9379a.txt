3.9(b)
FEEDING.
The two dog-wolf hybrids are being fed directly on the dirt floor in their enclosure. Feed not placed in a food
receptacle may become contaminated and that surface is not capable of being adequately cleaned and sanitized.
Food for dogs must be placed in food receptacles that protect the food from contamination of feces and pests and
are easily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 8 March 2018.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Plastic sheeting (possible garbage bag) has blown up against the enclosure housing two dog-wolf hybrids. There
are areas of this plastic that appear to be pulled into the enclosure through the chain link (as if being pulled in by the
animals). If plastic is ingested, it can cause illness or digestive upset. The licensee must ensure that the premises
where housing facilities are located be kept clean to protect the animals from injury. Premises must be kept free of
accumulated trash, junk, waste products, and discarded material. To be corrected by 8 March 2018.
3.83
WATERING.
The water receptacle in the enclosure housing 4 capuchins held clear water however, the interior surface of the
water receptacle was constructed of a rough, deeply pitted concrete material. This rough surface cannot be
adequately cleaned and sanitized. Failure to clean and sanitize water receptacles can result in disease transmission
and possibly discourage the animals from drinking. The licensee must ensure that all water receptacles be kept
clean and sanitized in accordance with the methods provided in 3.84 b 3 of this subpart. To be corrected by 7 April

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-The raccoon enclosure has multiple areas of sharp metal points protruding into the enclosure. This is mainly seen
at the top of the enclosure within reach of one of the climbing platforms and includes the hail screen and chickenwire with sharp points. Sharp points can cause injury.
-There is an area of deteriorated metal on the climbing tube into the underground portion of the raccoon enclosure.
This deteriorated metal is resulting in a jagged edge which can cause injury.
-There is expanded metal flooring in the underground portion of the badger enclosure. There are areas of this floor
where the dirt has worn away below resulting in a gap between the metal and the ground that could entrap a limb.
-There are multiple areas of the bison fence that have metal rods protruding into the enclosure. These rods are
constructed to hold electric fence. The electric fence is not being used and is not strung over most of these rods.
With the electric fence not operational to deter contact with the fence, these rods become a hazard.
These hazards can all cause injury to the animals. The licensee must ensure that the facility be structurally sound
and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by 7 May 2018.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is standing water in the concrete "pool" for the two tigers due to the drain not functioning correctly. This water
has been standing in this pool long enough to become stagnant and very cloudy. Standing water may attract pests,
become odorous and contaminate the animals inside the enclosure. A suitable method must be established to
rapidly eliminate standing water. Correct by 14 March 2018.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
There was an excessive accumulation of feces and food wastes that covered the majority of the longhorn cattle
enclosure. We were told by the facility representative that it has been three weeks since the last time this enclosure
had been cleaned. Also there was excessive feces in the goat/sheep enclosure. We were told that this enclosure is
raked on a daily basis, but not all the feces is removed because it is mixed with the sand substrate. Excessive
feces can contaminate the animals contained within the enclosures as well as create disease hazards. Excreta
must be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and
reduce disease hazards. Correct by 9 March 2018.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There are many bird nests located in the vines covering the tops of three enclosures. Also numerous birds were
observed in and around these vines. There were bird droppings on a bucket located in the mountain lion
enclosures as well as on the floor along one side of the mountain lion enclosure and under the shelter of the
longhorn cattle. One dead bird was also observed in the fox enclosure. Birds and bird droppings can contaminate
food and water sources and can transmit diseases. A method shall be established and maintained in order to
control pests. Correct by 7 April 2018.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
