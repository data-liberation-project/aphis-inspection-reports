2.31(d)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) members have been participating in approval of activities
in which that member has a conflicting interest such as being personally involved in the activity. During the February
12, 2013 IACUC meeting, 2 proposals (Teaching Protocol and Guidelines for use of animals), were signed as
approved by 4 IACUC members who are also instructors responsible for the animal care and use during the
teaching activities. This conflict of interest circumvents the checks and balances normally ensured by the IACUC
review and approval process. The teaching facility shall ensure that the activity review and approval process is
operated so that there are no conflicts of interest such as an IACUC member reviewing and approving an activity
which they conduct and in which they are personally involved.
To be corrected from this date forward.
Inspection and exit interview was conducted on-site with program director.
