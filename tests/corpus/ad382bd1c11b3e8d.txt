2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
During a review of IACUC records and facility paperwork, an incident was found involving the death of a goat
unintentionally involved in the facility’s Goat and Sheep Freunds 2020 Protocol. On April 3, 2019, a donor goat,
#4630, was inadvertently bled under the facility’s core protocol involving anti-body production in goats and sheep.
The technician handling the goat, verified the tag number of the goat after removing approximately 900ml of blood
and immediately stopped the procedure when she realized it was the incorrect animal. The technician immediately
reported the incident to the facility manager. As a goat not intended for the project, the animal did not receive the
initial physical exam, bloodwork, and additional testing to ensure that it met the specified health standards written in
the protocol and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The animal also was not given the opportunity to go
through the facility’s typical acclimation phase in which smaller volumes of blood are drawn over time before
collecting the maximum blood volume. Before the bleeding occurred, the animal did not exhibit any signs of illness.
That afternoon, the animal was found to have profuse diarrhea and was treated as directed by the attending
veterinarian. Later that evening, the animal was observed in distress by a staff member and was humanely
euthanized.
The facility has well documented protocols and SOPs regarding blood collection procedures. The individual
conducting the procedure was trained and found to be proficient to perform this task by the facility prior to this event
occurring. The internal IACUC investigation following this incident concluded that it occurred due to human error
(failing to check the animal’s identification correctly as required by the SOP).
The research protocol and SOP included several appropriate methods to ensure that handling of animals used
under the protocol are handled in a careful manner that minimizes stress and physical harm (including pre-use
physical examination, bloodwork, and fecal examination). As a result of the human error in checking identification,
none of these methods were used for this animal. Large volume blood collections without adequate pre-collection
testing may result in the worsening of underlying illness not obvious at the time of collection making subsequent
treatment more difficult. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a
manner that does not cause trauma, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. The unintentional bleeding of the
donor goat, resulted in unnecessary physical harm and likely contributed to the death of the animal.
The facility took immediate corrective actions to address the incident. Management investigated the issue,
submitted the finding to the IACUC for review, and quickly retrained all of the large animal technicians on the
protocol and SOP procedures. Correct from this day forward by ensuring corrective actions are followed to prevent further occurrence of incidents.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
