ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The single housed female Bull Terrier has not been provided with adequate veterinary care due to exhibiting
abnormal repetitive (stereotypic) behavior. During this inspection each time I approached the Bull Terrier in his
kennel she began to spin in circles repeatedly in a fast motion for over minute until I stepped away. I observed
some hair loss on the ground and nose irritated where it rubbed against the chain link fencing. During previous
inspections this dog exhibited the same stereotypical behavior but not this excessive. The care takers and licensee
had stated that that this dog was not able to exercise with the other dogs because she would harm them. It was
stated by the care takers that they take this dog outside on a leash once a day.
When asked about this behavior, the licensee stated that he was not aware of the cause. Abnormal repetitive
behaviors, often called stereotypies, can develop in response to many stressors including: lack of space, exercise,
under or over stimulation in their environment such as being housed alone. Because these behaviors often
develop in response to distress, they are important indicators of behavioral ill-health and require veterinary
intervention to properly diagnose the most likely causes and prevent farther deterioration by providing an
appropriate treatment plan to address the stressor as well as the abnormal behavior.
Correct by having this dog evaluated by the attending veterinarian for diagnosis of the cause of this behavior and
development of an appropriate treatment plan to address this issue. Written documentation by the AttendingVeterinarian, recommendations regarding kennel space, exercise, enrichment and any other steps necessary to
address this abnormality. This shall be maintained by the licensee for review by APHIS Officials. Additionally, the
licensee shall maintain documentation of the implementation of these recommendations for review.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female English Bulldog was not given adequate veterinary care when it was injured two weeks ago. This
dog was injured while climbing underneath the chain link fencing located in an outside exercise pen. The center of
the wound is approximately 1/2'' deep and 3’' to 4'' long and an inch wide is located at the left front rib area behind
her shoulder. The open wound appears to be healed, however this dog should still be seen by the attending
veterinarian to ensure if treatment is needed. Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate
veterinary care that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and
injuries.

There are two areas at the outdoor exercise pens that has damaged chain link fencing at the bottom. One pen has

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an excessive amount of excreta in the dog kennels housing the younger adult French Bulldogs. There are
from 5 to 8 occurrences of fecal waste in each enclosure. I observed the dogs stepping in the excreta during the
inspection. There was also a strong odor of excreta and some staining on the sides of the kennels. The care takers
stated that the excreta is removed several times a day, however there needs to be additional cleaning to prevent
soiling of the dogs and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pets and odors. The licensee stated there was a recent
change in the dog food which may be reason why there may be more occurrences of soft feces.
TO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY
This inspection was conducted with the care takers and exit interview by phone with the licensee due to the
language barrier and is out of town.
