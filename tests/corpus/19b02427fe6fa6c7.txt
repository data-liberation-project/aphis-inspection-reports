2.131(c)(1) CRITICAL
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During a public feeding opportunity on 16 October 2016, a child was bitten by a pygmy hippo. The child was allowed
to get close enough to the pygmy hippo that when she tried to throw the food, the animal bit her hand. The child
required medical attention due to the bite. During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal
risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the
general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. To be corrected from this point forward.
3.75(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wire for the guillotine door system for two enclosures in the colobus building goes through an opening in the
metal ceiling. The metal ceiling is torn at both of these openings, resulting in a jagged edge. In addition, the wire for
one of the door systems in this building is rusted and fraying. The frayed ends of this metal wire are sharp to the
touch. Both the torn metal on the ceiling and the frayed wire are within reaching distance for the nonhuman primates
in the enclosures. Sharp and jagged metal can cause injury. Any surfaces that come in contact with nonhuman
primates must be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animals. To be corrected by 23
November 2016.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A bale of peat moss stored in the large barn and used to enhance the bedding of nonhuman primates has been
opened and is not being stored in a sealed container. Also, an open bag of primate biscuits being stored in the
freezer near the large barn is open and not being stored in a sealed container. Unprotected food and bedding can
deteriorate and can become contaminated with pests. Open food and bedding supplies for nonhuman primates
must be kept in leak-proof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage and contamination. To be corrected
by 19 November 2016
3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a board missing which creates a gap on the top of a resting platform in both a honey badger enclosure and
a lynx enclosure. There is a rusted metal support on the sliding door in a serval enclosure. There is a broken wood
board at the base of a warthog enclosure. These structures are not structurally sound and can lead to injury. The
facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
