FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The paddock for the camel has an outer fence that is eight feet in height. Within this paddock, there is a single
strand of braided cord electrified wire located 3 feet from the fence. This electric wire has fallen down, and is lying
on the ground adjacent to the barn. In addition, the overlaid wire on the outer wooden fence has come loose from
the fence posts creating gaps at the top of the fence.
The fencing for the camel must be maintained in good repair to protect the animal from injury and to contain the
animal. The fencing must be repaired.
