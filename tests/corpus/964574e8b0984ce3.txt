TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Several dogs including 3 dams with litters in the same primary enclosures had no means of identification on the
dog(cid:25)'s cage or run or in animal record books kept at this facility. Failure to properly identify all animals as required
by 9CFR section 2.50 inhibits the accurate tracking and verification of animals at this facility. A system of proper
animal identification using a method allowable by the USDA must be in place.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-The interior and exterior runs of the sheltered building have concrete floors that have not been sealed. The floor
surfaces are porous and cannot be cleaned and sanitized as required. Fecal material and other debris can
accumulate in small crevices increasing the potential of disease hazards in these areas.
- There are wooden-framed access doors in between the interior and exterior runs of the sheltered building which
contained unsealed, raw wood. The surfaces of housing facilities must be constructed and maintained in a manner and that allow them to be
readily cleaned and sanitized. A system of timely identification, repair/replacement, and maintenance of surfaces of
housing facilities must be in place.
