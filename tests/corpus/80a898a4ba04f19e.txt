2.50(e)(2)

Time and method of identification.
The facility is not properly identifying animals on hand. At least 20% of the primary enclosures housing animals either did
not have any identification or had an incomplete label of identification attached to the primary enclosure. Proper
identification for all animals is essential for appropriate tracking of animals and to maintain compliance with the AWA.
Correct by ensuring all animals have proper identification. Correct by 1/12/22.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is not currently maintaining records of animals on hand and was unable to locate any previous records.
Complete and accurate records are necessary to facilitate the tracking of animals and maintain compliance with other
aspects of the AWA. Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully disclose the information
concerning animals, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under
his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor.
3.129(b) Repeat

Feeding.
The licensee is not currently cleaning and sanitizing feeders often enough to ensure they are being maintained rust free.
The feed receptacles are currently only being cleaned and/or sanitized when new animals are introduced into an


enclosure. Although the facility has been gradually working on the rusted feeders, there is still at least 10% of the used
enclosures that have an excessive amount of rust on the self-feeders where food is dispensed. Rust is not able to be
properly cleaned and sanitized and the minimal number of feeders with jagged edges can cause injury to the animals
while attempting to feed. The licensee must ensure that all food receptacles are kept clean and sanitary at all times to
minimize disease hazards and protect the animals from injury. Rusty feeders that cannot be properly cleaned or have
sharp edges must be repaired, resurfaced or replaced.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
