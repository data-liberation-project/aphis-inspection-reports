2.31(c)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
*** The IACUC has not conducted an inspection of all animal facilities at least every six months. A full inspection of
facilities and review of the program of humane care and use occurred on October 25, 2013. The next program and
facility review was conducted by the IACUC on May 6, 2014, which is greater than the required six month interval (7
months between reviews)
Inspection of the animal facilities by the IACUC is required at least every six months to ensure that any teaching
activities involving animals at these facilities are being conducted in a manner to reduce pain and/or distress and
that they meet the current standards for all species.
The IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research
facility's animal facilities, including animal study areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A- Animal Welfare, as a
basis for evaluation.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***The animal care staff did not convey the health status of two animals to the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner.
Both animals underwent surgery on June 28, 2014 for medical device implantation per protocol direction.
The daily observation logs for pig 48 from June 30, 2014, at 6:45am, indicate "Lethargic, playing with food".
The daily observation logs for pig 50 from June 30, 2014, at 6:45am, indicate "Lethargic, no interest in food".
At the time of inspection, at 13:30, both animals were still lethargic. APHIS VMO observed both animals in sternal
recumbency and both were reluctant to move. There was no documentation that indicated the attending veterinarian(AV) was notified at the time of these observations. The animal care staff stated to the APHIS VMO, that the AV had
not been contacted.
At the direction of the APHIS VMO, the animal care staff contacted the attending and clinical veterinarians. The
clinical veterinarian (CV) arrived at the facility during the inspection to assess the animals. During the CV's
examination, both animals vomited (an expected adverse reaction stated in the protocol) and appeared to be doing
better thereafter. The CV attributed the lethargy to nausea and administered an anti-nausea medication. The CV
stated he did not believe the animals were painful, but administered a small dose of NSAID as a precaution. The
APHIS VMO inspected the animals again, observing both animals standing and moving around their enclosure.
All animals must be observed daily and any veterinary care issues must be timely and accurately relayed to the
attending veterinarian. The facility must insure that a program is place to insure that all injured and/or animals
receive prompt and adequate veterinary care.
