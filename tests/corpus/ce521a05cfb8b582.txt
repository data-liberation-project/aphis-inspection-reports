2.40(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee states that the Attending Veterinarian does major surgical procedures, including Caesarean Sections,
on the licensee(cid:25)s property. The building used for those major surgical procedures is a large storage shed type
building. Within that building there are boxes of equipment and husbandry items stacked up against the walls (piles
of newspapers and carpet, empty boxes, feeders, a pressure washer, a paper shredder, empty dog crates, tools,
etc). In the middle of the room, there is a large plastic table sitting up on blocks of wood where the licensee states
the surgeries are done. Nearly the entire top of the surgical table is dirty and covered and/or stained with dried
blood. Half of the table has surgical equipment, multiple bottles of medications (including several bottles of expired
medications) and a small tub of dog food. The floor is soiled with dirt, dust and/or debris. There are two pieces of
cardboard sitting under the surgical table that are worn and soiled. In one corner of the room there are two
enclosures containing a total of five puppies. The licensee states that the Attending Veterinarian conducted
Caesarian Sections in this location on the two days previously (December 1st and 2nd). This is not an appropriate
facility/area for conducting major surgical procedures such as Caesarean Sections. It does not provide a sterile
environment and could lead to health complications for the animals. Major operative procedures must only be
conducted in dedicated facilities which are operated and maintained under aseptic conditions. The licensee must
establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the availability and use of appropriate
facilities and equipment.
The licensee stated that no more major surgical procedures will take place at this property.
To be corrected from this day forward.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Within the "Surgical Suite" there were numerous bottles of drugs and medical materials sitting on the surgical table.
Examination of these products revealed multiple expired drugs and medical materials intermingled amongst current
drugs and medical materials. The following medications were found to be expired: Two bottles of Xylazine expiredDecember 2013, one bottle of Dopram injection expired April 2012, one bottle of Atropine Sulfate expired August
2010, one bottle of Betadine Solution expired October 2003, one bottle of Povidone Iodine expired October 2006.
One bag of Sodium Chloride injection that expired in December 2010 was found on top of a dog crate next to the
surgical table. The licensee stated that cesarean sections had taken place in the surgical suite on the two days
prior to the inspection (December 1st and 2nd).
The use of expired materials such as drugs, fluids, or sutures on regulated animals is not considered to be
acceptable veterinary practice and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The use of expired medications
and other medical materials could be detrimental to the health of the animals. The facility must either dispose of all
such expired medical drugs and materials or segregate them in an appropriately labeled, physically separate
location from non-expired medical drugs and materials. The licensee must ensure that all medical materials used
for the care and husbandry of the animals is current and non-expired.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In at least five outdoor enclosures, containing at least five English bulldogs, the metal feeders are attached to the
fence panels by metal wires or the access doors are held open by metal wire. The ends of these wires are located
inside the enclosures creating sharp points at the level of the dogs. Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs
Enclosures must be free of sharp points or jagged edges that could injure the animals. The licensee must remove
all sharp points from all dog enclosures to ensure that they remain safe for the animals.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Blue Building" there are two enclosures containing a total of two adult dogs and three puppies that have
whelping boxes constructed of vinyl plastic. The vinyl plastic has been excessively chewed by the dogs and has
become torn and dirty. The chewing damage does not allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of the whelping
boxes.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be readily cleaned
and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace, repair or alter the damaged areasof the whelping boxes in a manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization to occur. The licensee must ensure that
all surfaces of housing facilities are properly maintained.

3.2(b)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Inside the "Pig Poke Building", which contains nineteen adult dogs and two puppies, there was a noticeable buildup
in the level of ammonia. One inspector noticed a burning sensation in her eyes and the other inspector noticed a
burning sensation in her throat. The buildup of ammonia could have a negative impact on the health and well-being
of the dogs.
Indoor housing facilities for dogs must be sufficiently ventilated when dogs are present to minimize odors, drafts,
ammonia levels and moisture condensation. The licensee must ensure that this building has adequate ventilation to
keep ammonia levels minimized and promote the health and well-being of the dogs. The licensee must ensure all
indoor housing, when dogs are present, is adequately ventilated at all times.

3.6(a)(2)(7)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In one outdoor enclosure, containing four English bulldogs, there is not enough shade provided to accommodate all
the dogs at one time. The licensee had put up a tarp in the corner of the enclosure but it had fallen and only a very
small section of shade was provided. Inadequate shade does not ensure that the dogs can find protection from the
direct rays of the sun which could negatively impact their health.
All primary enclosures must provide sufficient shade to shelter all the dogs in the enclosure at one time. The
licensee must add an adequate amount of shade to this enclosure for all the dogs housed within. The licensee
must ensure that all enclosures have sufficient shade for all the dogs at all times.
