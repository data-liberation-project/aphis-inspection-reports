ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the inspection, a female albino hedgehog was noted to be having loud audible breathing. Upon closer
examination, the hedgehog appeared to sneeze several times and continued to either vocalize or have audible
breathing noises. The owner had not noted this condition prior to the APHIS inspector's observation. Audible
breathing or increased vocalizations and sneezing are not normal in hedgehogs and may indicate a problem with
this animal's respiratory system.
**This animal should be observed daily and should be seen by a veterinarian by 2/7/2015 if she continues to sneeze
or have audible breathing or vocalizations.
Several notations on the cage card for one of the breeding female hedgehogs, "Grand Junction", raised concerns
about this animal's overall health and well-being. These included:
**10-5 body weight 597 grams
**10-8 giving birth to 7 babies with 4 dying and 3 moved to another female to foster on 10-9
**11-4 body weight 515 grams; male moved into cage for breeding
**12-18 "ran away"--owner states animal escaped from enclosure and was missing 1-2 days before being
recovered; recorded her body weight at 419 grams which is significantly less (178 grams or about 30 % weight loss)
from the recorded weight on 10-5; owner stated she believes this animal had been pregnant after breeding 11-4
through 12-12 and most likely aborted the fetuses, causing the significant weight loss.
**1-10 male moved in to breed with this female, no date listed when male moved out but no male present during
inspection
This female hedgehog's weight at the time of this inspection was 609 grams which may indicate she is pregnant.
She has had two failed attempts reproducing within the past 3 months, had severe weight loss around the time of an
escape from her enclosure, for which there is no documentation as to how long she was loose and did not have
access to food or water, and has been bred again since these experiences. When concern by the APHIS VMO was
raised about this animal's history and the owner was questioned as to whether the attending veterinarian (AV) had
discussed this situation or examined this animal on her recent visit (1/26/2015), the owner stated the vet looked at
every animal and didn't think there were any problems. There was no documentation by the owner or the AV to
show which animals were discussed or examined during this visit.This animal, and all of the animals, should be closely observed on a daily basis to ensure they are in good health,
eating and drinking normally, and, that abnormal behavior, sounds, or conditions are noted so that the AV can be
consulted in a timely manner. The AV should be consulted about any animals that have poor reproductive success
(abortions, rejections, dystocias, or other problems) prior to continuing to breed these animals.
A system has been implemented since the previous inspection on 11/13/2014 to record daily care and observations
of all animals in the store (excludes the breeding hedgehogs in the upstairs room). Records for the ferrets, sugar
gliders, and chinchillas did not have entries for daily observation or care on 1/27 or 1/30. One of the employees
stated that the mammals are one of the last group of animals checked by the staff and he could not definitively state
if the staff member forgot to document the daily care or if it was not performed on those days.
Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being and to provide water and food is required. If a
mechanism is developed by the facility to document this daily care and observation, the mechanism must be
maintained to ensure that all animals are properly cared for and, that if problems are noted, they can be
communicated in a timely manner to the AV.
The facility must establish a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate
information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility is not making, keeping, or maintaining records for the acquisition and disposition of animals other than
dogs and cats that contain all of the required information.
**Since the previous inspection on 11/13/2014, records of disposition showed that a total of 48 hedgehogs were
sold and 22 were transferred to site 002 for this licensee (48 + 22 = 70 total hedgehog dispositions).
There were 28 hedgehogs on site on 11/13/2014. Acquisition records between that previous inspection and this
inspection showed 45 hedgehogs acquired on 12/21/2014, 4 males born on premise on 12/29/2014, 14 born on
premise on 1/10/2015, 14 born on premise on 1/16/2015, and 5 born on premise on 1/24/15 (45 + 4 + 14+ 14 + 5 =
82 total hedgehogs acquired). There were 63 hedgehogs in the facility at the time of this inspection which leaves
23 hedgehogs unaccounted for by acquisition records; 28 + 82 - 70 = 40 hedgehogs total that should be on hand
but there were 63 on hand at time of inspection.
**At the time of this inspection, 3 chinchillas were present. At the previous inspection of 11/13/2014, 2 chinchillas
were present. A record of acquisition for 1 chinchilla on 8/18/14 was made available at this inspection. A
disposition record for 1 chinchilla on 12/23/14 was available for review during this inspection. There is no way to
determine if any of the 3 chinchillas on site at the time of this inspection were present at the time of the inspection
on 11/13/2014 and no records made to show when or from whom the additional chinchillas were acquired.**Two sugar gliders were present at the time of this inspection. Records of acquisition for 4 sugar gliders on 8/4/14
and 2 sugar gliders on 1/25/15 and a disposition record for 2 sugar gliders on 12/21/14 were available for review at
this inspection. An acquisition record for 2 sugar gliders on 3/18/14 and a disposition record for 2 sugar gliders on
9/26/14 were available on the previous inspection on 11/13/2014. No sugar gliders were present during the previous
inspection.
No other records of disposition for the other sugar gliders were made or available for review, leaving the 2 sugar
gliders acquired March 2014 unaccounted for. There is no method to determine whether 2 of 4 sugar gliders
acquired on 8/4/14 were sold on 9/26/14 nor what happened to the other 2 sugar gliders as none were present on
11/1/3/2014 and no record of disposition was made. There is no record of acquisition for the 2 sugar gliders sold on
12/21/14 and, therefore, no way to determine when and from whom they were acquired. The owner confirmed that
the 2 sugar gliders acquired on 1/25/2015 were the ones present during this inspection.
**The acquisition record for 2 sugar gliders on 1/25/2015 did not contain driver's license number and State, and
vehicle license number and State of the unlicensed person from whom they were acquired.
**A guinea pig was present at the previous inspection on 11/13/2014 but no guinea pigs were present during this
inspection. According to the owner, an employee purchased or otherwise acquired the guinea pig on 1/24/2015 but
no record of disposition was made. A record was created by the owner during this inspection.
**Two ferrets were present at the time of this inspection but no record of acquisition was made that included the
date of acquisition, name, address, driver's license number and State, and vehicle license number and State of the
unlicensed person from whom they were acquired.
Accurate and complete records for the acquisition and disposition of animals other than dogs and cats are required
to ensure that legal acquisition and humane transportation and care occur.
Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased, or
otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise
disposed of by that dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession
or under his or her control.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A female hedgehog was noted on the cage card to have escaped from the enclosure on 12/18/2014. The owner
stated that she was trying to switch the clear plastic enclosures (14 inches in height) to deeper enclosures because
the animals were able to climb out of the clear ones. The enclosures are plastic bins stacked on wire racks. Of the44 total enclosures housing hedgehogs in the upstairs breeding room, 10 were the shorter clear plastic enclosures
and most of these were located on the top shelves of the wire racks.
Enclosures that cannot contain the animals pose a risk to the animals as they can fall from the top of the racks (> 5
feet high) causing injury or they could be lost within the facility without access to food or water which could lead to
dehydration, starvation, or death.
The primary enclosure housing 2 ferrets had a severely frayed hammock which poses a risk for injury if the animals
were to become entangled. The enclosure also had a broken, unstable shelf on the mid-level which was not
structurally sound and poses a risk of injury if the shelf were to collapse or if the ferrets would become entrapped
between the caging and the unsecure shelf.
The housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
The hammock for the ferrets was removed during the inspection.
Appropriate enclosures to contain the hedgehogs and replacement or repair of the ferret enclosure are to be
corrected by 2/6/2015.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An open bag of bedding used for hedgehogs was being stored on the floor of the upstairs room adjacent to
solvents, paint, and other potentially harmful contaminants. The facility was noted to have an active pest problem
during this inspection and open bedding and food are attractants for pests.
Contamination of bedding by harmful chemicals or by pests poses a risk to the health of these hedgehogs as they
live and burrow in this material in their enclosures and can ingest or be exposed to chemicals or infectious material
from the pest by direct contact through their skin or by ingestion of the materials.
The storage cabinets under the enclosures for hedgehogs in the showroom of the store had numerous open bags of
bedding and food and an uncovered bowl of pelleted food. A spider web with live spiders was found in an open bag
of oat cereal, small black beetles were seen in the cabinet, and an accumulation of food debris, dust, and other
unidentified materials were found among the food and bedding.
Open bags of food and bedding stored in dusty cabinets with an active pest problem may become contaminated
and the food may deteriorate. This poses a risk to the health of animals provided with the food and/or bedding.Supplies of food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against
deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin.
To be corrected by 2/5/2015.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
Several enclosures housing hedgehogs and one for a chinchilla had an accumulation of excreta that would not
prevent contamination of the animals or their food and where an accumulation of flies was noted during the
inspection.
Accumulation of excreta attracts pests and provides a medium for the flies to spread infectious organisms between
animal enclosures and may contaminate food and bedding, posing a risk to the health of the animals.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
To be corrected by 2/5/2015,
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Several areas in the facility used for animal housing and food preparation/storage had accumulations of unused
equipment, potentially harmful chemicals, and items necessary for husbandry stored together in a manner that limits
the ability to perform the prescribed husbandry practices and to protect the animals from harm.
The upstairs room housing breeding hedgehogs had numerous carts and boxes overflowing with equipment, water
bottles, litter boxes, and other items necessary for husbandry practices. The ability to access the racks where the
hedgehog enclosures are stacked is limited due to the amount of materials stored in this manner.
The rodent breeding room had unused equipment stacked along the walls and accumulations of rodent feces, dust,
and debris were present. A metal cart with a food processor was in the middle of this room and had an
accumulation of dried food debris all over the processor and the cart. Adjacent to the cart were two buckets filled
with fluid, empty water bottles, and floating food debris.
These conditions are unsanitary and not appropriate in animal housing or food preparation/storage areas as they
can attract pests which carry infectious diseases and may contaminate the animals or their food and bedding. The
areas are also very cluttered and accessing the enclosures or trying to locate escaped animals would be limited.Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the
prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas
and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
To be corrected by 2/9/2015.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
The facility does not have an effective program for the control of pests.
Numerous flies were noted in the upstairs room where hedgehogs are being housed for breeding purposes and in
the rodent breeding room where some food preparation for the store animals occurs.
An excessive amount of rodent feces was noted along the walls and around equipment and other stored materials
in the rodent breeding room where some food preparation for the store animals occurs.
The storage cabinets under the showroom enclosures for hedgehogs had live spiders and beetles among open
bags of food and bedding.
No control methods were evident and the facility representatives stated that they have not been using anything to
control the accumulation of flies or other insects or to control feral rodents in the facility. Insect and mammalian
pests carry infectious diseases and can contaminate food and bedding, posing a risk to these animals for disease.
Spiders can bite small mammals, posing a risk to these animals for disease or injury.
Rodent feces and spiders should be removed immediately and the areas around food preparation, food and
bedding storage, and animal housing should be kept clean so active pest issues can be quickly identified and
addressed.
A safe and effective control program for all pests shall be implemented and maintained by 2/9/2015.
Inspection conducted on 2/3/2015 with owners, employees, Colorado Department of Agriculture PACFA
representatives, and APHIS AC VMO. Exit interview conducted with owner on 2/5/2015.
