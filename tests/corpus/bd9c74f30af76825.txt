2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult, blue Shih Tzu male named 'Blue Boy' and identified by tag number 130 has a right eye with an abnormal
appearance. The eye is cloudy with a blue color and has a small "bubble-like" bulge in the center. The licensee had
not noticed the eye prior to inspection. The abnormal appearance of the eye could be an indication of injury,
infection, or other medical issues.
Frontline Plus used monthly during April-November is listed on the ectoparasites section of the program of
veterinary care. The licensee stated she is not currently using this product. The licensee is mixing ivermectin with
alcohol and administering the medication by wiping it on the back of adult dogs monthly. The bottle of Ivermax (5mg
ivermectin per ml) being used does not list directions for use on dogs. The licensee stated that she has not
consulted the attending veterinarian about using the mixture.
Failure to have proper authorization and specific instructions for use from a veterinarian does not ensure that proper
dosing and administration of products is being accomplished. Further, it does not ensure that dogs are receiving
appropriate veterinary care within currently accepted veterinary practices.
The licensee must have proper authorization, labels and instructions for use from a veterinarian. The licensee must
have the dog listed above examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment
plan. Documentation should be available for all medical problems. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment
must be part of the documentation. The licensee must also ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at
all times.
To be corrected by: October 13, 2015.
