SANITATION.
***Camel Barn: The barn has an excessive build up of excreta and organic debris. The camels did not seem to want
to enter the barn. Excreta and organic debris must be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to
prevent contamination and minimize disease. The excreta and organic material must be removed and a regular
schedule of removal must be established to ensure the camels have areas in the barn to stand and sit that is free of
excreta at all times. Correct by May 29, 2014.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
