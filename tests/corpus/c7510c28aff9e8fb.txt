ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
2.40(b)(2)
There was a juvenile male Dachshund (no ID ) with circular patches of hair loss on his tail, as well as round, red
scabs on his tail, hips and back legs. When asked, the licensee and kennel staff were unaware of the condition.
Skin conditions can be painful and irritating to the dog and hair loss can indicate an underlying medical condition.
The licensee shall obtain a diagnosis and treatment plan from a licensed veterinarian within 48 hours and provide
adequate veterinary care as prescribed. Written documentation of the diagnosis and treatment should be available
during the next inspection. If the animal's condition is not resolved during treatment or returns, the licensee should
continue to have direct and frequent communication with the veterinarian to provide adequate veterinary care to the
animal.
3.1(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(e) Storage.
The food storage area had 3 unopened bags of dog food on the floor of the building and there was kibble strewn out
across much of the floor. The building is cluttered and is used to store additional material. A red, plastic container
that was full of gas was leaning against the dog food bags, allowing a great risk for contamination. Trash, food
waste, and clutter offer optimal breeding grounds for pests such as vermin and food sacks stored on the floor are at
risk for contamination. The licensee shall provide storage facilities that are kept clean and protect supplies from
spoilage, contamination, and vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls,
to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
(b) Shelter from the elements(4)
One of the outdoor shelter structures housing 2 adult Minature Pincher dogs had no bedding.The NationalWeather Service'(cid:25)s recorded high temperatures for the last 3 days have not risen above 50 degrees F and lows
were in the 30s with a recorded low of 28 degrees F on the night of 12/2/14. Sufficient bedding is needed to help the
animals maintain their body temperature. The licensee shall supply clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient
temperature is below 50 degrees F and additional clean, dry bedding when the temperature is 35 degrees F or
lower.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(a) General requirements (2)(x)
There were 3 sets of young puppies housed in the whelping facility enclosures that had flooring with large enough
openings that their feet and legs could pass through.
Two of the day old puppies were in an enclosure with their dam in which a blanket was provided to cover a portion
of the wire flooring. The blanket was bunched up with one of the puppies wrapped in a fold of the blanket. The
blanket was not a secure or safe floor covering. In addition there was a large section of un-covered wire coated
flooring with openings large enough for the young puppies to pass though.
The other two litters of un-weaned puppies were housed in enclosures with tenderfoot flooring that has 1inch long
diamond shaped openings. Both litters were provided blankets that covered a portion of the floor. However, these
puppies were observed walking off the blanket onto the exposed tenderfoot flooring with openings large enough that
the puppies(cid:25) feet and legs could pass through. There was no barrier to prevent the puppies from moving to the
uncovered area of flooring. Young animals that are not provided adequate support can result in an inability to learn
a proper gait and has the potential to cause injury. The licensee shall provide enclosures that have flooring that
does not allow the feet or legs of the animals to pass through any openings of the floor.
All of the NCI's were identified to the licensee and kennel staff during the inspection. A formal exit briefing was
conducted over the phone with the licensee on 12/4/14. A second exit briefing was conducted during the on site
report delivery on 12/5/14.
