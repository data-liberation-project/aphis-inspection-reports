2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Noticed a female Cocker Spaniel ( ID#1242) because it appeared to have matting and caked matter on the rear end area.
Upon closer observation there was an odor and discharge coming from both ears. The hair along the bottom of the ears
was matted and dirty, from the ear drainage. When you lift the ear flap, the ear canal and hair around the ear was wet.
There was a scabbed area behind the right shoulder about the size of a baseball. The scabbed area had a crack in the
middle with yellow and red discharge. Their was dirty matting on the back end of the dog and on the ears. Licensee
stated he talked to the AV and to use salve, I called the AV and he stated he didn't know anything about this dog and he
was there the day before doing puppy checks.
The facility also had expired medicines, panacur 11/20, Oxytocin '17, and no label on what the licensee stated was spray
salve.
The discharge from the ears and sore on the right side could be a medical condition causing harm to the dog. The matting
on the dog could cause discomfort. The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a veterinarian and keep records of any
treatment.

2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.

The facility did not have ID's on 12 dogs, and no cage cards or other form of ID for all the puppies. Identification is
necessary to properly complete any required documents and for APHIS officials to identify dogs and trace dogs back to
their origins. The licensee must ensure that all dogs at the facility have proper identification at all times.

3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
The outside enclosures on the south side of the sheltered building had seven enclosures containing 12 dogs with
excessive feces inside their enclosures. A build up of feces is a disease hazard and can attract pest. The licensee must
ensure all surfaces which come in contact with the dogs and puppies are spot cleaned daily.

3.2(d)

Indoor housing facilities.
Flooring in the indoor whelping and sheltered building is wood and not impervious to moisture. The wood floor in this
building had areas with feces on it and areas where moisture had absorbed into the plywood floor. Flooring that is not
impervious to moisture can harbor diseases. The licensee must ensure the floors of the facility are impervious to
moisture.

3.6(a)(2)(iii)

Primary enclosures.
In the sheltered building, the outdoor portion had dogs going between enclosures. Between two enclosures the dogs had
dug under the divider, so the dogs can go between enclosures. One enclosure had a hole dug out where the dogs can
escape. Holes can trap dogs, or dogs can escape and get hurt. The licensee must repair these holes and maintain all

enclosures.

3.6(c)(4)

Primary enclosures.
The licensee had a Dachshund chained up inside an enclosure because it was fighting with other dogs in that enclosure.
Dogs on a chain can hurt themselves. Tethering or having dogs on a chain is not allowed. The licensee must never tether
a dog.

3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care is missing the plans to maintain healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed toe
nails, healthy ears, eyes, skin, and teeth. Failure to have these plans could have a negative impact on the health and well-
being of the animals.
The Program of Veterinary Care must include an appropriate plan of preventative care and treatment to maintain healthy
and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed toe nails, and healthy teeth, ears, eyes and skin. The licensee must add the
missing plans to the Program of Veterinary Care in order to ensure the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.
