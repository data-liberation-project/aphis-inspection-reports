2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1045 on
13-DEC-16. I went to the licensee's house. A couple of delivery men were there and they were knocking on the
door. No one answered. I went back to my car, called the licensee, and left a message. She called me back about
ten minutes later. She said she was not close by and I would have to come back another time. I then left the
licensee's house.
Note: The licensee informed me she is in the process of moving. She was advised to contact the regional office to
let them know of her new address. This report will be sent by certified mail to her new address.
End of report.
