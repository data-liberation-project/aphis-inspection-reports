2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of inspection, the facility representative did not have access to the acquisition and disposition records for me
to review. Appropriate documentation of acquired regulated animals, and complete and accurate records of disposition
are essential for proper identification and necessary to track animals used in regulated activities to ensure their humane
care, use, and disposition. Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition and disposition for all
regulated animals, including animals born on the premises, and assure that all records are kept as required. To be
corrected by the next relicense inspection.

Facilities, general.
The gate located between the covered camel enclosure and the open outdoor area was in poor repair. The gate was
composed of a tubular metal frame with metal crossbars. The area where the crossbars are welded to the opening portion
of the gate was rusted and the welds were all broken. The horizontal tube at the top of the gate was also rusted with holes
eaten into the metal and a portion of the bar was collapsed and compromised. Failure to maintain enclosures in good
repair can lead to animal injuries and escapes. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and


shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. The gate was replaced at
the time of inspection.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by November 6, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
