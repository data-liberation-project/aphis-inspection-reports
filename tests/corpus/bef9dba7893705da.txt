PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE GUINEA PIGS AND HAMSTERS.
Eight blue transport enclosures housing 15 guinea pigs in each had no markings on top and on one or more sides
with the words "Live Animals" in letters at least 1 inch in height, and with arrows or markings to indicate the correct
upright position of the container (see air waybill 006 PHL 8311 9816).
Carriers and intermediate handlers must not transport live animals unless the primary enclosure is clearly marked
on top and on more or more sides with the words "Live Animals" in letters a least 1 inch in height, and with arrows
or other markings to indicate the correct upright position. Failure to label primary enclosures properly can result in
animals being transported incorrectly and can put animals at risk for injury.
This inspection was conducted with the customer service agent and the exit interview was conducted with the
general manager.
