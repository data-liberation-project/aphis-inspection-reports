3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was no shelter from inclement weather in an enclosure housing three camels.
The inability to take shelter from rain, especially cold seasonal winter rains, could cause discomfort to the animals
and adversely impact their health. The licensee stated that she submitted fecal samples to a veterinary lab afternoticing one of the animals had lost weight. She was told by the lab that whip worms were detected in at least one
sample. Health conditions (such as weight loss and parasite burdens) may be exacerbated by wet and cold
conditions.
The facility should ensure that animals housed at the facility have access to shelter that will adequately protect them
from inclement weather.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
Three camels were being fed directly on the ground. There were no feeders in the enclosure and hay was mixed in
mud inside the enclosure where the animals were being fed. The licensee fed hay directly on the ground in a
different location during the inspection. The ground inside the enclosure was soft because of rain in November.
Additionally, the licensee stated that fecal samples obtained from the camels had tested positive for whip worms
approximately three weeks prior to the inspection.
Food should be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination. Food may become contaminated when fed
directly on the ground, especially given the history of an intestinal parasite infection. Additionally, food may be less
palatable when mixed with mud and fecal material.
The licensee should ensure that the animals are fed in a manner that it wholesome, palatable, and free from
contamination.
