Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
-On December 18, 2022 a male Pomeranian with USDA tag number 5 was let out into the exercise yard with a male Shih
Tzu with USDA tag number 18 and a female Pomeranian with USDA id 4 that was in heat. The male Shih Tzu with id 18
bit the male Pomeranian in the left front toe causing a puncture wound. The toe is swollen and red, and the fur around
the puncture is discolored. The attending veterinarian was never called in regards to this bite wound and treatment
recommendations for the wound.
-A Yorkshire Terrier with USDA tag number 10 had heavy brown buildup of dental plaque with reddened gums. There
was a strong rancid odor coming from the mouth.
Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
The attending veterinarian must be contacted for an appropriate method to treat disease and injuries to prevent further
veterinary complications and pain.

Veterinary care for dogs.
The program of veterinary care lists that dogs be vaccinated for rabies at 14-16 weeks, lists that heartworm and flea
preventative be completed every 30 days with no medications/product listed, and there is no set frequency to examine
dogs for clean and healthy eyes and dental disease. When the inspector asked about heartworm preventative the
licensee produced a bottle of injectable ivermectin for cattle and swine. When the inspector asked how the medication
was administered the licensee could not answer.
Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that is developed, and documented in writing.
The written program of veterinary care must address the requirements for adequate veterinary care for every dealer that
includes vaccinations for rabies, a preventative care frequency to ensure clean and healthy eyes, and teeth.
The program of veterinary care must include all aspects of veterinary care to ensure the dogs are maintained in good
health.
