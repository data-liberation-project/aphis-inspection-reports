Handling of animals.
The facility is allowing public contact with a young Dama (Tammar) wallaby. During one of these interactions a child was
bitten on the finger. This facility has a history of public injury during it’s “animal encounters”.
During public exhibition animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of injury to the animals and the public. This
facility needs to ensure that animals and people are not put into situations where either is injured or stressed during these
encounters.

Facilities, general.
The floor in the sloth enclosure consists of glued linoleum over concrete. The linoleum is currently loose in areas and
peeling up from the concrete allowing urine to seep underneath and preventing the enclosure from being adequately
cleaned.
Facilities must be constructed and maintained so that they can be adequately cleaned to prevent contamination of the
animals, minimize disease hazards, and reduce odors.
The sloth floor needs to be repaired so that it can be adequately cleaned.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.


The 2 Asian small-clawed otters have a back holding area that is approximately 4’ x 4’. The area did not appear to have
been cleaned in some time. The white walls and the concrete block walls had staining to the height the otters were able to
reach. The floor had an accumulation of feces and staining that appeared to be more than one day’s worth.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
The otter back holding area needs to be cleaned more frequently.
