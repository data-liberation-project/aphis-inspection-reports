ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility had a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection at 11:30 A.M. on
02/29/2016. The facility refused to allow APHIS inspectors to conduct the Animal Welfare Inspection. Refusal to
allow inspection is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act.
The licensee refused to allow an inspection of her premises. The inspectors asked if there was any other person
who can conduct the inspection other than the licensee. The licensee stated that there was no other person
available to conduct the inspection.
Robert Brandes, D.V.M. & Megan Adams, ACI were present when the licensee refused an inspection. Both
inspectors asked her specifically if she was refusing an inspection and she replied she was.
