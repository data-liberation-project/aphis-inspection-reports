2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On 29 April 2015 an employee cleaning rabbit caging and changing out a rabbit nest box missed one newborn kit
still in the nest box while discarding the nest box bedding into the garbage. This resulted in the death of the baby kit
before it was discovered missing during the afternoon welfare check.
Ensure all animals are accounted for and handled during cage cleaning to prevent harm to the animals.
The facility has corrected this noncompliance by retraining all animal technicians, documenting the number of kits
on the cage card and to change out nest boxes by handfuls rather than dumping the nest box.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with President, IACUC Chair, Director of In Life & Veterinary Services,
IACUC Administrator and this Veterinary Medical Officer.
