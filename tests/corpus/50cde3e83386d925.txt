ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female orange and white Maine Coon ("Krissy" DOB 12-7-14 Avid 049379629) appeared lethargic. The licensee
stated she had been that way since he weaned her kittens about a week ago. Her inner eye lids were visible and
her eyes were not fully open. When the licensee pulled up on the skin on the shoulders it did not quickly go down
and the fur remained disturbed. He had provided her canned food, that she had not touched. She appeared thin,
and as if she was not grooming herself. The licensee had not consulted a veterinarian about the status of "Krissy"
Lethargy can be a symptom of numerous medical problems. The lack of veterinary treatment to determine the
cause does not allow for accurate and adequate treatment of the underlying medical condition. The licensee must
use appropriate methods, to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This information including
the diagnosis, treatment, and resolution of the condition must be documented and made available to the inspector
upon request.

the medications at the time of the inspection.
