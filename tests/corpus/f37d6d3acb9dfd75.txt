2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has three Ring-tailed Lemurs. The program of veterinary care for these animals calls for tetanus
vaccination every 10 years with the first vaccine given at 6 months of age. The licensee has not had these animals
vaccinated for tetanus and was unsure if they were vaccinated previous to him acquiring them. The written program
of veterinary exists to ensure that there is accurate communication between the applicant and the attending
veterinarian and ensure that all routine medications and vaccines provided to the animals by the applicant are done
with the direction and knowledge of the attending veterinarian. The licensee must ensure that the program of
veterinary care is followed per the direction of the attending veterinarian. To be corrected by December 26, 2017.
3.75(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal surfaces in the Ring-tailed Lemur enclosure had excessive rust present to the point that the surface was
no longer smooth. The rough surface may prevent the required cleaning and sanitization, which may lead to
increased disease hazards. These surfaces need to be addressed so that excessive rust is not present and to allow
for the required cleaning and sanitization. To be corrected by February 1, 2018.
3.75(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was an open bag of shavings used for the nonhuman primates that was not being stored in a leakproof
container with tightly fitting lid. This may lead to contamination of the supply. Open supplies of bedding must be kept
in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination. To be corrected December 22, 2017.
3.84(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The enclosure with three Ring-tailed Lemurs is not being spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency. The licensee is
currently removing feces along with the soiled shavings on a weekly basis. Feces mixed in with the shavings was
scattered throughout the enclosure floor so that the animals would not have been able to avoid contact with thefeces. Additionally, the adjacent enclosure houses parrot species and the ledge inside the Lemur enclosure had a
build-up of avian feces present. The presence of this waste and current frequency of cleaning could increase
disease hazards, pests and odors and make conditions unpleasant for the animals, if they cannot avoid contact with
the feces. Floors with absorbent bedding must be spot-cleaned with sufficient frequency to allow animals the
freedom to avoid contact with excreta and reduce risk of disease hazards, pests and odors. To be corrected by
December 20, 2017.
3.84(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The enclosure housing three Ring-tailed Lemurs is not being sanitized. One Lemur arrived in September and the
other two in mid-November. The licensee acknowledged that disinfecting is not being done. Additionally, the
adjacent enclosure houses parrot species and the ledge inside the Lemur enclosure had a build-up of avian feces
present. This could lead to an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris and excreta and increase disease hazards.
Primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks to reduce these risks and provide for the overall
well-being of the animals. To be corrected by January 2, 2018.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure housing two Kinkajous had smaller wire mesh attached to the primary enclosure fencing. The smaller
mesh had areas of sharp points along the edges of the mesh on the front enclosure door and on the bottom left
corner on the left side of the enclosure. Sharp points present a physical hazard that could result in injury to the
animals. Sharp points must be removed and enclosures maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury
and to contain the animals. The licensee addressed the sharp points at the time of the inspection.
3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The enclosure housing four young Capybara did not include a space for water for swimming/immersion. Capybara
are a semi-aquatic species and spend much time in the water. A space for water in the enclosure allows the
Capybaras to satisfy a behavioral preference. Inadequate space to express normal behaviors can lead to stress and
abnormal behavioral patterns. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures be constructed and maintained so as to
provide sufficient space for the animal. This was corrected at the time of the inspection.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
There is an AstroTurf carpet along the front of the fox enclosure. Excessive amounts of feces have collected on this
carpet and in some areas coats the AstroTurf so it cannot be seen. The animals must walk through the area ofaccumulated feces in order to access the water receptacle for this enclosure. The resting board on the floor of one
of the chinchilla enclosures housing two chinchillas has an excessive accumulation of feces. The feces are also
collecting behind the shelter box within the enclosure. Excessive feces and excreta in enclosures can play a role in
disease transmission, lead to odors, and make conditions unpleasant for the animals if they cannot avoid contact
with the feces. The licensee must ensure that excreta and feces shall be removed from primary enclosures as often
as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, to minimize disease hazards, and to reduce odors. To be
corrected by December 21, 2017.
