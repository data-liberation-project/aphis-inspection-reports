2.40(b)(2) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee lost 5 goats this winter due to illness. The licensee stated one goat had a snotty nose and the
caretaker gave it an unknown medication and it did not help. The licensee stated that the others may have died of
bloat. The goats died while the licensee was away from the farm and had a caretaker in charge.
Each exhibitor shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat disease and injuries.
The veterinarian must be consulted when an animal is sick for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan to prevent the
unnecessary suffering of the animals.
To be corrected from now on.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The goat walk on the east side of the market splits off in two places at the top. This section of walk is approximately
15 feet tall. The two sections of walk only have one side rail. There is an extension off of one of these sections that
has no rails and leads to a platform where the goats can get food. This platform does not have sides either.
The facility must be constructed so that it is sound and maintained in good repair.
Side rails must me added to these areas of the goat walk to make it sound to prevent injury to the goats by falling
from the walk.
To be corrected by June 30, 2017.
