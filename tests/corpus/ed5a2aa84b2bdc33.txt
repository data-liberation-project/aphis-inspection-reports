ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In speaking with the staff member about the fox's death I was told that she noticed that the fox was not acting
normal and that is when she noticed the frost bite on the back legs. She brought the fox into the house. However,
the fox died the following day. She told me that the attending veterinarian had been called and said that nothing
could be done for the animal. However, in speaking to the attending veterinarian(cid:25)'s office I was informed that they
were not called about this situation. The licensee did not observe the animal on a daily basis to ensure its health
and well-being nor did they take the animal to the vet for assessment. There wasn'(cid:25)t any communication with the
attending vet so that timely and accurate information could be conveyed. This would have ensured adequate vet
care was provided. This needs to be addressed immediately for the health care of the remaining animals at the
facility.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Four ring tailed lemurs were being housed in an enclosure to the right of the baboon exhibit. The front of this
enclosure is constructed of ½ inch x ½ inch wire mesh. There is also a 1 ft tall portable, wooden, step in front of this
enclosure. This step allows the general public to reach the wire mesh and have direct access to the primates. To
ensure the safety of the primates and the general public, this situation needs to be addressed. A sufficient barrier
needs to be placed around this enclosure.

FACILITIES, GENERAL. The newly acquired African Crested Porcupine is being housed in the old fox enclosure. The enclosure is
constructed of wire mesh panels. The bottom poles in the first section on the left, and first section on the right, are
both rusting out. There are holes in the pipe that go halfway through the pipe. To ensure the integrity of the
enclosure and prevent this porcupine from escaping, these pipes will need to be repaired.

The bison pen was currently in the process of being cleaned out. There were several metal gates / panels, held
together by baling twine, that have been used to cut the enclosure in half. However, these panels are loose and
leaning in various directions. To ensure that the bison is securely contained, these panels will need to be
addressed.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
During this inspection I was informed that the fox had died in January 2015. According to the staff, this animal
suffered severe frost bite to both of its back legs. Although straw /hay were present in the igloo shelter it is apparent
that it was not sufficient to protect the fox from discomfort, injury, or death. All animals that are housed outdoors
need to be provided additional protection from the severe weather conditions in this part of NY.
