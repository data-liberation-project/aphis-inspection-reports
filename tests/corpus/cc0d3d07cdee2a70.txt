2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1245 on
01-Dec-17. I went to the licensee's house. I knocked on the door. No one answered. I honked my car horn and
then called the licensee. She informed me she was not available and would not be available for a few hours. I told
her I would send out an attempted inspection report by mail and we would have to try again another day. She
stated okay.
End of report.
