Contingency planning.
The licensee does not have a contingency plan for their facility. Lack of contingency planning does not ensure that
adequate and appropriate care will be provided to the animals in the event of an emergency or disaster. The licensee
must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation,
housing, and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster (one which could reasonably be anticipated
and expected to be detrimental to the good health and well-being of the animals in their possession).

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class C license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by April 2, 2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
