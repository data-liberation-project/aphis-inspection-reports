2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult female Fennec fox, Foxy, has hair loss with red and inflamed skin on the knuckles of all four feet. This
animal was cited for this problem on previous inspection reports. There is also a large patch of hair loss on the right
flank. A facility representative stated that this hair loss was self-induced and Foxy has been scratching and biting at
this area. The most recent veterinary exam occurred on April 20, 2018. Despite the licensees following the current
treatment plan described by the attending veterinarian, Foxy's condition is not improving and is progressively getting
worse. This animal has yet to be seen by a veterinarian that has knowledge with this specie.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian that can give an accurate diagnosis and an appropriate treatment plan for the problem cited above. The
licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care. The program for
providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***An enclosure that housed seventeen sheep had approximately three areas where the fencing was in disrepair.
There were gaps in the metal fencing that were large enough for the animals’ horns, head, or limbs to become
stuck. In addition to these gaps, the metal fence was broken, exposing sharp metal points which were protruding
into the enclosure.
***An enclosure housing one Dromedary camel, “Coco,” had fencing in disrepair. The bottom of the chain linked
fence on one side was broken and mangled, which was exposing sharp metal points that were facing into the
enclosure where "Coco" could come into contact with it.
***An enclosure that housed another Dromedary camel also had fencing that was in disrepair. The top and base of
the fence was damaged, creating sharp points that pointed upward and outward into the enclosure where the camelcould come into contact with it.
***In an enclosure housing eleven sheep, a portion of the metal fencing material, along the bottom, was bowing out
of the base of the pen. This has created a gap large enough for the animal's limbs, horns, or head to become stuck
and therefore poses the risk of injury to animals in the enclosure.
***In an enclosure housing seven goats a portion of the wire fencing was in disrepair. The lower edges of the metal
fence was bent upward with sharp points protruding toward the animals that could cause injuries.
***The enclosure housing eleven goats in the barn had rust along the lower parts of the metal walls, which extended
up the wall at least 10 inches in height in some areas. The rusted metal exposed many areas of jagged, splintered
pieces of wood underneath. In the areas where the metal was rusted through, sharp metal edges were created and
pointed into the enclosure.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, holes, and gaps/openings in
order to protect the animals from injury. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to
ensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or escape.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***In the barn housing eleven goats, an accumulation of cobwebs was present in the corners of the enclosure and
on the feeders. Cobwebs can be areas for harboring pests which can affect the health of the regulated animals and
may be an indication of substandard husbandry practices.
Animal enclosures must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate good
husbandry practices. A regular program of housekeeping in and around all animal enclosures needs to be
implemented and maintained.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
