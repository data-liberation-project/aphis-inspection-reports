ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is in place, however the most current PVC form signed by the Attending
Veterinarian could not be located during inspection. A formal agreement signed by the Attending Veterinarian with
animal care/husbandry instructions is required to be available for inspection to document that animals are properly
cared for. Obtain and maintain an updated PVC signed by the Attending Veterinarian that reflects appropriate
veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits (at least once year).
