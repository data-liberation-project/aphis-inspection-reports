3.81(a)(3) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of inspection, a gibbon was still housed by itself with no access to other non human primates for
interaction. Non human primates are encouraged to be housed in social groups to promote the psychological
well-being of the primate. The gibbon must be housed with a compatible non human primate that does not prevent
access to food, water or shelter and not hazardous to the health and well being of each other. The compatibility of
the non human primates must be determined in accordance with generally accepted professional practices and
observations under the guidance of the attending veterinarian. While the attending veterinarian has attempted to
write a letter of exemption, the letter is not dated and the letter states that the animal can not be compatibly housed
with smaller primates. The letter does not state that the animal can not be compatibility housed with other gibbons.
