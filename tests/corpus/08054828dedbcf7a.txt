2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** A white female Maltese, micro-chip #482A454034. Had a brown build up of tarter encasing the teeth. This can be
a sign of dental disease which can be painful and contribute to health problems. The dog must be evaluated by a
veterinarian to determine if treatment is needed. The dog also had matted hair under/around the eyes, the matting
can irritate the eyes and can contribute to eye problems. The owner must remove the mats and maintain the hair
coat in a healthy manner.
The attending veterinarian and licensee established a dental maintenance protocol for the kennel dogs on
November 5, 2015. The protocol states that the licensee will bring in 1-2 adult dogs needing dental cleaning once
per month. The licensee did not bring in dogs for dental cleaning in January and February 2016. The licensee must
follow the instruction of the attending veterinarian and follow the dental maintenance protocol to ensure that the
animals are receiving proper veterinary care and to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.
All dealers must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
3.6(a)(1)

enclosures to bow and be unstable. The bowing unstable partitions may create gaps between the building and

building to ensure that the enclosures are stable, in good repair and protects the animals from possible injury. To be
corrected by: 04-16-16.
