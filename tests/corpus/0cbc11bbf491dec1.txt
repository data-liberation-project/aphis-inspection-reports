3.4(b)(4) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
All the igloo type shelter structures being used by 57 dogs in the outdoor housing area contain very little or no
bedding material. The inspector recorded a temperature of 41 degrees F at the time of inspection. According to the
National Weather Service, the low temperature last night was 14 degrees F. Lack of sufficient bedding in cold
environments increases the risks of sickness and hypothermia situations. Clean, dry bedding material is important
to provide added protection from the effects of temperatures less than 50 degrees F. More bedding material is
necessary when the temperature is less than 35 F degrees for the dogs to burrow into and remain clean and dry
and have better protection from the cold. The licensee must provide and maintain bedding material.

WATERING.
There were numerous plastic water buckets in the outdoor enclosures that were full of a hard frozen block of ice.
Most of the blocks of ice had depressions like the dogs had been licking at it for their source of drinking water. The
owner stated that the dogs were given fresh water 2 times daily, however, the water was still a frozen hard block
and the temperature had been above freezing for several hours. Some blocks had melted sufficiently to provide
water to lap up instead of ice to lick. If potable water is not continually available to the dogs, it must be offered to
the dogs as often as necessary to ensure their health and well-being, but not less than twice a day for at least one
hour each time. Although the dogs are receiving water twice daily, the licensee must provide the dogs with enough
water to meet their needs in order to support their health and well-being.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the whelping facility two of the primary enclosures housing adult dogs with nursing puppies were excessively
dirty. The floors of each enclosure has an accumulation of damp shredded and matted newspaper mixed with urine
and fecal waste. All absorbent bedding must be cleaned with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals freedom toavoid contact with excreta. In the outdoor run portion of the whelping facility, 4 enclosures housing 4 adult female
dogs, including 2 with litters, has excreta and dried fecal residue on 70 to 80 percent of available surface flooring.
One outdoor enclosure has a mound of feces at least 10” high in the middle of the outdoor enclosure. Licensee
stated the enclosures had not been cleaned within the last three days. Unsanitary living conditions exist that could
lead to potential contamination or disease risks. The potential for soiling or caking of the hair coat exists when the
dogs walk or rest in the affected area. The licensee must provide for the regular and frequent removal and disposal
of all animal waste or residue in a timely manner.
