CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The wash machine used for the dog and cat laundry is extremely rusted. All equipment used for the care of dogs
and cats must be kept in good repair to facilitate husbandry practices required by USDA regulations. This machine
cannot adequately clean and disinfect laundry without the possibility of re-contamination with rust particles.
The old wash machine needs to be replaced.
