HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Room Q6 in Building 2 was in use for animal housing during this inspection. The concrete floor in the room had a
large, circular shaped epoxy patch. A depressed area of bare concrete was exposed where the patch had failed
and peeled away. Water could pool and collect in the damaged floor area during routine husbandry procedures.
Standing water can serve as a reservoir for microbial growth, contribute to excessive humidity levels and inhibit the
benefits of cleaning in the animal housing room. Additionally, bacteria and water may degrade unsealed concrete.
Facility personnel stated that the floor had been recently repaired. Alternative repair solutions may need to be
reviewed.
*A slightly gaping, linear defect was noted in the ceiling of animal housing Room Q14 in Building 2. The defect was
visible across almost the entire width of the ceiling and penetrated the dry wall and paint. Although no water stains
were seen in the ceiling, the area surrounding the defect appeared moist and prolonged rainfall has recently
occurred in the area. Continued deterioration may cause the dry wall ceiling to collapse into the room. Facility
personnel indicated the exterior roof will be checked for possible leaks immediately.
All animal housing facilities must be structurally sound and kept in good repair to prevent injury to the animals and
facilitate required husbandry procedures. The above identified non-compliances should be repaired or replaced.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Room Q3 in Building 2 was housing animals during this inspection. Numerous drain flies were noted on the back
wall and in the corner of the walls at the ceiling junction on the left side. An abundance of flies were also noted in
the uncovered drain on the left side of the room as well as the wall above the drain.
Insects may carry and transmit diseases and cause annoyance to the animals. The flies should be eliminated from
this room and the current pest control program reviewed to ensure effectiveness so as to promote the health and
well-being of the animals and reduce any potential for contamination by pests in animal areas.Correct by: April 13, 2017.
