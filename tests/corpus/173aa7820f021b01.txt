ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- The following medication was past the labeled expiration date: panacur (cid:19) Feb. 2014. This medication was
intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. Expired
drugs may not work as anticipated, could become contaminated, and could harm the animals. Medications must be
labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure that the contents of the container can be known
with certainty, that the drugs are used at safe doses, and that medications are not used past their expiration dates.
The licensee must ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, labeled properly in accordance
with standard veterinary practices, and are stored in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations.
Corrected during the inspection.

3.80(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- - In the indoor portion of the medical building housing non-human primates there are two large, elevated, wooden
resting platforms in poor condition. The wood on these platforms is chipped, splintered, chewed and in need of
repair. Wood platforms in this condition are a potential source of injury to the enclosed animals and cannot be
properly cleaned and sanitized. The facility must repair or replace these surfaces to help ensure the health of the
animals.
3.84(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- - A live mouse was observed the on floor in the outdoor portion of the enclosures of the ring-tailed lemurs in the
non-human primate building. A partially eaten mouse was observed in the outdoor portion of a capuchin(cid:25)s enclosure
in the medical building housing non-human primates. There is no pest contract present for the facility at the time of
the inspection according to the facility representative. The facility representative states that he puts bait out
weekly. Mice carry diseases and may cause illness to the enclosed animals. They can also contaminate food, water
and living areas. The licensee must have a more effective program to control pests in the buildings and outdoor
portions of enclosures and must ensure proper pest control throughout the facility.3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- - In the rear of the park, an enclosure containing 7 white tail deer has large cinder blocks and broken brick present
along the fence and by the water receptacle. These cinder blocks have large open holes that create a possible limb
injury threat to the enclosed animals. Licensee needs to remove the bricks or replace dirt on top of the bricks to
ensure the animals are safely contained and protected from potential injury.
- In a pen (cage 87) in the rear of the park containing tigers there is an area in the fence between cages that has
broken welds. This broken weld area is approximately 3 feet in length allowing animals to potentially move between
enclosures. Facilities need to be maintained in good repair. Licensee must repair or replace this broken section of
fence to ensure the animals are safely contained and protected from potential injury. This was repaired during the
inspection.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- Portions of the perimeter fence do not meet requirements. In the back section of the park numerous trees are
growing in, thru and over the perimeter fence which can affect the structural integrity of the fence. The perimeter
fence for a facility housing dangerous animals must be structurally sound and in good repair. The licensee must
ensure the perimeter fence meets all requirements.
