3.131(c)

Sanitation.
There are several inches of hay and bedding material in the alley way between the sheep pens and around the food
storage area. A large number of empty feed bags are also piled in the corner of the food storage area making it difficult to
observe the floor.
Failure to clean animal facilities regularly can adversely affect the health of the sheep and can potentially attract pests.
The facility must maintain the premise by keeping it clean and by placing trash in designated areas and cleared as
necessary in order to protect the health of the animals and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices.
