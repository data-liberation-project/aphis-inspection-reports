A sheep at the Big Apple location was very lame on its right rear leg. The animal was observed to be limping
significantly as it moved around its enclosure. This situation is causing the animal significant pain and must be
treated. No one at the facility had noticed that the sheep was lame. Daily observation of all animals must be
conducted and potential health issues need to be reported to the attending veterinarian. Failure to observe these
health issues in a timely manner can lead to unnecessary pain and suffering for the animals. Observe all animals
daily for abnormal conditions. Report potential health issues to the attending veterinarian.
Exit interview conducted with the facility president and APHIS representative Kurt Hammel.
