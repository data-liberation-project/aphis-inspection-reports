SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Two adult bears are being rotated every other day with three younger bears into the larger enclosure with boulders
and soaking pools. The concrete dens the two adult bears are kept in on their off exhibit days measure
approximately 10 feet by 10 feet by 5 to 6 feet high. This height does not allow the bears to make the normal
postural adjustment of being able to stand on their hind legs. Plans had been made to raise the height of the den
enclosures and some of the materials were nearby, but this was not done. During the inspection, the caretaker
called and found a builder to work on the dens. To be corrected by 4-21-17.

SANITATION.
Each of the three cougar enclosures, each with one cougar, has an excessive amount of feces in them. In one
enclosure there were over 7 piles of mulch covered up feces, and large amounts of chalky white feces. The other
two enclosures also had large amounts of feces. Excess feces can lead to pests, disease hazards and
contamination of the animal. The caretaker stated they are on a weekly cleaning rotation, but then found out the
caretakers have sometimes had a difficult time shifting the middle cougar which prevented them access to all of the
enclosures. Plans are being made for different accesses and alternate shift possibilities for the one cougar. All
animal enclosures need to be cleaned often enough to prevent accumulations of feces which can contaminate
animals and attract pests. These enclosures were cleaned during this inspection. To remain corrected from this
day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Assistant Director and the caretakers.
Eland incident is under review.
