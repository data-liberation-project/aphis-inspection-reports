SEPARATION.
On the previous day the facility received 4 male Yorkshire pigs, all were three months old, and all were reported to
be in good health. They were transported together and were group housed together by the facility. This morning one
pig with ear tag #6935 was found to have fresh scratches around the upper back, neck, head, and both ears. The
majority of the injuries were on the left ear where the skin was red in color, inflamed, and blood was present. The
attending veterinarian was notified about these injuries in the morning before the inspection and began applying
neo-predef topical ointment to the wounds.
Animals that are housed in the same primary enclosure with other incompatible animals are at risk for injury and
stress from fighting. In some cases more dominant animals will limit access of the incompatible animals in the
enclosure to necessary resources such as food, water, etc. All animal housing systems should attempt to minimize
aggression and competition especially at mixing. The facility must ensure that animals housed in the same primary
enclosure are compatible.
After the inspection, the facility was in the process of moving the injured pig to a separate enclosure, addressing the
issue cited above.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
