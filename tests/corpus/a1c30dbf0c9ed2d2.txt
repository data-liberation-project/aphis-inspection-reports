2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The acquisition information for 7 zebus, 1 zebra and 1 capuchin were not documented. Without records which fully
disclose the animal’s acquisition information, legal and medical information traceback is not possible. Make, keep and
maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the required information for acquisition and disposition of
animals. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her
control. To be corrected by March 21, 2022.
3.78(d)

Outdoor housing facilities.
The facility currently houses 2 capuchins in outdoor housing. The perimeter fence surrounding the primary enclosure is 5
feet tall on 3 sides and 4 feet in the back therefore not meeting the 6 feet requirement for non-human primates. A
perimeter fence of sufficient height is important to protect non-human primates by restricting the access of unauthorized
humans and animals. The facility must ensure that capuchins being housed outdoors are enclosed by a 6-foot perimeter
fence at least 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosures. To be corrected by April 7, 2022.
3.84(b)(3)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


The facility cleans the capuchins’ water and food bowls daily with dawn dish detergent but does not sanitize the
containers at least once every 2 weeks. When food and water containers are not sanitized adequately, there is a higher
risk of large numbers of harmful germs remaining on the surfaces which creates a health hazard for the non-human
primates. Food and water receptacles for non-human primates shall be sanitized by washing them with hot water (180
°F.) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution
followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam under pressure. Correct by
March 31, 2022.
