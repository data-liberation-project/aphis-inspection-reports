3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
In the outdoor enclosures there is an enclosure containing 4 medium size adult dogs and only 2 plastic shelters. The
shelters do not provide sufficient space for 2 dogs to sit, stand, lay down and turn around freely. More shelter space must
be provided.

There are 4 enclosures that do not provide enough shaded areas for each of the dogs in the enclosure. One enclosure
contains 4 adult dogs, 1 contains 3 dogs, 1 contains 2 dogs and 1 contains 1 dog. It is necessary to provide one or more
separate outside areas of shade, large enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect them from the direct
rays of the sun. The applicant must provide more shade and maintain at all times.
3.4(b)(3)

Outdoor housing facilities.
In the outdoor enclosures one of the shelters does not have a wind break and rain break at the entrance. The wind break
and rain break is important to keep wind and rain out of the shelter to provide better shelter for the dogs. Shelters in
outdoor facilities for dogs must contain a roof, four sides, and a floor, and must be provided with a wind break and rain
break at the entrance and must be maintained at all times.
