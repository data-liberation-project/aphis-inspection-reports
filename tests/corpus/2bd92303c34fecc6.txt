ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two juvenile Syrian brown bears are in an enclosure that will not accommodate their needs as adults. The
enclosure is constructed of welded wire panels and wood. These wire panels will not be strong enough to contain
the animals as adults. There are no lock outs to ensure safe servicing of the enclosure. The enclosure is not clean.
It contains excess fecal material and the bedding is all wet. The entire enclosure has no dry areas for the bears to
lie in. A new enclosure that can safely house these animals as adults must be constructed. An inadequate housing
facilities leads to multiple problems including: poor sanitation, improper shelter from elements, failure to contain the
animals and inadequate veterinary care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Since the time of the last inspection two animals were euthanized at the facility. An Artic fox and a skunk were
examined by the attending veterinarian and euthanasia was recommended. The CEO of the facility picked up some
type of injection from the attending veterinarian that he then administered in the muscle of both animals to euthanize
them. The Program of Veterinary care clearly states euthanasia will be administered by the veterinarian and that it
is to be injected either intravenously or intraperitoneally. Improper euthanasia technique can result in prolonged
animal suffering and undue distress. This is a very serious issue which must be corrected immediately. Consult
with the attending veterinarian to decide and document who is authorized to conduct euthanasia. If the CEO is
authorized, document which species and technique. Training is required to ensure that improper technique is not
used again by the CEO. Documentation of training must be kept for review by APHIS officials.
Red berries were noted growing inside the black bear enclosure. This same type of vine was identified on a
previous inspection growing next to the white tiger water receptacle with berries floating in the water. The CEO of
the facility has no idea what type of berries these are. These berries may be toxic for all anyone at the facility
knows. This vine should be removed or the berries identified as harmless. Remove these vines to prevent possible
harm to the animals by toxin ingestion.3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The resting shelf in the Japanese Macaque enclosure contains more than a daily accumulation of feces. Areas that
this animal comes in contact with must be spot cleaned daily. Clean this enclosure daily to minimize disease and
odor problems that can be caused by excessive fecal material present in the enclosure.

WATERING.
The water receptacle in the Japanese macaque enclosure has a layer of grime lining its interior. The water
receptacles in each of the baboon enclosures have a layer of scum and slime lining their interiors. Debris is present
in these water receptacles as well. The crab eating macaque's water receptacle is full of leaves and debris. Water
receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to keep them free from contamination but at least
every two weeks. These water receptacles have only been power sprayed and bleached. Detergent followed by
bleach or a combination cleaning and disinfecting product must be used. Unclean water receptacles can affect
water palatability and lead to decreased water consumption. This can have an adverse effect on the health of the
animals in these enclosures. Contaminated water can also lead to other potential health issues for these animals
such as bacterial or parasitic infection. Clean these water receptacles as often as needed to keep the water in the
receptacles clean and sanitary.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The produce cooler contains spoiled produce. Deteriorating and liquefying boxes, bags and heads of lettuce were
present in the cooler. A case of molding peppers was in the cooler. Cauliflower heads with dark black spots were
in the cooler. Molding tomatoes were oozing juice onto softening apples in the case in which they were stored.
Pears were discolored and deteriorating. Spoiled produce must be removed promptly to prevent contamination of
food intended to be fed to the animals. Sort and remove spoiled produce promptly. This cooler needs to be
cleaned and have spoiled and deteriorating items removed in order to prevent contamination of food items that will
be fed to the animals. Although the CEO of the facility has stated that produce is sorted before feeding, the rotting
condition of the produce just fed the night before to the American black bears would indicate that this is not always
the case.
3.125(d) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
An open dumpster is located about 15 to 20 feet away from the butcher area used to process meat. It is overflowed
with boxes, buckets and various debris. Empty boxes and containers are stacked next to the butcher area. A wheel
barrow of fecal material and bones was stored in the alleyway to the leopard row big cat enclosures. Food and
fecal waste needs to be removed promptly in order to minimize odors, vermin infestation and disease hazards.
Remove this and all other waste materials in a prompt manner. The dumpster must be emptied more frequently as
its current overflowing condition creates odor, disease and vermin infestation hazards.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The entire Syrian brown bear enclosure contains wet dirty bedding. These animals must have access to dry area to
prevent needless discomfort and suffering. Ensure that these animals have access to dry resting area.

3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food receptacle boxes for the enclosure housing two American black bears and the enclosure housing two
Asian black bears contained a large amount of rotting food debris. In the case of the American black bear
enclosure, the CEO stated that the animals had just been fed the night before. Two pieces of fruit located near the
top of the receptacle were brown, shriveled and discolored. This fruit must have been bad at the time it was fed to
the bears. The grizzly bear feed area contained rotting food debris. Any food fed in these areas is going to be
contaminated by the rotting material present. These feeders need to be cleaned and made sanitary to ensure that
the food fed to the bears is wholesome and free from bacterial or pest infestation which could result in health issues
for the bears. In fact, liquid diarrhea was present in both the American black bear enclosure and grizzly bear
enclosure. This diarrhea could have resulted from the rotten food debris that these animals are consuming. If this
diarrhea persists its cause requires investigation and veterinary consultation.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacles for the enclosures containing the tigers Lily and Hank have a layer of algae scum on their
interiors indicating that they are not being cleaned adequately. The enclosure containing the Syrian brown bears
has no water in the receptacle. The only source of water for the enclosure is a muddy pool of water. The water
receptacle for the enclosure housing two bobcats has a layer of algae slime on its interior indicating that it is not
being cleaned adequately. Unclean water receptacles can affect water palatability and lead to decreased waterconsumption. This can have an adverse effect on the health of the animals in these enclosures. Contaminated
water can also lead to other potential health issues for these animals such as bacterial or parasitic infection. Clean
these water receptacles as often as needed to keep the water in the receptacles clean and sanitary.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was excessive feces in the enclosures for the tiger Kahn and the tiger Sundar. The den areas for the tigers
Pandora and JJ contained excessive bones and food waste. The tigers Lenny and Squigy had excessive food
waste in their den. The white tiger enclosure had excessive food waste and fecal material turning white which
indicated to me that it had been present for some time. The white tiger den contained excessive food waste. The
Asian black bear enclosure and the American black bear enclosure contained excessive rotting food waste. The
Asian black bear enclosure contained excessive fecal material. The grizzly bear enclosure contained excessive
rotting food waste. The cougar enclosure contained rotting food waste in the den area. A strong odor of ammonia
and decay emanated from this area. The enclosure housing two Syrian brown bears contained excessive feces.
The coyote enclosure contained excessive fecal material. There was excessive food waste in the enclosures
housing one gray colored fox, one red colored fox and the fox housed in the warm room. The enclosure containing
one alpaca and the enclosure containing 4 alpacas had excessive fecal material in them. These enclosures need to
be cleaned on a more frequent basis. This rotting material and feces can lead to pest control issues. The rotting
material present in these animals'(cid:25) enclosures and shelter boxes can contaminate these animals as they lay in their
enclosures. The animals can ingest this material when they groom themselves. Not removing old food waste
promptly can lead to contamination of new food. Ingesting this rotten material can lead to potential health problems.
Clean these enclosures more frequently to prevent a buildup of food and fecal waste to minimize odors and prevent
potential health problems.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The majority of the premise is filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash, buckets, tires and fence.
Several other buildings on the property are also filled with old equipment and debris and trash. Tall weeds are
located throughout the facility. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests and numerous
rodent holes were located throughout the facility. All this material must be removed to help control pests.
The sink in the butcher area is dirty and filled with dirty utensils and cleaning supplies. The chain saw used for
butchering is covered in meat and bone material from food processing. These things must be cleaned in order to
ensure that processed meat does not become contaminated. Contaminated meat fed to the animals can makethem ill and lead to unnecessary suffering.
The sink in the warm room area, the window above the sink and the area under the sink is very dirty. The condition
of this area makes it impossible to keep food items clean as they are processed for the animals. These areas need
to be cleaned to ensure food processed for animals is not contaminated.
The pools located in the grizzly bear, Asian black bear, American black bear and bobcat enclosures are very dirty.
They contain large amounts of green water and algae. These pools must be drained and cleaned. Stagnate water
in these pools can become breeding grounds for mosquitos which are vectors for several diseases which can make
the animals ill.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Rodent holes were located both inside and outside the
cougar enclosure and the den for this enclosure. Rodent holes were noted in a vacant enclosure located on leopard
row. Rodent holes were located going under the shelter box of the American black bear enclosure. Multiple rodent
holes were located in the goose enclosure which is located very near the alpaca enclosure. Several other rodent
holes were located near and around the white tiger enclosure and inside the white tiger den. The CEO for the
facility remarked that the rats were really bad the end of July when they cut the surrounding fields. Rodents can be
carriers of disease which may be harmful to the animals housed in these areas. A more effective means of rodent
control must be established for the facility.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of properly trained employees can
result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Animal numbers must be reduced
or more properly trained workers need to be added. A facility schedule needs to be developed that allows for
adequate employee coverage in order to address all animal husbandry needs. For the most part, the facility CEO is
the only one authorized to work with the dangerous animals at the facility as the other authorized party has very
limited availability. All animal work must be done with the dangerous animals under his direct supervision. This
limits the amount of time that is available to service the dangerous animal enclosures as the facility CEO is often
offsite. This leads to poor sanitation in the dangerous animal enclosures. The facility CEO needs to find a way to
be onsite more or hire trained staff to help run the facility.
An exit interview was conducted at the conclusion of the inspection with the facility CEO. AC personnel present
were Kurt Hammel and Carrie Bongard. A formal exit interview was conducted with the facility CEO and KurtHammel on 10-8-15.
