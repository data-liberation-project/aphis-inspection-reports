FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The 5 goats have been pushing on the 2 X 4 wire fence for the enclosure on the roof and it is bowing out in places.
One middle post has been pushed loose and it and the bowed fence are sticking out from the roof edge. This post
and fence need to be secured and something done to keep the fence from being further damaged by the goats.
The 2 X 4 ground wire is exposed in a couple of spots on the roof. This fencing needs to be covered over and kept
covered to prevent potential injury.
A pyramidal tall weather vane was bolted to the roof inside the goat enclosure, but was unbolted and laid down
during strong winds. This structure needs to be bolted back in place or removed to prevent climbing injuries to the
goats.
The old rusted antique truck was moved in the ground enclosure and the protective fence to keep the goats off of
the rusting parts was removed. The rusted out parts of the truck are a climbing hazard to the goats, especially the
interior floor where the seat is gone, and the front half of the truck. The front window is also cracked and in danger
of further breaking. Because the goats can climb on this truck, the rusted jagged edge holes need to be replaced,
repaired, or removed to prevent potential injury to the goats.
To be corrected by 3-21-14.

SANITATION.
There are numerous piles of feces in the ground enclosure, and the roof goat enclosures do not appear to be
cleaned on a regular basis, especially around the fence edges. The two pigs are sleeping on an old pile of very
dusty hay with old feces in it. The old dusty used hay the pigs are using for bedding needs to be removed and
replaced. Cleaning needs to be done on a regular basis to prevent disease hazards and prevent contamination of
the animals. To be corrected by 3-8-14.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
