3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures.
The enclosure housing five guinea pigs contained an excessive accumulation of 1-2 inches of compacted excreta
covering the entire floor area underneath the thin top layer of fresh hay. The licensee acknowledged that the
enclosure is not being sanitized at least once every two weeks. Inadequate cleaning and sanitation practices could
increase disease hazards, pests, odors and soiling of the animals. Clean and disinfect enclosure and maintain on a
more regular basis to include not less than a sanitation schedule of once every two weeks.
