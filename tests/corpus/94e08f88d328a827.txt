Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:32 AM on
15DEC2022. After knocking on the door a few times with no answer, the licensee was contacted via the phone number
listed on her account. I spoke to the licensee and she informed me she would not be able to be present for an inspection
today due to her work schedule. She proceeded to inform me of her optimal hours.
