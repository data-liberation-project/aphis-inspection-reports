2.31(c)(7) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 15-001 approved for 10 swine describes a non-survival surgery involving the spleen. Surgery records for
the 5 swine (B3465, B3466, B3467, B3468, & G4474) assigned to protocol 15-001 were reviewed during this
inspection and all 5 swine had non-survival surgery performed that did not involve the spleen. These 5 swine had
non-survival surgeries performed as described in protocol 13-035 by the same principal investigator. Protocol
13-035 had been approved for 11 swine and the principal investigator had already used 11 swine. The facility
IACUC did not approve an increase in the number of animals for protocol 13-035 and did not approve procedures
other than splenic for protocol 15-001. The principal investigator, therefore, did not follow his protocol 15-001 for
the 5 swine used. The facility IACUC must review and approve all proposed protocols and significant changes to
ensure that the proposed activities comply with the Animal Welfare regulations. Correct by ensuring that all future
activities are done in accordance with the IACUC approved protocol and all significant changes to the ongoing use
of animals are reviewed by the IACUC.
Protocol 13-009 directs that Buprenorphine be administered four to six hours after survival surgery to collect
bone marrow. Surgery and follow-up records for 11 sheep were reviewed during this inspection and none of the
sheep records indicated that they received the post-operative pain medication as directed by the protocol. Two of
the animals (5160, 5165) were noted to have swelling at the surgery site and associated mild lameness the day
after surgery. Two others (B3751, G4176) were noted to have mild lameness the day after surgery. This lameness,
in all four animals, was identified by Veterinary personnel and treated. The sheep responded to analgesic
administration but the lameness might have been prevented by earlier Buprenorphine administration as outlined in
the protocol. These 4 sheep had lameness that could indicate discomfort or pain. Pain relief as approved in the
protocol must be followed to assure that the animals are not living with discomfort or pain that could have been
controlled or minimized. Correct by assuring pain relief is administered as directed in the IACUC approved protocol.
An exit interview was conducted with facility Vice President; Dr. Mary Geib, VMO; and Dr. David Oelberg, VMO.Additional Inspectors
