HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are three outdoor enclosures, containing four adult St. Bernards, whose flooring is constructed of concrete.
The concrete flooring in all three enclosures has cracked and broken. The cracked and broken concrete creates
conditions which cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized and promotes the harboring of bacteria, parasites and
other pathogens. The surfaces must be replaced, repaired or altered in a manner that allows for cleaning and
sanitization to occur. Licensee must ensure that all surfaces remain in good repair and can be readily cleaned and
sanitized.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the small dog building the outdoor portion of the enclosures has flooring constructed of coated wire. There are at
least two enclosures, containing six dogs, whose wire flooring has broken, resulting in sharp points protruding into
the enclosure. In the same building there are at least three enclosures, containing fifteen dogs, whose sections of
wire flooring are no longer attached to each other and has resulted in gaps in the flooring when the dogs walk on it.
Sharp points in the flooring could result in injuries to the dogs and gaps in the floor could allow the dogs' legs and
feet to pass through.
All enclosures must have floors constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury and do not
allow the dogs' feet and legs to pass through any openings. The broken and loose flooring must be replaced,
repaired or altered in a manner that will not cause injury to the dogs or allow their feet and legs to pass through.
The licensee must ensure that all enclosures remain safe for all dogs.
