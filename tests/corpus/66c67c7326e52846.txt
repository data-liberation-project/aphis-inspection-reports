3.53(a)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Several enclosures had broken wire on the bottom that left sharp points and rusty wire exposed. One enclosure
had a gap large enough that the young bunnies could escape through it. The licensee moved the young rabbits to
another enclosure to correct the possibility of escape. The remaining enclosures with holes in the wire need to be
repaired or replaced so that they are structurally sound and then maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits
from injury, to contain them, and to keep predators out.

WATERING.
Several of the water bowls have a buildup of algae and are excessively dirty. Two of the water bowls were empty.
These need to be cleaned, sanitized and refilled.
