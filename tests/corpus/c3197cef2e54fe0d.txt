PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At the time of this inspection it was noted that 2 dogs were too large for the crates that they were being transported
in.
One dog (Maria Bell) measured to be 30 inches tall x 19 inches long. The crate she was in measured 24 inches tall
x 17 inches long.
One dog (Benzi) measured to be 26 inches tall x 15 inches long. The crate he was in measured 24 inches tall x 17
inches long.
It is obvious that these crates were too small to allow for the dogs to be able to stand up, turn around, and make
normal postural movements. More care will need to be taken to ensure that all the dogs / puppies being transported
are in crates that have sufficient space.

PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
While conducting this inspection it was noted that there were two roof panels that had begun to detach from the
ceiling. The white, panel boards were detaching and bowing downward. There were small gaps present between
the boards and the roof. To ensure that the entire trailer can be properly cleaned and sanitized, and that the panels
will not completely dislodge and fall on the animals crates, these panels will need to be repaired.
3.17(a)
CARE IN TRANSIT.
In speaking with the owner I was informed that they do stop and check on the animals. However, there was no way
to verify that this was happening. Nor could it be verified that they were checking on the animals at least every 4
hours. To ensure that the temperature is within the acceptable range and that the animals are not in any physical
distress a mechanism will need to be in place to ensure that all the animals are observed at least every 4 hours.This inspection was conducted in a Park and Ride parking lot on RT 395 / exit 90 in Putnam, CT.
An exit interview was conducted with the registrant.
