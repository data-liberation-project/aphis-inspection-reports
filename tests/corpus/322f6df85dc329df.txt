Housing facilities, general.
Open bags of bedding (shavings) were noted being stored on the floor of multiple primate housing areas adjacent to one
or two unopened bags. The keepers were not in the process of cleaning the enclosures during the time of the inspection.
Open bags of bedding may become contaminated during housekeeping practices or by pests getting into the bags.
All open bedding supplies must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The facility needs to establish and maintain an effective program for control of insect pests. Small black ants were noted
crawling in the food receptacles of the tamarins and one of the lemur enclosures (these receptacles had food remaining
from the previous feeding).
Insect pests can make the feed unappetizing, contaminate the feed and potentially spread disease causing organisms.
An effective program for control of insects must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being
of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. Correct by 6/30/22.

Facilities, outdoor.


The public walk-thru area of the facility has multiple enclosures housing multiple species. The area is surrounded by a
perimeter fence but along two sides of the walk-thru area (along street and along entrance drive) the fence is not six feet
high as required. The facility in the past has applied for and received a perimeter fence variance for most of the species
housed in this area but since the last variance was issued, additional species have been obtained which are not covered
by the variances in place. These species include caracal, serval and binturong.
A perimeter fence is constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and functioning as a secondary containment system for animals in the facility.
The walk-thru area outdoor housing facilities (not entirely indoors) must be enclosed by a perimeter fence at least 6 feet
high and 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure or fences not meeting these requirements must be approved in
writing by the Administrator/USDA Animal Care. Correct by 10/1/2022.
