2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection two animals were observed to have health issues that had not been conveyed to the Attending
Veterinarian for assessment and possible treatment.
DIRECT
**A pig was noted to be extremely thin and at times, the pig appeared to have trouble ambulating, with the back legs
crossing when it walked. The hair was thinning along its back. The facility representative had observed these
signs of health issues stating this pig exhibited this condition each spring. However the Attending Veterinarian had
not been contacted for assessment and possible treatment for the pig. The behavior, thinness and hair loss this pig
is
exhibiting indicate severe health issues that may require treatment.
INDIRECT
**One hedgehog was missing spines on its back. The condition was observed on 3/23/16. However, at the time of
inspection, the Attending Veterinarian had not been contacted for assessment and possible treatment for the
hedgehog. Spine loss can indicate an underlying health issues that may require treatment.
Establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include procedures that are implemented for all
animals exhibiting health issues to promptly receive appropriate veterinary care and treatment.
Note: The Attending Veterinarian was consulted regarding these animals prior to the exit briefing.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The animal inventory records were not accurate and up to date. Several entries of animal births, including
but not limited to 4 goats, 1 sheep and 1 llama, were not recorded. There were several dispositions not recorded,
including but not limited to, 1 fox and 1 lemur. The facility failed to maintain accurate and up to date animal records.
This does not allow APHIS Officials to track animals as needed. Update and maintain complete animal records ofacquisition and disposition as required to reflect accurate inventory, acquisition and disposition of all animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following problems with primary enclosures were observed:
**The primary enclosure housing one bobcat had chicken screening with sharp edges protruding within the
enclosure
above the water dish which could cause injury. There is a large cement surrounded hole in the ground created from
the removal of a tree trunk that has sharp areas and could cause injury.
**A hole behind the water pond, potentially large enough where the animals could move from one cage to the other
or
could cause injury, was observed in the fence that separated the primary enclosures containing one bobcat and two
red foxes.
**The primary enclosure containing one silver fox had a gap running along the underside of the fence large enough
where the animal could potentially escape or cause injury.
**A primary enclosure containing four Coatimundi had a post fastener hanging from the top of the enclosure in need
of repair.
**A primary enclosure containing two African Porcupines had sharp points/parts at the base of the front panel within
the enclosure that could cause injury.
**A primary enclosure housing up to 13 goats, 7 sheep and 3 llama had a large hole in the back corner of the fence
panel that could cause injury and is in need of repair.
**Areas of the fencing functioning as part of the primary enclosure for one llama is sagging, has sharp points and
is in need of repair.
Repair the primary enclosures to eliminate holes, sharp points and to restore structural strength to prevent injury
and to contain the animals. Correct by: 12 April 2016

WATERING.
The water receptacles in the primary enclosures for one bobcat and two foxes were observed to be excessively dirty
with mud and waste material. This does not ensure the animals have access to clean water. Unsanitary water can
cause a biological hazard that may cause illness to the animals. Clean and maintain water receptacles as often as
necessary and change the water as often as necessary to provide clean potable water for the animals.

Officer Dr. Debra Sime.
