2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On Aug 14, 2022 the facility reports that an enclosure gate was left unsecured and red foxes got out. They were found in
front of the enclosure area and shifted back into the enclosure the same day. One female fox "Kya" was seen limping
after being returned to the enclosure. The limping was reported to the attending veterinarian and after the recommended
observation period with no improvement, radiographs revealed she had fractured the affected leg. The facility is following
the attending veterinarian's treatment plan and she has been getting better. It is unknown on what she hurt her leg on,
but limping was observed just after the foxes were out and then returned to their enclosure. If the enclosure is not
maintained secured, animals can get out and get injured or injure other animals. Ensure that the enclosure is maintained
closed and secured to prevent further occurrences.

Note: The facility has implemented corrective action by double checking the enclosure gates. Ensure corrective actions
are followed.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
