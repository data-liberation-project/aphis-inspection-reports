2.126(a) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
********On Tuesday, February 25, 2014, at approximately 12:30 PM a call was placed to the first contact number
listed but the number had been disconnected. A call was placed to the alternate number listed and a message was
left with the individual who answered to contact the licensee to inform him the inspector was at the facility to conduct
an animal welfare inspection. Contact was finally made with the licensee after knocking on the door at which time
the licensee indicated "No, no, no, I can't do this today." The licensee was asked "are you refusing to have the
inspection" and he, the licensee, replied "Yes". The licensee indicated he could not let me downstairs because
nothing had changed from before, he had not been able to finish the repairs. I explained this inspection was a
follow-up to the previous report and this would be considered a refusal of inspection. The licensee was told that he
would be getting an inspection report in the mail indicating that an inspection had been attempted and that the
report would reflect that he had refused to have an inspection completed. The licensee indicated that he
understood at which time the inspector said goodbye and left the premises.
