2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) has not been updated in several years. It is not as specific as it needs to be
with regard to details of routine veterinary care, parasite control, capture and restraint, emergency care, and other
required categories. Details for all this information is important when dealing with primates because of the
specialized nature of the animal and the difficulty in finding veterinarians who will handle primates. The PVC must
be updated with complete information.
-The licensee indicated that she did not know when the Attending Veterinarian (AV) had last done a site visit. The
AV must make regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the exhibitor to evaluate the animal's housing and
husbandry.
-The person listed as the AV is not the veterinarian who has been signing off on the PVC for several years. If the
official AV is no longer providing care, a formal arrangement with the new AV must be made and a new PVC
developed. An updated, complete PVC needs to be written and signed by the veterinarian who is going to be
providing the service.
