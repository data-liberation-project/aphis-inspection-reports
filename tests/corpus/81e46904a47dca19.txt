RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
Review of records for auctions held in Sept. 2016 and Nov 2016 reveals multiple consignment forms that are
missing required information including one or more of the following: USDA number of the person selling/consigning
the animal or the driver's license number/state and vehicle plate number/state if not USDA licensed and a complete
description of the animal to include sex, date of birth or approximate age (missing in most non-warm room records)
and color/markings (missing for most animals). The following records are representative examples of missing the
USDA number or driver's license information for consignor:
Consignor 6672 (DMF) consigned fallow and sika deer in Nov auction
Consignor 371 (NF) consigned zebu, watusi and ibex in Nov auction
Consignor 310 (WW) consigned zebu in Nov auction
Consignor 1030 (VM) consigned zebra in Nov auction
Consignor 821 (DO) consigned zebra in Sept auction
Consignor 1422 (RS) consigned zebu and oryx in Sept auction
Consignor 1274 (CW) consigned fallow deer in Sept auction
Consignor 7142 (MK) consigned oryx in Sept auction
Consignor 881 (CL) consigned camel in Sept auction
All required information for each consigned animal needs to be kept and maintained to allow for proper identification
of the animals. The required information must include: the name and address of the person who owned or
consigned the animal, the USDA license number of the person or the vehicle license number and state and driver's
license number and state of the person if not licensed under the AWA, the date of consignment, and a description of
the animal which shall include the species and breed/type, the sex, date of birth/approximate age, color and any
distinctive markings.
