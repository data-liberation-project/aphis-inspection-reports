Sanitation.
There is an excessive accumulation of feces in the two bear enclosures resulting in the majority of the floor being covered
in excreta. According to the representative it had been a long time since these enclosures had been cleaned. Excessive
excreta can contaminate the animals and increase disease hazards. These enclosures must be cleaned on a more
regular basis. Correct by 15 June 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
