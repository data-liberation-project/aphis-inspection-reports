ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The larger arctic fox cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for being thinner than its cage mate, fecal
staining on the fur of its hind quarters, and not having grown in its new winter coat has still not been evaluated by a
veterinarian. While the animal appeared to have a normal body condition and its new winter coat with no fecal
staining during this inspection, slower winter coat development and problems maintaining a normal weight as
described above may be indicative of disease. This arctic fox must be assessed by a veterinarian experienced with
the species and the recommendations followed as soon as possible.
***The bobcat cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for abnormal pacing in its enclosure and for spending
the majority of its time in the rafters has still not been evaluated by a veterinarian. During the inspection the bobcat
was actively moving about in the rafters. No pacing was observed. The bobcat still spends most of its time in the
rafters according to the licensee. Abnormal behavior patterns may be indicative of physical or psychological issues
that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modifications, and must be evaluated by the attending
veterinarian as soon as possible to receive appropriate treatment and management.
***The large brown nosed coatimundi cited as a direct NCI under 2.40(b)(2) on the 1-19-17 inspection report was
not present for this inspection. The small brown nosed coatimundi cited under 2.40(b)(2) on the 1-19-17 inspection
report was also not present for this inspection. Neither animal was evaluated by the attending veterinarian since the
last inspection and the animals are currently housed at an undisclosed location.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The records of animals on hand are incomplete. The owner declined to provide the information on the disposition
of one Patagonian cavy and two brown nosed coatimundi. Records of sales, donations, transfers, and deaths must
be kept. Accurate documentation of the animal inventory ensures that all animals are accounted for and receive
proper care. Records of dispositions must be maintained to ensure animals receive proper care and to facilitate the
regulatory requirements of the Animal Welfare Act.3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***The licensee could not produce a written plan for environmental enhancement. Such plans are necessary to
ensure that non-human primates receive enrichment that is effective and address their species specific and
individual needs. A written environmental enrichment plan helps ensure that the psychological needs of the lemurs
are met. The facility must develop a comprehensive written enrichment plan with the attending veterinarian for the
two lemurs.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The prairie dog enclosure has a mesh floor with approximately 1 inch by 1 inch diamond shaped openings. While
there is straw bedding on part of the flooring. Some areas are bare and the animals’ feet could become entrapped in
the openings. Modifications must be employed to prevent entrapment hazards and foot injuries to the prairie dogs.
***The gate for the goat enclosure is loosely attached on one side with metal clips. The gate must be more
effectively secured for the safety and containment of the animals.
A metal feed trough being stored in the goat enclosure next to the front fence has rusted through the bottom
leaving a hole with jagged edges. The hole is large enough that a goat leg could pass through and get caught. The
trough should be removed from the enclosure to prevent injury to the animals.
***The squirrel cage has sharp points and gaps between the mesh sides and top. The licensee stated that on
occasion he has found wild squirrels sharing the enclosure with the regulated animals. These issues may result in
escape, injury or disease transmission. The squirrel cage must be repaired to prevent escape or access by wild
animals.
***The zebu and highland cow enclosure post securing the gate is leaning outward. The open end of the gate is
secured only with twine. The gate post must be repaired and the gate properly secured for the containment and the
safety of the animals.
***A Jacob’s sheep enclosure containing seven sheep has a gate that is loosely tied to support poles with twine.
This may predispose to entanglement, injury or escape. The enclosure must be more effectively secured for the
safety of the animals.
The tin roof on one of the shelters in the Jacob's sheep enclosure is caved in. The right side of the shelter is
leaning inward and a top support pole is detached. The shelter is not structurally sound and could cause injury to
the animals should it fall over. The shelter must be repaired or removed to prevent injury to the animals.***The bobcat enclosure has two areas of wood that attach to the rafters. The wood has sharp jagged edges. The
bobcat at the time of this inspection was moving about the rafters, including on the platform directly below the wood
with the sharp jagged edges. There was also a piece of wood hanging downward from the rafters that may fall into
the enclosure and injure the bobcat. The pieces of wood must be removed to prevent injury to the animal.
NOTE: The brown nosed coatimundis were not present at the facility at the time of the inspection.
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste Disposal
***The squirrel cage still has an excessive amount of sunflower seed and peanut hulls, and other food wastes in the
bottom of the cage under the leaves that have been placed in the cage. The amount of waste has decrease from
the previous inspection but the food waste is still being left to accumulate in the bottom of the cage.
Excess waste can become an attractant to pests and must be cleaned on a frequent basis. Animal and food wastes
must be removed from cages and disposed of away from animal enclosures. Wastes should be removed and
disposed of in a designated area at a frequency that prevents build-up and in accordance with county and state
laws.
3.127(b) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from Inclement Weather
***The alpaca enclosure has a covered shelter with only one solid wall and a partial wind block on the side opposing
the solid wall. Panels have been placed to provide additional protection from the wind except for one section.
Shelters should be constructed in a manner that provides protection from at least three sides for the weather
condition in this locale. Failure to protect animals from detrimental weather conditions can negatively impact their
health and ability to fight disease. The shelter needs to be modified to provide additional protection from the wind.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of Enclosures
***At the time of the inspection, the 5 Patagonian cavies have access to both sides of the enclosure. There is
moderate amounts of feces within the enclosure and the shelters. Exposure to even moderate amounts of feces,
urine, and soiled bedding may pose a disease hazard to the animals. Enclosures and shelters must be cleaned as
often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals with excreta, to minimize disease hazards, and to
reduce odors.3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Pest Control
Fresh rat holes were observed around the pig enclosure. Rats are known to carry various disease hazards and a
safe and effective pest control program is required for animal health. Implemented pest control measures must be
continued at an appropriate frequency to prevent harborage and recolonization of the rodent population.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses approximately 50 animals and numerous non-regulated species. Based upon the number of
animals and non-complaint items related to cleaning, sanitation, waste disposal, maintenance, and veterinary care
there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the husbandry responsibilities of the facility
on a daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of trained employees to carry out the day to day husbandry
duties and maintenance on the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is needed to ensure that cleaning,
animal observations, maintenance tasks, and pest control duties are performed at professionally acceptable level
for the number of animals housed at the facility.
NOTE: The following animals were no longer at the facility for this inspection: the three rabbits, the two brown nose
coatimundi, and the one Patagonian cavy that had been separated from the group.
The inspection was conducted with the owner on January 31, 2017. The exit interview was conducted with the
owners on February 1, 2017.
