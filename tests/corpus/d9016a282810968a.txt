Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The attending veterinarian diagnosed caseous lymphadenitis (CL) in the goat herd. The attending veterinarian wrote a
protocol for the treatment and management of this disease for the licensee to follow. The attending veterinarian stated
that the licensee is still not following this protocol.

Each exhibitor shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.

The attending veterinarian must be given appropriate authority to oversee all aspects of adequate veterinary care. All
attending veterinarian instructions must be followed to ensure the goats are treated and managed to maintain proper
health and mitigate transfer of the disease to non-infected animals.
2.40(b)(3) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is an intact, male Lamancha goat with hair loss on its back and shoulders. The skin on the Lamancha goat appears
to be dry, and flaky. The condition of this animals has not been reported to the attending veterinarian.


Daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being must be completed. These daily observations of
animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian provided that there is a mechanism of
direct and frequent communication and timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-
being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

At any time daily observations are completed by someone other than the attending veterinarian, problems of animal
health and behavior must be promptly communicated to the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian must be
made aware of any health or behavior problems to provide a diagnosis and treatment plan to prevent disease progression
or discomfort to the animal.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
-The intact, male, Boer goat still has a board that makes up one side of its enclosure that has a very large hole in it. The
hole measures approximately 18" by 18".
-The male Toggenburg, and French Alpine goats that are housed together have broken boards on one wall of their
enclosure.
-The enclosure housing the Angora goats has a structure to hold a shade cloth. One of the center posts is askew.
-The shelter for the male Agora goat has one wall missing exposing screw heads on two structural posts.

The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.


These boards or posts must be replaced, or repaired to prevent the goat from getting a horn, or a foot caught in the hole
and causing injury, having the shade structure fall down, or a screw head causing injury.
3.125(d)

Facilities, general.
There is a very large pile of manure that is overflowing its containment area. This manure is what has been removed from
the pens, but is close proximity to the cow pens, and approximately 20 yards from the main barn. There is liquid coming
from the manure pile and puddling around it. There is a strong odor from the manure pile, and excessive flies in the area.

Provision shall be made for the removal and disposal of animal and food wastes, bedding, dead animals, trash and
debris. Disposal facilities shall be so provided and operated as to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease
hazards.

The manure pile must be removed to prevent contamination of the animals, reduce fly infestation, odors, and disease
hazards.
3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
-The enclosure, including the shelter, for the Holstein cow is damp/wet, and the cow has to stand in damp/wet dirt that
extents well above its hooves. The cow was noted to trip a couple of times during inspection due to the condition of the
substrate.
-The 2 Yucatan pigs do not have a dry area in their primary enclosure. There is a wallow at one end of the enclosure, and
a cement pad at the other end. The cement pad is covered in so much heavy mud that it could not be seen by APHIS
inspectors. There is also mud, and wet straw in the shelter for these pigs.


A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water.

A method must be provided to eliminate excess water from the enclosures to afford the animals access to dry areas
inside their primary enclosures. Excess water can cause foot/hoof disease is a tripping hazard, and can result in overall
discomfort for the animals housed in the enclosure.

To be corrected by August 12, 2021.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
There is a heavy manure pack in the primary enclosures for the pygmy goats, Yucatan pigs, the male sheep and goats
housed on the west side of the male sheep and goat barn, male Angora goat, and the goats in the front yard pasture.

Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

The manure pack from these enclosures must be removed to minimize disease hazards, and to reduce odors.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
There is a large accumulation of wood, and fencing materials on the west side of the barn housing the male goats and
sheep. These materials are partially covered by tall grass and weeds.


Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to
facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated
areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.

This area must be cleaned and kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury, and to ensure proper animal
husbandry practices are met.

To be corrected by August 6, 2021.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
There are excessive flies throughout the facility. The animals were stomping to try to keep the flies off of their legs.
There were several fly strips noted in the barn, but these fly strips were full, and the licensee did not have any new ones
on hand.

A safe and effective program for the control of insects shall be established and maintained.

The current measure of pest control is not effective. Additional measures must be taken to reduce the fly infestation to
reduce disease hazards, and for the comfort of the animals.

To be corrected by August 2, 2021.
