2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the outdoor housing facility, there were four adult Schnauzers identified as #4834330A49, 0A02175515,
0A01766929 and 0A02172171 and one adult Scottish Terrier identified as #0A02215516 that had wads of matted
hair on the chest, back, hips and leg areas. The facility representative stated that grooming had begun at the facility,
yet was not completed. Matted hair can cause pain or discomfort to the animal. In addition, matting can create or
worsen skin infections and can hinder the animal's ability to move or defecate normally. Matted hair does not
provide appropriate insulation for the animals. The owner must remove the matted hair on these dogs and assure
that all animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.
To be corrected by February 26, 2016.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative and Bev Hicks, ACI.
End of report.
