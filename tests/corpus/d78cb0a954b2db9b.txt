ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The elephant's skin was noted to have thickened areas of dead skin present over her forehead and over her back
area during this inspection. The licensee reports he is bathing her daily and is following his routine skin care
regimen as set in place by his attending veterinarian. The presence of excessive accumulations of dead skin does
not provide for the comfort, health and well being of the elephant. The licensee should have this elephant's skin
care regimen and her skin health re-assessed by a veterinarian to evaluate the effectiveness of the current skin
care regimen. Correct by 12/31/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative.
This inspection was conducted near the Cullman Civic Center in Cullman, Alabama.
