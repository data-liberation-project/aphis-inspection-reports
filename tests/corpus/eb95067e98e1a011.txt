***On Thursday, December 28, 2017, between 10:45am and 11:15am, a responsible person was not available to
conduct an inspection. Inspector attempted to contact licensee by (calling cell/home and leaving message,
knocking on door, honking while in driveway). This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct from this day forward.”
