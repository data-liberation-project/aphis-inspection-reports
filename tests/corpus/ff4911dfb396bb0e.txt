HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The food bin in the main kennel area is cracked and in disrepair. Open supplies of food and bedding must be
kept in leak-proof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage. This needs to be
addressed for the health of the dogs and to protect their food supply.

3.2(c)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** There was not enough lighting in the whelping area to see puppies in the whelping boxes. The inspector had to
use a personal flashlight to see the animals during the inspection process. It was an overcast day and the two
windows on the outside wall do not allow enough light to diffuse throughout the room. This needs to be addressed
so the dogs have a light cycle for their health and well being and so that the licensee can see and maintain cleaning
and daily observation of the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** Some of the puppies in the whelping box are leaving the box and going out onto the wire mesh. This mesh is too
big for their little feet and their feet and legs are falling through the wire mesh. This needs to be addressed for the
safety of the puppies and to prevent injury.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.*** The whelping boxes are not being cleaned daily and as a result there was an accumulation of feces in the boxes
and on the carpets. These boxes need to be spot cleaned daily and feces removed. In addition some of the carpets
were overly wet and need to be replaced more frequently.
