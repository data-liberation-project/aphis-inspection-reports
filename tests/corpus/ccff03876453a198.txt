Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There is a greater than a daily accumulation of fecal material in the enclosures, affecting 105 dogs, in the newer sheltered
facility. When questioned the facility representative said it had been 3 or 4 days since the enclosures had been cleaned.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily, and from under primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats contained
in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. The licensee must remove the
excreta from the affected enclosures and ensure that it is removed daily from all enclosures.
