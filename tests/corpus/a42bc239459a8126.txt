Veterinary care for dogs.
The current program of veterinary care (PVC) APHIS form 7002A is not complete. The PVC does not address the
sampling for worms, coccidia, giardia, or heartworm with a schedule approved by the attending veterinarian. The sampling
and schedule must be added to the PVC to ensure adequate veterinary care is provided to dogs. Correct by April 9, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
