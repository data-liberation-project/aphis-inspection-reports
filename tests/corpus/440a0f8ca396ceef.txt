ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 am on
06-FEB-20.
When I arrived at the facility at 11:00 am, no one answered the door when I rang the doorbell. I called the facility
representative at 11:00 am and left a message. At 11:15 am I received a text message back that read “Who is this?”
I texted her at 11:15 am, 11:20 am and again at 11:30 am, but I never received a response. I left my business card
in the front door frame and left the area at 11:30 am.
