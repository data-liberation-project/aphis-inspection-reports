2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility arranged for transport of two 3-week old bobcats to an Oregon facility via airlines. The health certificate
for this transport was signed by the facilities veterinarian on May 19, 2016 and listed the animals as 3 weeks old.
The transport occurred on May 20, 2016. The licensee stated that the animal were 4 weeks old and their birth date
was April 20, 2016 but there is no other documentation available to corroborate that information. Based on the
health certificate signed by the veterinarian, these animals were 3 weeks old at the time of transport.
It has been determined that transporting neonatal (<4 weeks old) nondomestic cats is not consistent with safe
handling and protecting them from harm. The moving of the enclosure and the noise of the planes and crowds can
cause stress and discomfort. Because of their limited immunity, their health is at risk if they are exposed to potential
pathogens. Transport at such a young age could expose them to pathogens that their immune system is not able to
handle.
Correct from this point forward.
2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility failed to handle the animal so that there was minimal risk of harm to the public with sufficient distance or
barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. A
report of an alleged bite incident was received regarding a child who was bitten by a juvenile macaque named
"Lucy" during a animal encounter session on Dec. 21, 2016. The report of the injury was confirmed by an FWC
investigation. The licensee seemed to dispute that there was an injury. The facility described how these encounters
are done: The monkey has a harness and leash and while visitors are seated at a table the monkey is allowed to go
up and touch them and the visitors are instructed on how to touch and interact with the monkeys. When asked what
happens if a monkey becomes aggressive they stated that their animals are not at all aggressive but they can call
them back away from the visitors. When asked is there was anything in place that would prevent a monkey from
scratching or biting a visitor, no explanation was provided.
Macaque monkeys are known to be potential asymptomatic carriers of B virus, a virus that can potentially be fatal tohumans. It can be transmitted by bite or scratch. Recommendations for exposure to a macaque bite or scratch often
includes the use of antivirals which can sometimes have unpleasant side effects. The owner stated that she is
aware of this disease but disputes that it is a risk. They routinely use macaques in their encounter episodes. Other
diseases that might be of concern with such close contact with wild or exotic animal, such as rabies, could also
potentially result in that animal being euthanized in order to test it.
Animals must be handled so that there is minimal risk of harm to the public with sufficient distance or barriers
between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public.
Correct from this point forward.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Item from Nov. 29, 2016 report not corrected: - In an enclosure housing 4 tigers in the tram tour section of the park,
a wooden resting platform has been chewed and scratched excessively, leaving a row of exposed nail heads along
one border of the platform. This is a potential injury risk to the enclosed animals.
- In the deer enclosure housing 3 deer, there was a section of fence that was no longer attached to the railing and
was loose so fencing is not secure. This was re-attached with wire by the end of the inspection.
All facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect and safely contain all regulated animals.
This was a focused inspection to review non-compliant items from the previous report, to review animal handling
and a bite report, and to review documentation.
Only some of the previous non-compliant items from Nov.29, 2016 inspection were corrected: goat enclosure wire
around a large tree and the "Fort Dade" tiger enclosure wooden center support posts.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
