FEEDING.

appeared to be bird feces. Dirty feed receptacles and feed contaminated with fecal material may create health risks
for the deer. Food and food receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary at all times. If self feeders are used,
adequate measures shall be taken to prevent molding, contamination, or deterioration or caking of the food.
