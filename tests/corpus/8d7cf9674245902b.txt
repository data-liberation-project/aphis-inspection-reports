3.13(c)(3) REPEAT
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At the time of inspection, the following animals had recently arrived at the KLM cargo office:
A shipment of one crate containing two French Bulldog puppies, on waybill number 074-1267-4642, originating in
Budapest, via Amsterdam, on flights KL1976 and KL 0605.
The crate did not have instructions from the shipper regarding feeding and watering during travel, or last time the
animals had been fed and watered prior to departure. In Amsterdam a sticker had been applied noting that the
puppies were offered food and water at that stop. The paperwork for this shipment included an IATA checklist which
had been completed and signed, indicating that feeding instructions were attached to the crate, but they were not.
Failure to ensure that the shipper provides certification in writing regarding feeding and watering instructions at the
time of accepting a dog or cat for shipment can put the animals at risk. This information should be clearly displayed
on the carrier, during transit. The airline must ensure that the owner has provided this information in writing, in order
to help ensure that animals are adequately cared for while in transit.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives at the cargo office.
