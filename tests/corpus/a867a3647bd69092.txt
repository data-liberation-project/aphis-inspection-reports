ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several bottles of expired drugs were found during this inspection. Since it cannot be determined if the use of
expired drugs will produce the desired effect they were intended to in a medical application, expired drugs are not
considered adequate veterinary care and should not be used. Expired drugs must be removed from current
medication and labeled as expired. A regular program of drug inventory and removal of expired drugs should be
started and maintained.
