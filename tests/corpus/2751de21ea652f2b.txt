HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A young male white cheeked gibbon escaped his enclosure a few weeks ago. Repair was made to the top of the
enclosure at a location thought to be the area of escape., however a few days ago the same animal again escaped.
He was safely returned to the enclosure both times and is now held off exhibit in a secure enclosure. Zoo
maintenance is working to determine the location of escape so repairs can be made.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates housed in them. They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the
animals from injury, contain the animals securely. Repair must be made to this exhibit to contain the animals.
