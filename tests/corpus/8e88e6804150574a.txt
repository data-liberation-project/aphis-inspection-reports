ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the outdoor enclosures was a female Siberian Husky (M/C# 092811836) that was very thin and had a significant
abdominal tuck. The hair coat had shed from the sides and hips but was still thick and in the process of shedding
along the neck, back and loin. When the dog was palpated, the spine, hips and ribs were easily felt and there was a
significant muscle loss. The dog was in a large enclosure with 2 larger dogs. Dogs that are very thin may have
other medical concerns. The owner must have the dog evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment.
The dog must be housed in a separate enclosure from other dogs. Documents of diagnosis and treatment must be
available to APHIS officials.

Sonny, a male red and white King Charles Cavalier Spaniel had a left eye that was bulging and had brown
discoloration on the surface of both eyes. Eye conditions can be painful and when not properly treated, can lead to
loss of vision. The dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment. Documents of diagnosis
and treatment must be available to APHIS officials.

Scarlett (m/c# 092811344) a female Cocker Spaniel had a red mass on the outside lower lip on the right side. It
was about 1/2" diameter in size and shiny. This dog had an ongoing eye condition that was being treated, as stated
by the owner. There was a greenish discharge from both eyes although the eyes were clear and there was no
redness observed. The cheek teeth and canine teeth had hard dark material on their surfaces. The dark brown
material may affect the health and well being of the affected animals if left untreated and can affect the way that the
dog eats. The applicant should consult with the veterinarian to develop a dental care plan for all the dogs at the
facility. This plan should cover how dental disease will be identified and how differing degrees of disease will be
treated. The dog needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian so that a proper diagnosis can be made regarding the
observed problems and a treatment plan can be implemented. The licensee should document the diagnosis and the
treatment plan, and have it available to APHIS officials. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 1 AUGUST 2014
There was female Brindle French Bulldog (Paris, m/c# 4A014D3004) that had a large gray, irregularly shaped,
roughened mass on the top of the head. It was approximately 1/2" above the surface of the skin and 1 1/2" in
diameter. The owner stated that the dog had been evaluated by a veterinarian several months ago, but the mass
has increased in size. There was no documentation of the evaluation. Masses that change or grow may indicate a
more serious health condition. Due to the changes, the dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and
treatment.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
(2) Live puppies or kittens, less than 16 weeks of age
****There were 15 puppies under the age of 16 weeks that had no identification. One puppy was weaned and
separated from the dam. Identification numbers were listed on the APHIS 7006 forms for puppies that had been
sold, but the same numbers were used for each litter, thereby, using the same number numerous times. Proper
and accurate identification is necessary to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty when
medicating, to facilitate record keeping requirements and to track the dogs when ownership is transfered. The
owner needs to assure that all live animals throughout the facility are identified and that proper records are made
and maintained.
TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS DAY FORWARD.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
MDA inspector and veterinarian were also present on inspection.
