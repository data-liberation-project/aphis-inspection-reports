ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a Boxer puppy (approximately 8 wks old) that is thin in appearance and had loose diarrhea, that appeared
to have some blood in it. While the diarrhea had been noticed over the past week, there has been no treatment, or
contact with the veterinarian for proper diagnosis or treatment. The puppy appears to be eating and drinking and
moving around, however the weight loss and loose feces needs to be attended to.
Untreated health issues and weight loss can cause a treatable condition to become chronic or cause severe health
issues if left untreated or diagnosed properly in a timely manner.
The attending veterinarian must be contacted for proper diagnosis and treatment.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are several primary enclosure walls and 4 feeders that have a moderate buildup of brown dirt/grime on the
walls, and inside the feeder troughs. While the enclosures are cleaned 2 time a day, the sanitization schedule is
only once per 3 weeks. This is too long of a time period to wait to sanitize and clean properly.
A buildup of dirt and grime can be a source of bacteria which can cause possible health issues.
The licensee must increase the sanitization schedule for the enclosures and feeders to at least once every two
weeks or as often as necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt and grime on the surfaces the dogs come in contact
with.
