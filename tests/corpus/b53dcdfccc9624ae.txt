2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The facilities written program of veterinary care was different from the actual practice. The vaccination schedule and the
parasite control program were different than what was on the program of veterinary care. Not following the program of
veterinary care developed by your attending veterinarian can cause harm to the animals. The applicant must work with
their attending veterinarian and develop a program of vet care that reflects the current practice at the facility.
2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female Beagle (#4339) has a baseball size lump on its belly. The attending veterinarian recently examined this dog but
the applicant didn't have any current documentation. There was documentation that was from fall of 2020, that stated this
dog has a hernia and no treatment needed. The applicant stated the hernia has got a little bigger since fall 2020.
Ensuring the veterinarian has examined the dog and has documentation for this dog is important in making sure animals
are getting proper care. The applicant must get with their attending veterinarian and get the written medical record for this
dog.
3.1(c)(3)

Three outdoor enclosures had excessive feces in them. A build up of feces is a disease hazard and can attract pest. The
applicant must ensure all surfaces which come in contact with the dogs and puppies are spot cleaned daily.
