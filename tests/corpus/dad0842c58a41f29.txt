INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the whelping building, there is an odor of ammonia and other waste. Within just a few minutes, the inspector's
eyes were burning. The small exhaust fan present is too small to handle the size of the whelping areas. The
licensee stated they were planning on installing a new air/heat exchanger unit they have already bought but haven't
had a chance to install it yet.
A buildup of ammonia and other odors can cause respiratory and eye problems in the animals, and affect their
well-being.
The licensee must install the new ventilation unit for the health and well-being of the animals. The licensee must
ensure there is sufficient ventilation at all times in any indoor housing by using windows, ventilation fans, air
conditioning or other methods to reduce these odors.
To be corrected by October 6, 2015.
Inspection and exit interview conducted by Lynn Clarke and facility representative.
