Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
* Official USDA dog on hand sheets (7005's) need to be updated. Official identification (microchip) had not been
recorded for seven dogs. Complete and accurate records are needed to ensure each animal’s identity can be known with
certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace dogs. The licensee must ensure that they make, keep, and maintain records
that fully and correctly disclose all the required information concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned,
held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or
otherwise disposed of by that dealer or exhibitor. Correct by 12/13/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
