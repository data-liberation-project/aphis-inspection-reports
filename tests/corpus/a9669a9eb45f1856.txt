Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).

animals are receiving the care and observation they require for adequate husbandry practice. Create and document a
formal program of veterinary care plan with a licensed veterinarian.

Sheltered housing facilities.
The interactive room contains a lemur that is allowed to have direct contact with the public. While the licensee states that
there is a handler present in the room during this time, there is no direct control of the animals when they have contact
with customers. As per the licensee, customers are allowed to sit on a bench in the encounter room and the primates are
allowed to roam free on and around the customers. The licensee stands in the room to observe this.
There is a risk of direct injury to both the public and the animals in the interaction area. Animals must be under the direct
control at all times during interactive sessions.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class C license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.
