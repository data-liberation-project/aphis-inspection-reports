FACILITIES, INDOOR.
***There was a strong urine odor in the house where 3 skunks,1 fox, 2 raccoon, 2 prairie dogs, 1 opossum and one
kinkajou are housed. There was urine on the floor where the fox, skunks, and pet dogs run loose in the house.
Laminate floor appeared to have urine seeping into seams between pieces as the seams were discolored and
raised. One couch was urine stained and torn and contributed to the odor. Ventilation needs to be improved and
couch and any other urine-contaminated materials need to be removed to reduce odor.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
