2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a Burnese Mountain Dog (F, Queenie, #103) that was observed to be shaking her head continuously during the
inspection, and walking with her head low between her shoulders while tilting her head from side to side in obvious
discomfort. Upon examination after lifting the ears there was a large amount fluid filling up both ear canals, spilling over
the rim of the ear into the fur. The liquid was cloudy and drained out of the ears during examination. There was a slight
greenish tinge of the liquid located at the hairline by the right ear. The right ear had a brown gummy substance inside the
canal and crevices, while the inside of the left ear appeared to have some redness, thickening and irritation. Both ears
appeared sensitive to the touch as the dog would pull away or lean into any handling of the ears. The hair coat had a dull
appearance, and the body condition appeared very thin. Upon examination all of the ribs, spine and hips could be felt
easily, and the dog appeared to be underweight and warm to the touch. The ears and loss of condition had not been
observed before the inspection, and there had been no veterinary contact or treatment for these conditions.

All health issues must be identified in a timely manner in order to prevent a treatable condition from becoming more
serious or causing unnecessary pain and discomfort to the regulated animal.

The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the ears and lack of body

condition. Daily observations need to be increased and more thorough of all regulated animals.

To be corrected by: The attending veterinarian was contacted by the end of the inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Facility Representative.
