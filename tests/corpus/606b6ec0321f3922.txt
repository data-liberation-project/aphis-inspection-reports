3.1(c)(1)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the small dog building there is one enclosure, containing one dog, which has two sharp points created by the
ends of wires that are jutting into the enclosure and hanging off the fence. The wires are located at the level of the
dog.
There are at least five enclosures in the big dog building, containing seven large breed dogs, which have sharp
points located in the outdoor portion of the enclosures. The sharp points are created by the ends of wires that are
hanging off the enclosure fencing. The indoor portion of at least two enclosures, containing three large breed dogs,
have wires hanging from the fencing and walls and are creating sharp points at the level of the dogs. Sharp points
can cause injury to the dogs.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges that could injure the animals. The
licensee must remove all the sharp points from the enclosures in order to eliminate the injury risk towards the
animals. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Within the big dog building there are wooden posts covered with sheets of metal within some of the pens. In two of
the enclosures, housing one dog each, the metal has eroded and the old and worn wood underneath is exposed.
Within the big dog building there are two enclosures, housing one dog each, with chewed and/or worn flaps
covering the animal access doors. The areas that are chewed are rough and white strings are hanging down from
the chewed areas. In one of the enclosures, approximately half of the flap is gone.
Within the big dog building there are severely chewed, worn, and/or dirty feeders. The chewed and/or worn areas
are rough and there is dirt, grime, and/or caked feed sticking to the chewed and worn areas. There are seven
affected enclosures housing nine dogs. Severely chewed and/or worn surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which can lead to disease hazards
for the dogs. All chewed, worn and/or soiled surfaces and objects within the facility must be repaired or replaced.

3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an excessive build-up of feces in several (thirteen) pens within both the small and big dog buildings. In
some of the enclosures the feces is piled up in one spot and in others the feces is scattered and/or smeared around
throughout the enclosure. Some piles of feces had paw prints in them and the dogs were observed to be walking in
the feces. There are fifteen adult dogs and three pups in the affected enclosures. Failure to spot-clean feces daily
and sanitize enclosures can lead to disease hazards for the dogs. All hard surfaces with which dogs come in
contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent an accumulation of excreta and to reduce disease
hazards. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are spot-cleaned daily.
