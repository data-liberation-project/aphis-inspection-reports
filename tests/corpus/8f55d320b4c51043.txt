FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The current perimeter fence is in need of some repair to ensure that it is structurally sound. Vines and greenery
have overgrown over the top of the fence. The facility has killed the vines but they have not yet been removed. The
weight of the vines is causing the fence side along the paved parking area to sag toward the parking area.
The fence needs to be structurally sound to act as a deterrent to other animals/people getting in and as a secondary
containment system to keep the servals in. Correct by 10/12/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned owner.
