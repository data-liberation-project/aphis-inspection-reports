2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility representative stated that although nine animal and use protocols have been reviewed this year, the
corresponding paperwork for these reviews have not been signed off by the IACUC. Without this documentation, it
cannot be verified that the IACUC has conducted the reviews within the annual time period. A system should be in
place to ensure paperwork corresponding to annual protocol reviews are completed in a timely manner.
The IACUC shall conduct continuing reviews of activities covered by this subchapter at appropriate intervals as
determined by the IACUC, but not less than annually.
