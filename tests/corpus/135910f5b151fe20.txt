Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Item Vet Care 2.40 a 2
The Attending Veterinarian (AV ) diagnosed the tiger cub with a fractured 4th metacarpal bone of the left front foot. The
licensee's video demonstrated that the AV recommended treating the fracture with "confinement" and he stated the
healing process " would take about a month." The video reveals the licensee allowing the tiger cub to play and run with
the licensee's pet dog as well as jumping on and off a coffee table. In a subsequent video, the licensee states that the
cub continues to limp. The licensee must follow the AV's directions and must assure that the AV has appropriate authority
to ensure provision of adequate veterinary care .

Handling of animals.
Item Handling 2. 131 b 1
The licensee's video shows the tiger cub interacting with an animal he states is 100% wolf, although he told the USDA
that it was a wolf hybrid. The wolf's handler controlled him with a leash while the cub roamed free. The video displayed
an instance when the wolf lunged at the tiger cub. Throughout the interaction, the wolf was pulling on his leash to get to


the tiger cub. The tiger cub responded to the wolf by keeping a distance, jumping on a sofa to stay far from it, and
swatted at the wolf's face which could have resulted in injury to animal. Also, the licensee can be viewed pulling the
tiger's tail to get her to stop eating . The licensee can be heard saying "she's angry".
Handling of all animals shall be done in a manner that does not cause trauma , behavior stress or unnecessary
discomfort.

Facilities, general.
Item Facilities general 3.125 a
The floor of the tiger enclosure is composed of wooden boards. The USDA inspector observed at least 2 areas of wood
flooring with holes due to rotting. One of the holes is approx. 8 in. x 3 in. and appears to extend the full thickness of the
board and the other is approx. 6 in. x 2 in. Their size and placement potentiate the animal getting a portion of a paw or a
claw entrapped and risking injury. The shelter inside the enclosure has a wooden base that is in disrepair with what
appears to be sharp edges on which the animal could be injured.
Housing facilities must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

Facilities, outdoor.
Item Facilities outdoor 3.127 (d)
Fencing surrounding the tiger's outdoor housing enclosure does not meet the minimum height requirement of 8 ft. The
wooden boundary fencing on the sides of the premises is approximately 6 ft. in height and the back fence is
approximately 39 in. high.


According to recorded video and licensee statements to the USDA inspector, many times he brought the tiger cub inside
the house using a leash as a control. There is no secondary containment should the door open and the tiger escape the
leash.
USDA reviewed a video the licensee recorded and published and observed him allowing the tiger cub into the
enclosure's security entrance. This access eliminated any additional containment should the animal escape.
The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and other
unauthorized persons from entering as well as functions as a secondary containment system. Fences less than 8 ft. high
for potentially dangerous animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
