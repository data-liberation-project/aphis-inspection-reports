HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***The milking cow and calf are used for periodic agricultural talks. At other times, they are on exhibition in an
unattended area with no barrier fences in place. During these periods of exhibition, the public can come in direct
contact with the animals and there is no readily identifiable attendant present. During public exhibition, there must
be a barrier between the animal and the public for the safety of both the animal and the public. A barrier must be
constructed of sufficient distance and height to assure the safety of the public and the animals.
