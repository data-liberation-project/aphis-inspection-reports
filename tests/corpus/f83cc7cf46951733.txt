ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three of the young degus in the degu enclosure within the “reptile building” have excessive hair-loss. The hair is
mainly missing from the front third of their bodies. On each of the three animals there is some hair missing on the
backs of their heads and at the base of their tails. The licensee states that she has not spoken to the veterinarian
regarding the hair-loss. Hair-loss can be a sign of poor health, environmental conditions, or compatibility issues in
the group. A veterinarian must be consulted regarding the hair-loss in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is
obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis,
treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
One of the wolf hybrids had several flies sitting on the tips of its ears. The animal was seen occasionally shaking its
head, but the flies did not come off. No open wounds were visible on the ears, however, the inspectors were only
able to view the animal cage-side. The licensee stated that she had previously spoken with the veterinarian
regarding fly control for the wolf hybrids and normally treats them, but had not recently treated the animals or the
environment. Failure to provide pest control for flies can lead to health issues for the animals. An effective program
for the control of insects, including flies, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and
well-being of the animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is one enclosure wall within the outdoor portion of the baboon housing facility that separates two baboon
enclosures. The enclosure wall is made of wood panels. The wood is worn and soiled. There are some areas where
patches have been placed. The edges of the patches are chewed and/or worn with rough edges. In some areas,there are holes that have been chewed and/or worn through the wood. The chewed and worn areas are rough and
dirt and/or dust is embedded in the wood. The licensee states she has replaced some of the wood, but the animals
have continued to destroy the wall of wood. There are a total of four baboons in the two affected enclosures. Worn
surfaces are difficult to clean and surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned can increase disease hazards for the
animals. The licensee must ensure that surfaces of non-human primate housing facilities that cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized are replaced when worn or soiled.

3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are excessive cobwebs throughout the “primate building”. The heaviest cobwebs are mainly in the area near
the two macaques. The cobwebs are thick and cover the light fixtures in this portion of the housing facility. There is
a plastic playhouse in the outdoor portion of the same macaque enclosure that has a significant amount of dust, dirt,
grime and/or debris covering the surface of the structure. There is also a stack of crates containing fruits and
vegetables that has leaked on the floor next to the same macaque enclosure which is attracting pests (flies) to the
area. Failure to clean housing facilities and enrichment items within primary enclosures can lead to disease
hazards, pests and odors. The licensee must ensure that hard surfaces with which the nonhuman primates come in
contact are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least every two weeks. Furthermore, the licensee must ensure that
all other surfaces of the nonhuman primate housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy
generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
3.75(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is one pile of food in crates (mainly potatoes and bread items) that is located just outside the door to the
“primate building”. Some of the food appears to be old and/or moldy and it is attracting an excessive number of flies.
The licensee states that the food was stacked nice but that it’s likely raccoons or another wild animal had gotten into
it and made a mess. There is also a stack of crates containing food located on the floor, just inside the door, directly
across from the enclosure housing two macaques. The licensee states these crates hold mainly fruits and
vegetables. There is brown liquid that has leaked out from the crates on to the floor. There are an excessive number
of flies present within, on and around the crates. Failure to store food properly can lead to food spoilage,
contamination, and pest and/or vermin infestation. All supplies of food must be stored in a manner that protects the
supplies from spoilage, contamination, and infestation. The food must be stored off the floor and away from the
walls to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. Food requiring refrigeration must be stored accordingly,
and all food must be stored in a manner that prevents contamination and deterioration of its nutritive value. Only the
food currently being used may be kept in animal areas, and when not in actual use, open food must be kept in
leak-proof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent spoilage and contamination.To be corrected by: August 18, 2016

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are an excessive number of flies present inside of the “primate building”. The majority of the flies are located
around and within a stack of crates containing fruits and vegetables, just inside the door, directly across from the
enclosure housing two macaques. The flies are present within, on and around the crates but flies were also seen in
and around the macaque enclosure. The presence of pests can lead to health hazards for the animals. A safe and
effective program for the control of pests, including flies, must be implemented and maintained.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is one fence panel within the potbelly pig enclosure that has a rusted bottom rail. The rust has eroded the
metal leaving a jagged surface that the pigs could come in contact with.
There are several enclosures (“camel enclosure”, “Santa Cruz sheep enclosure”, and the “llama enclosure”) that are
made of chain-link fence. The chain-link fence in these enclosures has curled up at the bottom and the curled-up
edge has sharp points that extend into the enclosures. The affected enclosures house approximately fifty-two
sheep, eleven llamas, and one camel.
Sharp and/or jagged edges could cause injury to animals. All housing facilities must be structurally sound and shall
be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The “llama enclosure”, housing ten llamas, and the “zebu enclosure”, housing seven zebu and one Miniature
Hereford, have inadequate shelter space for the number of animals in the enclosure. There is only one small shelter
in each enclosure. The shelters are not large enough to hold all of the animals housed in that enclosure. Failure to
provide adequate shelter for animals housed outdoors does not ensure they are protected from the elements.
Natural or artificial shelter shall be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent
discomfort to such animals.
To be corrected by: August 18, 2016
3.127(c)FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The automatic waterer for the raccoons is leaking onto the ground surrounding the enclosure. The water has
collected and has created a small “moat” around and under part of the enclosure. The water is dirty/muddy and has
a thick layer of algae growing on top of it. There are four raccoons housed in this enclosure. Improper drainage
does not ensure a clean, dry environment which can lead to pests and other health hazards for the animals. A
suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess standing water from around enclosures.

WATERING.
The water receptacle within the capybara enclosure contains green water, dirt and/or debris. There are also small
insects swimming within and on top of the water. Lack of clean water creates a health hazard for the animals. The
licensee must ensure that potable water is offered to the animals as often as necessary to provide for their health
and comfort. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
Corrected the day of the inspection.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The capybara enclosure, a cement bowl in the enclosure housing four raccoons, and the shelters for the two black
bears are all in need of cleaning.
The shelter within the capybara enclosure contains an excessive amount of waste (food waste, soiled bedding,
and/or animal waste) and the “pool”/water bucket has an excessive amount of animal waste in it. The waste/soiled
material is attracting an excessive number of flies.
The concrete bowl “catching” water from the automatic waterer in the raccoon enclosure has a thick layer of
brown/green algae coating the inside surface and one side of the bowl.
The floor within the shelter area for the two black bears has several inches thick of old bedding, food and/or animal
waste present and it is attracting flies.
Failure to clean animal enclosures can lead to health hazards, pests and odors. Primary enclosures shall be
cleaned and excreta and other waste shall be removed in order to prevent contamination of the animals contained
therein and to minimize disease hazards, pests and odors.3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There are an excessive number of flies present in multiple areas throughout the entire facility. Areas with excessive
flies include the enclosure housing the capybara, the Meishan pig enclosure, the black bear enclosure, and in the
Kodiak bear enclosure.
The flies within the capybara enclosure are mainly located on and around the soiled material within the shelter, on
the shelter, on two halves of watermelon that are located next to the shelter and on the ground surrounding the
watermelon.
The flies in the Meishan pig enclosure are located on the two pigs in the enclosure and areas immediately
surrounding the pigs.
The flies in the black bear enclosure, housing two black bears, are located on the old bedding, food and/or animal
waste present on the ground within the shelter.
There are a large number of flies located within the Kodiak bear enclosure on the ground in, and adjacent to, their
feeding area. There were also an excessive number of flies seen on the animals. There are five bears in this
enclosure.
Small, less than one centimeter long, white, worm-like insects (the licensee confirmed these were maggots) were
seen crawling on the floor and bedding within the skunk enclosure, housing one skunk, in the back of the “reptile
building”. This was corrected during the inspection.
The facility has a few provisions for fly control, but they are not effectively controlling the fly population. The
presence of pests can lead to health hazards for the animals. A safe and effective program for the control of pests,
including flies, must be implemented and maintained.
An inspection was conducted on August 15, 2016 and an exit briefing was conducted on August 16, 2016 with the
owner, ACI Chad Moore, and VMO Heather Cole.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 16, 2016.Additional Inspectors
