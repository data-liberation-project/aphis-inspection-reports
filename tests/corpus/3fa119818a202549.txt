FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In two separate guinea pig enclosures, housing 3 animals each, there was aluminum foil wrapped over the top of
the coroplast lining the enclosure walls. The guinea pigs have eaten several sections of the coroplast and the
aluminum foil. Ingestion of the coroplast and the aluminum foil by the animals poses a health and injury risk. Indoor
and outdoor housing facilities for guinea pigs shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to
protect the animals from injury.
To be corrected by 10/27/15.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
***The hamster enclosure had an accumulation of cobwebs and debris on the enclosure walls. The licensee stated
to the VMO that she had recently changed the bedding and cleaned the wheel but did not wipe down the enclosure
walls. Accumulation of cobwebs and debris can be an indicator of substandard husbandry practices. Animal
enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards, to reduce
disease transmission, and to prevent the animals from becoming contaminated or soiled. Primary enclosures shall
be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris: Provided, however, that
such enclosures shall be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***The following outdoor, primary enclosures utilize the facility's 6ft, concrete, block wall perimeter fence as a part of
the primary enclosure: Patagonian cavy yard, Paca enclosure, and Wallaby pen/yard. The east wall of the wallaby
yard is not concrete block, but vertical bars with 2-3 inch spacing. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that
it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from having contact with the
animals, and so it can function as a secondary containment system. It must be of sufficient distance from the
outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or
persons outside the perimeter fence. Fences less than 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure must beapproved in writing by the Administrator.

3.131(a)
SANITATION.
***The following enclosures had an excessive accumulation of debris (hair, cobwebs, food, feces, dirt, etc) on
surfaces within the enclosure:
-on the two perches in the degu enclosure
-on the walls in the betong enclosure
-within and above the hyrax enclosure
-along the outside-bottom edge of the hyrax enclosure
-within and above the beaver enclosure
An excessive accumulation of waste/debris can increase insects, pests, and odors;may harbor pathogens which
can play a role in disease transmission and can be an indication of substandard husbandry practices. Primary
enclosures shall be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to
minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
***Throughout the facility, there is an accumulation of extra caging, cleaning supplies and other debris. Additionally,
on the floors, walls and ceilings surrounding the primary enclosures there is buildup of bedding, feces, food debris
and cobwebs. Accumulation of materials and debris make it difficult to maintain husbandry standards, can be areas
for harboring pests which can transmit disease to the regulated animals and may be an indication of substandard
husbandry practices. Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the
animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
