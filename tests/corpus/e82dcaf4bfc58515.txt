FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The chain link fenced gate of the sheep, goats, calf and alpaca primary enclosure was in need of repair. The chain
link gate had metal support poles on all four sides. However, the chain link was detaching from the bottom support
posts. This is allowing for an approximate 6 inch gap. To ensure that the animals are not injured on the gate and
fencing, it should be properly secured.
