OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***Six non-human primates were housed in outdoor enclosures in climatic conditions that did not provide adequate
shelter from the elements. There were two Grivet monkeys in one enclosure and four Ring-tailed lemurs in another
enclosure. The ambient outdoor temperature was 39.8 degrees F. The shelters for the animals were constructed
of concrete blocks that were approximately 38 inches wide by 40 inches long by 36 inches high. There was an
opening on the west side of the Ring-tailed lemur shelter and on the east side of the Grivet monkey shelter that
measured approximately 30 inches wide by 36 inches high. The Grivet monkey shelter was not heated. The
Ring-tailed lemur shelter had two heat lamps at the top of the south wall of the shelter. There was straw in both
shelters. The ambient temperature inside the Grivet monkey shelter was 43.7 degrees F. The ambient temperature
inside the Ring-tailed lemur shelter was 42.9 degrees F. All animals must be housed in appropriate conditions to
prevent weather related injuries. All enclosures that house non-human primates must contain a shelter that
provides heat to the non-human primates to prevent the ambient temperature from falling below 45 degrees F.
These animals must be housed in an enclosure that meets the temperature requirement stated above. To be
corrected from this date forward.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
