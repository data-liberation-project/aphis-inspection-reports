ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:30pm on
24-JUL-18.
Knocked at the door, called contact number, left message, and waited 30 minutes in driveway. Called again, left
message, and left facility. Mr. Hoard returned my call soon after I left. He is out of town and will return next week.
