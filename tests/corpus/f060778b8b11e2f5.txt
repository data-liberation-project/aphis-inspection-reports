ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:15pm on
19-Mar-18.
I arrived at the facility at 4:15pm. I knocked on the door and waited for 2 minutes. I returned to my vehicle and
honked the horn 3 times. I called both numbers provided in the file and left a message. I waited 30 minutes. At
4:45pm, I honked the horn 3 times again and tried knocking on the door again. I called both numbers and left a
message stating that I was leaving and would be writing an attempted inspection.
