ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:03pm on
30-Apr-18.
Telephone contact was made with the license but she was unable to leave work. The licensee is strongly
considering terminating her license at this time as she stated she has not conducted any business and probably will
not have time to in the near future. A form was left for the licensee to send in with her certificate.
