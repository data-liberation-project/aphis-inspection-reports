FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The back wall on the structure used to house the two Camels has two large holes that have been chewed into the
wood paneled wall. These two holes can allow for the camels to get injured from getting their heads stuck in the
narrow part of the holes or from chewing on the wood. All structures must be kept in good repair. This will prevent
injury to the animals.
