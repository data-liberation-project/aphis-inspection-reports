INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semi-annual evalution report was sent to the Institutional Official (IO) in April 2013. This report identified a
deficiency involving a relative humidity issue in the tree shrew rooms. The issue was not designated as significant or
minor. A plan for correction was noted as involving construction but there was no schedule with dates for correcting
the deficiency-just a notation that the construction would probably not occur until July 2014 due to funding issues.
The report to the Institutional Official functions as an overall evaluation of the registrant's facilities and programs. It
is the IO's ultimate responsibility to make sure all problems are addressed in a timely manner. This semi-annual
evaluation must be complete and for any identified deficiencies must include a description of the nature and extent
of the deficiency, the significance of the deficiency (significant or minor), and a specific plan and schedule with
dates for correcting the deficiency. Correct from this day forward.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility's IACUC has an annual proposal review process in place however during the review of approved
proposals by the inspectors, it was noted that four of eighteen active proposals had not been reviewed within the
last year. Proposal 12216 was last reviewed on 1/24/13. Proposal 10086 was reviewed on 3/20/12 and a
modification was approved on 8/28/13. No review was completed between 3/20/12 and 8/28/13. Proposal 11014
was last reviewed on 4/24/12. Proposal 11119 was last reviewed on 2/10/12. Continuing reviews of activities
covered by the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations by the IACUC are necessary to ensure that the facility is
adhering to all regulations and standards safeguarding the welfare of the research animals. The IACUC shall
conduct continuing reviews of covered activities not less than annually. Correct by 7/30/2014.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In room UUU, the majority of the 29 adult tree shrews had a mild hair loss on the dorsal surface of the tail with
15%-20% having significant hair loss on the tail along with having a thin hair coat around the tail head and hindlegs. No veterinarian was contacted about the hair loss. An adequate program of veterinary care includes
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The tree shrews must be
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian. Correct by 3/17/2014

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During this USDA inspection, the inspectors reviewed the room temperature and humidity records for the tree shrew
rooms. Records for the indoor housing room UUU used to house 29 adult and 3 infant tree shrews show that in the
month of Jan. 2014 humidity levels ranged from 15-35% with only one day consistently above 30%. In the month of
Feb. 2014 humidity levels ranged from 2-33% with no days above 30% all day. During the first half of Mar. 2014
humidity levels ranged from 17-30% with no days above 30% all day. Tree shrews are a species from south-east
Asia that live in tropical and sub-tropical areas that are usually moist environments. During the inspection it was
noted that several of the tree shrews showed dull dry looking coats that were sparse over the tail and tail head
areas. Low humidity levels can lead to medical issues such as skin and respiratory abnormalities and can lead to
discomfort for animals. All indoor housing areas shall maintain humidity levels at 30-70 percent and specific housing
room humidity levels should take into account the housed animals' age, species, breed, overall health status and
acclimation status. The facility shall increase the humidity through temporary measures by 3/21/2014 and will
correct the humidity issues via permanent long-term corrective actions by 9/1/2014.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Room XXX housed 14 guinea pigs in seven cages. Each cage housed two guinea pigs. According to health records,
the guinea pigs weighed over 350 grams. The guinea pig enclosure measured 18 inches by 13.25 inches. The
height of the enclosure measured at 7.50 inches; however, the snap on platform and feeder/water dispenser placed
inside the enclosure reduced the height of the enclosure to 4 inches on both sides. The platform and feeder/water
dispenser went across the entire width of the enclosure, so that the only 56% of the primary enclosure was at a
height of 7.5 inches with the remaining measuring at 4 inches. Guinea pigs must have an interior height of at least
7 inches. There was no approval from the IACUC for the decrease in height. Failure to comply with the space
requirements inhibits normal behavior, limits normal postural adjustments, and decreases animal welfare. Provide
an enclosure with a height of at least 7 inches for the entire required floor space for all guinea pigs. Correct by
