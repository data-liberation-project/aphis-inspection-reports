ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date. There was one 250 mg bottle of Amoxicillin
capsules with an expiration date of 10/2013, one Rexall 81 mg bottle of aspirin with an expiration date of 07/2012
and one bottle of wound spray with an expiration date of 01/2013. In addition, there were two 109 ml bottles of
liquid Scrub Care Iodine cleaning solution with expiration dates of 08/2008 and 11/2008. These medications were
intermingled with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The
usage of expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice
and does not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when
expired drugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must
ensure that all medications used have not gone past the recorded expiration date. Correct by 3/20/14.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* Official USDA dog on hand sheets (7005's) had 22 dogs recorded, but there were 26 adult dogs counted by the
inspector. When the records and dogs at the facility do not match it makes the records incomplete. Complete and
accurate records are needed to ensure each animals identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability
to trace dogs. The licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all dogs at all times at their facility.
Correct by 4/6/14.

WATERING.
* The entire top edge of one water receptacle is chewed and has a roughened, jagged edge. The receptacle used
by two dogs are located in outdoor housing. A chewed, roughened, jagged surface cannot be easily cleaned and
sanitized and could potentially cause injury to the dogs. In addition, it could harbor bacteria and other disease
causing agents that can affect the health and wellbeing of the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all receptacles
can be properly cleaned and sanitized at all times. Correct by 3/20/14.
* Facility inspection done on 3/6/14 and exit briefing done on 3/10/14 were conducted with the licensee.
