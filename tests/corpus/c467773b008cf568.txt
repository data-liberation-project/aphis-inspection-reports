2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
The licensee started using microchips for official identification purposes. A microchip scanner was not available at
the time of the inspection. Without a scanner microchips in the dogs cannot be read. Proper identification is
required in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record-keeping
requirements. The licensee must identify all dogs on the premises by either an official tag affixed to the animal's
neck by means of a collar, legible tatto, or microchip with scanner. Correct by 4 July 2015.
2.75(a)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The Record of Dogs on Hand forms are not complete. The microchip number is missing for 10 dogs. The lack of
complete information on these forms makes it difficult to accurately track and monitor the dogs present in the
kennel. These forms shall accurately and completely include all required information, including but not limited to
dog identification number.

A section of welded-wire fence attached to the gate of one enclosure housing one dog has been chewed resulting in
a hole and wire points. Holes in the fence may not securely contain the dog and wire points may cause injury to the
dog. All surfaces must be maintained and kept in good repair so animals are securely contained and protected from
injury. Correct by 11 June 2015.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Dogs have dragged bedding from their dog shelters and it is now accumulated in front of their shelters and has
