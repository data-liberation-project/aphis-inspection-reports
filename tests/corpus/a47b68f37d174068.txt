ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 230pm on
01-Aug-17.
Contact was made with the owner who advised they were at work and could not come to do the inspection, nor did
she have anyone else that could meet me do conduct the inspection. A discussion on better times and dates for
inspection attempts were discussed.
