Outdoor housing facilities.
There are 14 outdoor enclosures at this facility. All enclosures contained an appropriate shelter but 9 of the enclosures,
housing 12 dogs, lacked an additional area of shade. The licensee stated that tarps were previously used to provide
shade but that the wind, rain, and dogs had ripped them to the point that they were no longer functional. Pieces of
shredded tarp could be seen clinging to the tops of several enclosures. Dogs that cannot access shade to escape the
direct sun have the potential to overheat. Correct by ensuring every enclosure has an area of shade that is large enough
to contain all the animals in the enclosure at one time. Correct by May 1, 2021

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
