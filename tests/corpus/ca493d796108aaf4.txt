Facilities, outdoor.
The facility currently has a perimeter fence variance that does not include the capybara. During a recent flash flood event
the capybara were able to escape the property. A perimeter fence must be constructed in a manner that will restrict
animals to the facility as well as prevent entry of animals and unauthorized persons.

To be corrected by August 27, 2022.
