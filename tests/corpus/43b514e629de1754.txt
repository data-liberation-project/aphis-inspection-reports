2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a written program of veterinary care but the licensee states the attending veterinarian has changed since it
was written. The licensee states the change was made about four of five years ago and that they likely have an
updated version but it could not be located for inspection. Licensees with a part-time or consultant veterinarian must
have formal arrangements with an attending veterinarian to include a written program of veterinary care in order to
ensure adequate veterinary care at the facility. The owner needs to locate the current program of veterinary care or
develop a new program of veterinary care with the current attending veterinarian. An updated and accurate program
of veterinary care needs to be available for inspection upon request.
