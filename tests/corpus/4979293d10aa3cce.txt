ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:30pm on
10-Jun-19.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 12:30pm. No one was home and there was no answer on the telephone. I
left my business card in the door and left. I returned at 3:20pm. Again, no one was home and there was no answer
on the telephone. I called out towards the kennel. I honked my car horn. I waited for 30 minutes and finally left at
3:55pm.
