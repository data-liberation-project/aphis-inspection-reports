3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
There is a buildup brown scale and debris on the plastic floor of the guinea pig enclosures. The regular cleaning
process (method and frequency) utilized is not effective in removing this accumulation of scale and debris. Licensee
recently tried an acid wash on one of the enclosures and the brown scale was removed. The brown scale buildup
must be removed from the rest of the guinea pig enclosures. Failure to effectively clean and sanitize enclosures
exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures
must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of scale and debris and must be sanitized at least once
every two weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean to prevent an accumulation of scale
and debris and that enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks.
