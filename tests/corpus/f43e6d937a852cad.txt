2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Several Guinea pigs have lesions consistent with ringworm. There is hair loss, scaly skin, and areas of ulceration seen
on some of their noses and/or around their eyes. Though a treatment is outlined in the written program of veterinary care,
the animals have not been treated nor has the veterinarian been notified. Guinea pigs experience discomfort when they
have these lesions and are a source of contamination for other animals. Licensee shall assure appropriate methods are
used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. Treat these animals as outlined in the written
program of veterinary care or contact a licensed veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment.

A gold, black (with some white) Guinea pig in pen 10 has a thick greenish discharge covering it's right eye. With close
examination, the eye appears sunken, red, and hazy. Facility representative had not noticed this condition prior to
inspection. Eye conditions are painful, and left untreated can result in loss of eye function. The written program of
veterinary care does not include instructions for treating this condition. Licensee shall assure appropriate methods are
used to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This Guinea pig must be examined by a licensed
veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment.



Licensee must assure veterinary guidelines are followed exactly. Document veterinary recommendations and treatments
given. Maintain these documents for examination by APHIS officials.
