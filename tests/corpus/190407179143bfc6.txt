CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Two dogs were observed scratching inside of their enclosure. Upon closer observation there were some fleas
present on the dogs abdomen and sides. When asked the licensee stated that he had not yet provided
treatment for fleas. Fleas can transmit disease,cause other health related issues,and cause the dogs
discomfort. The licensee must treat these dogs for fleas and ensure that an effective program is established and
maintained to prevent an infestation of fleas and other insects, birds,and mammals that are pest for
the health and well-being of the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
