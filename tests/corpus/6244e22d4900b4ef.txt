ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Owen (Eastern Grey Kangaroo) is thin. His pin bones are visible and his ribs & spinal column are easily felt with
little muscle over these bones. The licensee has stated that he has been this way for a long time (since arrival) and
has not lost any weight, but has no documentation of any weights or veterinarian examinations on this old, thin
animal.
The goats have not been vaccinated within the last year (last vaccinations 8/15) as per the Program of Veterinary
Care program.
Have the goats vaccinated as indicated in the Program of Veterinary Care, and have Owen examined by your
veterinarian and treat if necessary.
