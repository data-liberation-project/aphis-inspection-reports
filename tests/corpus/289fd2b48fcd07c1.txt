ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:15-1:45pm
on 19-DEC-18.
I tried to make contact at the facility. I honked my horn and called the number on file and left a message. I waited
in the driveway 30 minutes before departing.
