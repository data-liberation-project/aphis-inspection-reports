ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facilities current Program of Veterinarian Care was approved by an Attending Veterinarian in 2011 that no
longer works for the facility. They have been using a local veterinarian, as needed, for emergency care of the
animals, but they do not have an Attending Veterinarian. A Program of Veterinarian Care is required to ensure that
adequate measures are in place to ensure all health issues are addressed in an appropriate and timely manner.
The facility must have a written Program of Veterinarian Care for the facility that has been signed off and approved
by a current Attending Veterinarian. In addition, Licensee must ensure that the Veterinarian Care Plan is detailed
with all treatments, medications, vaccinations, dosages, administration etc.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a female reindeer, identified as Scarlet during the inspection, which appears to be severely underweight.
The shapes of individual ribs are showing. The outline of the lateral aspect of the hip is becoming visible and
appears to be sunken. Weight-loss can be a sign of multiple diseases or an improper diet. Under-weight animals do
not have the adequate energy reserves for normal body functions and it can be highly stressful to the animal. For
example, the immune system is often severely hampered in times of stress and poor body condition. This animal
must be examined by a licensed Veterinarian. Documentation of examination, diagnoses and treatment must be
maintained by the facility and made viewable for inspection by APHIS Officials.

2.40(b)(3)ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a reindeer that was identified on this inspection as being underweight. When the Curator was asked about
the animal, he identified that this animals was an older animal. This animal was also shedding at this time.
However; none of the facility members or staff had previously identified this animal as being underweight. At the
first sign of weight-loss, a veterinarian must be consulted and an appropriate treatment must be enacted to increase
weight in the animal. Failure to report underweight animals or signs of severe health issues to a veterinarian results
in diseases not being treated in a timely manner and can result in the further progression of weight loss. This facility
must provide an accurate and timely means of communication with their Attending Veterinarian to ensure that all
problems, including weight loss, for all animals are reported within an accurate and timely manner.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The facilities current enrichment plan was approved by an Attending Veterinarian that no longer works for the
facility. In addition, the keepers are not following the plan as it was written. There were several enrichment
materials; bubbles, lemon scents, newspaper, etc that were documented on the enrichment log, which was not on
the enrichment list that was approved in 2011. The curator confirmed that these changes had not been approved
by an Attending Veterinarian. Enrichment plans are required to promote the psychological well-being for the
Lemurs and any other non-human primate this facility may acquire. Not having proper enrichment may cause these
animals to start displaying abnormal behaviors if their senses are not stimulated on a consistent basis. This facility
must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environmental enhancement that has been established
and approved by the Attending Veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are three quarantine rooms in the Animal Health Building. Each of the quarantine rooms currently have a
heat lamp hanging from the ceiling. None of the heat lamps have a cover over the light fixture. These areas are not
currently being used. However; the Curator stated that these lamps are not removed when Animals are inside of
these rooms. Not having covers over the fixtures directly expose the animals to the bulb of the light. This bulb canbe easily shattered or very hot when in use and can expose the animals to potential injury. This facility must ensure
that all fixtures and accessories, to include the heat lamp, protect the animals from injury.
