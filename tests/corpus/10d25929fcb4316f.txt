ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30 pm on
12-Oct-17.
The inspector arrived at the facility and knocked on the door to the house. When there was no answer the inspector
went to the shop next door where the licensee works and the sign on the door stated that it was closed for business
that day. The inspector then called the licensee and left a message.
