2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female German Shepherd (Bridget, m/c# 991001000502337) who was nursing 6 puppies (approximately 7 weeks
old) was extremely thin. Her shoulders, ribs and hip bones could easily be felt and there was a distinctive abdominal
tuck. At the time of the inspection, she was in an enclosure directly next to the enclosure with the puppies. She had
been moved there a short time prior to the inspection. There were 5 areas of diarrhea (one area was very shiny and
watery) in the enclosure with the puppies and the facility representative stated that it was from the female. The dog
was observed to have diarrhea for at least a day. The facility representative stated that the dog had not been given
supplemental foods or any treatment to prevent the weight loss and a veterinarian had not been consulted about the
weight loss and the diarrhea. Significant weight loss and the watery diarrhea can indicate an underlying medical
condition such as stress, illness, parasites and poor quality of food. The dog must be examined by a veterinarian for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There were 5 enclosures in the outdoor facility that had no shelters for the enclosed dogs. Two enclosures
contained puppies (6 puppies approximately 6 months old and 6 puppies 7 weeks old) and the other enclosures
held adult dogs, one adult was the mother of the 7 week old puppies. Shelters are necessary to protect the animals
from the elements. While the enclosures have a roof and a solid wall at the rear of the enclosure, there must be a
shelter that has a roof, four sides, and a floor. The owner must provide and maintain one or more shelters in each
outdoor enclosure that are large enough to contain all the animals at one time and allow them to sit, stand, lie, and
turn about freely.
