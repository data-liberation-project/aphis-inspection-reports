Facilities, general.
The outdoor portion of the sheltered housing for the two foxes is in need of repair. The foxes have dug the dirt up outside
for an approximately 3 ft. long x 1 ft. wide section of the ground in front of the entrance to the shelter structure. There is a
piece of fencing present placed on top of the ground to keep the foxes from escaping. The digging of dirt from underneath
the fencing on the ground leaves a hole under the fencing material. If the foxes fall through/step into one of the openings
of the fencing material they could injure themselves or get a limb caught in the material. The outdoor fox enclosure needs
to be constructed and maintained to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 10/31/22.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
