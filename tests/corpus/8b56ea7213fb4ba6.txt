2.40(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two situations occurred that impacted the health of the animals from the lack of appropriate handling equipment.
These animals could not be captured or controlled for routine examination and treatment. The facility stated that the
only means of capture for the llama was by darting to sedate the animal involved in the situation. The facility stated
that the one adult male llama, and two prairie dogs could not be captured and evaluated in a safe manner.
A wound on an adult male llama was not discovered in a timely manner. The shearing had not taken place for the
year, but was scheduled to be done. The wound of unknown size was located on the sternum and was observed to
be draining. During treatments the wound became necrotic. After 17 days of treatment at the onsite treatment
center, the animal was euthanized due to the severity of the wound.
There is a prairie dog enclosure that housed two prairie dogs. The enclosure design prevents routine evaluation of
animal’s health and well-being. The two prairie dogs retreated into their burrows for the winter without evaluation of
their health status and have not been observed since.
The lack of appropriate equipment to handle and control the animals for maintaining their health and perform normal
husbandry practices does not allow for proper care of the animals. The facility personnel has started integration of
new training, capture, and handling of new animals to the facility. The exhibitor shall establish and maintain
programs of veterinary care that include the availability of appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services
to comply with the provisions of this section.
