INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC met at least once every six months this past year and minutes were generated, but no report to the
Institutional Official with a majority of signatures from the committee members was submitted. No animals have
been present on the campus, and no animal research conducted this past year. To be corrected with future
meetings.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC chair.
