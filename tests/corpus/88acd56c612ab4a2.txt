PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The enclosure housing three rabbits is in need of repair. Two sides of the enclosure consist of a thin chicken wire
type material attached to a wooden frame. In places the wire has come loose from the frame leading to some sharp
protruding points and large open loose areas. A child was noted putting his hand/arm inside the enclosure through
an area of loose wire along the frame of one of the doors of the enclosure. Loose wire areas and wire points can
lead to injury, escape of the rabbits or entry of predators. The rabbit enclosure shall be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to protect the rabbits from injury, contain them and keep predators out. Correct by
