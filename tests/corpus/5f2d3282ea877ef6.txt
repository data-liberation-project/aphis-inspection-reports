ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
An Inspection was attempted at the home site on November 1st, 2016 at 1230 PM, knocked on the door and called
the licensee. Received a call back from the licensee on November 3rd, with a message that the licensee is
traveling and has moved on from the previously submitted itinerary. As the home inspector, no recent itineraries
have been received and the Ft Collins office confirmed that no additional itineraries have been submitted from this
licensee.
At time of this inspection, no current itinerary has been received by USDA-APHIS-Animal Care that accounts for this
travel. In the case of traveling exhibitors, itineraries must be submitted to USDA via fax, mail, or electronic mail at
least two days prior to any overnight travel. The itinerary shall include the exact address, dates, number of animals,
name of the person exhibiting and transporting the animal, etc. Itineraries are necessary to ensure the welfare of
the animals through unannounced inspections.
Correct for all future travel.
Exit interview conducted with licensee via phone.
