MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
**NHPs are restrained in a specialized primate chair when they are transferred from their housing room to testing
laboratories located outside the vivarium. The chair with the NHP is then placed inside a plastic transport container
equipped with a cover during the time of the transport. The only source of ventilation for the transport container are
10 holes each approximately 3/16 inch in diameter that had been added to the cover. According to the facility’s
SOP for transport of un-anesthetized NHPs within the main building, only sound proof and ventilated carriers will be
used.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the handling of animals by all personnel, including laboratory staff, should be
done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause overheating, physical harm, behavioral stress, or
unnecessary discomfort.
The design of the plastic transport container that is being used does not include an adequate number nor placement
of openings to ensure sufficient ventilation for the NHP during the time when the animal is inside the container and
being transferred between the housing room and the testing laboratories. Sufficient ventilation is important to
provide for the health and well-being of the animals.
The research facility needs to evaluate the current transport container and ensure it provides sufficient ventilation
for transport, and if inadequate, procure another type of transport container that meets the requirements for
ventilation to ensure the safety and well-being of the animals.
Correct by 6/1/17.
2.38(f)(2)(ii)
MISCELLANEOUS.Withholding of Water.
**Pertaining to Protocol #489: The protocol includes water scheduling in NHPs and states that when the NHPs are
being tested and under water scheduling, they will be weighed twice a week. A review of the records revealed that
an NHP was tested daily under water scheduling during the week of 4/3/17. The NHP was weighed on 4/3/17 and
the next time the NHP was weighed was on 4/10/17.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the withholding of water when specified in an IACUC-approved activity is
permitted provided the proposal for animal use includes a description of the monitoring procedures. Although the
proposal does include appropriate monitoring procedures, laboratory staff failed to follow the approved procedures.
Animals under fluid scheduling need to be monitored in order to ensure their health and well-being.
The research facility needs to ensure that monitoring procedures for animals under fluid scheduling are being
followed as per the IACUC approved protocol.
Correct from this date 4/13/17 forward.

SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
**The exhaust vent cover located in the ceiling of the cage wash room was noted to be very soiled with dirt and
particulate material. Cleaned cages and husbandry items that are removed from the cage washer pass directly
under this vent.
Per this Section of the Regulations, premises shall be kept clean in order to facilitate prescribed husbandry
practices. The presence of dirt and particulate debris on the surfaces of a ceiling mounted vent cover does not
constitute good housekeeping and husbandry practices, as well as can serve as a source of possible contamination
of the clean caging and equipment that are being removed from the cage washer.
The ceiling vent needs to be cleaned and the research facility needs to review its housekeeping practices and
ensure that all staff are familiar with these practices in order to maintain the cleanliness of the premises.
Correct from this date forward 4/13/17.NOTE – Inspection conducted 4/12/17 and 4/13/17. Exit briefing held 4/13/17 on-site with facility representatives.
