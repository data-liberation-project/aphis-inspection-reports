ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Several new species of exotic animals have been added to this facility in the past few months. The instructions
for parasite control on the Program of Veterinary Care need more detail. Section III for Wild and Exotic Animals
(dingos, fox, wolves, goats, pigs) lists "Advantics" and other instructions that aren't readable for ectoparasites. For
intestinal parasites it states "Goats - Alternating deworm every 4 wks. The line below that states "Panacur
Regularly - fecal floats as deemed necessary." It is unclear if the Panacur instructions apply to all the animals or
just the goat. It also doesn't state what products should be alternated for the goat. Section IV for Other
Warmblooded Animals (rabbits, chinchilla, kangaroo, kinkajou, coatimundi, porcupine, cavy, groundhog) instructs
"examined by owners daily and treated if found. NO Frontline Toxic" for ectoparasites. However, there are no
instructions on what product to use or a dose the licensee is to use if ectoparasites are found. Some, but not all,
products being used at the facility had labels from a veterinarian. Unclear or incomplete instructions for the Program
of Veterinary Care can result in the wrong product or the wrong dose being used for the animals. The Attending
Veterinarian must provide clear, specific instructions regarding product, dose, and dosing interval for any
medications that the licensee or his staff are allowed to give the animals. It must also be noted if the licensee is
required to consult the Attending Veterinarian before giving medication to any specific animals.

***A bottle of Pyrantel Pamoate labeled for use in humans was being used for the animals and had an expiration
date of 04/15. Expired medications or vaccines can lose their effectiveness and their ability to prevent or control
disease and/or pain. The licensee must ensure that all medications and vaccines are within their expiration dates at
all times.

2.131(d)(2)HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
One attendant was present in the area of the facility that housed the animals that the public was allowed to contact.
These animals included a kangaroo, a goat, rabbits, a hedgehog, and chinchilla. Because these animals were
located in separate rooms, the attendant was not able to observe the public contact of all the animals at the same
time. Public contact with animals can result in injury to the animals or to the public; therefore, a knowledgeable
attendant must be able to intervene if necessary. The licensee must ensure that an adequate number of
responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable attendants are present at all times during periods of public
contact.

The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with facility representatives.
