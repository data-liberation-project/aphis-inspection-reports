3.6(a)(2)(x) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In one enclosure, containing one adult dog and three puppies, the flooring is constructed of wire. The puppies are
lying on the wire flooring and two puppies were observed to have their hind feet and legs passing through the
flooring. Openings in the flooring that are large enough to allow an animal's leg to pass through can cause injury to
the animal.
Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from
injury and do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through openings in the floor. The licensee must replace the flooring or
alter it in a manner that does not allow the puppy's feet or legs to pass through. The licensee must ensure that the
enclosure flooring is safe for the dogs at all times. The licensee moved the puppies into a whelping box during the
inspection.
