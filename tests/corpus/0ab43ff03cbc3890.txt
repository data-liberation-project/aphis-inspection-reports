2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
No acquisition and/or disposition records for the following animals were available for review by the inspector during this
inspection: 5 zebras, 2 Arabian oryx, and 1 addax. Missing records can put animal health at risk due to inability to track
the transport and locations of animals and the potential delays in conducting timely epidemiologic investigations during
disease monitoring activities. Per the regulations, each dealer shall make, keep and maintain records or forms which fully
and correctly disclose the items contained in (b)(1)(i - vii) for all animals acquired or disposed by the dealer.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
No perimeter fence was in place around the following subadult animals: 3 nilgai, 1 black buck and 1 impala. Not having
the required perimeter fence in place puts the animals at risk of escape and/or improper contact by animals or people. Per
the regulations, all outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep
animals and unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 6 feet high and 3 feet from the primary enclosure must be
approved by the Administrator. Corrected during inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
