3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Several holes are in the ground around both the Sheltered Building and the Outdoor Housing that appear to be
made by rodents. There is no way to tell if these were recently dug, or are old. The facility representative showed
us a few bait boxes that had been purchased, but had not yet been set up. In addition, there is an overgrowth of
weeds around the Whelping Building, and weeds are starting to be overgrown around the sheltered and outdoor
housing facilities.
Overgrown weeds create a breeding ground and living area for pests, rodents, and other vermin causing possible
disease hazards to the dogs.
These weeds and grasses must be continuously controlled to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for
rodents, pests, and other vermin. The licensee must establish and maintain an effective program for the control of
insects, external parasites, and bird and mammal pests, to promote the health and well-being of the animals and to
reduce contamination by pests in all animal areas as part of the facility’s regular plan.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
