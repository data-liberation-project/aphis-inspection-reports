FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one goat enclosure, there was a large piece of plywood on the ground. The material was originally attached to the
fence side wall of the enclosure. In an adjacent enclosure, the plywood wall was heavily chewed and the wood was
splintering. Failure to maintain animal housing facilities in good repair may adversely affect their health and
well-being. Outdoor housing facilities should be structurally sound and should be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury.

SANITATION.
At the goat unit, there was an accumulation of fecal material in 3 animal runs not currently housing animals.The
runs were located across from the enclosures that currently house goats. Accumulations of waste materials can
attract flies and other flying insects as well as produce odors to animal areas. A system should be in place and
maintained that removes waste products from animal areas as often as needed to minimize pests and odors.
