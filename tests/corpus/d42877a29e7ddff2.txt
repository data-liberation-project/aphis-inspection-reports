ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 4:30 pm on
31-AUG-17.
On Thursday, August 31, 2017, between 4:30 pm and 5:15 pm, a responsible person was not available to conduct
an inspection. Representatives were present at the facility and said licensee had left on an errand and that they
were uncomfortable with leading the inspector through the facility. Inspector attempted to contact licensee by calling
cell and home numbers and leaving messages. This is the first attempted inspection.
The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was
not able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
Correct from this day forward.
