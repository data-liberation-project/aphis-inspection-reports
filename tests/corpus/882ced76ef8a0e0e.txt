Handling of animals.
On the morning of October 5th, 2020, an approximately 8.5- to 9-week old male Oriental Small-Clawed Otter pup was
found dead in its enclosure. The licensee stated that the day before, the pup had been used in 12 to 15 public encounters.
Encounters are advertised as lasting 30 minutes, but the licensee stated that they usually lasted 5 to 15 minutes each.
During public encounters, members of the public could hold and play with the otter pup. The licensee stated that the otter
pup appeared to be normal and had a normal appetite the evening before it died. The licensee stated that after
discovering the dead pup he contacted the attending veterinarian, and both he and the veterinarian believe that the pup
died as a result of stress from the previous day’s public encounters and handling. The attending veterinarian was
contacted and confirmed this conclusion.
Young otter pups can be easily stressed. Behavioral or psychological stress can occur due to separation from the mother
otter and litter mates, as otters are known to be highly social animals. Stress to the body can occur easily: Due to their
small size and young age, otter pups can easily become dehydrated, injured, exhausted, or cold. The excitation and
activity caused by public encounters can also lead to low blood sugar, which can be deadly. Prolonged stress can lead to
decreased function of the immune system, increased susceptibility to infections, increased risk of diarrhea, and reduced
growth.


Correct by handling young or immature animals in a manner and for periods of time that are consistent with maintaining
their health and well-being. Correct by October 28th, 2020.

Primary enclosures.
One female adult black lop-eared rabbit was housed in an wire cage that was 12 inches tall. The licensee stated that this
rabbit had been separated from the other rabbits and placed in this cage because she was possibly pregnant. Rabbits
require adequate space in order to make normal physical, postural, and behavioral adjustments. Correct by November
1st, 2020, by housing the rabbit in an enclosure that provides at least 14 inches of vertical space.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner and attending veterinarian.
