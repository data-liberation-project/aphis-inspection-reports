HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One lower metal support pipe beneath one dog shelter in the east side of the kennel is rusted to the point that
sections are missing.

other debris.

structurally sound.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Excreta covered a large portion (approximately a third of the floor space) of the outdoor section of one sheltered
whelping enclosures. According to the owner, this enclosure was cleaned 2 days ago. Accumulation of excreta can
soil the dogs, increase disease transmission, and attract flies and other pests. Excreta and food waste must be
removed from primary enclosures on a daily basis. To be corrected by 7 April 2016.
