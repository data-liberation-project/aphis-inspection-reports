Facilities, general.
The facility has several structures in animal enclosures that are in disrepair and can lead to injury.
*** In the Coop Yard, there is a silo with large areas of flaking paint that can fall directly into the pasture.
*** In the South Paddock, there is a metal electrical box with flaking paint that is accessible to the animals. The shade
shelter structure has a wooden roof with a broken board that is falling into the enclosure.
*** In the North Pasture, the back wall of the barn forms a barrier of the pasture. The wall has flaking paint at the level of
the animals and a hole in the outer wooden boards about 10-12” in diameter. One section of the top rail that the barn door
rolls along has broken free and is hanging down over the pasture. This pasture contains goats, sheep, cattle, and alpaca.
Flaking paint that falls off into enclosures can be consumed by animals and lead to potential illness. Shelter structures
that are in disrepair can cause injury to the animals within the enclosure.
Correct by 14 April 2022 by ensuring that outdoor housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury.
