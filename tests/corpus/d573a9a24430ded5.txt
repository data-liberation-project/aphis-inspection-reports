ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1330 on
09-Jan-18. I knocked on the door and a family member answered. She informed me the licensee was not home
and would not be home anytime soon. She informed me no one was available to do the inspection. I informed her I
would send out the Attempted Inspection report and we would try again another day.
End of report.
