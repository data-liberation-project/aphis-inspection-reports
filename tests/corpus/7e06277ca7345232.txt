3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
On the right side of the large sheep shed, there were two areas of wire paneling, between the two main pens, that are in a
state of disrepair. The first wire panel is bent upwards from the concrete curb which allows for sharp points to project into
the pens. The second wire panel, at the far end of the building, is also bent away from the horizontal metal supports,
approximately 1 foot into the adult pen of sheep, and has sharp points projecting into the pen near the vertical support
post.
Failure to maintain enclosure fencing can allow for sharp points or unstable structures which can result in injury or
entrapment of the animals.
Facilities shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and contain them.

3.127(a)

Facilities, outdoor.
The licensee has recently started to allow some of the adult sheep to graze on pastures surrounding the facility which do
not have access to shade or shelter.
A lack of shade could subject the sheep to direct sunlight which can cause overheating or discomfort during the summer


months.
Sufficient shade by natural or artificial means shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves
from direct sunlight.
