2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee stated the written Program of Veterinary Care was mistakenly thrown away so it was not available for
review at the time of inspection. There was also no record of the Attending Veterinarian's last visit to the facility and
the licensee didn't know when that visit occurred. A written Program of Veterinary Care is necessary so APHIS
inspectors can ensure that adequate veterinary care is being provided for the animals at all times. The licensee
must ensure that a written Program of Veterinary Care is available for inspection. Furthermore, the licensee should
record the Attending Veterinarian's regularly scheduled visits to the facility.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: 18 December 2015
The inspection and a verbal exit interview were conducted with the licensee and a facility representative.
