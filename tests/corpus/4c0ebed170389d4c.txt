ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1025 on
20-Dec-16. I went to the licensee's house and she informed me that she was just getting ready to leave. She
informed me that there was no one else available to do the inspection with me. I informed her that I would be
mailing out the attempted inspection report and that I would try to catch her another time.
End of report.
