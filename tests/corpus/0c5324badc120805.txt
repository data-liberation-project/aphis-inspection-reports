3.8(a)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
Five French Bulldogs were housed individually. The written exercise plan that was present at the kennel did not
provide guidance for individually housed dogs. The licensee stated that the dogs went into the exercise yard once a
week for a half an hour weather permitting. The attending veterinarian was consulted by the inspector about their
guidance for these animals and the licensee did not meet the requirements they indicated, if a dog was individually
housed.
Three enclosures measuring 51 x 31 inches (10.98 sq feet) housed one dog each. Each of those dogs were
approximately 25 inches long. Dogs of this size require 6.67 sq feet of minimum space under section 3.6(c)(1).
They require an additional 6.67 sq. feet of space (13.35 sq. feet total) to meet all of their exercise requirements
within their primary enclosure.
Two enclosures measuring 32 x 31 inches (6.89 sq feet) housed one dog each. Each of those dogs were
approximately 20 inches long. Dogs of this size require 4.69 sq feet of minimum space under section 3.6(c)(1).
They require an additional 4.69 sq. feet of space (9.38 sq. feet total) to meet all of their exercise requirements within
their primary enclosure.
Section 3.8(c)(3) provides additional options for meeting dogs exercise requirements such as access to a run or
open area at the frequency and duration prescribed by the attending veterinarian, however, the licensee is neither
meeting the minimum space requirements for exercise within the primary enclosure, nor the Attending
Veterinarian’s guidance for exercise outside of the enclosure.
The lack of appropriate exercise can affect the dogs’ mental and physical health, and impact the growth of young
dogs. The licensee must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan for exercise. In addition, the plan must
be approved by the attending veterinarian, and made available for APHIS upon request. The dogs must be
provided the opportunity to exercise regularly at the frequency and duration prescribed by the attending
veterinarian, if they are kept individually in cages, pens, or runs that provide less than two times the required floor
space for that dog, as indicated by 3.6(c)(1) of this subpart.To be corrected by: June 27, 2018
