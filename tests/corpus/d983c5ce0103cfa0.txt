ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult coatimundi named "Spencer", which was on display to the public prior to the death of the mountain lion,
died at this facility on July 19, 2014 with a confirmed diagnosis of Yersinia pestis. A dead rat was found in the
indoor part of the coatimundi enclosure on July 21, 2014 and was taken to the department of health for testing.
Evidence of rodent activity (burrows with piles of debris accumulations such as sticks and other plant material) is
still present in the area around the primary enclosures housing the bear, porcupine, and raccoons. At the time of
inspection there was no documentation of recent communication with the attending veterinarian on the health issue
of the coatimundi. Rodents and fleas are known to be involved in the transmission of Yersinia pestis.
Appropriate veterinary preventative care and pest control methods must be developed and maintained, in
consultation with the attending veterinarian, to prevent, diagnose, and treat disease, in order to protect the health
and well-being of all animals at this facility.

north side of the barrier fence is not secured to the post leaving a gap where the public could potentially gain access
to the bobcat enclosure.
Barriers must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals and public safety.
