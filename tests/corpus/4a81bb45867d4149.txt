ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:50pm on
02-OCT-19.
I arrived at the facility, knocked on the door and called out with no response. I then called the provided phone
number and left a message. After several minutes I was able to speak with an employee who stated the licensee
would not be available for an inspection that day. I then left the facility.
