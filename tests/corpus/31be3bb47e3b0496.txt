Watering
One enclosure housing two Shiba Inus has no water in the water bowl. The dogs drank normally when water was given.
The licensee says the water bowls are usually filled at least twice a day. All other enclosures had water. Water must be
continuously available to dogs. The situation was corrected immediately and the licensee will be connecting an automatic
watering system within the next week.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
