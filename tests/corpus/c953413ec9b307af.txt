2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A female hedgehog, cage card 51 F, has a wound on the skin adjacent to her left eye. There is a scab, approximately
one centimeter in diameter, above the wound. The wound has inflammation around the edges with mild amounts of red
material present. The licensee indicated she didn’t see the lesion when the animal was observed two days ago. I asked
the licensee how often the animals are observed, and she replied she observes them every two days. Daily observation
of all animals is necessary to assess their health and well-being, so problems of animal health are conveyed to the
veterinarian in a timely manner. Contact the veterinarian regarding this animal’s condition. Ensure any prescribed
treatments and/or instructions are completed.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The disposition records for every hedgehog sold in 2021 are incomplete. Over fifteen disposition records are missing the
licensee's name and address as the seller of the animals. Records containing all the information in 2.75(b)(1) are
necessary to document animal sales. Ensure disposition records contain all the information required in 2.75(b)(1) of the
Animal Welfare Act.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.

A cat litter box containing excessive amounts of cat feces is adjacent to the hedgehog enclosures. Without proper
cleaning, the litter box can create poor air quality in and around the hedgehog enclosures. Ensure the hedgehog housing
area is kept clean to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.
