3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two areas housing nonhuman primates had surfaces that can come into contact with these animals that were
rusted and could prevent the required cleaning and sanitization:
**The off-exhibit area for white-cheeked gibbons had rust around the light fixtures within the enclosures.
**The off-exhibit area for Celebes macaques had rusted surfaces around the metal beams and the shift door.
Rusted surfaces can no longer be adequately cleaned and sanitized and may harbor infectious or harmful agents,
posing a risk to the health of the animals.
Any surfaces that come in contact with nonhuman primates must be free of rust that prevents the required cleaning
and sanitization.
To be corrected by 9/6/2014.
3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following surfaces in nonhuman primate housing facilities were in disrepair such that they can not be readily
cleaned and sanitized:
**Several off-exhibit enclosures in the Emerald Forest building had broken and cracked concrete flashing (EF39,
EF31, EF27, EF36, EF35).
**The concrete entry way for the shift door between the off-exhibit enclosure and the island exhibit for red-ruffed
lemurs had a broken surface that exposed porous and unsealed concrete and stone material.
Two wooden nest boxes for aye-aye's, one in the off-exhibit area and one in the main exhibit in the Emerald Forest
building, were excessively chewed and shredded. There were numerous holes with deep gouges in the painted
wooden surfaces which can no longer be readily cleaned and sanitized.Material, such as excreta and food debris, can become embedded or flushed into and underneath the cracked and
broken concrete surfaces or can accumulate in the shredded/unpainted wooden surfaces of the nest boxes. These
can not be readily cleaned and sanitized so pose a risk to the health of the animals.
Surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the
facility--that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.
To be corrected by 9/19/2014.
3.101(a)(3)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several chain link panels and the bottom support posts were excessively rusted in the off-exhibit pool area (SL4,
SL5, and corner of SL6) for California sea lions and harbor seals. The surfaces were no longer covered by paint
and were corroded such that the rusted surfaces appeared "bubbled".
These surfaces are no longer in good repair and cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized which can lead to an
accumulation of infectious or harmful agents, posing a risk to the health of the animals.
All surfaces must be maintained in good repair as part of a regular, ongoing maintenance program.
A permanent fix for this problem, along with a plan for an ongoing maintenance program, will be decided by
10/30/2014.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
A mineral block feed supplement for 6 red river hogs was placed on the ground in the enclosure. The mineral block
had a brownish material on most of its surface and was adjacent to a muddy, high-traffic area in the enclosure.
This feed supplement was not placed in a manner to minimize contamination from dirt or excreta, posing a risk to
the health of the animals.
Food and feed supplements shall be sufficient in quantity and located so as to be accessible to all animals in the
enclosure and shall be placed so as to minimize contamination.
To be corrected by 8/31/2014.Inspection and exit interview conducted on 8/19/2014 with facility representatives, AC VMO, and APHIS extern.
