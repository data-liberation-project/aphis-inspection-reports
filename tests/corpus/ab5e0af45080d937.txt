PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
This was a focused inspection regarding the Syrian brown bear cub.
On 27 October 2014 the facility was transporting a Syrian brown bear cub between facility sites. The bear cub was
housed in a sky kennel primary enclosure secured with wire inside the transport trailer. During transportation the
bear cub was able to escape its enclosure. While making a rest stop the bear cub was able to break through the
sliding ventilation window and escape the trailer. The facility was unaware of the escape until they reached their
final destination. The bear cub was recovered by local authorities with no injuries.
The facility failed to ensure the primary enclosure was of sufficient structural strength to contain the animal. This
resulted in its escape and may have resulted in injury to the animal or the public.
Ensure that all primary enclosures used to transport animals meet the standards by being of sufficient strength to
contain the animals, to withstand the rigors of transport and prevent escapes. Correct immediately.
Note: The facility has initiated correction of this noncompliance at the time of inspection.
