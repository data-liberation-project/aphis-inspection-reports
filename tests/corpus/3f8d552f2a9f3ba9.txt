ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One Great Pyrenees dog named JJ is in need of grooming services. The back half of both his sides are covered by
thick mats. Mats may lead to skin irritation and even more serious skin conditions and may cause discomfort to the
dog. Regular grooming to prevent matting of the haircoat for the dogs shall be made available as part of an
adequate program of veterinary care. Correct by August 16, 2014.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During today's inspection, the inspectors monitored instructions being given to the public at the admittance kiosk
and then monitored interactions of the public with the animals both on the employee driven tractor/trailer and with
the public driving their own vehicles through the drive thru portion of the park. Upon paying their admittance fees,
the public was instructed not to leave their vehicle. They were then given instructions verbally on how to feed the
different species including the instruction to feed the zebras only by dropping feed onto the ground. There were no
signs noted anywhere on the premises or on any handouts to advise the public how to interact with the animals. In
the drive thru part of the park, numerous instances were observed where there was more than a minimal risk of
harm to the animals and/or to the public as a sufficient distance and/or barrier between the animal and the public
were not maintained:
*The tractor/trailer with about 20 people on it stopped. Animals surrounded the trailer. Several elk pushed their
upper body over a wooden gate at the back of the trailer and into the trailer itself. Several people at this end of the
trailer were noted jumping up and pushing further into the interior of the trailer as the elk pushed their heads and
upper body into the trailer.
*Private vehicles were noted with windows open and the people inside placing their arms and hands outside of the
vehicle to hand feed and pet animals including bison, zebra, elk, deer and llamas. Occasionally a person would put
their head outside the window to look at the animals more closely. No responsible, knowledgeable and readily
identifiable employee or attendant was present at the time.
*Private vehicles were noted with windows completely open and the animals including llamas, bison, elk and deer
placing their entire head and necks into the window openings. No responsible, knowledgeable and readilyidentifiable employee or attendant was present at the time.
*A pickup truck holding two adults in the front seat had two additional teenagers sitting in beach type lounge chairs
in the bed of the pickup truck. They were feeding animals from the bed of the pickup truck. Animals were
surrounding the bed of the truck.
Lack of sufficient barriers or distance between the animals and the public can lead to injury including potential bites
or scratches to the public and injury to the animals. Animals may be injured in open windows especially those
species with antlers/horns or by being fed something other than the feed being sold by the facility. During public
exhibitions, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public with
sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and the general viewing public or a responsible
knowledgeable and readily identifiable attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact in
order to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by July 30, 2014.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are three donkeys and two goats that share an enclosure which includes one small three sided shelter. This
shelter is not large enough for all five animals to be able to fit comfortably in the shelter at the same time if needed.
An adequately sized shelter (or shelters) needs to be available to fit all the animals in an enclosure for the protection
of the outdoor animals during inclement weather and to prevent discomfort.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are two holes at the bottom of the perimeter fence that surrounds the part of the petting zoo area housing
cavy, sheep, and an alpaca. The larger hole measures 9 to 10 inches in height and is approximately a foot wide.
The perimeter fence needs to be repaired or replaced in order to prevent physical contact between animals inside
the enclosures and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence, to prevent unwanted animals from entering the
area by going under the fence and to act as a secondary containment system for the animals in the area. Correct by
July 30, 2014.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
The alpaca enclosure contains a black plastic food receptacle which has been placed on top of the alpaca(cid:25)'s pile of
feces. The receptacle has pelleted feed in it. Spilled feed has mixed in with the feces on the ground adjacent to the
receptacle. Flies are present. All food receptacles need to be placed so as to minimize contamination. Food
receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times in order to prevent contamination. Correct by July 20, 2014.3.131(c)
SANITATION.
*There is a white electical cord hanging low across the back fence line of the wallaby enclosure; it appears to have
fallen down to a level at which the wallaby can reach the cord from a hook hanging up higher on the fence. This
cord then continues to the wallaby shelter and the white socket end of the wire is visible hanging down into the
opening of the wallaby enclosure. It is within easy reach of the wallaby. Chewing or pulling on an electrical cord can
lead to injury of an animal. Cords need to be secured so the animals cannot access them.
*The enclosure housing the blackbuck and two oryx contains a large number of weeds many of which are over a
foot tall. The animals have made some tracks to reach their shelters and along the back fenceline and corner where
they like to congregate. Weeds can harbor pests such as ticks, may be toxic and make cleaning difficult. Weeds
should be removed or controlled.
Premises shall be kept in good condition/repair and cleared as necessary in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. Correct by July 30, 2014.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
The facility currently does not have enough employees to care for all the animals, maintain the animal enclosures
and deal with the public related aspects (including monitoring interactions of the public and the animals) of the
business. During the inspection today there was one full time employee trying to handle daily observation of over
100 animals, feeding them, supplying clean fresh water and taking care of any enclosure issues. Two other
employees and one volunteer (none of whom are trained on direct animal care) were handling the front admission
gate and driving the tractors/trailers used to drive the public through the drive thru portion of the park. The caretaker
is trained and responsible for feeding and watering but the facility lacks an animal husbandry/curator type person
with training and a background in the standards of care for the animals housed at the facility. This is substantiated
by the numerous citations on this report and a history similar issues recurring from inspection to inspection (repeat
non-compliances). There needs to be a responsible person observing all animals daily for possible issues/problems.
Lack of an adequate number of trained employees working under a knowledgeable supervisor can lead to
inadequate care of the animals. The facility shall maintain a sufficient number of trained employees working under a
knowledgeable supervisor to maintain a professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices.
