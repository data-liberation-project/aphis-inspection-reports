2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A small white hornless ram (Bangs tag KY 9157, stall tag 362) was found deceased by the inspectors in the main sale
barn of the facility. When the auction staff and on-site veterinarian were notified by inspectors, they were unaware of the
animal’s condition. At the time of discovery, the animal was laterally recumbent and partially covered with straw. The ram
had not undergone any obvious postmortem changes, including rigidity. There were no other animals present in the stall.
Hay and water were present.
When animals aren’t observed adequately on a daily basis, health conditions and behavior changes can be missed,
leading to progression of disease or injury, including death. The licensee must ensure that adequate daily observations
are made for all animals, and timely and accurate information regarding animal health, behavior, and well- being are
communicated directly and frequently to the attending veterinarian. Correct by 09/16/2022.

Handling of animals.
During the auction, members of the public were observed walking into a holding area containing caged, potentially
dangerous, animals including skunks, raccoons, foxes, kinkajou, and coyotes. This area is behind secondary fencing
which has posted signs stating, “please keep hands out of pens,” “danger very aggressive animals,” and “please keep
gate closed.” Despite the signs, members of the public were observed inside the secondary fence, and many were

attempting to touch or pet the animals. One member of the public commented that one coyote was friendly and allowed
her to pet the animal. At this point, no facility employees were present to deter the public from handling the animals. The
inspectors notified several staff members and the show veterinarian of the animal contact, however, a consistent
attendant was not present in this area to observe the public during the duration of the auction.
In the hoofstock barn, members of the public were observed touching, petting, and hugging a large mature dromedary
camel. The camel was able to put his head over the gate which allowed him to be at the level of the public walking
through the barn. No facility employees were observed in this area of the hoofstock barn to deter the public from
interacting with the animals. When notified, the facility added an additional wire panel to one of the gates of the
enclosure, however, the other gate remained the same and still allowed for contact.
Failure to ensure appropriate distance and/or barriers, can allow for unintended interactions and lead to harm to the
animals or the public members. The facility is responsible for safe exhibition of the animals while on auction grounds,
including sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animals and general viewing public so as to assure the safety of
both animals and the public. Correct by: 9/17/2022
2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
During the auction, members of the public were observed petting a dromedary camel and touching numerous smaller
mammals (fox, skunk, kinkajou, and coyotes). In these areas, the facility did not have readily identifiable employees on
hand during the public interactions with the animals. The facility has signage trying to deter people from touching the
animals, however, members of the public continued to contact the animals.
A lack of readily identifiable attendants to deter the public from contacting the animals can allow for unintended
interactions which could lead to harm to the animals or members of the public. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily,

identifiable employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact whether intended or not.

Primary enclosures used to transport live rabbits.
A majority of the primary transport enclosures for the rabbits did not contain easily accessible openings, projecting rims,
or adequate handholds. Approximately, 90% of these enclosures did not contain openings to allow easy access in case
of an emergency with the rabbit. 95% of the enclosures also did not have projecting rims to ensure adequate ventilation is
maintained or handholds to prevent tilting and contact with the animal. Sharp, broken wires, were also observed in 3 of
the rabbit enclosures
A lack of appropriate openings, projecting rims, and handholds on primary transport enclosures can make it difficult to
remove the animal in the case of an emergency, allow for inadequate ventilation if the cages are stacked, and can cause
unintentional contact between the handler and the animal during transport. Sharp points or protrusions can also cause
injury to the animals.
All primary transport enclosure for rabbits must contain openings that are easily accessible at all times for emergency
removal of live animals, contain projecting rims or other devices on the exterior walls to prevent obstruction of the
ventilation, and provide adequate handholds for lifting animals without tilting or risk of contact with the animal. Primary
enclosure must also be free from any protrusions that could be injurious to the live rabbits. Correct by 9/30/2022.
3.61(f)

Primary enclosures used to transport live rabbits.
None of the primary transport enclosures for the rabbits were marked with the words “Live Animal” or arrows indicating
the correct upright position of the cage. Approximately 192 rabbits were observed in enclosures missing these markings.
Failure to clearly mark transport enclosures can allow for inappropriate handling of the cages as its contents and position

may be unclear to the staff. Primary enclosures used to transport live rabbits must be marked with the words “Live
Animal” in letters at least 1 inch in height, and with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the
container. Correct by 9/30/2022.
3.66(c)

Handling.
After being consigned to the auction, several of the rabbit enclosures were stacked 3-4 enclosures high and tightly packed
together on a large wagon. The stacking of these enclosures allowed for decreased ventilation to the interior rabbits and
tilting of many of the enclosures.
Inappropriate stacking of enclosures can allow for decreased ventilation and unstable structures which can impact rabbit
health and safety. Primary enclosures used to transport rabbits must not be needlessly tilted or stacked in a manner
which may result in their falling. The facility restacked the enclosures onto an additional wagon shortly after the
observations were made. Correct by 9/17/22.
3.125(a) Direct

Facilities, general.
While the inspection team was observing an adult female white-tailed deer, she became entrapped in the gap between
the gate and wall of the enclosure. The cervid area of the main sale barn, is constructed of wood with tall extensions on
the walls, to contain the deer, and 2 gates on opposite walls. The front gate had an extra wooden piece blocking the
space between the gate and wall, but the back gate was not constructed in this manner, allowing access to the gap
between the gate and wall. Prior to the incident, the singly housed deer, in a double stall (#110), appeared stressed and
was darting around the enclosure, trying to climb the walls of the wooden stall. The deer jumped into a corner of the stall
and as she slid down, her left front leg became entrapped in the gap between the wooden gate and wall of the stall, where
the gate latched. The deer started thrashing, pulling, and twisting her body, trying to free her leg, which was caught at the

narrow part just above her joint. No staff members were immediately nearby so the inspector assisted the deer to dislodge
her leg by lifting it up and back into the enclosure before she could more seriously harm herself. The doe limped away
and then stood, holding her leg up while open mouth breathing. The on-site attending veterinarian was notified
immediately.
Inappropriately constructed enclosures which create gaps or holes can allow for the entrapment, serious injury, or death
of the animals. The facility must be constructed in a manner that is appropriate for the animals involved to protect them
from injury and contain them. Correct by 09/16/2022.

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
Several of the primary transport enclosures for the small mammals, including degus, spiny mice, skunks, and coyotes, did
not contain easily accessible openings, projecting rims, or adequate handholds. Approximately 30% of these enclosures
did not contain openings or doors to allow easy access in case of an emergency with the live animal. 40-50% of the
enclosures holding these small mammals also did not have projecting rims to ensure adequate ventilation is maintained or
handholds to prevent tilting and contact with the animal.
A lack of appropriate openings, projecting rims, and handholds on primary transport enclosures can make it difficult to
remove the animal in the case of an emergency, allow for inadequate ventilation if the cages are stacked, and can cause
unintentional contact between the handler and the animal during transport. All primary transport enclosure for subpart F
animals must contain openings that are easily accessible at all times for emergency removal of live animals, contain
projecting rims or other devices on the exterior walls to prevent obstruction of the ventilation, and provide adequate
handholds for lifting animals without tilting or risk of contact with the animal. Correct by 9/30/2022.

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.

In the warm housing area, 19 sugar glider enclosures containing 38 sugar gliders did not have solid bottoms or pans to
collect the animal excreta or food and water waste. The cages were placed on racks with bars which allowed for any
spilled feed, water, or feces to fall on and into the enclosures underneath.
A wire multi-level chinchilla enclosure located near the main auction ring had an excessive accumulation of excreta on all
levels of the enclosure. The enclosure housed 3 chinchillas and offered very little space for the animals to move without
having to walk through their own excrement.
A wire enclosure with a wooden bottom located in the warm room that held 1 albino African crested porcupine had wood
shavings as bedding that were completely soaked in excreta and water waste. The animal had no available option to
move onto a dry surface.
Failure to properly clean and sanitize primary enclosures can lead to disease hazards and increased odors. Primary
enclosures that do not have solid bottoms can allow for excreta or food waste to spill into other areas of the facility which
can contaminate enclosures, and potentially introduce disease hazards to other animals. Primary enclosures used to
transport must be cleaned and sanitized in a manor prescribed in 3.131 of the standards. All primary enclosures used to
transport live subpart F animals must have solid bottoms to prevent leakage and contamination of other areas. Correct by
9/30/2022.

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
None of the primary transport enclosures for the subpart F mammals including degus, foxes, skunks, bobcats,
hedgehogs, and many other species, were marked with the words “Live Animal”/ “Wild Animal” or had arrows indicating
the correct upright position of the cage.
Failure to clearly mark transport enclosures can allow for inappropriate handling of the cages as its contents and position
may be unclear to the staff. Primary enclosures used to transport live subpart F animals must be marked with the words

“Live Animal” or “Wild Animal” in letters at least 1 inch in height, and with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct
