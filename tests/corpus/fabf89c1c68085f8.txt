FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the pig enclosure there was a floor drain cover missing, exposing the pipe underneath. This created a gap that
the pigs could step into and possibly become injured. The facility needs to be maintained in good repair in order to
protect the animals from injury.
********This issue has since been corrected
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
