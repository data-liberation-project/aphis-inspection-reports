3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures in the small dog building are raised off the ground and at least three of the enclosures, containing
approximately six dogs, have a wooden door that has bowed outward at the bottom creating a gap between the
door and the enclosure floor. The gaps are large enough for the leg of a dog to fall through which could result in
injury to the animals.
Housing facilities for dogs must be designed and constructed so they are structurally sound, kept in good repair and
protect the animals from injury. The licensee must alter the enclosures in a manner that eliminates the gap between
the enclosure floor and the bowed wooden doors to protect the dogs from potential injury. The licensee must ensure
that all enclosures are safe for the animals at all times.

3.1(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are twelve enclosures, containing at least twenty dogs, that have a wooden door with a hook screwed to the
front that latches the door shut. The sharp end of each of the screws has penetrated through the wooden doors
and into the enclosures. These sharp points are located at the level of the dogs and contact with them could result
in injury to the animals.
Surfaces of housing facilities must be free of jagged edges and sharp points. The licensee must remove the sharp
points of the screws to eliminate the risk of injury to the animals. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are
free of any sharp points and jagged edges at all times.
