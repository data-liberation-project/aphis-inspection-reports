Housing facilities, general.
On July 19, 2021 in modular 31D there was an unresponsive infant rhesus macaque showing signs of dehydration with a
poor prognosis which was euthanized. However, the dam was slightly underconditioned with adequate hydration and was
placed on conservative treatment. The facility conducted daily study observations mid to late Monday morning with no
indication of dehydration in any of the animals in the building . On July 20, 2021 two infant rhesus macaque deaths were
reported and two infant rhesus macaques were reported unresponsive, and a third was reported dehydrated, but aware of
it's surroundings. The attending veterinarian was notified of the water issue and treated all 3 animals. By the end of the
day one macaque responded well to treatment while the others did not, and they were euthanized. Animal Resources
confirmed that the lixits were working properly on Monday, but it was determined on Tuesday that there was a reduction in
water pressure to the lixits. At this point, the water was shut off to prevent bloat, and all animals housed in the building
were supplemented with water until the water supply was deemed functional. Upon further investigation, it was
determined by the Physical Facility personnel that the pressure regulator to the the housing room/lixits was not working
properly, thus reducing the water pressure to the animal room excessively. The housing facility must provide reliable
running potable water for a nonhuman primates’ drinking needs to prevent dehydration. The facility has implemented
several corrective actions including daily manual checks and records of water pressure, monthly water flow confirmation


checks, water flow monitoring plan and facility water system evaluations to identify points of risk for additional monitoring.
The Center is offering the animals more high-water content supplements and all infant studies will consistently include
twice daily observations. The facility is in the process of utilizing a Building Automation System based automatic pressure
monitoring and alarm system to receive alerts for pressure values outside of acceptable ranges. Correct from this day
forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
