3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Surfaces must be free of excessive rust that can prevent required cleaning/sanitizing and also have good structural
strength. Two of the dog runs that share a common pipe frame, the bottom pipe is rusting, pitted, and has open
rusted out areas. These rusty areas cannot be cleaned/sanitized properly, and the structural strength can be
affected. The breeder must repair or replace these areas. Good cleaning and sanitizing will help in the good health
of dogs. Good structural pipe frames will enhance the integrity of dog’s areas and help dogs to be in a safe
environment. The owner must correct these areas and then put into place a good maintenance program. Breeder
has ordered new material to start this project. Correct by 07-15-2017
