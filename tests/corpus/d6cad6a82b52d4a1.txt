2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public
with barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the
public.
The barrier in front of the newer adult tiger enclosure at the rear of the facility is not sufficient to assure there is
minimal risk of harm and safety to the public. There is a barrier approximately 4' in height in front of the enclosure,
however both sides are open ended where the public could enter and have contact with the tiger and become
injured. To assure there is minimal risk of harm and safety to the public the barrier must assure the public cannot
have access to the enclosure.
The licensee stated there are guided tours at this facility, however members of the public especially larger groups
of children could go around the open ended barrier having contact with a potential dangerous animal. A similar
noncompliance was cited during the May 23, 2016 inspection with the cougar.
