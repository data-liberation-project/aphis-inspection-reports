Personnel qualifications.
**On May 2, 2022, four Damaraland mole rats were found dead in their enclosures. According to facility personnel, an
electric space heater that was being used to provide supplemental heat for the animals was somehow placed under the
metal rack holding the enclosures resulting in the animals overheating. The facility was unable to determine how the
space heater was placed under the metal rack holding the animal enclosures. Upon further review of the incident, the
facility has instituted safety measures to prevent future incidents that would cause overheating of the animals. The
research facility must ensure that all personnel involved in animal care, treatment and use are qualified to perform their
duties to ensure the humane treatment and health of the animals.
