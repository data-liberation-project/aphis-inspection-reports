Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a six year old white male bichon (microchip # 7E10034200, date of birth 02-16-2016) with a heavy accumulation
of tartar buildup on the upper dental arcades. The buildup has produced a thick brown deposit of debris on teeth on both
the right and left sides with inflammation and recession of gum tissue.
Accumulation of dental tartar may lead to inappetence, gum infection, gum recession with loosening or loss of teeth, pain
and discomfort.
Each dealer shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries.
This dog needs to be evaluated by your veterinarian and an appropriate plan for treatment established by April 10 2022.
3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There is a large amount of fecal buildup on the exterior concrete slab in 4 occupied dog runs on the east side of the far
east kennel building. There is also a large amount of fecal buildup under and on the exterior suspended floor of a
suspended kennel on the west side that is occupied by three dogs.
Buildup of fecal material on surfaces contributes to insanitary conditions which may lead to soiling of dogs and an


increased risk of disease. Accumulated waste may also attract flies and other pests.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily and from under primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent an excess of feces and food waste.
Affected dogs need to be moved to clean kennels or accumulated waste removed by the end of today.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with conducted with the licensee and a facility representative.
