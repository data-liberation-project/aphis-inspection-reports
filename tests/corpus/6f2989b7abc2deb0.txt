2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During public exhibition animals must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animals and the public.
Staking the sheep and goats on tethers and allowing the public uncontrolled access to these animals could
potentially cause the animals or the public harm. Animals could become tangled in the tether causing injury or
become stressed because of the inability to get away from the public. They could break a tether and leave the area.
Small children could get caught in the tethers and be injured or be knocked over by the animals. The pigs need to
have an enclosure that does not easily allow children and adults to enter the enclosure and allows the pigs to
escape from the public if they desire. The animals must be maintained in facilities that contain the animals, allow
them to escape from public contact if they desire, and protect them from injury.
