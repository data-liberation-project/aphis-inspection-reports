FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the fenced paddock where the bison and watusi are located the covered structure with for open sides remains
without any walls or other structure to act as a wind break. The watusi has destroyed any attempts for walls in this
structure, and the licensee advised they will be constructing another option before fall. Currently there is a large
leaved tree that is providing appropriate shade for the animals, and there is a low sloped area in the SE corner
where they can get down out of the wind. There does need to be a more permanent structure to protect the animals
in inclement weather.
The lack of appropriate weather barriers or structures to protect the animals from inclement weather can cause the
animals to be in discomfort or expose them to harsh conditions that could be avoided with access to sheltered
conditions.
The licensee needs to provide a large enough and strong enough shelter for both the bison and watusi to be able to
utilize to get away from severe weather and wind conditions.
The perimeter fence variance request is still under review.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the CEO of the facility.
