The north side of the deer enclosure was closed off from the south side by a gate. One Buck and two doe were
present in the north side which has few trees and no artificial shelter. Correct by providing these animals access to
shelter from inclement weather.

have a windbreak. A windbreak may be needed in the winter to assure the animal can remain protected from the
weather and prevent discomfort. Correct by providing a windbreak.
Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be
provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The coyote enclosure has running water that is backing up in front of the shelter entrance. An attempt has been
made to limit the water by running a hose to the lower part of the trough but this is ineffective. This backup causes
the animal to have to walk thru water to enter its shelter and could lead to discomfort and disease especially as the
weather gets colder. The water also effectively reduces the size of the enclosure If the animal tries to avoid it.
Correct by preventing the water from covering unintended portions of the shelter floor.
A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. The method of drainage shall comply with
applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations relating to pollution control or the protection of the
environment.

SANITATION. A wire top had been constructed over the Raccoon Portion of the enclosure that housed raccoon and skunk. This
wire top was accessible to the raccoon thru the open door into the uninhabited skunk area. The raccoon has
defecated significantly on the top of this wire and there was an accumulation of feces at the time of inspection.
Correct by cleaning the feces regularly and/or restricting access to this part of the enclosure.
A nesting box for birds was present inside the northern deer enclosure adjacent to the Bear enclosure. The roof
of the nesting box was sloped toward the bear enclosure and was covered with feces. This configuration can lead to
contamination of the bear enclosure with bird feces during rains and may cause disease in the bear. Correct by
changing the location or configuration of the nesting box and routine cleaning. This item was corrected before the
exit briefing.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the
animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.
