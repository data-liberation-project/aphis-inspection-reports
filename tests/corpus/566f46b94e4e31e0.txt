2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The 14 year old male Bactrian camel is thin and has projectile liquid green diarrhea, demonstrated during the
inspection. All of the feces in the enclosure and barn were of liquid consistency. Several of his ribs and his pelvic
bones are visible, and his two humps are thin. His entire rear end and both rear legs are covered in green feces
and dirt. The fur on his rump is thickly matted with fecal matter and dirt. The caretaker states he developed diarrhea
when he was moved to a new paddock with long fresh grass and that they have given him Koapectate. Chronic
diarrhea can lead to dehydration and can cause serious illness or death. This animal needs to be cleaned of the
feces caking the rump and covering the legs. This is a Direct citation.
Two female aoudads are excessively thin. They are each nursing a single baby. Their ribs, scapula, and pelvic
bones are easily visible. The caretaker states they were darted and dewormed with 4ccs of ivermectin on August
28, 2015, but the only medical record is a note on the appointments calendar saying (cid:28)aoudad shot.(cid:29) The attending
veterinarian has not been contacted to re-evaluate these animals to obtain a diagnosis and provide additional
treatments as needed.
The attending veterinarian also needs to be consulted about the following behaviors observed in the capuchin.
The caretaker stated she feeds the non-human primates a few biscuits in the morning as she starts hoof stock
rounds, then feeds their meal normally around 11:00 -12:00. The capuchin was exhibiting repetitive frantic
stereotypic behaviors as he sat on a top perch peering in the direction in which the food would arrive. He was biting
at the cage bars, clapping his hands, biting at his hands and feet, clutching his head, sticking his tongue out and
sticking his hands in his mouth. Then he would walk the perch past the hanging white bucket where food is
dispensed and look into it every time. He also went to the ground and appeared to be looking for food. He took a
black object out of the pvc half pipe feeder and stuck it in his mouth, but then spit it out. He continued these
behaviors for at least 15 minutes.
The stereotypic behavior of the capuchin ceased once the capuchin was fed. The veterinarian needs to be
consulted as to the quantities and nutritional value of the food, to see if additional changes to diet would alleviatethe excessive behaviors.
Documentation of all veterinary examinations, consultations, and treatments must be maintained for future review
by APHIS officials. Owner-given medical treatments provided to the animals need to be documented (e.g. drug
names, dosages, routes of administration, species to be treated etc.) to show the veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations,
that the written Program of Veterinary Care is being followed, and that animals are being provided adequate
veterinary care.

2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Last week the male elk stuck its antler through the wire fence and scratched a woman over her right eye. A public
barrier needs to be permanently placed (not just during rut) at a sufficient distance to assure the safety of the public
and the animals.

The animals in the enclosures inside the rabbit and guinea pig room have changed since the last complete
inspection. Two juvenile coatimundis, a kinkajou, and a sloth are in the three enclosures. There is no public barrier
in front of these cages and the one inch square coated wire allows people to put their fingers into the cages. There
is a sign saying to not feed the animals as they may bite. An adequate barrier at a sufficient distance needs to be
placed to assure the safety of the public and the animals. To be corrected by 9-30-15.
3.128 REPEAT
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The two capybaras still do not have adequate water in their enclosures in which to submerge. The two turtle shaped
kid sand boxes used for pools have approximately 4 inches of water in them, and the black livestock water
receptacle has approximately 10 inches of water in it. Submerging in water is a major part of the normal postural
adjustments capybaras make. These capybaras need to be provided a sufficient amount of water space to make
their normal behaviors.
3.129(b)
FEEDING.
Fresh pieces of produce were fed to the sloth during this inspection and the food was placed on a wooden shelf in
the indoor part of the enclosure. This shelf was black with grime and had rodent feces on it. All food receptacles
must be kept clean and sanitary at all times to prevent contamination of the food. To be corrected by 9-24-15.3.130
WATERING.
Water receptacles for several animals contained mosquito larvae indicating they had not been adequately emptied
and cleaned in several days. The water affected includes the two Dromedary camels, the Bactrian camel, and 15
black buck antelope, and the 17 aoudads.
Some water receptacles are not appropriate for the animals in the enclosures as it is difficult for them to easily
access the water. This includes a large plastic automatic water receptacle intended for bovine which is being used
for pygmy goats, including two young kids. One of the kids was observed standing on the rocks placed below the
automatic water source to facilitate access to the water, but it still could not reach the water as the level is several
inches below the lip of the waterer. This type of waterer could be dangerous for the kid goats if they jumped up onto
the slick plastic surface and slid into the opening. A different water container needs to be provided to be safe and
accessible for all the goats.
In another enclosure with 15 pot belly pigs, the only water source is a large gray oval livestock waterer that has
water in the bottom third. None of the adult pigs can access this water unless they jump into it and the nursing
piglets cannot drink from this water source. Although this water source can be left for the pigs to cool off, an
additional more easily accessible water container needs to be added.
To be corrected by 9-30-15.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The Bactrian camel is having diarrhea and his rear is covered with feces. Multiple puddles of feces are in the
concrete floor barn. The barn needs to be cleaned often enough to keep him from getting contaminated with feces.
To be corrected by 9-24-15.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Excess small flies were observed on the legs and undersides of the adult female water buffalo and on the two bison.
The bison were observed repeatedly switching their tails. Although the caretaker had placed fly (bumpers) to
dispense insecticides in the shelter areas, they were half torn down. Besides the bites being annoying to the
animals, heavy fly infestation can cause blood loss and transmit diseases. More preventative measures need to be
taken to decrease the number of flies at the facility and to treat the animals most affected. The attending
veterinarian needs to be consulted to provide guidance on fly control for these particular flies. To be corrected by

EMPLOYEES.
During the first hours of this inspection, there was one employee in the zoo. Another employee arrived late. During
this inspection, when all of the animals were not there as some are on travel exhibit, there are 15 non-human
primates in the zoo and 191 other animals. At the time of inspection, one person was attending the entrance booth,
preparing food, distributing food and water. Some animals had behaviors indicating feeding was delayed. The lack
of an adequate number of employees can lead to delays in feeding and cleaning that can be detrimental to the
animals. To be corrected by 10-16-15.
The licensee called and told us to leave the property on 9-16-15 at around 11:30 after a short conversation with the
caretaker. The inspection was terminated at that time.
A meeting and exit interview was conducted by Kate Campbell, ACI and Ellen Magid, SACS with the licensee and
the caretaker on September 23, 2015.
