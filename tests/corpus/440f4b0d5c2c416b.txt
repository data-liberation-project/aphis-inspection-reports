Rabbits are being housed outdoors without adequate shelter from the cold and rain. Some rabbits are being housed
in covered but open sided individual hutches while others are housed in wire enclosures under roofed structures
with no sides. Most of the enclosures have wire floors, thus the animals are exposed to the cold from all directions.
Whereas some plastic has been put up on the sides of some structures to protect from the elements, others are still
open on four sides, and some openings remain between the plastic sheets on others.
Exposure to cold temperatures and wetting may be deleterious to the health of the rabbits and may cause them
discomfort. Shelter from cold temperatures should be provided for all rabbits when the temperature falls below 40 F.

Sections of fencing surrounding the outdoor rabbit enclosures do not completely enclose the rabbit enclosures. A
section had been removed, leaving an opening of more than six feet, and when it was replaced there still remained
a gap of nearly one foot in diameter. Rabbits housed outdoors are vulnerable to attack by predators. The facility
should ensure that their rabbit enclosures are fenced or otherwise enclosed to minimize the entrance of predators.

SANITATION.
Several rabbit enclosures contain excessive amounts of excreta. In some enclosures hay/straw appear to be wet
and caked with feces. Some solid surfaces were covered with feces and what appeared to be urine. Additionally,
although many enclosures have been replaced, there is still some rust present on some enclosures.
Rabbit enclosures should be kept reasonably free from feces and debris such as soiled hay/straw and rust. Failure
to keep the cages clean could increase animal exposure to disease causing agents and be detrimental to their
health.

rust by 12/20/14.

SANITATION.
Piles of hay/straw bedding are being discarded under the enclosures along with the urine and feces that collect
under the cages. Some piles were more than twelve inches deep, and not adequately contained in bins, but rather
the debris is in contact with the ground. When wire cage floors are in use, excreta should be removed from
collection bins at least weekly. Excessive amounts of hay and straw should also be discarded regularly. Discarding
bedding and excreta appropriately will minimize odors and flies, which can create an unhealthy environment for the
rabbits.
