SANITATION.
** While inspecting I noticed more than a few fleas were on me. As I walked from the raccoon enclosure to the coati
mundi enclosure more fleas appeared. I had to spray several times before leaving the facility with Adam's flea spray
provided by the customer. The abundance of fleas could cause health concerns for the animals at the facility. There
needs to be a pest control program established and maintained to prevent flea infestation or disease. Correct by

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
