2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Pomeranian (ID #103) is limping on the right front leg. Closer examination of the right front foot revealed a
swollen, dark red sore between the toes. The licensee had not noticed the condition of this dog and no veterinary
care was being administered at the time. Sores on the foot could cause pain and discomfort to the dog. This dog
must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. The
diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request. The
licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
A female Cavalier spaniel (ID #84) has excessively long toenails on both front feet. The toenails have developed a
significant curve towards the bottom of the foot. Overgrown toenails and sores on the foot could cause pain and
discomfort to the dog, as well as, affect the dog’s natural gait. The licensee must trim this dog’s toenails to an
acceptable length and ensure that the toenails of all dogs are maintained at an acceptable length at all times.
Male Cocker spaniel cited on the previous inspection report dated February 02, 2017 has received toenail
maintenance.
