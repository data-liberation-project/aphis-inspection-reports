2.31(c)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC has never prepared or submitted a report to the Institutional Official of its evaluation of the animal facilities.
The report allows for the evaluation of the programs, procedures, and facilities by the Institutional Official to ensure the
health, safety and humane care and use of the animals utilized by this facility.



Reports of the IACUC evaluations of the program of animal use and animal facilities need to be updated at least every six
months and sent to the Institutional Official. All reports to the Institutional Official must be signed by a majority of IACUC
members, identify departures from the regulations or standards, distinguish significant from minor deficiencies, and
provide a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency.

Date to be Corrected: From this time forward.

2.31(e)(2)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The proposal doesn’t provide the justification of the use of two different bear species or the number being requested per
year. The study should provide a statistically significant result with a minimum number of animals, and the methods by
which the number of animals was determined must be clearly stated. The number of animals required should be clearly
and scientifically justified to assure that no more animals are used than are necessary for scientific validity. As part of the
proposal review process the IACUC is charged with ensuring there in not unnecessary duplication of experiments and that
the minimum number of animals needed to obtain valid data is being requested.

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).


This protocol does not describe how blood collection of both black and brown bears will be taken. A description of
procedures is needed to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be limited to that which is unavoidable for the
conduct of scientifically valuable research, including provision for the use of analgesic, anesthetic, and tranquilizing drugs
where indicated and appropriate to minimize discomfort and pain to animals. The IACUC must review and approve the
description for procedures to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be minimized whenever possible, in order to
safeguard the well-being of the animals under study.

Recordkeeping requirements.
There were no IACUC records of the proposed activity for a study which involves the use of bears. Records of proposed
activities must be maintained to ensure only studies which have been approved are conducted and to ensure they are
being conducted in accordance with the approved protocol. Anytime a covered species is used in research a written
protocol must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to the use of the animal. The IACUC records must be
maintained of proposed activities involving animals and proposed significant changes in activities involving animals, and
whether IACUC approval was given or withheld.
