3.126(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Two of the three Patagonian cavies at the facility died last night. The facility owner indicated that he discovered
both of the cavies dead within their enclosure as he checked on them last evening. He further indicated that they
died as a result of exposure to the cold temperature inside of the garage where their enclosure was located. The
third cavy, also housed in the same enclosure, was moved into a warmer area inside of the facility. A single electric
heater was present and working in the garage where the animals were housed, however; the heater was unable to
sufficiently heat the garage. Cold temperatures and inadequate heating can cause discomfort, distress, and even
death.
Assure that all indoor facilities are adequately heated to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.
To be corrected: The third Patagonian cavy was moved into a warmer part of the facility. All indoor facilities
containing animals shall be adequately heated from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITIES MAY BE CONDUCTED FROM THIS FACILITY SITE UNTIL ALL NON-COMPLIANT
ITEMS ARE CORRECTED.
