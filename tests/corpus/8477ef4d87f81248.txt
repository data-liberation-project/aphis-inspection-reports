2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public barrier around the wolverine enclosure to the left of the glass viewing area is still not far enough back
from the enclosure. The inspector was able to reach across the barrier and grab onto the chain link fence. For the
safety of the animals and guests the barrier needs to be moved back so there is a sufficient distance and guests are
not able to touch the enclosures or potentially the animals.
The facility has made progress in funding and planning out the removal of old fence and construction of new fence
that will be further back and higher to prevent guests from being able to touch the primary enclosure. The facility
has plans for the project to be completed by mid August.
An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative at the time of the inspection.
