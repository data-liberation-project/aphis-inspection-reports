SANITATION.
***In the enclosure housing 2 sheep and a separate enclosure housing 4 goats, there was an excessive
accumulation of feces present on the ground. Due to the accumulation, the animals could not lay in their enclosure
without becoming contaminated by the waste material. Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to
provide for appropriate animal husbandry standards, to reduce disease transmission, and to prevent the animals
from becoming contaminated or soiled. The licensee must clean these enclosures and ensure that all enclosures
housing animals are cleaned as often as necessary to promote appropriate husbandry standards.
To be corrected by August 1, 2014.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner.
