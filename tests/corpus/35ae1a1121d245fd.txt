2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Bongo was lying down inside the shelter. When I approach the bongo, he stand and began walking away with
his right leg lifted in the air indicating there was a possible problem at the distal part of the limb. According to the AV
treatment was started yesterday with antibiotics (20 days after the last inspection), but still there is no definitive
diagnosis and no way to know if the current treatment will be effective.
Currently the animal is under an oral supplement for arthritic conditions (glucosamine, hyaluronic acid) which
doesn't appear to be helping too much.
There is a procured request for x-ray services according to the AV, which has not been approved at this moment
and which is one diagnostic tool to determine the cause of lameness.
An appropriate method to diagnose and treat the condition causing the lameness shall be implemented since the
animal didn't appeared to have any improvement.

An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
This was a focus inspection on previous nci's.
