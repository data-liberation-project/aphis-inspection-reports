Primary enclosures.
Space. Insufficient space was being provided in 13 enclosures housing 15 guinea pig weanlings in each enclosure.
Enclosures measure 30 inches by 28.5 inches or 855 square inches. The food bowl (6.25 inches in diameter) took up an
additional 30.66 square inches of floor space leaving a total of 824.34 square inches. Weanlings up to 350 grams require
at least 60 square inches of floor space each.

Inadequate space can cause stress, crowding, and aggression in animals. Licensee must ensure that guinea pigs are
provided with at least the minimum space requirements to prevent stress, crowding, and discomfort to the animals. Can
not house more than 13 guinea pig weanlings in the current enclosures.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
