FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
On the day of inspection, temperatures were in the high 80's. One pot-bellied pig was being housed in an enclosure
without available shade. For their health and well-being, when temperatures might cause discomfort, all animals
must be provided the option of avoiding the direct sunlight. (Note: A small, 3 sided shelter which is low to the ground
cannot be considered shade as the interior temperature when occupied is likely to exceed the exterior temperature.)
Correct before the end of the day.
An exit interview was conducted with the employee.
