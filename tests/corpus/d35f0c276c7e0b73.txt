2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The public is permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of animals. This
includes camels, sheep, goats, pigs, muntjac deer, fallow deer, bongo, llama, giraffe, sitatunga, oryx, zebra, and
kudu. These animals are housed in the walk through area of the zoo which is open to the public. Additionally, one
temporary pen was set up on a grassy section of the zoo grounds to allow public interaction with two young llamas.
There are no barriers present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food sold at the
entry gate and coin feeders are located throughout the facility. There are no attendants present during public
contact and guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals. Primary enclosure fences are made of
material with spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch the animals. Unattended public
contact does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals. Licensees must ensure that during periods of
public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general
viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent public
contact with these animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of these
locations to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals.
*** The camel identified for a veterinary care issue on the last inspection was seen by the veterinarian.
*** The inspectors were unable to assess the presence or absence of the elephant handler during periods of public
exhibition due to limited public attendance during the inspection.
*** The citation under Section 3.127 (d) from the previous inspection report has a correction date of March 1, 2018.
This inspection was conducted on Tuesday October 24, 2017 with the facility representative and the owner.
The exit interview was conducted with the owner and his wife on Wednesday October 25, 2017.Additional Inspectors
