3.1(c)(1)(i)

Housing facilities, general.
The bottom section of a chain link fence enclosure housing one male adult dog has rusted portions with areas of sharp
points. The rusted areas are pitted and flaking. Rusted metal surfaces cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized and
could harbor bacteria or infectious organisms. Sharp points may cause physical injuries such as lacerations or puncture
wounds. All surfaces that come in contact with dogs must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning
and sanitation. Additionally, they must be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animal.

3.101(a)(1)

Facilities, general.
USDA Inspectors identified several areas throughout the park in need of repair.

Sea Lion Main
The show pool has many areas of exposed, cracked, and removed areas of concrete and chipped paint in and around the
pool. Additionally, one of the mesh gates for a holding pool in this area had missing sections that left sharp points in the
mesh. There is a large hole in the shade cloth covering an enclosure housing one harbor seal.


Sea Lion Downstairs
The walkway in front of the enclosure housing two harbor seals has areas of exposed cracked concrete. The facility
trainers occasionally conduct their training sessions in this designated area so that the public may see the interactions up
close. Additionally, the gate to the enclosure has a section of chipping paint. The cavern area in the same enclosure also
has sections of chipped paint.

Dolphin East
The eastern pool containing bottlenose dolphins has areas of chipping paint and cracks in the cement walls. A viewing
window has moderate algae growth on the outside pane due to a leak from the pool.

Ports East and West
Both port enclosures (east and west) are constructed with treated wood and contain two California sea lions. There are
specific sections that are in varying stages of rot. Furthermore, the metal struts above the pool and attached to the shelter
show signs of rust. Additionally, there is a section of the flooring in the port west enclosure that is darkened in color and
seems to be lifting up from the base beneath it.

Flaking paint and/or protective coatings can cause a health risk to the animals if ingested. Defects on the coating surface
or missing chunks of concrete may cause injury to the animals through skin abrasions, lacerations, or other means.
Cracking or other structural defects in the pool may put animals at risk. Indoor and outdoor housing facilities for marine
mammals must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury, to contain
the animals within the facility and to restrict entrance of unwanted animals.

3.103(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
A portion of the perimeter fence for the facility is less than 3ft in distance from the enclosure fencing for two California sea
lions. The current perimeter fence in that area is constructed of wood approximately 8 feet in height. The fence must be of
sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between the animals inside the
enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. It may be determined that the current construction of the
perimeter fence and enclosure fencing effectively prevents people and animals from entering the facility; however, the
facility must obtain written approval for such a determination from the USDA APHIS Animal Care Administrator, as per
subsections under 3.103 (c).

Water quality.
A review of water quality records spanning since October 2019 until present identified several dates where the chlorine
levels in the primary enclosures of
Sea Lion Main: 01/01/21 - 01/14/21; 02/27/21, 03/03/21 - 04/21/21
Dolphin East: 12/16/21 - 12/31/21; 1/1/22 - 01/02/22, 01/19/22 - 01/23/22
Dolphin West: 12/16/21 - 12/30/21; 01/19/22 - 01/23/22
Dolphin Far West: 12/18/21 - 12/31/21; 01/01/22 - 01/02/22, 01/19/22 - 01/23/22
Port East: 3/16/21, 3/18/21, 5/19/21 - 5/21/21, 6/18/21- 6/19/21, 6/21/21 - 6/22/21, 1/31/21 - 8/2/21, and 9/9/21 - 9/11/21

Port West: 4/16/21, 5/18/21 - 5/19/21, 5/28/21, 7/11/21 - 7/13/21
These enclosures were consistently over 1 part per million. The facility began construction on the Dolphin Stadium area in
October 2021. This construction has disrupted the dolphin pools natural water flows. Additionally, the facility has been
refurbishing portions of their life support system and is currently waiting to install a new sand filter for the larger water
systems of Dolphin Stadium. Due to these various factors, the bottlenose dolphins were consistently exposed to total
chlorine ranges above 1.0 PPM for approximately two weeks in December 2021. Additional upgrades to the Sea Lion
Main life support systems led to persistent algae blooms that were difficult to remove mechanically. Review of medical
records and interviews with both the current and former attending veterinarians confirmed that the algae blooms did not
have any observable detrimental effects on any of the animals housed at Sea Lion Main. The attending veterinarian gave
the life support staff permission to raise the free chlorine ranges from a maximum of 0.4 PPM to 0.7 PPM in order to treat
the algae blooms. Subsequently, the animals residing in those pools were exposed to total chlorine levels above 1.0PPM
for the first two weeks in January 2021 and from March 3rd, 2021, to April 21st, 2021. Two of the pinnipeds residing in
those pools have chronic eye conditions; one harbor seal recently underwent cataract surgery.

Industry standards set the maximum level of total chlorine at 1.0PPM. Total chlorine is a measurement of both free
chlorine and chloramines. Chloramines are much more irritating to an animal’s skin, eyes and lungs than free chlorine.
Increasing chlorine to levels above industry standards in pools that actively contain animals in order to combat algae
blooms is not an acceptable method of disinfection. Total chlorine levels above 1.0PPM for long periods of time can
cause the marine mammals skin, respiratory, and eye issues. Constant management and maintaining chlorine levels
below 1.0 PPM is necessary to maintain the health and welfare of the marine mammals.

Water quality.
A review of water quality records identified periods of time where coliform testing was delayed beyond the once-a-week
requirement as required by the regulations. Samples were taken on the following dates (the delay on these samples was
between 9 – 10 days): January 27th, 2020, February 6th, 2020, February 10th, 2020 and February 19th, 2020.
Additionally, coliform testing was delayed for the following dates: March 10th, 2020, March 19th, 2020, April 26th, 2021,
May 9th, 2021, September 6th, 2021, October 7th, 2021, September 20th, 2021, December 27th, 2021 and January 11th,
2022. Timely and accurate testing for coliform counts is required to quickly identify harmful levels of bacterial counts and
effectively maintain water quality standards. Water samples shall be taken and tested at least weekly for coliform count.

Sanitation
A review of medical records identified two animals that underwent medical procedures to remove foreign bodies from its
stomach. On June 26th, 2020, Ivan, a 17-year-old male rough-toothed dolphin, underwent a foreign body procedure to
remove a piece of a plastic pool noodle that he consumed during an interaction with a trainer. During the procedure, a
plastic bag was also removed from his stomach. The animal passed away due to unrelated medical issues on May 30th,
2021. During his necropsy, a metal object was incidentally found in his stomach. Sandy, a 25-year-old female harbor
seal, underwent a foreign body procedure on January 10th, 2019, to remove two pennies and two nickels identified on
abdominal radiographs. The subsequent procedure to remove the foreign body may cause unnecessary discomfort.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
