ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11am-1130am
on 23-Feb-17.
The inspector tried to make contact with the Licensee at the facility address as well their address on file. The
inspector was unsuccessful at both locations. The inspector called the number on file. However; no one answered
and an answering machine did not pick up. So the inspector was unable to leave a message at the number
provided on file. The inspector left her card at the door to the facility prior to leaving the premise.
