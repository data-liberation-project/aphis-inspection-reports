2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility is not maintaining disposition records documenting the number of guinea pig deaths.
Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to assess the health of the colony by identifying animal losses by
deaths.
The facility must maintain records containing the required information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the
number of animals disposed of including deaths.

Sanitation.
Approximately 25% of the guinea pig pens contained a large amount of soiled wet bedding with excess accumulations of
fecal material and discarded food. The pens had last been cleaned approximately 7 days ago and the facility was due to
clean the pens on the day of the inspection.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the enclosure,
and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent a build-up of debris and fecal material and


sanitized at a minimum of once every two weeks.

Sanitation.
On the west wall of the guinea pig room, there were 2 windows that did not have screens. There were numerous live flies
and several dead flies on the windowsills and the fly tape reel was coated with flies.
Excessive pests such as flies can cause discomfort to the animals and result in increased disease spread.
An effective program for the control of flies must be established and maintained.
