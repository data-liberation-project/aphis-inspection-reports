FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A review of animal records indicated that two rabbits escaped from a playpen which was used for animal enrichment
and exercise. The playpen is composed of hard, durable plastic fencing on all four sides as well as hard, plastic
flooring.
Facility representatives stated that an animal caretaker discovered that one of the two escaped rabbits, ( a 2kg
male) had an apparent left hind limb injury. A facility veterinarian was immediately notified and the animal received
prompt veterinary diagnostics and treatment. A fracture of the left tibia was diagnosed and it was determined by the
veterinarian that humane euthanasia was warranted.
Upon the facility'(cid:25)s inquiry of this incident, there was no definitive or apparent cause of the rabbit(cid:25)'s fractured hind
limb. Facility representatives stated that this playpen system has been utilized for approximately ten years without
any rabbit escape or injury. The facility did have concerns that floor drains/grates (approx. 24ft length by 13in. width)
along both sides of this room may have had openings large enough to cause limb entrapment. The openings in the
drains are about 1 inch wide between metal bars. Currently, the facility has replaced the drain on one side of this
room with more solid slats with a 1/2in. width opening. Furthermore, all drains with 1 inch openings in the rabbit
rooms were promptly and fully covered with either solid rubber mats or mats with very small openings following the
injury to the rabbit. According to facility representatives their plan is to finish replacing all drains with the
aforementioned slats with the 1/2in openings.
Following review of records and the rabbit facilities, inspectors noted that although no definitive cause of the rabbit(cid:25)s
injury has been found, this was an adverse event which led to an animal(cid:25)s death.
All facilities for rabbits must be structurally sound, maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury, and
must properly contain the animals.
This incidence was self-identified and self-corrected prior to inspection.
To be corrected from this day forward.
