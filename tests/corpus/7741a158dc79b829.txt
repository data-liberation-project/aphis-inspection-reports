2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee did not have acquisition information for a male Poodle named Ozark that had been purchased several
months earlier. The licensee did not have disposition information for a male domestic short hair cat named Yogi
that was given away the previous year. Properly completed acquisition and disposition records are necessary for
identification of dogs and cats to facilitate record-keeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and
healthcare. The licensee must record acquisition and disposition information for all dogs and cats and must be able
to produce these records upon request by the Inspector.
TO BE CORRECTED BY NOVEMBER 10, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and a facility representative.
