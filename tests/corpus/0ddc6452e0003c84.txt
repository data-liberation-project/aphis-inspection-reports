ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***I arrived at the premises at 3:15 pm. I called and left the owner a message that I was at the facility to conduct an
inspection. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I waited at the facility and called again at 3:58 pm. No one
answered so I left a message letting the owner know that I was leaving and that this visit would be considered an
attempted inspection. A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection
process at 3:15 pm on 06/25/2014. A responsible adult shall be made available to accompany APHIS officials
during the inspection process.
