2.40(b)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a cavalier female, brown/white-4yrs old (Julie, #8225) that has a moderate buildup of brown tarter/plaque type
material on all of her teeth. While there is no evidence of loose teeth or infection, the amount of buildup needs to be
properly diagnosed and treated by the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian had not been contacted about
the dogs teeth, as the licensee did not observe the progression of the buildup on the teeth until identified during the
inspection.

The lack of timely dental care and monitoring can cause a possible health issue and pain or discompofort to the regulated
animal.

The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the dogs teeth. The daily
observations should include dental health and monitoring.

To be corrected by: The licensee made contact with the attending veterinarian during the inspection and made a dental
appointment for May 31, 2022
3.1(c)(1)


Housing facilities, general.
There are four unsealed cement walls on each end of the outdoor runs that contain dogs and are in direct contact with the
regulated animals.

Unsealed wood and cement can absorb bacteria or other health concerns that would allow the regulated animal to come
into direct contact with the contaminant. Sealed wood and cement can be cleaned and sanitized according to AWA
regulations and standards.

All surfaces that come in direct contact with the regulated animals must be constructed in a manner and made of
materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized. All wood and cement surfaces must be sealed in order to
prevent the contamination of the surfaces with bacteria or other possible health issues.
