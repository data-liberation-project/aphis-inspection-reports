3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
The facility reports that an improperly repaired hole in the prairie dog enclosure wall allowed the prairie dogs to get loose.
One prairie dog was seen during inspection and observed to have made a natural habitat by the primary enclosure and
still has access to shelter, food and water, however three prairie dogs are unaccounted for. Enclosures that allow animals
to get out could allow injury and does not protect the animals at the facility. Ensure that enclosures are maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

Maintain correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensees.
