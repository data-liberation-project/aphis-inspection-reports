FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***Two enclosures housing two servals each had light fixtures with exposed light bulbs that were not covered. The
exposed light bulbs poses a risk of injury to the animals if it breaks and glass gets into the enclosures of these
animals. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place to ensure all animal facilities are
structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
Date to be Corrected: May 28, 2018
***An enclosure where four servals routinely play had wood climbing structures that were in disrepair. The edges of
the wood climbing structures had jagged, splintered edges and there was an exposed nail that was protruding out of
the wood where the animals could come into contact with it. All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of
sharp points and jagged sharp edges in order to protect the animals from injury.
Date to be Corrected: May 23, 2018 (the exposed nail in the wood climbing structure), June 18, 2018
(repair/replacement of the wood climbing structures).
