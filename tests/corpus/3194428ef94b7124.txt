2.126(c) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
An inspection was attempted at the home site at 3:32 p.m. on 10/21/14, however it was discovered that the exhibitor
was out of town. No current itinerary has been received by USDA-APHIS-Animal Care that accounts for this travel.
In the case of traveling exhibitors, itineraries must be submitted to USDA via fax, mail, or electronic mail at least two
days prior to any overnight travel. The submission of itineraries allows USDA to conduct inspections in order to
assess the welfare of the animals both at home and on the road. Current itineraries should be submitted to USDA
in a timely manner.
