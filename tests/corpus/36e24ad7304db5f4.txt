MINIMUM AGE REQUIREMENTS.
On June 2, 2014, an Air Canada employee accepted a female goldendoodle puppy in Toronto, Canada and
shipped the puppy to Philadelphia International Airport (air waybill # 014-01295125). The puppy was born on April 8,
2014, and was only 55 days of age at time of shipment. Puppies must be at least 8 weeks of age for shipping to
make sure they are properly weaned, vaccinated, and fit for transportation. No carrier or intermediate handler shall
transport a puppy or kitten unless it is at least 8 weeks of age or 56 days old in commerce.
An exit briefing was conducted with the manager on duty.
