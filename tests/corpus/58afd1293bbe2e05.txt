Personnel qualifications.
On January 7, 2021, investigators identified a lamb on study with stomach distention. In the clinical interest of the lamb,
the investigators passed a stomach tube to relieve the bloated stomach of the lamb. The procedure was approved for
ewes under the IACUC approved protocol; however, the procedure was not approved in lambs. The procedure to pass a
stomach tube in lambs was an approved procedure on the primary investigator’s other IACUC approved protocol. The
clinical veterinarian on rounds at the time, noticed the incident, assessed the animal, and administered veterinary care to
the lamb. Stomach distension in lambs was not listed in the IACUC approved protocol as a potential adverse condition,
nor was the treatment for that condition described. The primary investigators must receive training to communicate these
issues to the veterinarian if it is not approved by the IACUC. After this incident, the principal investigator submitted an
amendment to add the procedure of passing a stomach tube in lambs under the protocol. This amendment was reviewed
and approved by the IACUC January 8, 2021.

Training and instruction shall be made available to personnel involved in animal care and use with sufficient frequency to
fulfill the research facility’s responsibilities under 2.31 of the AWR.



Corrections were instituted prior to the inspection to prevent recurrence.
3.53(a)(1) Critical

Primary enclosures.
In the months of April and May 2021, there were 6 reported incidents of rabbits escaping from their primary enclosures.
According to facility documentation, the first three rabbits escaped from their enclosures on April 9th, May 1st and May
11th. After the rabbits escaped, staff attempted to secure the front of cages by placing metal rings on the affected
enclosure doors.
Two of the rabbits that were able to escape, in separate incidents were injured as a result, one rabbit was found with a
swollen and inflamed upper lip. This rabbit was examined and treated by the Veterinarian. In another incident on May
13th, a rabbit escaped from an enclosure on the top row, resulting in the rabbit becoming paralyzed. This rabbit was
euthanized by the Veterinarian due to the injury sustained. The Department of Veterinary Resources then had the caging
assessed by the vendor on May 14th and replacement parts were ordered.
One rabbit was able to escape from the same enclosure on May 22nd and May 24th through the back by pushing on the
catch pan. The facility placed bolts to secure the pans and prevent movement. On May 25th the facility replaced all the
door latches on the cages. The facility must ensure that primary enclosures are structurally sound and contain the
rabbits.
The facility has corrected this item by replacing all door latches on all cages, an incident has not recurred since that time.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

This inspection was conducted 07/28/2021 to 07/29/2021.
