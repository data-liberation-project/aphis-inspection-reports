ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30 a.m. on
20-JUL-18.
When I first arrived at the facility I knocked on the door and there was no answer. I then called and left a message
on the facilities voicemail and the owner’s cellular phone. I waited at the facility for 30 minutes and was not able to
get in contact with someone to perform the inspection.
