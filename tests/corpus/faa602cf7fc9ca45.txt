2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A prairie dog housed in an enclosure in the area behind the stairs is mildly squinting the left eye. The left eye is cloudy in
the center, there is green discharge and crusts around the eye, and the eyelids are mildly red and swollen. The facility
representative states that the problem occurred a few days ago and was worse initially, as the eye was completely closed,
but that she is unsure if a vet was consulted about the problem. The attending veterinarian does not have a record of
consultation for this incident. No treatments have been administered.

Problems that are not communicated in a timely manner to the attending veterinarian can lead to poor health and poor
animal welfare.

Direct and timely communication of animal health problems must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian to ensure the
health and well-being of the animal.

Corrected during inspection; facility representatives called the attending veterinary clinic and obtained a same day
appointment.


2.131(c)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
A bite incident occurred in early August at the facility. A member of the public was bitten by one of the prairie dogs, and
approximately 1 month later, was hospitalized. When the bite occurred, the facility was alerted but a facility representative
did not directly witness the incident.

Animals handled in a way that does not minimize the risk of harm to both the animal and the public can lead to serious
injuries or health impacts of either the animal or the public. Correct by ensuring there is sufficient distance and/or barriers
between the animal and the public to assure the safety of both. Corrected prior to inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
