SANITATION.
The weeds around the cougar enclosure have become excessive. Weeds were up to knee high and above around
the animal's enclosure between the enclosure fence and the perimeter fence. These weeds can become a haven
for pests and vermin. Weeds must be cut down and then controlled to facilitate the prescribed husbandry.
