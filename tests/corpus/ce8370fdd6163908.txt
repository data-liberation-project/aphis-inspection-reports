2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 on
17-Oct-16.
The licensee's wife indicated that the licensee would not be available for inspection since he was working 1-2 hours
away. It is the licensee's preference that he be present himself for the inspection. Lack of availability for
unnanounced inspections hinders the regulatory process. The licensee must ensure there is a responsible,
knowledgeable adult available to accompany inspectors during regular business hours.
Correct from this time forward.
