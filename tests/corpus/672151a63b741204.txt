2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Two rabbits and one prairie dog do not have acquisition records. Furthermore, there are no disposition records for
any animal. The absence of acquisition and disposition records prevents the animal(cid:25)s movements to be tracked and
verified. The licensee shall keep and maintain all records of acquisition and disposition for all covered species.
Correct this day forward.
3.53(a)(4)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two adult rabbits, one white and one grey, were found on inspection in an outdoor enclosure that did not provide
flooring that protected the rabbits(cid:25) feet and legs from injury. Approximately 75% of the flooring was covered with a
white plastic lattice that provided suitable flooring; however, the remaining 25% had the underlying support wire
exposed. The 4in by 2in cattle fencing used as support was easily large enough for an adult rabbit to pass its foot
and leg thru the wire flooring. Wire flooring that has spacing large enough for a foot or leg to get caught in puts the
animals at risk for injuries including broken legs. Correct by ensuring the rabbit enclosure, including flooring, is
constructed that protects the rabbit(cid:25)s feet and legs from injury. Corrected at time of inspection.
3.80(a)(2)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The facility has numerous sharp points from wire fencing in two non-human primate enclosures. The adult Olive
baboon enclosure has several sharp points from a section of wire mesh that was cut to hang a water bottle on the
outside. The adult capuchin enclosure has 12in by 12in section removed in the wire fencing that is currently being
covered by wood. The ends of the wire fencing around the cut-out section has numerous loose wire ends, some
pointing inside the enclosure. No lacerations were observed on any of the animals. Surfaces in the housing facilities
of non-human primates must be free of jagged edges and sharp points that may injure the animals. Sharp wire ends
can cause lacerations to the skin and be broken off and ingested. Correct by ensuring that these sharp edges are
removed or made inaccessible to any animals. Correct by 1/23/20153.84(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
All nonhuman primate enclosures have a moderate to heavy accumulation of dust, dirt, debris and other organic
material build up on the wire mesh of the enclosures.

The Japanese Snow Macaque enclosure is primarily constructed with unsealed raw wood. There are several areas
where the wood has a heavy accumulation of green organic material build up. The area with the largest
concentration of buildup is along the bottom framing of the enclosure. In addition, the interior portion of the
enclosure is constructed with raw wood to include; floor, celling, wall and platform. These areas have a moderate to
heavy accumulation of dust, dirt, debris and other organic material build up on a majority of the surfaces.
Raw wood cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized and can harbor bacteria. Insufficient cleaning habits expose
the animals to unnecessary disease hazards.
Licensee must ensure that all surfaces that come in contact with nonhuman primates are made and constructed
with material that can be properly cleaned and sanitized or can be replaced when they become warn or soiled. In
addition, a routine for cleaning must be established for the facility. All nonhuman primate areas must be spot
cleaned daily or as often as necessary to meet commonly accepted husbandry practices. Correct by 1/30/2015

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
**There were several sharp wires pointing inside animal enclosures. The goat enclosure had several wires that had
broken off the enclosure fence at one end and were sticking inside the enclosure. The enclosure housing two adult
cougars has a metal wire mesh attached to the outside of the enclosure. The ends of the wire mesh have multiple
sharp points that are sticking inside the enclosure.
**The enclosure housing two adult brown bears has a severely rusted metal support bar in the enclosure. The 3ft
long (approximately) bar was located at the bottom of the fence roughly 2-3 inches off the ground and located on
the East side of the enclosure. The inside of the hollow bar was completely exposed due to one side had completely
rusted away or the edges pulled back. The entire length of the bar had two sharp, jagged rusted edges that span
the entire length of the bar. The two bears inside the enclosure have access to the sharp edges. There was an
additional support bar on the outside of the enclosure fencing at the bottom.
No lacerations were observed on any of the animals. Sharp points or jagged edges could cause injury and pain to
an animal. Loose wires are also more likely to break off and be eaten or stepped on. Additionally, facilities must be
in good repair; however, the disintegrating metal bar in the bear enclosure is not. While currently it does not seem tohave impacted the ability to contain the animals, it may eventually lead to an unable to properly enclose them.
Correct by ensuring all housing facilities must protect the animals from injury and is in good repair. Furthermore,
monitor all wire fences and enclosures to ensure loose wires are removed and could not harm any animals. Correct

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility currently has a small area in a building where they store fruits and vegetables that they get donated to
them on weekly basis. This room is not refrigerated and does not have a working refrigerator area. During
inspection, this area had a small amount of fruits and vegetables that were not fit for consumption sitting out in the
open in boxes. Licensee stated that refrigeration was not necessary due to the cold weather and he planned to
convert a non-working freezer into a refrigeration unit before the summer. Licensee stated that this area can be
upwards of 90 degrees in the summer and the vegetation spoiled very quickly when they were stored in the area
with no refrigeration.
The facility does not currently have any form of freezer area for meat and other items that need to be kept frozen to
prevent spoilage. Licensee stated that they currently get deer meat donated to them on a fairly regular basis and
do not need to put it in a freezer at the current time due to the cold weather. He stated that they are able to use all
the meat or dispose of it before it spoils. He also informed inspectors that he goes to the store on a daily bases to
purchase any additional meat they require to feed all carnivores that they currently have at the facility. The licensee
had several cases of chicken in his van that he planned to give for morning feeding. He told inspectors that he
planned to leave the meat overnight in the van due to the cold weather.
Although the current weather is conducive for storing vegetables and meats in a non-traditional way of refrigeration,
even in the winter, the weather can go above freezing and increase the rate of spoilage. All perishable foods
require proper refrigeration to protect the supplies against deterioration, molding, or contamination. Spoiled meats
and vegetable can harbor harmful bacteria that contribute to illness.
Licensee must have a proper refrigeration/freezer unit to maintain vegetation and meats at the appropriate and
constant temperature. Correct by 2/6/2015
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Currently, there is no perimeter fencing surrounding the three wallabies. Additionally, there is a large trunk
approximately two feet away from the perimeter fence. This tree is large enough for an animal to climb and jumpover the perimeter fence. A perimeter fence is required to keep unwanted animals and people from entering the
facility and making contact with the animals. The perimeter fence also acts as a secondary containment system.
Licensee must ensure that all covered species are within an appropriate primary enclosure that is located inside a
primary fence. Additionally, the tree must be removed or made non-climbable. Correct by 2/16/2015.
This is a focus inspection of the indirect non-compliances.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
