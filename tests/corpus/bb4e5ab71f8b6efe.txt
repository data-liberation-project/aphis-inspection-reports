3.6(a)(2)(10) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Inside the whelping building, an enclosure housing a female West Highland White Terrier with tag number 73 with 4
puppies on a coated wire floor with openings big enough (2 inches by 1 inch) that easily allowed the puppies to pass
their feet and legs through the black wire floor. During the inspection puppies were observed getting their feet and
legs caught in the flooring multiple times. These openings easily allow puppies to get stuck and possibly injured.
Any flooring in the primary enclosure cannot allow a dog's foot to pass through it. The licensee must provide flooring
to all dogs, including puppies, that prevent legs and feet passing through the flooring.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and his wife.
