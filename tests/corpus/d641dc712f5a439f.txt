FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A significant amount of standing water was noted in a dry land area of the river otter enclosure. The excessive
amount of water was the result of heavy rains that occurred five days previously. A dirt and debris mark was visible
on the exhibit viewing window at a level that indicated flooding may also have occurred in this area during the recent
rain.
The particular dry area of the enclosure effected by the standing water contains a drain that facility personnel stated
is not sufficient to provide adequate and rapid drainage to this part of the outdoor exhibit. A suitable method of
drainage for elimination of excess water must be implemented to prevent standing water and flooding of dry areas in
the enclosure. Standing water and flooding can create unsanitary conditions and disease hazards which can
adversely effect the health of the animals.
