2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female black and white shih tzu (Microchip # 047 375 552) has excessively long toenails and was seen walking
cautiously with a slight limp in her hind end. Nearly all of the toenails on both back feet are excessively long and are
curling back under the foot pads. The nails either touch or nearly touch the underside of the pads. Some of the pads
are excessively thickened/roughened where the toenails are touching and a few of the pads have indentations in
them from where the toe nail is pushing into the pad. The licensee trimmed the toenails at the time of inspection.
Nearly all of the cheek teeth have a moderate amount of dental tartar covering nearly the entire surface of each
tooth and the gums appear mildly red and swollen. Two of the cheek teeth on the lower right side of the mouth are
severely covered with thick dental tartar and the teeth move easily when touched. The gums below these teeth are
severely pulled back from the surface of each tooth. The licensee has documentation that the dog’s teeth were
cleaned in April 2016, but there is no documentation that the teeth have been observed since that time.
One female shih tzu (Microchip # 839 321 845) has a cloudy right eye. The entire eye is mild to moderately cloudy
and there is a small indent/defect located in the middle of the eye. The defect on the surface of the eye is circular
and is just slightly larger than the head of a pin. The white of the eye is mild to moderately reddened. The animal is
excessively tearing and the hair around the eye and on the top of the muzzle is wet and matted together.
Conditions such as these can be painful and can lead to further health complications. The animals listed above
must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an
appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information, including the diagnosis, treatment and
resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive appropriate veterinary care at all times.
3.6(a)(2)(x) REPEATPRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the "Female Building" one female Shih tzu was observed to be walking back and forth in the outdoor portion of
her enclosure. This section of the enclosure has raised tender foot flooring, and the inspector observed the dog's
feet pass through the openings in the flooring at least four times. Openings in the flooring large enough to allow the
animal's feet to pass through could cause injury.
Primary enclosures must have flooring constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury and
does not allow the dogs' feet to pass through any openings. The licensee must alter the flooring in a manner that
does not allow the dog's feet to pass through the flooring. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures
keep the dogs safe from injury at all times.
The licensee moved the dog to a new enclosure with appropriate flooring at the time of the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Heather Cole, VMO, and the facility representative.
