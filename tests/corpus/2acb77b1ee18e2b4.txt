2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 710 guinea pigs including adults,
weanlings, and newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records present indicating the
number of adults, weanlings, and newborns held, or the number of guinea pigs that died since June 2022. Failure to keep
records on guinea pigs held including births and deaths makes it difficult to track changes in production, losses due to
death, and to assess the animal care program. Licensee must ensure that records are kept and maintained on guinea
pigs held, owned, born, died, and sold to help keep track of animals, document changes in ownership and production.

Primary enclosures.
Space. Inadequate space was being provided in four enclosures (yellow tubs) housing weanling guinea pigs. Enclosures
measure 25 inches by 38 inches or 950 square inches of floor space. Guinea pigs weighing up to 350 grams require at
least 60 square inches of floor space for each weanling. Can not house more than 15 weanlings in this size enclosure.
The following enclosures did not have adequate floor space:

Enclosure 92 had 17 weanlings

Enclosure 93 has 23 weanlings
Enclosure 95 had 32 weanlings
Enclosure 97 had 30 weanlings

Inadequate space can cause stress, overcrowding, health issues, and aggression in animals. Licensee must ensure that
guinea pigs are provided with at least the minimum amount of floor space per animal to prevent unnecessary stress and
discomfort. Correct by November 12, 2022.

Sanitation.
Housekeeping. There were shavings, hay, dirt, and debris covering the floor of the animal room especially near food and
bedding supplies. Dust and dirt were accumulating on veterinary products, supplies and equipment. There were open
trash cans, a cardboard box and bags stored next to food and bedding supplies. Ineffective cleaning and housekeeping
can expose the guinea pigs to disease hazards, pest problems , and health risks. Correct by ensuring premises are kept
clean, including: removing spilled shavings, loose hay and debris from floor; dusting off shelves and supplies; storing
veterinary products in a cabinet or closed container to prevent contamination; storing trash properly in cans with lids;
removing cardboard boxes and bags from the floor; and maintaining a level of husbandry to support good animal
husbandry and health. Remains uncorrected.
