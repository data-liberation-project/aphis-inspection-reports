3.79(d)

Mobile or traveling housing facilities.
The exhibitor used a baboon and a capuchin monkey for a video shoot event in Southern California in November, 2020.
The inspectors reviewed photos and videos from this social media-based promotional video event, and determined that
the exhibitor did not adequately maintain direct control of the animals while they interacted with the public. The animals
were observed to be in physical contact with the public - shaking hands in the case of the baboon, and sitting on
shoulders in the case of the capuchin - and the exhibitor did not have a hold of the animals, nor was he holding onto the
end of their leashes during these encounters.

Failure to maintain direct control of nonhuman primates during physical contact with members of the public could result in
physical harm to the people or animals involved.

Trained nonhuman primates may be allowed physical contact with the public, but only if they are under the direct control
and supervision of an experienced handler or trainer at all times during the contact.

To be corrected from this time forward.



This inspection was conducted with the licensee / exhibitor, and an exit interview was completed via phone conference on
3/11/21.
