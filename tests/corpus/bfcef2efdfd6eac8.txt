Facilities, outdoor.
The facility, which houses kangaroos, porcupine, ring-tailed lemurs, and other exotic animals in outdoor and sheltered
enclosures, does not have a complete perimeter fence. The front of the property, from the kangaroo enclosure to the
driveway area, is not completely fenced and most existing fences in this area are less than 6 feet tall.
A perimeter fence protects animals from wildlife which can spread diseases and injure captive animals. A perimeter fence
also acts as a secondary containment system in the event that an animal escapes from its primary enclosure.
Correct by November 1st, 2021, installing a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and unauthorized
persons out, and to act as a secondary containment system for animals in the facility.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
