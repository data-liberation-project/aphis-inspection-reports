PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were two enclosures housing New Zealand red rabbits that did not meet the space requirements. Enclosures
measured 24'' by 24'' or 4 square feet. Weaned rabbits weighing up to 4.4 pounds require a minimum of 1.5 square
feet of floor space each. One enclosure had 3 rabbits and the second enclosure had 4 rabbits. No more than 2
weaned rabbits weighing up to 4.4 pounds can be housed in this size enclosure. Licensee must ensure the space
for rabbits at least meets the minimum required floor space to allow the animals to make normal postural
adjustments and to prevent discomfort or stress. Correct by September 23, 2017.
