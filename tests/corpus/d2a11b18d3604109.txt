3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several enclosures had areas where the impervious surfacing was chewed or broken to expose the wood
underneath. This makes the surface hard to clean and sanitize. The chewed edges provide an area where dirt and
organisms can accumulate. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis and those that cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn. Correct by: 30 April 2015

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outdoor portions of the enclosures had accumulation of feces and in two kennels the dogs had become soiled
by feces from the enclosure. Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures daily to prevent soiling of the dogs.
