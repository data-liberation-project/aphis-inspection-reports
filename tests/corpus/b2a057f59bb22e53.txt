2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Two studies were conducted on an IACUC approved protocol from July 2018 - October 2018.
1) The protocol describes humane endpoints for the animals on study, which include an upper limit for tumor size. If
an endpoint is reached, the protocol states that the animal is to be removed from the study and humanely
euthanized. One animal on study from July 2018 to August 2018 was identified with a tumor that exceeded the
upper size limit described in the protocol. This animal was maintained on study and received a test compound after
having reached this humane endpoint. Deviation from the IACUC approved endpoints can lead to compromised
welfare of the affected animal. Failure to remove this animal from study once the endpoint was reached constituted
a significant change without IACUC review or approval
2) This protocol indicates that animal weights are to be monitored twice weekly while on study, with more frequent
monitoring instituted if weight loss is identified. On review of available health monitoring records, weights were
routinely monitored only once per week. 7 animals were identified to have weight loss while on study, and no
increased frequency of monitoring was instituted as required by the protocol. Deviation from the IACUC approved
monitoring compromises the ability of investigators to identify problems of animal health or welfare. Failure to
monitor these animals in accordance with the protocol constituted a significant change without IACUC review or
approval.
Any significant change in ongoing activities regarding the care and use of animals must be reviewed and approved
by the IACUC prior to being instituted.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
This inspection and initial exit interview was conducted on June 24th, 2019 with a facility representative. A final exit
interview was conducted with facility personnel on June 26th, 2019.
