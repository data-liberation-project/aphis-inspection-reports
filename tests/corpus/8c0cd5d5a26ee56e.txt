* An estimated three foot section of perimeter fencing is broken and extending inwards. The gap created by the
broken fencing does not restrict animals and unauthorized persons from gaining contact with the animals in the
facility. The facility must have in place an effective and customary containment with security measures for the
animals in the facility. The facility must ensure that all fencing must be constructed so it protects the animals in the
facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through or under it and having contact with the
animals in the facility. Correct by 12/7/15.
* The facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 11/23/15 were conducted with the Director and Animal
Care Supervisor.
