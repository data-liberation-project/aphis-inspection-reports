Facilities, outdoor.
A 20-foot section of the perimeter fence, located behind the otter enclosure, lowers from 8 feet in height to 4 feet. This
section is positioned near the edge of a waterway and leans away from the enclosure due to plant growth and erosion.
There are two gaps underneath the fence approximately 12 inches wide and 6 inches deep.

The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility.

The facility must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is structurally sound and of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. Correct by 10/24/2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
