2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult black & tan guinea pig on the front side of the building, in row 4, 2nd enclosure on rack from the top, was
observed with a mass under her chin. This animal had a firm, but moveable mass on her neck approximately 1 inch in
diameter.

An adult tan & white guinea pig on the back side of the building, in row 5, 4th enclosure on rack from the top, was
observed with a right head tilt.

An adult tri-colored (white, black & tan guinea pig on the back side of the building, in row 6, top enclosure on rack, was
observed to have a right head tilt and a mass under her chin. This animal had a firm, but moveable mass on her neck
approximately 3/4 of an inch in diameter.

All three animals appeared to be eating and drinking normally. The treatment for masses and head tilts are not addressed
in the program of veterinary care and there is not record that the licensee had identified these three animals prior to
today's inspection. A failure to conduct daily observations with direct communication with the attending veterinarian can
result in a delay of care provided to animals and can prolong animal health problems. All animals must be observed daily

to assess their health and well-being with a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the attending
veterinarian so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health and well-being are conveyed.

The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian and have these three guinea pigs evaluated for masses and head
tilts so that appropriate treatment can be provided. Correct by July 22, 2021.
