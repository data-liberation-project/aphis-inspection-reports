3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The dwarf bovine "Ugmo's" enclosure has large areas of standing water and mud. This animal's hooves and lower
portions of the feet are covered with wet mud. "Ugmo" must pass through mud and standing water to gain access
to the shelter and hay.
Other bovine species & the water buffalo's enclosures also have areas of standing water & mud.
All enclosures shall be designed to rapidly eliminate excess water (taking into account the amounts of rain that the
facility experiences throughout the year) to protect the animals and reduce breeding areas for flies and mosquitoes.
Animals shall not pass through mud to gain access to their food, water, & shelter.
