3.75(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the chimp housing areas an open shelf was identified,upon which was placed containers of materials toxic to the
chimps including bleach and other disinfectants. Due to its close proximity to the chimps within the indoor enclosure
themselves, such substances can pose toxic hazards if animals are exposed to them. The shelving did not have any
doors or cabinets attached to allow enclosed storage.
Substances that are toxic to the nonhuman primates but that are required for normal husbandry practices must not
be stored in food storage and preparation areas, but may be stored in cabinets in the animal areas.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
