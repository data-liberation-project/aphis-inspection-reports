ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.

documented an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of
the marmosets. The plan must be in accordance with currently accepted professional standards and as directed by
the attending veterinarian. The plan must address at a minimum social grouping, environmental enrichment and
special considerations (including infants/juveniles and those that show signs of being in psychological distress
through behavior or appearance). The facility must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan for
environment enhancement for the marmosets. Correct by 6/30/18.
