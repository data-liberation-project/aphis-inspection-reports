2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The new program from May 2016 is incomplete. The program does not specify how often the attending veterinarian
is to visit the facility. The information regarding vaccinations and parasite treatments needs to be reviewed to
ensure that the information is complete. There are no vaccination recommendations listed. The parasite control
treatments listed must include all species kept at the facility (for example there is no information for the sheep and
African crested porcupines) and must include how often the medications are to be administered. There is nothing
written regarding any TB testing of susceptible species to include some of the hoofstock and the non-human
primates.
The facility and the attending veterinarian need to jointly decide on all preventative veterinary procedures, drugs and
vaccines to be administered to the animals. The facility shall contact the attending veterinarian and obtain the
missing information that then needs to be added to the written program.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two animals are currently in need of veterinary care.
*One older black pig has hair missing over about 50% of its back. The skin appears very dry and flaking. There is
one red moist looking area about 1/2 inx3/4 in in size. The owner reports there are plans for the pig to be sold. Dry
skin can be uncomfortable and lead to sores that can become infected. The pig should have it skin issue evaluated
by a veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment if it remains at the farm. Correct by 2/14/17.
*One four horned sheep (tag #123) is in need of hoof trimming. Both the front and rear hooves are elongated and
have started to curl and/thicken. Long hooves can lead to discomfort and abnormal joint/muscle actions. The sheep
needs to have its hooves trimmed. Correct by 2/14/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with owner.
