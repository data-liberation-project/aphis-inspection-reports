2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult hamster had been returned to the store by the purchaser on August 1, 2014 because it had lumps on its
body. During the inspection, the hamster was observed to have large swollen areas beneath the skin behind both
front legs. The hamster was being housed in an area away from the public and the other animals and was labeled
as "Not for Sale." The store had a written daily care log for feeding and watering of the hamster, but a veterinarian
had not been consulted about the condition and the animal was not receiving any treatment. Untreated medical
conditions can be painful and can worsen. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and
must maintain a written record of any treatment.
TO BE CORRECTED BY AUGUST 21, 2014.
