INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The indoor housing facility for the dogs is not sufficiently ventilated to minimize ammonia levels. During this
inspection there was a strong odor of ammonia throughout the kennel. The small exhaust fan was not turned on and
had a cloth over it. This kennel appears to be cleaned properly, has air condition with fans and adequate
temperatures. For the health and welfare of these dogs, there needs to be additional ventilation to minimize these
ammonia levels. The exhaust fan was turned on and the doors at both ends of the kennel were opened for a short
time during the inspection to reduce the ammonia levels.
