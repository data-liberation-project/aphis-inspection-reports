ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45 AM on
26-JUL-18.
Arrived at facility and called both numbers, left messages that I would wait for 30 minutes, until 11:15 AM. Called
down the driveway, no one was visible from the gate. Received a call back from the licensee at 11:15, not currently
available for inspection.
