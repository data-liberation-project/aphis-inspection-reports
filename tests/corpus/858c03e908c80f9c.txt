ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
***On Tuesday, March 1, 2016, a responsible person was not available to conduct an inspection. This is the first
attempted inspection.
The inspector spoke with the licensee, who was working and unable to attend an inspection. The facility was not
able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health
and well-being of the animals.
A responsible person must be available to accompany the inspector on an animal welfare inspection.
To be corrected immediately.
