NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
The licensee moved the animals to a new location over a month ago. The licensee failed to notify USDA / APHIS /
Animal Care in writing of this change of address. It is essential that Animal Care is notified of any significant
changes so that unannounced inspections can be conducted as needed.
To be corrected immediately.
2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The exhibitor did not have any records on hand, and there was no current written Program of Veterinary Care. The
Attending Veterinarian had not been onsite to see the facility and the animals, and review the vet care program for
over a year. The exhibitor should collaborate with the veterinarian, and review the program of preventive care,
emergency care, etc, at least once per year, and the written program should be reviewed, updated, and available at
the time of inspection.
To be corrected by 2/26/15.
3.50(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The primary enclosures for the rabbits were rusty, and had some sharp wire ends. An opening in one enclosure was
not secure, as it was closed with a section or wire mesh, where the wire ends were interwoven into the enclosure
panel to close the opening. The wire mesh had moderate rust on some enclosures, and at least one enclosure had
no bottom, posing a risk of animal escape. The frames were made of wood, and some sections were painted, and
some not. Porous wood surfaces and rusty metal make adequate cleaning and disinfecting difficult. Rabbit housing
should be structurally sound, and maintained in good repair, in order to protect the animals from injury, contain the
animals, restrict the entrance of other animals, and facilitate sanitary conditions.
To be corrected by 2/26/15.3.52(d) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The rabbits are in primary enclosures on the ground, and there is no perimeter fence present that would prevent the
entrance of predators, such as the local wild pigs and mongoose. The enclosures are not constructed in a manner
that provides sufficient protection -- one enclosure has no bottom, so tipping it over would set the rabbits free.
Whereas there are dogs on site, they cannot be relied upon the protect the rabbits from predators, and could pose a
predation risk as well. Outdoor housing for rabbits should be fenced or otherwise enclosed to minimize the risk from
predators.
Immediate steps should be taken to protect the animals from predators. Appropriate protection from predators
should be in place at the time of the next inspection.
An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
