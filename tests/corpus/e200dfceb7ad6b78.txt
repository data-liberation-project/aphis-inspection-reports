3.84(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The primary enclosures are not being sanitized at a minimum once every 2 weeks. Multiple enclosures have an
accumulation of grime and debris on the enclosure sides and floor. Old food enrichment devices are not being removed
and cleaned and several enclosures have plastic bottles with food waste left in the enclosure for more than a week. The
current design of the enclosures does not facilitate some of the animals to shift to another area so the primary enclosure
can be effectively cleaned and sanitized. As such, some of the enclosures have not been sanitized since December. This
needs to be addressed so enclosures are cleaned as often as necessary for the health of the animals but at a minimum
every 2 weeks.
