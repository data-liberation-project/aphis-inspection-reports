3.1(c)(1)

Housing facilities, general.
***The metal flashing/border on the interior surface of four of the indoor kennels at the joint where the wall meets the
flooring have rusted and corroded leaving surfaces that have grooves and pockets that may allow the accumulation of
feces and waste material. These surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Improper sanitation of these surfaces
may increase risk of exposure to disease hazards. All surfaces that the dogs may come in contact with shall be prepared
in a manner that will permit appropriate cleaning and sanitization to protect the dogs from possible disease hazard.

***There are two runs observed to have portions of the vinyl tile flooring that has become torn exposing the wood below.
The wood in one of these openings is wet and has been chewed or dug out leaving a hole that may accumulate waste
material, creating a potential disease hazard. The torn vinyl shall be repaired or replaced to create a surface that may be
readily cleaned and sanitized to protect the dogs from disease hazard.
