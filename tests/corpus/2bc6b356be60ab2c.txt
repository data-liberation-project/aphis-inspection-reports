2.76(a)
RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
The facility brokered the sale of one female mink and four fennec foxes (two male and two female) on 8/31/18 at an
exotic auction in Tennessee. The records made and maintained for these animals were incomplete. The records for
the mink did not include any acquisition information. The records for the fennec foxes were missing the following
information: the USDA number or drivers license and vehicle license numbers for the person from whom they were
acquired and the color and age of the fennec foxes. Complete and accurate information is necessary to show
ownership of the animals and to allow tracking of the animals. The facility shall make, keep and maintain records
which fully and correctly disclose all the information required by 2.76(a) for each animals brokered. Correct by
9/19/18.
