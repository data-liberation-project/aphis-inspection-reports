In the communal Fennec Fox enclosure there were three female Fennec Foxes that had eye issues that had not
been previously addressed by the licensee.
***Santina (female d.o.b 5/22/08 #5) Appears to have swelling under left eye and is holding the eye shut.
***Chula, (female d.o.b. 6/10/09 #12) Squinting right eye with discharge and dark accumulation around eye.
***Mercedes (female d.o.b. 5/22/08 #7) Squinting left eye with discharge and dark accumulation around eye.
Veterinary care issues with the eye(s) can cause pain and discomfort to the animals, and can lead to further health
complications. The licensee must have the above mentioned animals evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for
proper diagnosis and an effective treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented and made
available to the inspectors upon request.
