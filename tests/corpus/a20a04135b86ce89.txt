2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
***At the time of the inspection, the facility representatives could not produce acquisition documentation for three adult
guinea pigs and one adult sugar glider which were all recently donated to the zoo.
***There is incomplete acquisition information for one male, juvenile Bactrian camel and incomplete disposition
documentation for one adult, male Asiatic water buffalo. The partial paperwork for these two animals lacks a USDA
license number for the seller of the Bactrian camel and the receiver of the Asiatic water buffalo, without a vehicle license
plate number and state or the number of a state-issued driver’s license or photographic identification card.
Complete documentation of acquisition and disposition is required for all animals to ensure their proper use. The licensee
must make, keep and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information as detailed in Part 2,
Subpart G, Section 2.75(b)(1)(i-vii) of the Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations for animals purchased or
otherwise acquired, owned, held, leased or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which are
transported, sold, euthanized or otherwise disposed of by that licensee. The records shall include any offspring born of
any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.

Contingency planning.
At the time of the inspection, the licensee did not have a written contingency plan in place.
A written emergency/contingency plan is required to help ensure animal health and well-being in the event of an
emergency or disaster; without this tool, animals may suffer illness, injury or death due to unpreparedness should an
emergency or disaster strike. The licensee must develop, document and follow an appropriate plan to provide for the
humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster
(one which could reasonably be anticipated and expected to be detrimental to the good health and well-being of the
animals in their possession). The contingency plan must include all of the information and documentation as detailed in
Section 2.134(a-c) of the Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations.

Housing facilities, general.
In one of the spider monkey enclosures, the corrugated metal wall separating the indoor and outdoor portions has an area
several feet long that has areas where the metal has rusted through and created holes with sharp edges.
Sharp metal and holes are a hazard since animals can come into contact with them, resulting in injury or entrapment. All
enclosures must be constructed and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from illness or injury.

3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
There is an approximately eight foot section of perimeter fencing located near the marmoset enclosure that is in disrepair,
causing this portion of the fence to measure only 90.5" in height. This is below the required minimum of 96" in height for
the species inventoried at the time of inspection.


The fence is inadequate because it cannot serve as a secondary containment system for the animals housed in the facility
and cannot prevent other animals and unauthorized persons from entering. The licensee must assess all perimeter fences
at the facility for adequate height and structural integrity and modify the existing fence(s) or install a different perimeter
fence or fences of at least 8 feet in height. The perimeter fence(s) must remain a minimum of three feet from the primary
enclosures and constructed so that the fence(s) protect(s) the animals by restricting entry of outside animals and
unauthorized persons from going through it, or under it, or having contact with the animals in the facility.

Feeding.
***There is one open bag of canine food and one open bag of unidentified, pelleted feed on the shelves in the
commissary. The facility representative disposed of the open feed at the time of inspection. (CORRECTED AT THE
TIME OF INSPECTION)
*** There is a container of insect spray stored on a shelf above a counter and utensils used for food preparation. The
facility representative relocated the can of insect spray at the time of inspection. (CORRECTED AT THE TIME OF
INSPECTION)
***The hay stored inside the haybarn is contaminated by bird feathers and feces.
Food that is not properly stored is subject to deterioration and contamination due to microbial growth or pests and vermin,
which can lead to animal illness. The licensee must ensure that all food is stored to ensure it remains wholesome,
palatable and free from contamination in order to maintain all animals in good health.

3.131(c)

Sanitation.


***The floor of the main commissary is in disrepair to the point that adequate cleaning is difficult or not possible, as the
tiles are missing, broken and/or lifting in several places, where dirt is seen trapped in the resulting spaces. There are also
areas of the floor and shelving that are not in disrepair but are covered in dirt, with cobwebs and rodent feces noted.
***The haybarn used for storage of hay and bedding is untidy, with accumulations of trash (empty plastic bags, torn bags
of wet and molding material and broken pallets) as well as animal feces; the entire floor is covered in several inches of
old, loose hay.
Premises that are not kept clean and in good repair do not facilitate adequate husbandry; they also attract vermin and
pests and can result in contamination of food. The licensee needs to keep facilities in good repair and establish and
maintain an effective method and schedule to keep the premises, including the food preparation area and all food storage
areas, clean and sanitary.

3.131(d)

Sanitation.
***At the time of the inspection, an excessive number of flies are noted to be swarming inside the commissary and landing
on counters and equipment used to prepare food. Mouse feces are also seen on the commissary floor. There are no
methods in place to prevent or control the entry of insects or other vermin.
***Inside the haybarn, there are feathers, bird (and possibly mammalian) feces on the hay and straw bedding, as well as
on the walls and floor of the structure. There are no methods in place to prevent or control the entry of insects, birds or
other vermin.
The presence of pests and vermin encourages contamination of food preparation areas and utensils, as well as the food
itself - which can lead to animal illness. The licensee must establish and maintain a safe and effective program for the


control of insects as well as avian and mammalian pests.
