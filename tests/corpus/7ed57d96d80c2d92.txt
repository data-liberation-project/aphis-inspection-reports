ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1610 on
05/19/2016. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I called three different phone numbers and left a
message on each one. I honked my car horn and waited thirty minutes before leaving.
End of report.
