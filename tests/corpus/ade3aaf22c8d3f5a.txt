3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the genet's enclosure there is a wooden nest box. Inside the box it was observed that there is paint peeling off of
the wooden surface.
Peeling paint presents an ingestion risk, and impedes cleaning. Nest boxes, and all surfaces in animal enclosures,
should be kept in good repair and maintained or replaced on a regular basis, in order to facilitate adequate
sanitation, and to protect the animals from harm.
To be corrected in all enclosures by 6/28/15.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Around the facility grounds there is an accumulation of items that are not in use; plastic containers, unused fencing
and building materials, tarps, unused kennels, and items to be discarded. The presence of these items creates
clutter that impedes housekeeping, and could provide habitat for vermin, which could negatively impact the health
and well-being of the animals. The grounds should be maintained clean and free of debris so as to accommodate
good husbandry practices.
