***In the outdoor facility, there was a male Maltese identified as Prince Lewie #108.561.551 that had no weight
bearing on the right front leg. Upon further observation, in between the digits, the tissue was swollen and red with a
darkened area in the center. The facility representative stated that this problem had been noted this morning during
walk through and would be treated with medication today. According to the program of veterinary care there is no
treatment plan from the attending veterinarian for this type of issue. Limited weight bearing or non-weight bearing
limbs are an indication of discomfort, pain, injury or disease and increase the risks of further deterioration if not
properly diagnosed and treated or left if left unattended. The licensee must have this animal evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian for appropriate diagnosis by May 6, 2014 and treat as directed.
***In the outdoor facility, there was a female French Bulldog identified as Sara Jo #041.366.568 that was walking
cautiously inside the enclosure. Some of the toenails were wrapping around the wire flooring and turning the toe
digits in an abnormal manner as pressure was applied. The facility representative trimmed the toenails during the
inspection. Long toenails can cause discomfort or pain and can lead to injury if left unattended.
***In the medication ready to use storage area, there was a bottle of Vetericyn that expired 02/14. Expired
medications may not produce the desired result. The licensee must remove this medication from the ready to use
medication storage and assure that all medications used on regulated animals is within the manufacturer's
expiration date.
The licensee must assure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care as required.
This inspection began at 0903.
The inspection and exit conference were conducted with the facility representative.
