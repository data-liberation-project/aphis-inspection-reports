***Porcupine Enclosure: The nest box flap only provides coverage for half of the opening to the nest box. The flap
also has jagged edges. The flap provides additional protection from the elements. Structures must be maintained in
good repair to facilitate its purpose for use and to minimize the risk of injury. The flap must be replaced. Corrected
at the time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
