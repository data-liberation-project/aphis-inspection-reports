ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
According to puppy records, on 11-19-2013 five Maltese puppies were born dead and premature, and on 2-10-2014
seven Lhasa Apso puppies were born weak and died over 1-2 days. There was also additional unexplained puppy
deaths documented over the past 6 months. The licensee had notice the unexplained puppy deaths and believed it
to be something wrong with the dam's milk; however, a veterinarian was not contacted. A program of adequate
veterinary care includes the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat all diseases.
Mortality in puppies is an important sign a disease is present. A veterinarian needs to be contacted whenever there
is a sign of disease so the disease can be properly diagnosed and the animal treated. This will improve your
reproductive success and increase the welfare of your animals. While it is up to the discretion of your attending
veterinarian, significant numbers of unexplained deaths warrant diagnostics be preformed which may include a
necropsy. Contact your attending veterinarian to discuss the unexplained puppy deaths and all future unexplained
deaths.
