2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were extensive variably sized (1-2 x 2-4") clumps of matted hair covering the trunk, legs, and tails of the two
young Highland steers. The skin under the mats appeared normal, however, one of the animals withdrew and
seemed irritated upon gentle manipulation of one of the mats near its abdomen.
Extensive matting can cause discomfort to animals and lead to illness. For example, matted hair may eventually pull
on an animal's skin, impede normal movement, or serve as a substrate for disease organisms.
Appropriate methods, such as a program of haircoat maintenance, should be used to appropriately prevent, control,
and treat discomfort and/or disease issues that may arise from excessive matting.
