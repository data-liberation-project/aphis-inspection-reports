FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an open bag of hedgehog food present, which is also stored directly on the floor. Food stored directly on
the floor, against walls or left open can be contaminated and allows deterioration or access to rodents and other
pests.
All open supplies of food and bedding must be kept in leak-proof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent
contamination and spoilage.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The room for the hedgehogs has accumulated fecal material and bedding present on the floor. Cobwebs and debris
are present on the walls. Excess equipment and supplies are filling one side of the animal room. In addition, a
large accumulation of animal cages and other equipment awaiting cleaning are present on the ground in front of the
animal building.
Accumulated bedding and fecal material on the floor contribute to odor and make it difficult to maintain adequate
pest control. Excess equipment makes the animal room difficult to clean and sanitize, and accumulated caging and
other equipment preclude adequate pest control on the premises.
The floors and walls of the animal housing room must be cleaned. Accumulated equipment in front of the animal
building must be cleaned and properly stored. In addition, if the animal room is to be used for the storage of
equipment and supplies, these areas must be cleaned and organized.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
