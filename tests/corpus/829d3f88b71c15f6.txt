SANITATION.
To the north of the sheep enclosure is the storage area for the hay, directly to the north of this is the auxiliary hay
storage area. The ground between these areas has become a collection point for items such as but not limited to
blue tarps, hay bale twine, and fence posts.
This accumulation of items poses a risk to the animals if the wind blows these items into the nearby animal
enclosures, or for the ground to not dry out quickly providing an unhealthy environment for the animals. Steps must
be taken to identify these situations and quickly correct by cleaning and organizing these items in an appropriate
place, to protect the animals from injury and to assist in the prescribed husbandry practice. Steps must be taken to
insure this does not repeat.
Exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
