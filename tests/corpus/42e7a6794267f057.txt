2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection, the facility did not have an up-to-date, written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) signed by
the current attending veterinarian. The facility's PVC was last updated in 2008, and the attending veterinarian listed
on the PVC moved out of state in late 2014, although another vet has been out to the facility in the past year. The
PVC must be reviewed, updated, and completed as necessary to accommodate new attending veterinarians,
animals/species, facility changes or changes in husbandry practices. The new PVC should include more detail in
the emergency and euthanasia section and also document other health topics, such as discussions of
pododermatitis (rabbits). The current attending veterinarian must review the program of veterinary care, sign and
date the forms.

WATERING.
In 2 out of 18 rabbit enclosures, the water bottle or dish had moderate algal growth/debris present. The water
receptacles should be sanitized when dirty, or at least every two weeks. A system of maintenance to sanitize bowls
and replace water bottles when they can no longer be effectively sanitized should be in place. The licensee
immediately replaced the two dirty water receptacles with clean bowls of water.
Corrected during inspection.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The larger enclosure for the sheep/goats had an area (along the upper fence shared with the ponies) where there
were several dangling and protruding pieces of wire from a patch that could potentially cause injury to the animals.
Enclosures for all animals should be structurally sound and maintained in good repair so as to protect the animals
from injury and to ensure their health and well-being. Licensee immediately bent back most of the protruding wires.Corrected during inspection.
