2.31(b)(3)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Eight IACUC meetings have been held since the last USDA inspection on 13 Nov. 2013. The community member
has only participated in three of these eight IACUC meetings which took place on 2/28/14, 5/9/14, 9/25/14,
10/24/14, 11/7/14, 11/21/14, 2/20/15 and 4/17/15. The newly appointed community member started attending with
the 5/9/14 meeting. Without active participation of the community member, the institution is not fulfilling the
requirement of representation of community interests in animal care and treatment. It appears that the new
community member is not able to attend meetings regularly enough to adequately represent community interests. At
least one active member of the IACUC shall not be affiliated in any way with the facility other than as a member of
the IACUC.
An exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
