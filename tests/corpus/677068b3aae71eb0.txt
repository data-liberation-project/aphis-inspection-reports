Cleaning
In the outdoor sections of 3 sheltered enclosures, housing 3 dogs, there is an accumulation of fecal material.
Some of the fecal material had a dried appearance to it indicating that it is old. When questioned as to when the
last time the fecal material was removed from these sections of the enclosures the licensee replied that it had been
more than 1 weeks time. Excreta must be removed from primary enclosures daily in order to protect the health and
well-being of the animals and to reduce disease hazards pests, insects and odors. Licensee must remove the
accumulated fecal material from these enclosures and ensure that all excreta and food waste is removed daily from
primary enclosures.
