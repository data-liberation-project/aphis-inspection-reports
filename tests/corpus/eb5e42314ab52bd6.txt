FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-There is a hole in a metal support bar at the base of a shelter structure in the goat/sheep night pasture. The metal
has deteriorated on this support bar creating a rough edge approximately 1 by 3 inches.
-There is a metal panel on a zebra stall door that is pulling away from the underlying wood and has a rough,
deteriorating edge.
Rough metal edges can cause injury to the animals. The license must ensure that the housing facilities must be
structurally sound and be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Corrected at the time of
inspection.

Food that is or can become contaminated can cause illness, decreased appetite, and decreased nutritive value. The
facility must ensure that food and food receptacles be placed so as to minimize contamination. Food receptacles
must be kept clean and sanitary at all times. Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The night pasture for goats and sheep has excessive amounts of feces in about 90% of the area. The accumulation
of feces is thick in the center of the enclosure and sparser but present along the periphery of the enclosure. The
staff reports that the tractor used to remove excreta from this enclosure is not operational at this time resulting in a
longer that usual time between cleanings. Excessive excreta can increase disease hazards and can lead to odors,
pests and discomfort for the animals. To be corrected by 29 October 2015.
