Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The birth records for the kittens born on the property have not been completed on the documents required and the
information on the litters is not complete.

The lack of updated and proper records can prevent proper management and traceability of the regulated animals coming
and going at the facility.

All records must be complete and on proper USDA record forms for cats and dogs. All broker records must have complete
acquired from address information and disposition(7006) forms for cats and dogs, and complete records for exotic sales.
2.131(a) Repeat

Handling of animals.
The licensee acquired 2 tigers and 2 cougars for exhibition over the past two years. All licensees who maintain wild/exotic
animals must demonstrate adequate experience and knowledge of those animals. There have been many dangerous
incidents, documented in previous inspection reports, that prove a lack of the necessary knowledge and experience.

Since the acquisition of these dangerous animals, the licensee has not taken sufficient steps to gain the essential

knowledge, other than having a person with tiger cub experience at the facility for a short time and talking with other
licensees. The licensee can bring an experienced person (with these species) to the facility or go to other facilities and
work with them to gain the required knowledge/experience.

Lack of the required knowledge/experience is dangerous for the licensee/volunteers/public and the animals and could
result in serious injury or death in any of those groups.

Watering.
The water bowl in the enclosure containing four lemurs' had a moderate amount of green algae on the bottom of the metal
bowl. There is a larger plastic black tub that was full of water in the opposite corner of the enclosure that had a large
amount of dark green algae growth.

Algal growth in water that is available for drinking can be a possible source of disease or other health issues.

All water sources must be kept clean and free of contamination and sanitized at least once every two weeks or as often
as necessary to prevent the accumulation of algae, dirt and debris.

The water sources were cleaned and fresh water provided by the licensee at the end of the inspection before the exit
interview.

Facilities, outdoor.

The eight-foot perimeter fence surrounding the facility is still under construction. The South and East sides of the facility
are still completely open with no fence structure to prevent animals from escaping the property. The North and NW part of
the property has a six-foot perimeter fence, with the SW part of the property having an eight-foot wooden fence behind the
tiger, cougar, macaque and porcupine enclosures.

There is a gap under the entry gate of the cougar enclosure (approx. 2inches) that could allow for a cougar to reach under
the door and make contact with a worker in the walkway area.

An eight-foot perimeter fence is required for the two cougar and two tigers that are in outdoor primary enclosures on the
facility property due to being considered dangerous animals.

There is no six-foot perimeter fence completely surrounding the non-dangerous animals as required. This requirement is
for animals such as the three badgers (bottom of the perimeter fence is not secured and open for animals to get under),
the two coati, Geoffroy's cat, bobcat and non-human primates.

While a six-foot perimeter fence and partial eight-foot perimeter fence surround over half the facility, the remaining South
and East sides are open which can allow any of these animals to escape if they get out of their primary enclosures, and
allow other animals or people to gain entry into the facility and make direct contact with the enclosures.

On July 12-13, 2021 two Cavy escaped their primary enclosure overnight due to a heavy rain and were able to leave the
facility through the unfinished portion of the perimeter fence. If the perimeter fence had been completed the animals would
not have escaped the property approaching neighbors yards and exploring the surrounding woodland and fields. The

animals were recovered and returned to their primary enclosure unharmed the next day.

The perimeter fence must be completed for the dangerous and non-dangerous animals per USDA regulations and
standards for those species.

Watering.
There was no water available in the prairie dog enclosure, the bowl was empty and coated with dirt/debris. The pig and
goat area had a large black plastic tub approx. 2ftx3ft that had a large amount of green algae along the bottom and sides
of the tub, giving the water a dark green/brown color. The other water bowl available was empty. In the lynx enclosure
next to the full rubber water bucket, there was a metal bowl that had turkey meat covered with water that had several
maggots on the surface. While there was water available for the lynx to drink that was clean, the bowl of water with the
contamination was located and available right next to the drinking source.

The presence of algae and water/food sources contaminated with maggots in the bowls/tubs that the animals have
access to can be a source of possible disease and health issues.

All water sources must be kept clean and sanitary.

The water bowl was cleaned and filled for the prairie dogs immediately during the inspection. The water tub for the
pigs/goats was cleaned and filled with fresh water at the end of the inspection and before the exit interview. The bowl of
contaminated food/water was removed from the lynx enclosure immediately during the inspection.

Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee.
