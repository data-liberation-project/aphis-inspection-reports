Outdoor housing facilities.
Two of the three outdoor enclosures, housing five adult domestic cats, are still constructed with wood permeable to
moisture and cannot be properly cleaned or sanitized. One of the enclosures is constructed and framed with unsealed
wood. The enclosed shelter box and wooden ramp are also constructed out of unsealed wood. The second enclosure with
a corresponding shelter box and resting platform is constructed with a mixture of painted and unsealed wood. Surfaces
permeable to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and/or sanitized to meet the requirements set for by 3.11 of the AWA
regulations. In addition, these structures and items are not designed or constructed in a way that they can be easily
removed once they become worn or soiled.
Having surfaces in contact with the animals that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized can expose the cats to
unnecessary disease hazards.
Correct by ensuring that all enclosures, den boxes and furniture type fixtures are designed and constructed of materials
that are impervious to moisture and able to be properly cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced once they become
worn or soiled.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.


Enclosures for domestic cats are not being cleaned with excreta removed daily. Two of the outdoor enclosures housing
five domestic cats have large volume of feces on the floors. In one enclosure, the feces are primarily located in the back
left corner mixed with mulch. Some feces are developing white mold on the surface. The other enclosure has them more
dispersed throughout and mixed with mulch and dirt. The indoor enclosure housing a queen with her kittens has a large
build up of excreta in the litter box as well as some dried feces on the floor outside the litter box and on the floor of the
room, outside the enclosure.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from domestic cat enclosures daily and as often as necessary to prevent the
excessive accumulation of feces and food waste to reduce disease hazards, odors, and pests.
Correct by removing excreta and food waste daily from primary enclosures.
3.11(b) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Enclosures for domestic cats are not being sanitized often enough. The two wooden outdoor cat enclosures have
multiple surfaces such as the ladder ramps, surrounding wood of the hide box, back and side walls, and shelves that are
discolored brown with a top layer of organic debris. The surfaces are discolored yellow and have accumulation of brown
debris. The ceilings in both enclosures and shelter boxes have collections of dust mixed with fur.
Infrequent and improper sanitation of primary enclosures exposes the animals to unnecessary disease hazards, odors,
insects and pests.
Correct by sealing all wood surfaces and sanitizing primary enclosures at least once every 2 weeks and using one of the
approved methods listed in 3.11(b)(3).
3.129(b)

Feeding.


A food receptacle in the kit fox enclosure has large amounts of rust and food dust covering the inner 2/3 of the pail. The
kit foxes are fed from small buckets clipped to the wire frame of the enclosure. The inside of the feed bucket that provides
their dry dog food has brown material caked on the bottom and sides of the bucket. The material appears to be a
combination of rusted metal and deteriorated and caked food.
Insanitary food receptacles can lead increased food spoilage, deterioration, and contamination of any new food placed on
top. Contaminated food can lead to illnesses in the animals exposed. Rusted food receptacles cannot be cleaned and
sanitized adequately.
Correct by May 27, 2022 by keeping food receptacles clean and sanitary at all times, and taking measures to prevent
molding, contamination, and deterioration or caking of food.
3.131(a) Repeat

Sanitation.
Two outdoor enclosures contain an excessive amount of excreta present throughout. The Patagonian cavy enclosure has
a large amount of fecal matter mixed in with straw bedding and covering approximately 1/3 of the floor space. The
potbellied pig has a lot of excreta in the back 1/3 of the enclosure on either side of the igloo shelter.
Animals that come into contact with their own waste can develop a range of diseases that are detrimental to their health.
Correct by ensuring that all enclosures are being cleaned and excreta removed on a routine basis and as often as
necessary to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
