3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the enclosure housing seven guinea pigs, the bottom corner is cracked and broken. This has resulted in jagged
pieces of plastic that are accessible to the animals. The guinea pigs could potentially injure themselves in this area.

Repair or replace the enclosure.

3.56(d)
SANITATION.
Excessive flies were observed in and around the rabbits' enclosures during the time of inspection. The flies were
also seen in and around the soiled rat enclosure adjacent to the rabbits. There were no provisions in place for fly
control during the time of inspection. Flies can carry and spread disease.
Implement and maintain an effective program to control the flies.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. The llama and Hereford bull enclosure fence is in disrepair. The fence (on the public walkway) is bent and
separated from the post. Additionally, there is a stray wire exposed and accessible to the animals.
2. The Santa Cruz sheep and llama enclosure contains re-bar posts (approximately one foot tall) that are exposed
to the animals. The re-bar posts are coming out of the ground and are leaning towards the animals along the south
fence line. 3. The female black bear den contained a loose loop of fence wire on the ground. The bear could potentially injure
itself on this wire.
Sharp points and loose wire on these areas could injure animals. Ensure enclosures and fences are free from loose
wire and sharp points that could possibly injure animals.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The brown bear enclosure did not contain sufficient shelter for the all five bears during the time of inspection. The
enclosure contains two permanent shelters that, when both are available, are sufficient for the bears. The licensee
restricted access to the second shelter because there was a large hole dug underneath it to the outside of the
enclosure. Additionally, the hole was filled with water. All animals must have sufficient shelter to protect them from
inclement weather.
Assure all animals have access to sufficient shelter.
To be corrected: 4-15-19
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
1. The raccoon enclosure contained excessive amounts of feces during the time of inspection. The feces were
concentrated along the perimeter of the enclosure. Feces can harbor disease and attract pests.
2. The Santa Cruz sheep enclosure has a large build up of soiled material along the back fence. The soiled
material has again, partially buried the metal hay feeder and the back fence. The soiled material is approximately
two and a half feet from the top of the fence. The animals could potentially escape from the enclosure at this area of
the fence. Additionally, soiled material can harbor disease and attract pests.
Remove the soiled material and repeat often enough to prevent excessive build up.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner. An additional exit briefing was conducted by
phone with the owner on 4-10-19.Additional Inspectors
