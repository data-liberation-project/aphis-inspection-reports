Miscellaneous.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany the APHIS Official during the inspection process from 11:44 AM to
12:42 PM on 27-SEPT-2022.

Upon arrival, the inspector stopped at a "Private Property - No Trespassing" sign, then called the registrant and left a
message. Emails were sent immediately to both email contacts listed in the registrant's record. After waiting 50 minutes
with no response, the inspector knocked on the door 3 separate times, waited for several minutes, and left a "Sorry We
Missed You" flyer with business card.
