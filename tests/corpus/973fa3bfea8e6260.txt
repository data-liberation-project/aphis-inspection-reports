3.14(c)(1)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
The facility had accepted and was holding for shipment two enclosures with ventilation on all four sides of the
enclosure, each containing one puppy. Both of the enclosures had tape covering several ventilation holes on both
the left and right sides of the enclosures. After measuring the open ventilation and the total surface area of each
side, it was determined that both left and right sides of both enclosures had less then the required 8% surface area
unobstructed for proper ventilation. Proper ventilation is required to ensure the health and well being of the animals
during the shipping process. This facility must ensure that all enclosures meet the requirements for ventilation. The
tape on both of these enclosures was adjusted so that they met ventilation requirements prior to delivering for
shipment.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the desk agent.
