ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
1. While conducting this inspection it was noted that one of the female muntjac had an approximate 2" x 2" patch of
fur missing on her right side. To ensure that the fur loss is not causing this animal any discomfort it will need to be
evaluated by the attending veterinarian.
2. One of the Timber wolves was noted to have a red, raw area on the top of its nose. This area was right along the
hair line. The attending vet did see this animal in August 2017. According to the staff they were putting an ointment
on its nose for a little while. However, that treatment has been discontinued and no other treatments have been
prescribed. It appears that the attending vet has not been contacted about this animals condition. All suggestions
and recommendations from the attending vet will need to be followed.
3. While reviewing the supplies of medical equipment and medications it was noted that a few items were outdated.
These medications were readily available for the use on the animals. All medications need to be kept currant and
within date.
4. This facility is using an additional attending vet for its wolf hybrids and small animals. To ensure that this vet will
provide appropriate care for these specific species a new Program of Veterinary Care form will need to be
completed.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
While reviewing the records of the recently acquired animals it was noted that the records were not complete. The
paperwork on the new chinchillas only contained the name of the person that brought the animals to the facility. The
paperwork on the new mink only contained the name and address of the facility the mink was acquired from.
Records need to document the name, address, date of transaction, USDA # (if applicable), or Driver's License #and Vehicle plate number of the person selling / donating the animal. All records need to be kept currant and
accurate.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. While conducting this inspection it was noted that the hybrid wolf enclosure was in need of attention. The floor /
base of the small, wooden dog house in the enclosure was beginning to deteriorate. The front support wood piece
was rotting away. To ensure the safety of these animals this dog house will need to be addressed.
2. There were also 2 areas where the dirt had eroded away and now the 2" x2" wire mesh was exposed. This was
by the gate and by the door to the building. Again to ensure the safety of these animals these areas will need to be
addressed.

EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
This facility has added on another attending veterinarian for the small animals and wolf hybrids. However, the
Exercise Plan was approved by an attending vet that is no longer associated with this facility. Therefore, a new
Exercise Plan form needs to be completed and approved by the new attending veterinarian.

3.50(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a small wood shed, adjacent to the ring tailed lemur enclosure that houses 2 rabbits. The left wall is made
up of 2 sheets of plywood. However, the sheet on the right has begun to detach from the studs and there is now a
gap between the two sheets of wood. To ensure this gap or sheet of plywood does not cause any injury to the
rabbits, it will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: March 10, 2018
3.75(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The ceiling of the ring tailed lemurs indoor enclosure was in need of attention. There are sections where small
holes, or bare sheet rock is exposed. All surfaces in a primate area need to be maintained so that they can be
readily cleaned and sanitized. These areas can not be sanitized. Therefore, the ceiling will need to be addressed. ***To Be Corrected By: April 1, 2018
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. They recently purchased a new mink. At this time the mink is being housed in an enclosure that is constructed of
three wood walls, a wood ceiling, and a 1" x 1" wire mesh on the front section. The zoo is current closed for the
season. However, this will not be able acceptable once the zoo is open to the public. This mesh is too large and will
not restrict the public from gaining direct access to this animal.
***To Be Corrected By: April 1, 2018 or before the zoo opens for the season, whichever comes first.
2. The wood sided barn and wooden framed gate in the camel enclosure are in need of attention. Roof shingles are
missing above the door, the wood boards on the sides are being chewed, and the gate frame is also being chewed.
A screw was protruding from the upper, left corner of the gate. All areas need to be maintained on a regular basis to
ensure that the animals are not injured.
***To Be Corrected By: March 24, 2018
3. The enclosure that houses the 2 fruit bats has exposed yellow, foam insulation present. The insulation is in the
upper, back, right corner. To ensure that the bats are not chewing or picking at this insulation it will need to be
addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: March 10, 2018
4. The back fence line of the sheep enclosure is in need of attention. The section of wire mesh fencing, to the left of
the back gate, has begun to bow upwards. This is now protruding up into the sheep enclosure. To ensure that they
are not injured on this mesh, it will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: March 10, 2018
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. In the parking area within the zoo grounds there is a shed that is used to store the shavings. However, there is a
section, and layer, of missing roof shingles just above the doorway. This building needs to maintained structurally
sound to ensure the supplies are protected from deterioration. This roof will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: March 31, 2018
2. In speaking with the staff I was informed that the walk-in refrigerator leaks when there is a rain storm. Due to the
fact that produce is stored in this refrigerator this leak will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: March 10, 2018 to do a temporary repair
***To Be Corrected By: May 1, 2018 for a permanent repair3. During this inspection it was noted that an opened bag of shavings was present in the room with the 2 newly
acquired chinchillas. All opened bags of food or bedding need to be stored in closed containers. This situation will
need to be addressed.

3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
On the previous inspection (7/20/17) it was noted that the shed for the camels was not large enough. This facility
has 1 Dromedary camel and 1 Bactrian camel. They currently have an 8' x 12' shed. There is also a large number of
deciduous trees within their enclosure / pasture. However, the shed / shelter is not large enough for these camels
during the winter months. Due to their size and temperament an additional shed needs to be provided. While
observing the Dromedary walk out of the shed it was noted that his hump narrowly clears the top frame of the
doorway. This facility was given a correction date of 12/1/2017. This situation will need to be addressed.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
1. On the previous inspection (7/20/17), it was noted that the back kitchen had a sink and a blue Formica and
counter top cabinet. However, the right side was missing a piece of Formica. This exposed bare presswood. This
material can not be properly cleaned or sanitized. This was present again during the inspection today. This area
needs to be addressed.
2. There is also an accumulation of cobwebs and dirt between the window panes and wire mesh covering of the
leopards indoor housing den. To ensure that the area is kept clean this will need to be addressed.
***To Be Corrected By: March 3, 2018
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
During this inspection it was noted that this facility has an issue with mice. The back kitchen had mice droppings all
over the sink. There were droppings on the stainless steel table that housed the barrels of dry food products in the
main kitchen. There was also a mouse seen running into the gap of the wall in the rabbit shed (noted under 3.50
(a)). An effective pest control program needs to be established and maintained.

3.132 REPEATEMPLOYEES.
On the previous inspection (7/20/17) it was noted that there were not enough employees to maintain the zoo in
compliance with the USDA regulations. On the previous inspection I was informed that the facility had 3 full time
employees (keepers) doing all of the animal care work. During this inspection I was informed that they only had 2
full time employees (keepers). And the Executive Zoo Director is on Administrative Leave. This facility has
approximately 90 mammals, 35-40 reptiles, and 10-15 birds. In light of the lack of keepers, the lack of a supervisor
who has a background in animal care, and the number of non compliant, and repeat, items noted during these past
two inspections, it is apparent that more employees are needed. This issue will need to be addressed.
The exit briefing was conducted at the time of this inspection. This exit briefing was conducted with Sarah Tsitso,
Sr. Director Organizational Development.
