2.50(a)(1) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
None of the ten adult dogs in the facility had any verifiable Identification. The licensee stated they have tags, but
none of them were affixed to their neck by means of a collar. All live dogs held on the premises, purchased or
acquired must be identifiable by tag, tattoo, or microchip in order to properly track the animals, facilitate the required
recordkeeping and to ensure the identity of the dogs can be known for certain. The licensee must provide proper
identification of all the dogs.
This is a repeat non-compliant item.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor shelter structure housing four Pembroke Welch corgis has a back wooden wall that is scratched, worn,
and deteriorated to the point that it can no longer be properly cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces that cannot be
cleaned and sanitized can cause disease and other health risks. The licensee must ensure all surfaces that come
in contact with the animals must be able to be properly cleaned and sanitized or must be replaced when worn.
This a repeat non-compliant item.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In an enclosure within the sheltered facility there is an accumulation of dirt, sand and other organic material on the
floor and on the inside/outside access door. When questioned as to when the last time was that the licensee had
cleaned this enclosure he stated that it had been "10 days to 2 weeks".
Inside of the sheltered facility there is an accumulation of dirt, dust, and cobwebs throughout the entire building.
This build-up of dirt, grime, cobwebs, and other organic material could become a disease hazard, and attract
rodents and other pests. The licensee must ensure that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact with are
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every two weeks (or more often if necessary). All other surfaces of
housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards
and practices.
This affects 1 adult dog and 3 puppies. To be corrected by: 27 May 14
3.11(d) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Inside of the sheltered facility, affecting 1 adult dog and 3 puppies, there is an accumulation of rodent droppings on
top of the whelping boxes, floors, and window sills. Rodents and rodent droppings can transmit diseases to the
dogs and puppies. The licensee is currently not using any type of rodent bait or other means of controlling rodents.
The licensee must clean the affected areas and establish an effective program of rodent control and ensure that
rodent droppings are removed from the facility for the health and well-being of the dogs.
