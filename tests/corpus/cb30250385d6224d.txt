2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***During the inspection, expired medications were found including: Ivermectin expired 07/2013 and 1 bottle of
sterile saline expired 13 Jun. Use of expired or improperly stored medical materials is not considered to be
adequate veterinary care as the effects cannot be guaranteed to appropriately treat the animals condition and the
materials may become contaminated which poses a risk to the animals. Appropriate methods to prevent, control,
diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries shall be used, established, and maintained as part of the program for
veterinary care.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The wood lean to in the sheep area, of the drive through section, had nails that had become loose and are
protruding from the wooden structure. The loose nails pose a risk of injury to the animals and can decrease the
structural stability of the structure.
***Inside one of the wooden shelters in the petting zoo area, there were nails that were not driven in to the studs
and were protruding from the wooden structure. The protruding nails pose a risk of injury to the animals and can
decrease the structural stability of the structure. The protruding nails were removed during the inspection.
*** The enclosure housing 3 collared peccaries had several areas in which the lathe (metal framework) under the
gunite was exposed and twisted with sharp points. The building materials were not maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury.
***The drain access in the river otter exhibit is not being maintained in a manner to protect the animals from injury.
The drain lever is in the bottom of a tube which has no lid/top on it. The facility is using a rock in the end of the tube
to restrict access of the animals into the tube. There is a gap between the edge of the tube and the rock, which the
otters may fit into and injury themselves. The facility must find an alternative to the rock, in order to restrict the
animal's access into the tube and protects the animals from injury.Failure to maintain housing and exhibit facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. The
affected structures must be repaired or replaced and all facilities should be maintained and kept structurally sound
to protect and contain the animals moving forward.

WATERING.
***The beaver exhibit uses a dive/swimming pool as the only source of potable water for the animal. At the time of
the inspection, the water was very turbid and full of debris and would not be considered safe for drinking.
***The petting zoo area uses a shallow pool as the only source of potable water for the animals in that area. At the
time of inspection, there was a buildup of green and brown debris on the interior surface of the pool.
Potable water receptacles/sources must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in order to ensure that the
animals are provided with clean, potable water, to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain
adequate hydration. Water sources/receptacles should be cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain
standard husbandry practices.
To be corrected by 5/13/15.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted by 2 Animal Care Veterinary Medical Officers with the chief operating
officer.
