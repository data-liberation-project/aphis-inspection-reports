INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC had their meetings & facility inspections on February 19, 2015, and then again on April 6, 2016. It is
recognized that there might have been difficulties in setting a date for these activities due to weather or other
commitments of the members, but these activities shall occur at least once every 6 months.
Efforts shall be made to ensure that these activities are performed at least once every 6 months. This can be
accomplished (but not limited to) having shorter intervals between these IACUC responsibilities, using technology
(such as Skype for meetings), or appointing new member(s) who can commit the necessary time to being a IACUC
member.
No further correction is necessary at this time. Ensure all IACUC activities are conducted at least once every 6
months.
