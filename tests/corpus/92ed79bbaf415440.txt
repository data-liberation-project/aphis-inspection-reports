Watering.
In an enclosure housing 2 camels, the designated water receptacle contained a large amount of algae growth. The water
was slightly murky and the bottom of the receptacle could not be observed. Failure to maintain the drinking water
receptable in clean and sanitary conditions could result in water quality that could be harmful to the animals. All water
receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

Facilities, general.
At the time of inspection, there were two juvenile camels freely roaming within the perimeter fence of the licensee’s
property. The licensee has plans to house the camels in a pasture with other animals already housed there once the
camels mature to their adult size. The young camels currently have access to the entire area within the perimeter fence.
Within this “facility/enclosure”, the camels have access to a variety of potentially hazardous materials such as fencing
materials and equipment, large farming machinery, and a shed that stores common farm compounds that are not for
animal consumption. Un-restricted access to these materials and compounds can be a source of injury for the animals.
Correct by ensuring the young camels are being housed in a facility/enclosure that is sound and protects the camels from


injury.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
At the time of inspection, the indoor portion of an enclosure housing four squirrel monkeys had an accumulation of feces
and food waste on the floor of the enclosure. The enclosure had not been cleaned that day and the employee whose duty
it was to clean the enclosure had already left for the day per the licensee. Excreta and food waste much be removed from
inside each indoor primary enclosure daily to prevent the nonhuman primates from becoming soiled and in order to
reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
Correct by implementing a daily cleaning schedule to remove excreta and food waste.

Outdoor housing facilities.
At the time of inspection, two outdoor enclosures housing four lemurs total did not provide adequate shelter from the cold.
The lemurs are provided with a single-layer wooden nesting box filled with hay for protection from the elements. The
licensee confirmed that the animals are not provided with an additional source of heat should the temperature drop below
45F. The Weather Channel has archived nightly temperatures as low as 29 degrees Fahrenheit for the month of February
2021.
Outdoor housing facilities for nonhuman primates must provide adequate shelter from the elements at all times. Lemurs
are known to be sensitive to cold weather conditions which can cause frostbite injuries. The shelter must safely provide
heat to the nonhuman primates to prevent the ambient temperature from falling below 45 degree F except as directed by


the attending veterinarian and in accordance with generally accepted professional and husbandry practices.
