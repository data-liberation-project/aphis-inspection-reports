ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***"Baxter", white male maltese (ID # 049-295-023) had an excessive buildup of a dark brown material on the cheek
teeth extending up to the gum line. Most of the cheek teeth could not be visualized. The gums were swollen and
reddened and a malodorous smell was coming from his mouth that is evident when standing about 2 feet from the
dog. There was a white creamy material along the gum line near one of the large cheek teeth on the right side.
The buildup of abnormal material on teeth with a discharge at the gum line can be painful, impact the ability of the
dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal. The licensee must have this animal examined by a
veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must
be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
