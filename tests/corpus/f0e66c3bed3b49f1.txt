3.127(d) Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
The enclosure housing a North American Black Bear does not have an 8ft perimeter fence on its Northern side. The
portion of the perimeter fence on its Eastern side is less than the required 8ft. An improper perimeter fence can provide
unwanted and unauthorized people and animals access to the animals. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that
it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and
having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the facility.
To be corrected by your next re-license inspection.

This is a 1st Relicense Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
Applicant. All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by July 3, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the
license fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
