2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One of the dogs pulled for a brief exam during the inspection was found to have moderate buildup of dark brown – black
exudate and moderate inflammation in the right ear. The animal was not shaking its head or showing any obvious signs of
discomfort at the time of inspection. Daily observations had already been performed, and none of the staff, including the
attending veterinarian, were aware of the condition. Daily observations are a key aspect in identifying ailments and issues
pertaining to the animals. If they are not performed adequately, the animals’ health and well-being can be negatively
impacted. The facility must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily observation of
all animals to assess their health and well-being. Furthermore, should the daily observation of animals be performed by
someone other than the attending veterinarian, a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-being is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian. The animal was scheduled to have its ear cultured, cleaned and treated after these findings.

3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.


The facility does not have a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC), as is required with maintaining dogs at the facility.
The PVC serves to list general routine protocols and measures the attending veterinarian (AV) will utilize while caring for
the animals. Each facility must follow an appropriate PVC for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and signed
by the AV.
