INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC member who is serving as the unaffiliated member serving the general community interest is employed
as a supervisor of an animal facility at the local university. Although this member can serve on the committee, her
appointment to represent the community as an unbiased representative for the proper care and treatment of
animals, is not appropriate as she works with animals and animal researchers in her profession. Another member
needs to be appointed to serve to represent the community interest as the unaffiliated member. IACUC members
need to be officially appointed by the Institutional Official. To be corrected before the next IACUC meeting.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Although the IACUC meets every 6 months and conducts a facility inspection and a brief program review, they have
not been sending reports of these meetings and inspections to the Institutional Official. The IO usually attends the
meetings. The IACUC members have signed reports of meetings and facility inspections. After facility inspections
and program reviews are conducted, reports documented all findings, indicating if there are or are not any minority
views to the report need to be sent to the Institutional Official. If deficiencies are identified, a plan for correction,
with dates for correction, and identifying them as significant or minor, are required on the report to the IO. To be
corrected with future inspections.
2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There is one protocol which decribes the procedures used to produce altered tissue which is then harvested after
euthanasia. This protocol needs to provide additional details. Other species are mentioned in the protocol without
stating that those species' tissues are purchased from vendors. In the description of one agent given, the time
frames for the induction, the overnight fast, and the euthanasia are not clear. The protocol states inducing agents
may be used singly or in combinations, but does not describe how or why and when those combinations will be
used. The protocol does not state what actions will be taken if any animal experiences unanticipated side effects.
Because some of the agents used in this protocol are chemicals and therefore are non-pharmaceutical grade,
complete justification of their use is required. To be corrected by 8-31-15.2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.

available written Program of Veterinary Care available for review is dated 2009 and was written by the former
attending veterinarian. A new written Program of Veterinary Care needs to be completed by the current attending
veterinarian. To be corrected by 8-31-15.
Exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
