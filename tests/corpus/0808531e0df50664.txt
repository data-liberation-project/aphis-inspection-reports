FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
One outdoor rabbit enclosure houses five young rabbits. A tarp is secured over the rabbit cage at night to protect
the rabbits from cold weather. With outdoor temperatures predicted to be below 40 degrees this weekend,
additional methods of protection from cold weather (such as shelter boxes and dry bedding material) are necessary.
When cold weather is likely to cause discomfort, sufficient protection from low temperatures must be provided for
the rabbits. To be corrected by: November 20, 2015.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are three deer housed together in one outdoor enclosure with one shelter. One section of the shelter wall
appears to have become detached from the shelter structure and is laying on the ground. This shelter must be
repaired in order to provide adequate shelter for all the deer. Outdoor housing facilities must be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by: December 18, 2015.
In one sheep enclosure, there are sheets of corrugated metal attached to the bottom of the primary enclosure fence.
There is a large hole (approximately 12" x 12") rusted through one metal sheet at head height for the four sheep
housed in this pen. This hole has sharp pieces of rusty metal protruding inwards which could injure the animals.
This area of fencing must be repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury. To be corrected by: December
18, 2015.
