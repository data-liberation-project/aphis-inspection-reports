2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On July 30th, 2021 ten rhesus macaques escaped from their primary enclosure and into the hallway of the facility.
According to facility representatives, the animal care staff employee who was cleaning during the incident did not make
sure the latch of the lock was completely secure. The employee was able to return 9 of the rhesus macaques to their
primary enclosure. While returning the macaques to their primary enclosure, one juvenile macaque escaped into an
uncovered floor drain. The baskets that covered the drain was removed at the time for cleaning.

The facility attempted to retrieve the juvenile macaque from the drain, which included digging up the sewer main. The
macaque was dead when it was removed from the drain by facility representatives.

Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

This was corrected by the facility through installation of permanent grates over all drains to prevent animals from entering.


Other appropriate corrective actions were taken, which included retraining of all employees that work with the primates at
the facility.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
