CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the outdoor portion of at least 7 enclosures, containing at least 11 dogs, there is an excessive buildup of feces.
The feces are covering the majority of the flooring and there is a very limited amount of space in the outdoor portion
of the enclosure in which the dogs will not come into contact with the feces. The licensee stated that he had not
cleaned the enclosures since the previous week. A buildup of feces could increase the risk of disease towards the
dogs and could cause the dogs to become soiled.
Excreta must be removed from the enclosures daily and as often as necessary to prevent the excessive
accumulation of feces and to prevent the soiling of the dogs and to reduce disease hazards, pests and odors. The
licensee must remove the feces from the enclosures every day and as often as necessary to prevent the excessive
buildup of feces in order to support the health and well-being of the dogs.
To be corrected by: Feces must be removed from the enclosures every day.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.(cid:9)
