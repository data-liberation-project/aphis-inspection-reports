2.4(d) REPEAT
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
During initial contact with the licensee, he immediately became belligerent with the APHIS officials. Upon arrival, the
licensee quickly walked towards the inspectors while pointing at them. In a hostile tone, the licensee stated that if
one of the inspectors walked further onto the property near the no-trespassing sign he was going to call the Sheriff's
Office and have the inspector arrested. Additionally, he intimidated the inspector by insisting he walk further onto
the property so he could attempt to have him arrested. Multiple times the licensee belittled one of the inspectors by
using profane language to describe that inspector. He later made an indirect threat stating he wanted to find out
where that inspector lived. The licensee made comments in reference to contacting the Fort Collins office
requesting one of the inspectors not return to the property. He indicated that the inspector keeps returning and
suggested that's how people get killed.
Interfering with the inspection process prevents the Secretary from fulfilling his obligation to enforce the Animal
Welfare Act.
The licensee shall not interfere with, threaten, verbally abuse or harass any APHIS official in the course of carrying
out his or her duties.
2.126(a) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The inspectors arrived at the facility at approximately 12:00 pm on June 29, 2015. Upon arrival, the inspectors made
contact with the licensee(cid:25). The licensee stated one inspector could do the inspection but he refused access to the
other inspector and told him to leave the property. The licensee later stated he would allow the inspectors to inspect
but one inspector couldn(cid:25)'t talk. One inspector advised the licensee that refusing to allow all inspectors on the
inspection would be a refusal of inspection and would be cited. The inspector told the licensee that he was getting
cited for refusal to allow inspection since he was refusing to allow all inspectors on the property and that it would be
sent in the mail. Failure to provide APHIS officials with access for inspection upon request interferes with the ability of the officials to
protect the welfare of the animals and prevents the Secretary from fulfilling his obligation to enforce the Animal
Welfare Act.
Licensees must allow APHIS officials to conduct inspections to assess the welfare of the animals and enforce the
Animal Welfare Act.
