No non-compliant items were identified during this inspection.
A portion of this inspection was focused on the dogs identified in the Direct 2.40 (a) (2) and 2.40 (b) (2) citations
written on the 11/09/2015 report. The attending veterinarian was contacted and a complete plan for the care of the
identified animals was developed. On 11/13/2015 the adult male Yorkshire terrier with USDA tag# 12 received a
dental cleaning by the attending veterinarian. The adult female Shih Tzu with USDA tag #14 was pregnant when
identified. This animal was still whelping at the time of the re-inspection. Per the plan developed with the attending
veterinarian, she will receive appropriate dental care one week post weaning. A plan for appropriate palliative care
has been developed and is currently being implemented for this female.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted by the Licensee(cid:25)s wife and Veterinary Medical Officer Michael
