3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Five cages each housing a single rabbit had excessive accumulation of feces, waste, hair, and debris on the floors
and cage walls. Buildup of waste is a source of contamination to the enclosed animals, and increases the risk of
disease and negative health impacts. All affected enclosures must be thoroughly cleaned, and sanitized as needed.
The licensee must keep these enclosures reasonably clean to protect the health of the rabbits.
