SANITATION.
Pest control.
The pest control program is not effectively controlling the loose crickets at the facility. Dozens of crickets are loose
in the facility mammal room. They are present on the floors, walls, shelves, and even in the animal enclosures. No
fewer than six crickets were observed in the guinea pig food storage bin when the employee lifted the lid for
inspection. The facility has glue traps deployed in an effort to control the crickets, however; they are not effectively
controlling the population.
Establish, implement, and maintain a program to effectively control the cricket population at the facility.
