OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Sec. 3.78 0utdoor housing facilities. (d) Perimeter fence.
* A section of perimeter fence on the backside has been taken down. There was cattle paneling on the backside.
This paneling has large openings and is not 6 feet tall. This paneling could let in unauthorized humans and animals
to go through it or under allowing for unauthorized contact to the two primates. The primates housing facility must
have a perimeter fence that is 6 feet tall. The perimeter fence must be constructed so it protects the primates by
restricting unauthoraized humans and animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going through it or
under it. Therefore, preventing unwanted contact and protection that will be provided with the perimeter fence.

* There were tall weeds and grass around the enclosure housing two non-human primates. The tall weeds were
approximately 1(cid:25) to 3(cid:25) tall. Premises must be kept free of tall weeds, grass and brush. This will facilitate cleaning
of the premise and pest control. To include, reducing or eliminating breeding and living areas for rodents, pests
and other vermin. As a result, a clean premise and pest control will reduce the disease hazards to the primates
caused by rodents, pests and other vermin.
