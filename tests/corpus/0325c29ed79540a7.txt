ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 on
12/19/2014.
Upon arrival I spoke with the licensee who was leaving the facility and could not stay for the inspection process. We
discussed future hours of availability.
This is the first attempted inspection.
