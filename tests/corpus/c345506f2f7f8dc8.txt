PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
Four bulldog puppies arrived IAH on AWB 7770-7560 from KBP via AMS on October 4, 2017. Two primary
enclosures contained two puppies each. There was insufficient room in the enclosures for the puppies to turn
around normally or simultaneously lie flat in the enclosures. Each enclosure measured 21 in. L x 15 in. H x 15 in.W
and the puppies contained in each enclosure collectively weighed 25 lbs.
Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs must be large enough to ensure that each animal contained in the
enclosure has enough space to turn around normally while standing and to lie in a natural position. These space
requirements during transportation are in place to allow the dogs to make normal postural adjustments during
extended periods of confinement thereby reducing potential discomfort, injury and anxiety during travel.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with assistant cargo operations managers.
