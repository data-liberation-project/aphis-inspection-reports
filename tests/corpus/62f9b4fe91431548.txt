2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
2.40 (b) (3) The older female Pronghorn antelope has excess hair loss along both the right and left side from behind
the front legs to the hips. In several areas where the hair is missing, the exposed skin is thickened and has a dark
pigmentation. Animal caretaker stated that the younger female pronghorn was excessively mounting the older
female which could potentially be stressful for this animal. These two female pronghorns need to be evaluated by
the attending veterinarian in order to determine if there is a medical and/or behavioral problem with the excess
mounting and hair loss. Ensure that a mechanism of direct and frequent communication is accomplished so that
timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.125 (a) Structural Strength. Along the southwest side of the enclosure housing 1 adult coyote named "Wiley", the
innermost layer of fencing is curled upward with broken sharp edges. The broken wire with the sharp edges could
potentially cause an injury to the animal. Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound and
in good repair to protect the animals from injuries.
