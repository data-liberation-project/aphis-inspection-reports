3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning and sanitation of primary enclosures. There are still accumulations of dirt and grime on the back side of 20
wire enclosures and on the rear support frames for the guinea pig breeders on the east side of the building.
The licensee is in the process of replacing all the wire enclosures with new enclosures with solid sides and flooring.
Since the previous inspection report dated August 1, 2016 a total of 25 enclosures were built.
The accumulations of dirt and grime exposes the guinea pigs to potential infections with bacteria, fungi, and
parasites. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are clean and sanitized often enough to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, grime and debris. Additionally, ensure that the primary enclosures are sanitized at least once
every two weeks.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
