3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
A 6yr old intact male bobcat, Rascal, was injured by a wild snake on approximately July 10th, 2022. He sustained injuries
to his abdomen and right front leg. The facility has put up additional fencing around some of the enclosures and a black
netting around portions of the perimeter fence; however, additional measures may be needed to prevent future snake
interactions. Failure to maintain the enclosures free of snakes has allowed for snake injuries and resulted in this animal
experiencing significant pain and distress. The facility must establish an effective plan to mitigate entry of wild snakes into
the exhibited animals' enclosures. The outdoor housing facilities must protect the animals from injury.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence was not in compliance at the time of inspection. There was a section of perimeter fence
approximately 10ft in length that had a gap of about 5 inches at the bottom. This gap could allow animals unwanted
access to the property. Additionally, a pile of concrete rubble had been placed next to the perimeter fence effectively
decreasing the height to less than 8ft as required for dangerous animals. This may allow the animals inside the property
to climb out. The perimeter fence must prevent unauthorized persons and animals from going through it or under it and


having contact with the animals in the facility. It must also act as a secondary containment system for the animals inside.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
3.129(a)

Feeding.
There were several items in the fridge section that were not wholesome and free from contamination. Two egg cartons
were encased in a fine layer of black mold. The egg cartons were on a shelf next to open containers of fresh fruit.
Furthermore, USDA Officials identified dairy products that had expired in May 2022 and March 2022. A discussion with
the facility's AV confirmed that they did not approve expired dairy products to be fed to the animals.
The ingestion of mold and expired food products can be detrimental to the health and welfare of the animals. Additionally,
the presence of mold on and around open containers of fruits and/or vegetables does not keep them free from
contamination. The licensee shall ensure that the food is wholesome, palatable and free from contamination.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
