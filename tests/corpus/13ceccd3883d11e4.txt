ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** There were a lot rabbits (rabbits A-61, B-143, A-42, A-68, E-427, E-419, E-418, E-417, E-413, G-616, G-561,
G-631, F-524, G-684, F-499 and H-725) with yellow, black and grey colored debris in both ears. The facility has a
treatment plan but these rabbits were overlooked and were not treated. None of these rabbits exhibited any signs of
head shaking, head tilting, scratching, or hematomas but a couple of them had an excessive amount of debris
There is a concern that these rabbits may have ear mites in their ears. When the clinical signs were identified the
President instructed the staff to treat the rabbits right away with medication prescribed by the attending veterinarian.
All animals shall be observed daily in sufficient detail to assess their health and well being, taking into account
previous history of disease &/or other conditions that may be prevalent to a particular species, to minimize the
discomfort of affected animals as well as the possibly of disease transmission to other susceptible animals. No
further correction needed at this time.
** There were two rabbits (H-721 and D-193) with eye conditions and one rabbit (E-451) with severe diarrhea. One
rabbit had an opaque white appearance with a disturbed surface covering its right eye. The rabbit didn't exhibit any
signs of distress or pain but there was some drainage from the eye. The second rabbit had yellow crust and some
drainage from his right eye which was completely sealed shut. The rabbit with the diarrhea had an increased
respiration rate and was stretched out. The President stated that it has been bred twice without producing any litters
and would probably be euthanized. None of these conditions were observed by the staff and they had not consulted
the veterinarian. All animals shall be observed daily in sufficient detail to assess their health and well being, taking
into account previous history of disease &/or other conditions that may be prevalent to a particular species, to
minimize the discomfort of affected animals as well as the possibly of disease transmission to other susceptible
animals. A mechanism for direct & frequent caretaker communication is required so that timely information about
animal health & well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian to reduce the risk of further spread of the
disease to the affected animal as well as other susceptible animals. Correct by October 26, 2015
3.56(a)(1)SANITATION.
** The rabbit cages have a dusty coating with hair and cobwebs. Inadequate cleaning of the primary enclosures
increases the risk of bacterial growth and other disease hazard. The enclosures shall be cleaned and kept
reasonably free of hair, cobwebs and other debris. Correct by October 29, 2015
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the President.
