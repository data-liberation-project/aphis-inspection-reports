2.126(c) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee has failed to provide the Animal Care office with a travel itinerary. The Animal Care regional offices
had not received an itinerary from the licensee prior to overnight travel. The absence of an itinerary inhibits
inspection for compliance with regulations and standards of the Act while the animals are away from the home
facility.
The licensee must submit an itinerary to the Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of travel whenever
the animals will be exhibited at a location other than the approved site(s) and whenever travel extends overnight.
The itinerary shall contain complete and accurate information concerning the whereabouts of all animals intended
for exhibition at any location other than the approved site.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
