2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
In the section of the protocol that involved the breeding colony of grasshopper mice, the number of breeding pairs
requested by the principal investigator was provided. However, there were insufficient details regarding the number
of offspring to be produced and no justification for either the number of offspring or breeding pairs requested. It is
necessary for the principal investigator to state and justify the numbers of animals to be used so that the IACUC can
determine that the minimum animals would be used. The IACUC must review this information as part of the
protocol approval process. The protocol should be amended to provided these necessary details.
