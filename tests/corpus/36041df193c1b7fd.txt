WATERING.
The goats’ water trough was dry and contained branches and leaves. When the trough was emptied and filled with
fresh water, the goats came and observed but did not drink excessively. The sheep waterer needs attention due to
rust starting along its edges. Lack of access to potable water can negatively impact the animals’ health. Access to
potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals. Goat trough was
corrected at time of inspection. Correct sheep waterer by November 24, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility owner.
