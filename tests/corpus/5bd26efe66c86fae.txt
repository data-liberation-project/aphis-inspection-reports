ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:40 a.m. on
02/17/2015.
I arrived at the facility at approximately 9:40 a.m. and called the cell phone of the licensee. Licensee answered the
phone and informed me that she was not at the facility. She also stated she would not be able to meet me today to
perform the inspection due to her schedule. The licensee updated me with the days and times that work best for her
facility.
