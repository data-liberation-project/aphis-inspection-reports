Several guinea pigs were noted to have old wounds on their ears and bodies. One hamster had a large scab on its
face; and another hamster was observed dragging both rear legs and appeared to be paralyzed. These animals had
not received any veterinary care at the time of inspection. The attending veterinarian was contacted, and stated that
the licensee needs to contact him regarding proper wound care and injury treatment.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.

covering the floor. Excess build-up of feces creates a disease hazard and contaminates the animals. Primary
enclosures shall be cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris.

3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Four (4) gerbil enclosures each contained a decomposing animal. Licensee stated he was not aware that dead
gerbils were present in the identified cages, but was due to clean them within the next day. Dead animals remaining
in enclosures pose as a health risk and serve as an attractant of vermin to the remaining animals. Dead animals
must be promptly removed to prevent disease hazards.
CORRECT BY : 5/1/19.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Rodent droppings were identified in all the animal rooms this date. Wild rodents harbor diseases that may harm and
kill domestic rodents. Licensee stated that bait stations are refilled monthly. Pest control was also an issue on the
inspection of June 26, 2017. Pest control must be increased and an effective control program maintained to providea healthy environment for the animals and to reduce the chance of disease transmission.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee.
