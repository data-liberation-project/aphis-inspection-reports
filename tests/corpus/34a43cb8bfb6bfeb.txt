RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There was no disposition record of animal identified as "Tiger/Male Jeff Nevada, born at park 06/26/2017" that was
on previous inventory submitted late July 2017 but omitted from current inventory.
Animals transferred to or acquired from other licensees must have disposition records containing all required
information specified in the Animal Welfare Regulations available for inspection. The facility shall make, keep and
maintain records which fully disclose all the required information concerning animals purchased or otherwise
acquired or disposed of. The record shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or
under his or her control.
Acquisition and disposition records are necessary to be able to accurately track animals being used in regulated
activities to ensure their legal acquisition, proper care, and humane transportation.
Correct from this day forward.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
