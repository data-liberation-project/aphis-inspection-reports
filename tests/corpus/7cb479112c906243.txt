ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female Boston terrier (m/c# 003 271-001) had an area of thinning hair about 6 inches in diameter located
on her right side and abdomen behind her elbow. The skin in this area was reddened and had numerous tiny
scabs. The licensee had noticed the problem but the dog was not receiving treatment and the licensee had not
consulted a veterinarian about the problem. Skin problems can be painful, can progress, and can be the result of
an underlying medical condition. The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian for diagnoisis and
treatment. The licensee must present written documentation of the treatment upon the inspector's request.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Six of the 14 dogs listed on the Dogs on Hand (APHIS form 7005) did not have identification numbers on the
paperwork. Properly completed acquisition records are necessary for identification of dogs to facilitate
record-keeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare. The licensee must update this
Record of Acquisition and maintain the record on a regular basis so that it always has accurate information
regarding acquisition, identification, and disposition for all dogs.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(e) Storage.
Open bags of dog food were laying on the floors of both buildings that housed dogs. Improperly stored dog food
can become contaminated by pests and can spoil. The licensee must ensure that all open supplies of dog food are
stored in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.

3.3(e)(1)(3)SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
(e) Surfaces.
One enclosure housing an adult Boston terrier had been chewed all the way around the dog door on the outside
portion of the enclosure. A large amount of wooden subsurface was exposed and was not impervious to moisture.
Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture can not be cleaned and sanitized properly. The licensee must repair
or replace this area so that it can be properly cleaned and sanitized.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A wire enclosure housing unweaned Boston terrier puppies had a hole in a wall panel that was 2 inches high and 7
inches wide. The puppies were observed putting paws through the opening and attempting to push their heads
through. This could lead to entrapment and injury of the puppies. The licensee must ensure that primary
enclosures are constructed and maintained so that they protect the dogs from injury.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(c) Housekeeping for premises.
Weeds and grass were growing on all sides of the whelping building up to the level of the bottom row of enclosures
which housed adult dogs and puppies. Excessive weeds and grass provide hiding and breeding places for pests
such as insects, rodents, and snakes. The licensee must establish an effective program to control weeds and
grasses.
