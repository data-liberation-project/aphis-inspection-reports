3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is an area of perimeter fence, approximately 7' in length, which measures 5'8" in height around the two
bobcat enclosures. The perimeter fence has been constructed this way for several years and the ground has
settled causing the perimeter fence to sink. The licensee expressed interest in rebuilding this entire area. The
enclosure containing the bobcats is fully enclosed with a top. Perimeter fencing must be constructed so that it
protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility, and high enough to act as a second containment area for the
enclosed animals. The licensee must ensure that all areas of perimeter fencing are at least 6 feet in height for the
bobcat area or have the fencing and height approved through the Administrator.
