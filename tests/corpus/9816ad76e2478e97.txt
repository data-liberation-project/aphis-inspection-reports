2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In one of the outdoor enclosures there were 2 Beagles. One was observed to be licking the right hind foot of the
other dog. Upon closer observation, that dog (JB's Joy III, m/c 105-888-606) had a very long and curled toenail on
the dewclaw. The pad was reddened, swollen and sensitive to pressure. The toenail was pressing on the skin,
causing a dent in the skin, but not yet piercing through. The nail can continue to grow and cause injury to the skin,
and become more painful. The dog must be evaluated by a veterinarian and the treatment directions must be
followed. Documentation of the evaluation and treatment must be available to APHIS officials.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Twenty-two of the 73 adult dogs do not have any identification numbers. Most of the dogs have a microchip. The
dogs without microchips have no collar and tag, tattoo or other method to identify them. Identification is necessary
to know the dogs with certainty, to provide medication to the proper dog and to identify them in transfers of
ownership and transportation. The dogs must all be identified.

3.6(c)(1)(3) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
(iii) The interior height of a primary enclosure
***The top of the outdoor part of the shelter building has a sloped roof line that measures 29" on the end attached to
the building and 15" on the short end. The 3 (2 adult Beagles and 1 Terrier type dog) dogs in the enclosures did not
have the 6" space from their heads to the top of the enclosure throughout the entire outdoor part of the enclosure.
At the rear part of the outside part, the decreasing slope of the roof causes the dogs to lay down in the last 12"-15"
of the enclosure. In another separate raised enclosure was an adult dog that had only 4" from the top of the head to the ceiling of the
enclosure. When the height of an enclosure is insufficient, the dogs are inhibited in their natural body movements.
The owner must ensure that all dogs are provided with the required size and height of enclosure so the dogs are
allowed to posture normally.
An exit interview was done with a facility representative and more discussion was done when the report was
delivered.
