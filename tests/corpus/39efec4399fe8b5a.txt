Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
On March 3, 2022 at 10:30 am, the licensee refused to allow the APHIS inspector to complete an animal welfare
inspection. The licensee stated that he was too busy with his job (located on same property as the licensed facility) to
leave and complete an inspection and his wife was not available because they had company. He said he was working on
selling the rest of his herd and canceling his license. When asked if he was refusing inspection and told he would be cited
for a refusal if he did not allow an inspection, he said that will work.
Failure to allow for unannounced animal welfare inspections makes it impossible for APHIS to determine if the facility is in
compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and its regulations.
Correct this by allowing APHIS officials access to the facility for all future unannounced inspections.
