Personnel qualifications.
In November 2021 one pig on an IACUC approved protocol was under treatment by the veterinary staff for a condition
related to a study procedure. Laboratory staff were instructed to continue the treatment over the weekend, but the
treatment was not done due to illness of the designated laboratory staff member. The laboratory staff member did not
contact the veterinarian until Monday morning to report that the treatment was not done because he/she did not realize an
on-call veterinarian was available over the weekend. Veterinary staff then reviewed the records for animals used under
this protocol and identified additional instances where laboratory staff did not follow the post-procedural monitoring
described in the IACUC approved protocol (4 animals) and one other instance where the veterinary staff’s directives to
laboratory staff were not followed. The animals recovered uneventfully.

Per this Section, it shall be the responsibility of a research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians,
animal technicians, and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties.
This requirement ensures that laboratory staff follow the IACUC approved protocols and that research animals receive
proper care.



In response to this incident, the IACUC and veterinary staff conducted an investigation and implemented corrective
measures to prevent recurrence including but not limited to providing supplemental refresher training to the laboratory
staff on post-procedure monitoring, documentation, and compliance with veterinary staff directions. There have not been
any additional incidents. Corrected prior to the inspection.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted 3/7/22 with facility representatives.
