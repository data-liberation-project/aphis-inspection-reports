2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There is no record of the animals that are currently being housed and held for breeding purposes (animal inventory).
Likewise, there has been no record kept of offspring born to those animals, which were subsequently either kept for
continued breeding or sold at retail. Without this information, it is difficult to verify that the animals were obtained
appropriately by the dealer, and that all of the offspring born were sold through appropriate methods. Dealers shall
keep and maintain records disclosing the name and address of the person from whom the animals were acquired,
the date of acquisition, the number and species in the shipment, and include all offspring born while in the dealer's
possession.
Sales records were complete as required by this section of the regulations.
Correct by making and maintaining records of animals on hand that are purchased, acquired, or otherwise held by
the dealer, including all offspring born to those animals while in the dealer's possession.
Correct from this time forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
