2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On October 10, 2021 a 2-year-old, female red fox “Gumi” was able to escape its primary enclosure and has not been
seen or captured at this time. The facility representatives stated that an animal caretaker entered the enclosure to care for
the animal but failed to latch/lock the door behind them resulting in the escape. The facility’s staff was immediately
notified at the time and attempted to capture the animal; however, it is believed the animal likely escaped the facility
grounds.
Improper handling practices (i.e., not closing or securing the door during care of the animal) led to the escape of the fox.
An animal escape from the safety of its enclosure can cause severe distress, trauma and/or physical harm to the animal
especially in unfamiliar or potentially hazardous surroundings. Handling of all animals must be done as carefully as
possible and in a manner that cannot lead to an animal escape which can cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical
harm, or unnecessary discomfort for the animal.

To be corrected from this day forward by handling animals in a manner that ensures their health and safety.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
