HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The welded wire fencing on one enclosure divider have become detached, exposing bent and broken wires. One
dog is in contact with the affected wiring located in outdoor housing. The ability to contain the dogs securely is
greatly affected and could lead to potential injury, if the enclosure fencing is not kept in good repair. The licensee
must ensure all enclosure fencing is kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury, contain the dog securely
and restrict other animals from entering. Correct by 4/5/18.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
* The facility has no current effective pest prevention program in place. Bird droppings were observed
accumulating on top of the storage shelving and one plastic food storage unit. The affected areas are located on
the east side of the outdoor barn housing nine dogs. No means to control or eliminate the birds were viewed during
the inspection. Lack of an effective program that controls birds can create unsanitary conditions and lead to
potential health risks. Bird feces may contain pathogens that could adversely impact animal health. The licensee
must establish an effective program for the control of birds and mammals that are pests, must be established and
maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in the
animal areas. The licensee must have an effective program for the control of insects, external parasites affecting
dogs and cats, birds and mammals that are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health
and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. Correct by 4/5/18.
* Facility inspection and verbal exit briefing done on 3/22/18 were conducted with the licensee.
* Copy of the inspection report was sent by electronic mail.
