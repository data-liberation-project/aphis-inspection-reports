2.126(a) Critical

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
***Unable to review records as they are currently held electronically and the computer is not operable. The licensee has
stated that he does not have hard copies of the records.

***Unable to inspect reindeer enclosure. The reindeer currently have access to the main pen as well as the back pen.
When asked about entering the pen the licensee stated that we could not enter because the reindeer are in velvet. The
food and water bowls are located inside the enclosure and cannot be accessed to feed and water without entering the
pen. USDA inquired as to how the reindeer are currently being fed and watered without being able to access the
enclosure. The licensee stated he is able to access the pen and care for the reindeer but USDA could not. USDA then
inquired if the licensee could lock the reindeer in the back pen to allow inspection of the main pen but the licensee said
not right now.

Each exhibitor shall, during business hours, allow APHIS officials to enter its place of business; to examine records
required to be kept by the Act and the regulations in this part, to make copies of the records, to inspect and photograph
the facilities, property and animals, as the APHIS officials consider necessary to enforce the provisions of the Act, the


regulations and the standards in this subchapter; and to document, by the taking of photographs and other means,
conditions and areas of noncompliance to ensure the health and wellbeing of the animals housed at the facility.

To be corrected by July 15, 2022.

Facilities, general.
***The large tree that fell on the fence along the right side of the back enclosure was cited on previous inspections is can
be seen still laying on the fence compromising the structural soundness causing the top line of the fence to bend down
and outward, and the lower wire to bend inward into the enclosure leaving areas that may allow the reindeer to become
hung up in the fence. The fence is in disrepair and shall be repaired or replaced to protect the reindeer from injury and to
maintain them securely within the enclosure.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Licensee.
