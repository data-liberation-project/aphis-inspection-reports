A female Lhasa Apso, ID #0754, was observed with her left eye partially crusted closed. Upon closer observation
there was a moist appearing yellowish discharge and some light brown colored dried material entangled in the hair
around the eye. This could be a sign of an injury, infection or another veterinary care issue and could be painful.
The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a veterinarian for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment plan. The
licensee must present the documentation of the veterinary examination to the inspectors upon request. The
licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
This is a repeat non compliant item.
