ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:13 pm on
22-SEP-16.
Arrived at 1:13 pm. The front door to the house was open. Knocked on the door and rang the door bell. No one
came to the door. I called Dawn and she answered and stated she heard at the stakeholders meeting that she could
select days and times that were good for her. I told her we had put optimal hours in the system for her and she had
indicated that this day and time were optimal. She stated that she had 4 afternoon appointments and today was not
good. We then discussed what she would like as her optimal days.
