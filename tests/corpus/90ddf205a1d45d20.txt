INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the(cid:29) "hospital room,"(cid:29) there are two enclosures with floors that are worn and no longer impervious to moisture.
The floors have a plastic coating that is worn in several areas and along the edges and corners. Water was
observed dripping from a water bottle onto the surface and soaking in. These affect two cats and five kittens.
Another enclosure has a raised resting surface in which the edges are peeling away and exposing surfaces that are
not impervious to moisture. This affects one cat. Surfaces that are in contact with the cats must be maintained at
all times to ensure they can be properly cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces that are worn, peeling and exposing
surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized. Licensee must repair or
replace these surfaces. To be corrected by: April 16, 2014.
An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
