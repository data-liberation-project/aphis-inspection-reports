3.6(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
Throughout the facility there were broken wires causing sharp points. The facility, had multiple areas along the enclosure
fencing, and divider panels, with broken wires and/or loose wires causing sharp points. Also the wind/rain breaks on the
large dog shelters had sheet metal that was loose causing sharp edges. These sharp points and edges affected
approximately 24 dogs. Most of these sharp points were wires used for fastening or were broken wires that had sharp
ends which were protruding into the enclosures at the dogs' level. The sharp points can injure the dogs. The licensee
must ensure that all enclosures have no sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs.
