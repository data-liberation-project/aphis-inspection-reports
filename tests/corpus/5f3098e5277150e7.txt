Primary enclosures.
The wire mesh at the top front section for the two nonhuman primates named "Salt" and "Pepper" had excessive rust and
breakage. This is not longer structurally sound and animals could injure themselves on the sharp points that are now
exposed. Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound
for the species of nonhuman primates contained in them. They must be kept in good repair. This area needs to be
repaired or replaced.
