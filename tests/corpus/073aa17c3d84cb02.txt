2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A current/updated written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available for USDA review during the
inspection of the site and twenty-one (21) puppies. In order to comply with this section of the Animal Welfare Act
(AWA) a written PVC must be in place and available for inspection at all times. Under formal arrangements, as
directed by the AWA, the licensee must have an updated PVC by the current Attending Veterinarian (AV). Also, the
licensee must ensure the AV conducts regularly scheduled visits to the premises (all three approved sites under the
licensee's certificate) where regulated animals are kept. To ensure adequate veterinary medical care to regulated
animals, a current/updated PVC must be readily available for inspection, and at a minimum of once per year, the AV
must visit the premises of all three sites under the licensee's certificate.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records for animals at hand for twenty-one (21) puppies containing required information on acquisition, disposition,
or transportation were not available for USDA review at the time of the inspection. Required records for all
transactions of regulated animals must be available for inspection at all times and at all three sites under the
licensee's certificate. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly
disclose information on animals purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or leased. Also, records are
required when animals are transported, sold, euthanized, or otherwise disposed. The records shall include any
offspring born of any animal at the premises of any of the licensee's three approved sites. The Record of Animals
on Hand (APHIS Form 7019) and Record of Acquisition, Disposition, or Transport of Animals (APHIS Form 7020)
are forms which may be used by the facility to keep and maintain the information required by federal regulations.
The licensee needs to obtain/document the required information so that it is ready for USDA inspection; recent
acquisition and disposition transactions records of all regulated animals/puppies (since the last USDA inspection of
this site).
