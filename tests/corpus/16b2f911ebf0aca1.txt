3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The floor inside the mobile home where the smaller dog kennels are kept was extremely dirty. It appears the dogs
are allowed to run around loose in the trailer occasionally. Some areas had dog feces that had been trampled flat.
The walls were also dirty. The dog kennels themselves were clean. Hard surfaces with which the dogs come in
contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or more often if necessary.
All surfaces in the trailer that the dogs have contact with must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, and excreta which can contribute to illness and disease in the
animals.

removed from primary enclosures daily. Primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.
All dog enclosures must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent an accumulation of
dirt, debris, food waste, and excreta which can contribute to illness and disease in the animals.
