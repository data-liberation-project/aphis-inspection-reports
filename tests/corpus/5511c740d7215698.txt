INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
IACUC review of activities involving animals.
The IACUC approved protocol #KDL-S14-01 involving gonadectomy of 2 hamsters. The principle investigator did
not provide a written narrative for the methods and sources for considering alternatives to this procedure. Failing to
search for and consider alternatives to procedures that cause more than momentary or slight pain and distress to
animals does not ensure that procedures involving animals will avoid or minimize discomfort, distress and pain to
the animals. Ensure that all protocols presented to the IACUC for review where more than momentary or slight pain
and distress to animals occurs include the materials and sources for considering alternatives to these procedures.
Correct from this time forward.
2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A proposal to conduct an activity involving animals... must contain.
The IACUC approved protocol #KDL-S14-01 involving gonadectomy of 2 hamsters. The principle investigator did
not describe the gonadectomy procedure within the protocol submitted to the IACUC. Failing to provide a complete
description of the the proposed use of the animals does not allow for adequate oversight by the IACUC to ensure
that procedures involving animals will avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the animals. Ensure that all
protocols presented to the IACUC for review include a complete description of the the proposed use of the animals.
Correct from this time forward.
