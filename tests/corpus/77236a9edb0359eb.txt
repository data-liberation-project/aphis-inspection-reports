MISCELLANEOUS.
Section 2.38(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: Each research facility shall, during business
hours, allow APHIS officials: (1) To enter its place of business.
A facility representative was not available to allow access at 1300 on 04/12/2016.
After arriving at the facility, I called the contact number and spoke to the facility representative regarding access and
optimal hours for inspection for this site. I left a business card on the gate with the attempted time of inspection and
proceeded to inspect the other sites.
