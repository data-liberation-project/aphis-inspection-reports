PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
***On March 4th, 2013, a student employee was bit on the hand by a nonhuman primate while moving the animal.
This employee was handling the nonhuman primate after having received only one of their six required weeks of
training. This employee also used a nonhuman primate that was noted to be visibly agitated prior to being moved
even though the protocol states that animals that appear agitated will not be used until the following day. The
corrective actions included, but were not limited to, providing the employee with all six weeks of their required
training and retraining the Principal Investigator and the staff on protocol adherence. Allowing personnel who are
not adequately trained or do not have sufficient instruction to perform their duties resulted in a human injury and
was distressful for the nonhuman primate. It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all personnel
involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties.
The IACUC implemented appropriate corrective actions and no similar adverse events have occurred.
***From August 2011 to December 2011, there were four instances of nonhuman primates escaping from their
enclosures. During two of these escapes, the animals incurred injuries that required pain medications to be
administered. The facility determined that a single employee was responsible for the escapes and the employee
was retrained and reassigned. Allowing personnel who are not adequately trained or do not have sufficient
instruction to perform their duties resulted in pain and distress to the escaped nonhuman primates. It is the
responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are
qualified to perform their duties.

The IACUC implemented appropriate corrective actions and no further nonhuman primate escapes have occurred.
These items have been appropriately addressed by the facility.The facility inspection and record review were conducted from 13 May 2014 through 16 May 2014.
The exit interview was conducted with the IACUC Chair, Attending Veterinarian, Regulatory Specialist, Compliance
Specialist, and Compliance Officer.
