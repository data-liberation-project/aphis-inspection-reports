FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the enclosure for the pigs, sheep, and goats, there are screw points protruding from the ceiling support boards for
the shelter. In the same enclosure a peacock pen was built and there are some sharp unfinished wire ends where
the metal fence was cut, and some loose wire ends on some extra fencing pieces.
In the pasture where the cow is housed, the fence at the front is in disrepair with rusted broken wires at the bottom
in several areas and two holes at the bottom where the cow could stick its head. There is an electric wire which is
a secondary containment.
All structures need to be repaired and maintained to prevent potential injury to the animals.
To be corrected by 11-11-14.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
