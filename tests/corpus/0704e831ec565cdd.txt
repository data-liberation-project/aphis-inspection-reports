2.126(b)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:45 pm on 12-2-20.

I honked the vehicle horn, called the licensee's cell phone and a left message in attempts to contact the licensee. There
was no response. I waited at the facility for 30 minutes and left.

A responsible adult shall be available for inspection during business hours.
