3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The back wall is rusty on the two upper enclosures housing 25 and 15 guinea pigs each. Primary enclosures must
be constructed of smooth material that is substantially impervious to liquids and moisture. Enclosures with rusty
surfaces that are no longer impervious to moisture can prevent proper cleaning and sanitation. Inadequate cleaning
and sanitation can result in disease risks to the guinea pigs. These two enclosures must be resealed, repaired, or
replaced s that wall surfaces are impervious to liquids and moisture. Correct by February 15, 2020.
