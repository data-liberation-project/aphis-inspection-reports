FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Three enclosures, each housing 12 breeding animals were noted to have metal feeders that were rusted on one
side of the hopper to the point that they presented a sharp edge. These feeders need to be repaired or replaced
since the edge could cause injury to the animals. No injuries were noted at the time of inspection. Correct by
ensuring that facilities for guinea pigs are structurally sound and maintained in good repair, to protect the animals
from injury. To be corrected by 7 March 2016
An exit interview was conducted with the facility owner.
