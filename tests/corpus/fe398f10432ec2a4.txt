ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1230 on
01-NOV-16.
Called licensee and left a message when I arrived at the facility, knocked on the window to the room she indicated
was hers. Waited half an hour and left when the licensee was not at the facility. Received a call back from the
licensee 2 days later, indicating she was not at home.
Exit interview conducted with licensee by phone.
