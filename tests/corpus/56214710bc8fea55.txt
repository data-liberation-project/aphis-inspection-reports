Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A fawn male chihuahua, named Prince with microchip # 7E10131672, approximately six years old was found with poor
dental health. The licensee noted that she had not noticed his condition. On his right side most of his teeth were about a
quarter to halfway covered with a light to dark brown hard substance. The gums on this side were red and swollen. The
upper tooth behind his canine tooth had some gum recession with a small amount of root exposure. This tooth was loose
and painful to the touch. Anytime that tooth was touched Prince would shy his head away from the inspector. On his left
side the front top and bottom teeth were half to three quarters covered with a brown to dark brown hard substance, while
the back top and bottom teeth were completely covered in a dark brown material. The licensee called and made an
appointment with her attending veterinary for this dog before we continued with the inspection. Poor dental health can
cause pain and discomfort to the animal as well as lead to further health issues. This dog must be evaluated by a
licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. Each dealer must follow an
appropriate program of veterinary care for dogs that includes preventative care and treatment to ensure healthy teeth for
all dogs.
