3.80(a)(2)(ix)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The paint on the wall of the outdoor portion of the Capuchin enclosure is worn off in places leaving exposed
concrete with some cracks and rough surfaces. These surfaces in this condition cannot be effectively cleaned and
sanitized and therefore can play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces in
contact with nonhuman primates are able to be readily cleaned and sanitized in accordance with Sec. 3.84(b)(3) of
this subpart, or replaced when worn or soiled. To be corrected by 1 Nov 2017.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The sliding metal shift door in the bobcat enclosure is rusted and deteriorating to the point that fragments of material
from the door are flaking off and collecting on the enclosure floor. This shows that the structure is not being
maintained in good repair and suggests that the structural strength of the door or frame may be compromised. The
licensee must ensure that the facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for
the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained
in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. To be corrected by 1 Nov 2017.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A hole has been dug under the perimeter fence next to the walkway down to the ravine area. The hole appears to
be a path used by an animal to enter the facility under then fence. Gaps in the perimeter fence may not restrict
animals and unauthorized persons from entering the facility. The perimeter fence must be constructed so that it
protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it
and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility. To be corrected by 15 September 2017.
