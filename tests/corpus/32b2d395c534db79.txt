3.1(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the travel trailer that houses the dogs’ crates, there is an approximately 1ft by 1ft jagged hole where the AC unit
was torn away. The licensee states the AC unit was removed by the dogs this past weekend. During inspection,
they had free access to the exposed jagged metal edges and were seen poking their heads through the hole.
Licensees must maintain housing facilities so that they are structurally sound, protect the animals from injury and
restrict other animals from entering. The exposed metal edges may cause serious injury to the dogs, and the hole in
the trailer wall allows access to unwanted animals.

the bottom where the fence wire allows for animals to pass through. The edges of the fence wire are exposed
towards the inside of the pasture.
Licensees must maintain housing facilities so that they are structurally sound, protect the animals from injury and
restrict other animals from entering. Exposed fence wiring may cause the animals injury and allow unimpeded
access to unwanted animals.
