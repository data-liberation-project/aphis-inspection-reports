*** 36 animals were found in need of veterinary care during the inspection. This included:
~ Animal 1: One female gray and white Syrian Hamster was housed with her litter (containing 5 live pups) in the
trailer, fifth rack, row 3, box 5. This female hamster was thin and lethargic and in addition to the live pups one
freshly dead partially cannibalized hamster pup was also present in the enclosure. When examined, this hamster
had a large amount of soft wet brown debris around her tail consistent with diarrhea.
~ Animal 2: One gray and white Syrian Hamster was housed in a group enclosure in the trailer, first rack, row 2,
box 3. This animal had a right eye that was sunken, crusted with brown debris and was held partially shut when
identified by the inspector.
~ Animal 3: One dark gray Syrian Hamster with white feet was housed in a group enclosure in the trailer, first
rack, row 6, box 7. This animal had a patch of hair loss on its back and nose. The area of hair loss on the back
was approximately 1cm in diameter and the underlying skin appeared normal. The area on the nose was smaller
and underlying skin appeared crusty. When identified by the inspector, the licensee stated that the hair loss on the
nose was just from pushing against the feeder and on the back was likely scars from fighting previously.
~ Animal 4: One female grey and white Syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 5 live pups) in
Room #17, rack #1, row #2, box #3. This hamster had a wet area with brown discoloration on the underside of the
tail and chin consistent with diarrhea and grooming of the area. In addition to the live animals, there were also two
dead hamster pups in this enclosure. One of these was fresh and partially cannibalized. The second was older and
consisted only of dried fur and skin.
~ Animal 5: One male tan long-haired Syrian hamster was housed with a single other adult hamster in Room
#17, rack #3, row #3, box #19. This hamster had incomplete hair loss / thinning over the hind end of the body. The
underlying skin was dry and had numerous scabs. The facility representative stated that this was likely bites from
the other hamster and separated them when identified by APHIS Officials.
~ Animals 6-15: One brown female Syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 9 live pups) in Room
#17, rack #3, row #1, box #5. The adult hamster had a moderate amount of wet brown debris under the tail
consistent with diarrhea. The hamster pups were all wet over the fur on the backs and had varying degrees ofdiarrhea on their hind end. In addition to the live animals there was also 1 dead pup in this enclosure.
~ Animals 16-22: Seven juvenile Gerbils were housed in room 5 of the 'Main Building' in rack #16, row #4, box
#7. This included 3 brown, 1 white, 2 black, and 1 tan all of which had areas of dark red-brown scabs over their
back and/tails. The most severely affected was the white gerbil which had scabs extending from the back of the
neck down the back to the base of the tail as well as hair loss in those areas. The licensee stated that there
appeared to be some aggression in this enclosure and removed the one animal that had the least amount of scabs,
presumed to be the aggressor and separated the enclosure for observation.
~ Animal 23: One black Russian dwarf hamster was housed with 7 other hamsters in box 5 of the hallway near
room 5 of the main building. This hamster had a large area of hair loss covering 1/4 to 1/3 of its head between the
eyes and ears. The skin underlying this area of hair loss had three large scabs present.
~ Animal 24: A white chinchilla was observed with hair loss on the sides of both ears. There was also some
scabbing in this area. This can be an indication that there is a medical issue. This animal had not yet received
veterinary attention. Measures need to be taken to provide appropriate veterinary care in a timely manner in order
to prevent the animal unnecessary pain and distress.
~ Animal 25: A black chinchilla was observed to have hair loss on its neck area. This hair loss extended full circle
around the entire neck. Hair loss can be a sign of a more serious health issue. This animal had not yet received
veterinary attention for this condition.
~ Animal 26: A grey chinchilla was observed with an abnormal reddening area around its eyes with areas of hair
loss. There was crusty discharge on both eyes and nose, and a cloudy discharge on the left eye. The eyes were
sunken in and the chinchilla was huddled in the enclosure and appeared depressed and lethargic. These signs are
indicators of a negative health issue and suggestive of systemic disease and animal discomfort. The animal had not
yet received veterinary care for this issue.
~ Animal 27: A white chinchilla was observed with hair loss between its ears on the back of its neck. The skin
underneath was bright pink in color. Hair loss can be a sign of a more serious health issue. This animal had not yet
received veterinary attention for this condition.
~ Animal 28: A black chinchilla was observed with a cloudy "hazy" appearance in both eyes. This condition
affected the center of the eye in the middle of the cornea. There was a discharge noted in the left eye. This could
be an indication of a serious underlying medical issue and can cause distress to the animal. The chinchilla had not
received vet care for this condition.
~ Animal 29: A black chinchilla was observed squinting with a discharge from both eyes. The animal was not
opening the eye fully, which may be an indication of discomfort or pain. The animal remained huddled in the corner
of the enclosure and seemed reluctant to move around compared to the normal movements of the healthy
chinchillas. The chest area was wet and had a crusty appearance. The chinchilla had not received vet care for this
condition.
~ Animal 30: A white chinchilla was observed with a discharge from both eyes. This can be an indication of a
more serious illness affecting the animal, and could possibly cause distress to the animal. The chinchilla had not yet
received veterinary care for this issue.
~ Animal 31: In the Hut on the top row bin 1 a black and white guinea pig was observed with a crusty discharge
from the left eye. The animal was not opening the eye fully, which may be an indication of discomfort. The guineapig had not received veterinary care for this issue.
~ Animal 32: One light sable juvenile ferret housed in the Ferret / Rabbit room had a right eye that was partially
closed and had an accumulation of light brown crusty debris present.
~ Animal 33: One tricolor Abyssinian-type guinea pig was present in the "Hut" building on the male rack, row #5,
tub #3 (co-housed with 13 other guinea pigs). This guinea pig had a small circular area of hair loss just above the
nose with a small central scab. The surrounding skin was dry and crusty.
~ Animal 34: One light tricolor rough coated "teddy-bear" type guinea pig was present in the "Hut" building on the
male rack, row #5, tub #3 (co-housed with 14 other guinea pigs). This guinea pig had a right eye that was being
held partially closed and had brown crusty debris on the upper and lower lid accumulating in the corner of the eye
closest to the nose.
~ Animal 35: One white Abyssinian-type guinea pig with a brown patch near the eye was present in the "Hut"
building on the male rack, row #2, tub #8 (co-housed with 14 other guinea pigs). This guinea pig had a left eye that
was being held partially closed. There was a small amount of crusty debris accumulated along the lower lid and at
the corner nearest the eye.
~ Animal 36: One grey agouti with white guinea pig with a single rosette on the head (Crested / American-type)
was present in the "Hut" building of the male rack, row #4, box #8 (co-housed with 9 other guinea pigs). This
guinea pig had a left eye that was completely sealed shut with brown crusty debris. When examined the eye could
not be opened with gentle wiping.
The facility maintains an area within each room for animals requiring additional care, however, none of the animals
listed above were identified by facility staff prior to inspection. All of these animals / enclosures were mixed with the
general population of animals in their respective rooms. The clinical signs of hair loss, eye abnormalities, loose
stool / diarrhea, and general lethargy / depression are all indicators of ill-health or disease. These conditions can
result from multiple causes including traumatic injury and infectious diseases, or other causes. Depending on the
underlying cause, left untreated these conditions may progress leading additional unnecessary animal suffering.
Animals exhibiting advanced signs of disease such as generalized lethargy, depression, and weight loss are also at
an increased risk of death when left untreated and several dead animals were found in the above enclosures.
Additionally, pre-weaning juvenile animals whose mothers' have died are at significant risk of suffering and or death
if appropriate steps are not taken to properly diagnose the cause of death, provide appropriate treatment and
supportive care, or humanely euthanize individuals if they are not old enough to self-feed and survive on their own.
All licensees are required to implement appropriate methods for adequate veterinary care including the use of
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat disease for all animals. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of
these animals is necessary to ensure humane care. Correct by reporting these animals to the attending
veterinarian and having them examined by a licensed veterinarian for diagnosis and the development of an
appropriate treatment plan for each animal condition. Documentation of this examination, the treatment plan,
implementation of the treatments, and recommendations for prevention / control of disease spread to the remaining
animals shall be maintained by the licensee for examination by APHIS Officials upon request.
To be completed by: 8 January 2016Note: Facility representatives brought several animals to the attending veterinarian as they were identified during
inspection. The animals received immediate appropriate attention. Documentation of examination by the attending
veterinarian and the treatment recommendations was provided to APHIS Officials for many of the most severely
affected animals during the inspection and prior to the exit interview.
*** In addition to the animals requiring veterinary care for physical ailments listed above, one Roborovski dwarf
hamster exhibiting an abnormal repetitive (stereotypic) behavior was identified by inspectors. This tan hamster was
cohoused with 7 other Roborovski dwarf hamsters in box 3 of the hallway near room 5 of the main building and was
observed for several minutes during which time it consistently jumped in "back flip" motion. The animal would
backflip, run several paces forward into the same starting position and then back flip again, repeating this process
greater than 20 times in a row with little to no deviation to the behavior. The animal continued this behavior even
when other animals in the enclosure walked in its path only making minor alterations as were necessary to continue
the behavior. APHIS Officials were able to disrupt the behavior by talking or moving the enclosure at which time the
animal burrowed and/or ate a few bites of food, only to return to the stereotypic behavior shortly after. APHIS
Officials returned to this area to observe the animal again approximately 30 minutes later at which time the animal
was still preforming this abnormal behavior. The facility representative stated that this had not been observed by
the facility previously and no steps had been taken to identify or address the cause. Abnormal repetitive behaviors
often called stereotypies are a behavioral indicator of stress and can be detrimental to the animal. All licensees are
required to use appropriate methods to prevent control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries including this type
of behavioral disease. Correct by having this animal examined by the attending veterinarian so that appropriate
methods for diagnosis, treatment, and continued monitoring can be taken to identify and correct the cause of the
behavior. A record of this examination, treatment recommendations, and implementation of the treatment plan shall
be maintained by the facility for review by APHIS Officials upon request.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
16 dead animals were identified by APHIS Officials during the inspection. These animals were often present in
enclosures which contained additional live animals and the deceased were in various states of decomposition.
~ Animals 1-6: One female gray and white Syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 5 deceased
pups) in Room #17, rack #1, row 1, box 1. This female hamster and her pups were all dead and there was a strong
odor of decomposition in this enclosure and nearby. The adult hamster was bloated and there were portions of the
skull exposed. The pups were all furred, but younger than weaning age. ~ Animal 7: One female gray and white Syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 6 live pups) in
Room #17, rack #1, row 1, box 2. In addition to these animals, there were three clumps of fur and skin consistent
with a deceased cannibalized pre-weaning pup. This may have come from one animal or multiple. The adult
female hamster and remaining pups were all alert and active.
~ Animal 8: One female brown Syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 7 live pups) in Room #17,
rack #2, row #1, box #2. The adult hamster in this enclosure was dead but remained intact and had no obvious
outward signs of the cause of death.
~ Animal 9: One female brown and white Syrian hamster was housed singly in Room #17, rack #3, row #4, box
#2. This hamster was dead and there was a large amount of dried dark brown material caked around her rectum.
This material appeared consistent with diarrhea.
~ Animal 10: Three juvenile gerbils were housed in room 5 of the "Main Building" in rack #15, row #7, box #7. In
addition to the live animals one dead tan gerbil was present in this enclosure. On examination this animal had an
accumulation of brown debris under the tail consistent with diarrhea.
~ Animal 11: One tan female Syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 5 live pups of pre-weaning
age) in Room #17, rack #4, row #1, box #6. The adult hamster in this enclosure was dead and had a significant
accumulation of brown debris under the tail consistent with diarrhea. Additionally there were 3 dead pups in this
enclosure. This included 2 pups that were relatively fresh and one that was only fur and dried skin.
~ Animal 12: One dead hamster observed in the enclosure in room 17, line #9 row 1 rack 4 top #2. This pre
weanling pup was housed with the female hamster and the remaining pups (6 total). The dead pup remained intact
and had no obvious outward signs of the cause of death. The remaining animal housed in the enclosure did not
exhibit any obvious signs of illness, and were alert and active.
~ Animal 13: One Syrian hamster was housed with her offspring in room 17, line #9 rack 1, row 7 bin 2. This
adult female was found dead was housed in the enclosure, the remaining pre-weaning offspring were still alive.
There was a wound observed encompassing the entire top portion of the head, where the offspring had
cannibalized the carcass. The remaining hamsters in the enclosure were of normal appearance with no signs of
illness.
~ Animal 14: One female tan Syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 6 live pups) in Room #17.
The female was observed dead with the left hind leg having decomposed and or cannibalized. The skin was
removed and the underlying bones were exposed. The remaining pups were all alert and active.
~ Animal 15: One female tan Syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 5 live pups) in Room #17,
line 8 row 7 bin 2. In addition to these animals, there was one clump of fur and skin consistent with a deceased
cannibalized pre-weaning pup. This may have come from one animal or multiple. The adult female hamster and
remaining pups were all alert and active.
~ Animal 16: One female tan Syrian hamster was housed with her litter (containing 8 live pups) in Room #17,
line #7 rack 4 row 7 bin 4. In addition to these animals, there was one deceased cannibalized pre-weaning pup.
The adult female hamster and remaining pups were all alert and active.


All licensees are required to conduct daily observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being. Thefacility representative stated that employees conduct observations while providing feed and water on a daily basis
as well as when changing cages as needed. Observation "Loss" logs were present in every room, however, these
were inconsistently filled out by the facility personnel. When these logs were completed, there was no method in
place to determine whether the abnormalities were reported to the attending veterinarian or the outcome of the
condition (treatment, improvement, euthanasia, etc). The presence of 16 deceased animals listed above in various
states of decomposition, as well as the 36 animals found in need of veterinary care indicate that these observations
are not being conducted in an effective manner at this time. Correct by modifying husbandry procedures as
necessary to ensure that animals are observed effectively on a daily basis. Additionally, the licensee shall ensure
that when such problems are identified accurate information shall be reported to the attending veterinarian in a
timely manner. Records of the changes in procedures and training of employees to conduct more effective
observations shall be maintained for APHIS Officials upon request.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee currently lacks adequate guidance to personnel regarding euthanasia of animals conducted by the
facility. The Methods used for Euthanasia were not adequately described in the Program of veterinary Care stating
only that animals could be euthanized by either the veterinarian or the licensee and by Carbon Dioxide or Sodium
Pentobarbital but not differentiating who was permitted to use which method, for which species, or what staff
training was required. When APHIS officials questioned facility personnel in charge of performing euthanasia and
the methods which they were trained, the reply was that the procedure was " (cid:28)learned on the internet"(cid:29). The
licensee must seek adequate guidance from the Attending Veterinarian (AV) and ensure that all employees are
appropriately trained in these techniques including positive determination of death as directed by the AV before they
are allowed to perform these responsibilities. A complete description of the methods used including a description
of these procedures and designation for which species it is appropriate must be included in the program of
veterinary care. Failure to obtain adequate guidance from the AV regarding this topic may result in deviation from
acceptable practices without the veterinarian(cid:25)s' knowledge and lead to unnecessary animal suffering. Correct by
ensuring that additional guidance as described above is incorporated into the PVC and that records of staff training
in these methods are maintained from this point forward.

2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.A record of animals on hand was not available for review. In addition, the facility does not maintain adequate
records of animals that have been born or euthanized at the facility. Records are required in order to adequately
verify the total number of animals housed at the facility. A system of recordkeeping containing the above required
information must be maintained and available for review.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several escaped animals were observed in multiple buildings throughout the inspection. This included loose
hamsters observed in the trailer, the chinchilla area of the main building, and the hut. Additionally, one escaped
guinea pig was observed in the hut and one escaped chinchilla was observed in the hamster area of the main
building. Injury can occur from falls and exposure to dangerous substances when an animal escapes out of its
enclosure. In addition, there were several hamster enclosures observed with full thickness cracks in the bottoms,
some of which were covered with tape. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are maintained in good
repair and that they properly contain the animals. Additionally ensure worn enclosure must be replaced when
necessary.
To be completed by: 8 February 2016
3.26(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Upon entering the Hamster room 17, a strong ammonia smell was noticeable. This odor was considerable and
began to cause discomfort and burn APHIS officials(cid:25) eyes and noses during the inspection process. This situation
can cause the animals housed in the room unnecessary discomfort. In addition, poor ventilation can contribute to
the spread of disease. Ventilation must be adequate to provide for the health and comfort for the animals. Correct
by ensuring that adequate fresh air is provided and that this area is properly ventilated to minimize drafts, odors,
and moisture condensation.
To be completed by: 8 February 2016
3.29(d)
FEEDING.
When APHIS officials questioned an employee about the sanitation schedule for cleaning of the feeders in thehamster rooms, they were told that the feeders were cleaned only when they were contaminated or when the
hamster is removed from the room at the end of the breeding span. This may be as great as 21 weeks. In
addition, approximately 1 out of every 25 feeders had a buildup of rust observed. This frequency of sanitization is
inadequate and can allow a buildup of dust and debris on the food, which may lead to illness. All licensees must
ensure that food receptacles are kept clean and must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or as often as
necessary to prevent deterioration of food. Correct by ensuring that these receptacles are cleaned and sanitized as
required from this point forward.
To be completed by: 18 January 2016
3.30
WATERING.
At least 15 water bottles observed in the hamster enclosures in Rooms 17, 18 and the Hut, were dirty and
contained floating debris. Three bottles were observed with algae growing inside of them. In addition, several racks
of enclosures were observed with a significant dust buildup on the outside of the bottles. Dirty water can cause the
animals to become ill or have a negative health impact. Correct by ensuring water receptacles are sanitized at a
frequency which prevents the buildup of debris, and at a minimum every two weeks.
To be completed by: 12 January 2016
3.31(a)(4)
SANITATION.
The wash area in the Hut building did not have hot water readily available to clean enclosures, food, and water
receptacles. The facility representative stated that the hot water has been turned off at the heater due to leaking
valves and that it must be turned on at the water heater. APHIS officials observed employees using the wash area,
but when the water temperature in sinks was assessed by touch it was found to be ice cold. Employees appear to
be washing the enclosures with cold water. When the valves were turned on at the hot water heater by
management the water did in fact become hot at the washing station. Cold water is not as effective at removing
excreta, bacteria, or other contaminants and this practice will not result in enclosures being adequately sanitized
which may possibly lead disease transmission and other negative health impact on the animals. Licensees must
ensure that primary enclosures are sanitized using hot water of 180 degrees and soap or detergent as in a
mechanical cage wash, by washing with a detergent solution and then using an appropriate disinfectant, or by
cleaning with live steam. Correct by ensuring repairing that there is a continuous supply of hot water available for
cleaning and disinfection or by using an alternate method as allowed by regulation. To be completed by: 18 January 2016
3.31(a)
SANITATION.
Many of the hamster and guinea pig enclosures had a significant buildup of a tan to white hard mineral type deposit
in the corners which appeared to be urine scale. The facility representative stated that they periodically do an acid
wash to remove this buildup, but this is typically done only annually during the warm months. This accumulation of
debris reduces the cleaning and disinfection efficiency and can possibly have a negative health impact on the
animal. Correct by ensuring that enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to prevent and with
appropriate methods to remove this accumulation of excreta.
To be completed by: 8 February 2016
3.33(b)
CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
A domestic cat was observed sleeping in an open shipping container in the Hut building. This building houses
guinea pigs contained in primary enclosures that are large, open toped bins. The primary enclosures are not
designed in a manner that would exclude this free roaming cat (or other animals) from entering the bins. Cats are a
predatory animal and may injure or cause unnecessary stress to the guinea pigs. In addition, this could negatively
affect the health of the animals contributing to the spread of disease either carried from the outside or from
enclosure to enclosure. When identified by inspectors, the cat was removed from the building and then noticed
walking into the room again from the rear of the building shortly afterwards. When attempting to determine how the
cat was back, inspectors observed that the back door to the Hut building did not close or latch properly. A bleach
bottle was observed holding the door closed, however, this bottle could not be propped in place when employees
left through the back door allowing the cat to regain entry to the room. Guinea pigs must not be housed in the same
primary enclosure as other species. Considering the guinea pigs in this area are housed in open bins and this cat
can freely enter the building, it is clear that there is currently no method in place to prevent other animals from
entering the guinea pig enclosures. Correct by ensuring that other species of animals, especially potential
predators, are not permitted access to animal areas with open topped primary enclosures. Additionally, the facility
must ensure that the door is repaired and closes securely to adequately protect the animals contained in this
building.
Corrected at the time of inspection
3.53(a)(1)PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There were many support beams for the rabbit enclosures which were observed to have a heavy buildup of rust. In
addition, the wire coating for the floors was completely eroded in most areas, exposing the wire underneath. If not
addressed, the degree of rust may lead to these structures becoming structurally unsound, and thus may cause
injury to the animals contained within. Primary enclosures must be maintained in good repair and must be
structurally sound. Correct by repairing or replacing these enclosures.
To be completed by: 8 February 2016
3.56
SANITATION.
There was a buildup of hair, urine scale and debris observed in the majority of the rabbit enclosures. The buildup of
brown urine scale in the corners of these cages was enough that it was off the wire creating a (cid:28)lumpy(cid:29) 3-dimensional
appearance. The facility representative stated that these cages are regularly brought outside the building and
pressure washed and then disinfected using a bleach solution outdoors. This accumulation of urine scale is
significant enough to indicate that the current cleaning and disinfection procedures are either not adequate or not
being done with sufficient frequency to meet the required cleaning requirements. This condition is insanitary and
can harbor bacteria and possibly cause the rabbits to become ill. All enclosures must be kept reasonably free of
excreta, hair and other debris. Additionally, the enclosures must be sanitized at least every 30 days in accordance
with 3.56(b). Correct by ensuring that these enclosures are cleaned and sanitized at a higher frequency or through
alternate methods in order to prevent this condition.
To be completed by: 18 January 2016
3.128(d)
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
All chinchilla at the facility are currently being maintained in primary enclosures which are 16 inches x 18 inches and
approximately 14 inches high. These cages were all one level and had a solid bottom containing pine type
woodchips. Each enclosure contained 1-2 Chinchilla, and two enclosures housing a breeding pair plus one
offspring. When asked about the length of time the animals are held in these enclosures, the facility representative
acknowledged that there is no current method in place for tracking that on an individual basis, but that the primary
caretaker for that room would probably know. While many animals are only housed short-term, approximately 25 -
30 are older breeders that have been present for long times. The facility representative also stated that the caging is
a recent change. Prior to the summer, the breeders (housed long-term) were kept in larger enclosures of an
alternate style, but that these were easier to clean so they were moved to these new enclosures. When the facility
representative was asked about access to dust baths he stated that they do not currently provide dust for theseanimals and that they roll around in the shavings when enclosures are cleaned. He also stated that when they used
to provide dust, however, it makes a large mess. Access to dust baths at least on a periodic basis is a necessary
part of chinchilla husbandry to maintain appropriate fur coat quality. The current enclosures and management
practices do not provide access to any space which allows for this normal behavior as needed for long term
housing. Additionally, chinchilla are active animals that typically require adequate space to jump as part of postural
adjustments. Multiple animals were observed bouncing off of wall sides and the current cage size is not adequate
to provide for normal species-typical social and postural adjustments for long-term housing of these animals.
Animal enclosures must be constructed and maintained to provide sufficient space to allow each animal to make
normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Correct by ensuring that animals are
given access to adequate space for jumping and dust bathing to meet these requirements on a continuous or
periodic basis as dictated by behavior and natural history.
