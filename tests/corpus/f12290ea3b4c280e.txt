ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of the last full facility inspection on 9-28-16 the inspectors observed that a 14 month old tiger known as
Daisy was experiencing balance issues and was slightly unsteady when she walked. The inspectors were shown
records that indicated that she was diagnosed with ottitis externa due to bacteria and ottitis media on 9-26-16.
These records also indicate that she was first treated for this condition on 8-31-16. Daisy had received several
injections of polyflex and dexamethazone prior to our inspection that day. We requested that she receive further
veterinary evaluation as her condition had not resolved. On a focused inspection conducted 9-30-16, the inspector
was informed by the facility CEO that the plan was to give oral antibiotics to Daisy.
Daisy was observed to be extremely ataxic today and stumbled and almost fell down several times while the
inspectors were observing her. Daisy also appeared thinner than at the time of the last full inspection and her hair
coat was dull in appearance. Treatment record showed that Daisy has been administered oral Cephalexin 500 mg
twice per day on three separate occasions: 9-30-16 to 10-7-16, 10-23-16 to 10-29-16 and 11-1-16 to the present
day. She was also administered diphenhydrinate from 10-13-16 to 10-20-11. According to the box, this is a motion
sickness medicine. Daisy's condition is worse since the time of the last inspection. She is suffering in her current
condition and is in need of further veterinary evaluation. It is ultimately the responsibility of the licensee to ensure
that their animals receive adequate veterinary care. Additional veterinary consultation must be sought for Daisy's
worsening condition. A continued deterioration of Daisy's condition will lead to additional animal suffering and
possibly death. Keep records of veterinary consultation, diagnosis and treatment information for review by APHIS
inspectors. Veterinary consultation should be sought as soon as possible but no later than 11-16-16.
The inspectors observed a small brown cow which was very thin with prominent hip and rib bones. There was a
small amount of hay trampled into the mud and the front of the animals enclosure. The CEO of the facility informed
the inspectors that this cow had been obtained about one month before and was to be used as food for the animals.
This cow is in need of veterinary care. It is to thin and is in need of evaluation for its condition. Keep records of
this evaluation and treatment for review by APHIS inspectors. Even if intended for animal food, animals at the
facility require proper food, water, shelter and veterinary care while at the facility. Process food animals
immediately upon arrival at the facility or provide for their basic husbandry needs, including veterinary care if
warranted.A coatimundi at the facility has no hair above its haunches on both sides of its body. This animal is in need of
veterinary evaluation for its condition. This animal must bee seen by the attending veterinarian by close of business
on 11-11-16. Keep records of this animals evaluation and treatment for review by APHIS inspectors.
2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A coatimundi at the facility has no hair above its haunches on both sides of its body. No one at the facility had
noticed this hair loss. The attending veterinarian had not been consulted regarding the condition of this animal.
Failure to observe health issues and promptly treat and/or report them to the attending veterinarian will lead to
unnecessary suffering and in extreme cases even possible animal death. Thorough daily observations of all animals
should be made. Animals with known problems should receive extra scrutiny. Report all health issues promptly to
the veterinarian.
2.131(a) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A coatimundi at the facility was still housed in an outdoor enclosure. The facility CEO told inspectors that his plan
was to move the coatimundi inside in about a week and that it was a mountain coatimundi and used to the cold
temperatures. Two online sources consulted and reviewed at the time of the informal exit interview stated that
coatimundis should not be exposed to temperatures less than 40 degrees. The CEO has no knowledge of the basic
husbandry needs of this coatimundi. Licensees must demonstrate adequate knowledge of the species they
maintain. The licensee must learn about this coatimundi so that it can be kept according to its basic husbandry
standards. Keep records of books or online sources consulted for APHIS inspector review.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fence for the enclosure housing one alpaca has become pushed up from the ground. The enclosure fence for
the enclosure housing two alpacas has a broken post. The fence has also become pushed up and from the hair
present on the fence and the pattern of grazed grass outside the enclosure fence it is evident that these alpacas are
reaching under the fence to eat the grass. It would be very easy for one of these animals to become entangled in
the fence and injured while attempting to reach under the fence to eat or escape the enclosure. As there is no
grass inside the enclosure the animals may be highly motivated to exit the enclosure to obtain grass. Repair these
enclosures to properly contain the animals and prevent possible injury.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL. The meat cooler had an overwhelming odor of rotten and decaying meat. This odor makes it very hard to determine
if the meat items stored in this cooler are fit for animal consumption. Clean the cooler, identify the source of the
odor and eliminate it.
3.127(b) DIRECT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A coatimundi at the facility was still housed in an outdoor enclosure. The facility CEO told inspectors that his plan
was to move the coatimundi inside in about a week and that it was a mountain coatimundi and used to the cold
temperatures. Two online sources consulted and reviewed at the time of the informal exit interview stated that
coatimundis should not be exposed to temperatures less than 40 degrees. The expected low for the night is 36
degrees. In addition to this, several days in October already had recorded low temperatures ranging from 31 to 35
degrees. The expected low temperature for 11-11-16 is 26 degrees. To expose the coatimundi to these cold
temperatures has caused it suffering. This coatimundi needs to be moved indoors. Move this coatimundi indoors
today.
A shelter for the enclosure housing one alpaca and the shelter for the enclosure housing two goats and one sheep
have no bedding. The expected low temperature for the night is 36 degrees. These shelters need bedding. These
animals need dry bedding to remain comfortable during times of cold temperatures. Put bedding in these shelters.
Correct by: COB 11-9-16.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food receptacle boxes for the enclosure housing two American black bears and the enclosure housing two
Asian black bears contained a large amount of rotting food debris. Any food fed in these areas is going to be
contaminated by the rotting material present. These feeders need to be cleaned and made sanitary to ensure that
the food fed to the bears is wholesome and free from bacterial or pest infestation which could result in health issues
for the bears.
3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacle for the enclosure containing the tiger known as Lilly has a large amount of algae slime lining
its interior. This indicates that it is not being cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis. Water receptacles should be
kept clean and sanitary to promote adequate water consumption which is essential for animal health. Clean and
sanitize this water receptacle more frequently.3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was excessive feces and food waste in the enclosure for the grizzly bear. The CEO told the inspectors that
the enclosure had been cleaned about one month ago. This enclosure needs to be cleaned on a more frequent
basis. This rotting material and feces can lead to pest control issues. The rotting material present in this bear's(cid:25)
enclosure can contaminate it as it lies in its enclosure. The animal can ingest this material when it grooms itself.
Not removing old food waste promptly can lead to contamination of new food. Ingesting this rotten material can
lead to potential health problems. Clean this enclosure more frequently to prevent a buildup of food and fecal waste
to minimize odors and prevent potential health problems.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The majority of the premises is filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash and fence. Several other
buildings on the property are also filled with old equipment and debris and trash. Tall weeds are located throughout
the facility. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests and numerous rodent holes were
located throughout the facility. All this material must be removed to help control pests.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Rodent holes were located in the alleyway for the
leopard row cat enclosures and going under the shelter for the cougar enclosure. Rodents can be carriers of
disease which may be harmful to the animals housed in these areas. A more effective means of rodent control
must be established for the facility.
3.132 CRITICAL REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. The fact that no one at the facility had noted the condition of the coatimundi
illustrates this point. Daily observation of all animals and reporting animals that need attention to the attending
veterinarian are basic duties for facility employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of properly
trained employees can result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Of specialconcern on this inspection was the condition of the cow to be used for animal food at the facility. It was evident in
our discussion with the CEO that he felt that this animal should be treated differently than other animals at the
facility. He even referred to other meat animals that had been housed at the facility in the past to make his point to
APHIS inspectors. This facility states that it is an animal sanctuary. The CEO demonstrates a very indifferent
attitude towards animal welfare at the facility. This leads to a culture of indifference at this facility to basic animal
needs and treatment. This is animal cruelty. It is this culture of indifference to basic needs of animals that puts all
animals at the facility in danger. Animal numbers must be reduced or more properly trained workers need to be
added. A facility schedule needs to be developed that allows for adequate employee coverage in order to address
all animal husbandry needs. For the most part, the facility CEO is the only one authorized to work with the
dangerous animals at the facility as the other authorized party has very limited availability. All animal work must be
done with the dangerous animals under his direct supervision. This limits the amount of time that is available to
service the dangerous animal enclosures as the facility CEO is often offsite. This leads to poor sanitation in the
dangerous animal enclosures. The facility CEO needs to find a way to be onsite more or hire trained staff to help
run the facility.
The inspection was conducted with the CEO and two members of the board. An informal exit interview was
conducted with the CEO and two members of the board. All non-compliant items were discussed. Education
materials were shared with the CEO and the board members. All direct non-compliant items were discussed and
APHIS expectations for correction of these direct non-compliant items were made clear at this informal exit
interview. Due to scheduling concerns the formal exit interview with the CEO was conducted on 11-16-16.
