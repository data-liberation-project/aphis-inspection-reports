2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Four cats displayed abnormal signs or symptoms. "Arthur" (ID#7417) had black debris in both ears. We could not
determine if this debris was causing him discomfort. "Sophie" (ID#5819) had a thin haircoat on her sides, back, and
flanks. The underlying skin appeared healthy. "Sophie" has not been in any flea or tick study for at least the past
year. "Cry Baby" (ID#7267) had a mucoid discharge in both eyes. The eyes were otherwise clear, with no
indication of pain or discomfort. "Sam" (ID#5934) had black debris in both ears, although there was no indication of
discomfort.
There was no indication from paperwork or questioning employees that the facility had noted any of these
symptoms. None of these conditions were clearly impacting the animals. However, the presence of any abnormal
signs should be noted by the facility staff, and appropriate followup completed.
Correct from this point forward.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an accumulation of fencing, construction material, and other items located immediately adjacent to an
outdoor enclosure containing dogs. Weeds have grown through this material, all of which is being kept directly on
the ground. This is a potential source of harborage for pests and insects, and is located close enough to the dogs
to impact their well being. This material must be removed immediately. It should be properly stored at an
appropriate distance from regulated animals.
