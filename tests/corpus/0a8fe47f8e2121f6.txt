2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
** There were two rabbits (H-721 and D-193) with eye conditions and one rabbit (D-374) with excessive drainage on
the right side of its face. Rabbit (D-193) had an opaque white appearance with a disturbed surface covering its right
eye. The rabbit didn't exhibit any signs of distress or pain but there was some drainage from the eye. The second
rabbit (H-721) had yellow crust and some drainage from his left eye which was completely sealed shut. Rabbit
(D-374) had excessive drainage from the right eye and the skin beneath the hair appeared reddened with a crusty
brown substance around the edges. These conditions were noted at the previous inspection. The veterinarian has
been contacted but the animals have not received any veterinary care as of yet. A mechanism for direct & frequent
caretaker communication is required so that timely information about the animals health may be conveyed to the
attending veterinarian and the animals can receive treatment as expeditiously as possible.
This was a focused inspection of the veterinary care of the animals.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the animal caretaker.
