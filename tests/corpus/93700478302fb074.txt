ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One Maltese female #10 "Mindy" was observed with dark discoloration of the white fur around the mouth. On
inspection of her teeth, it was noted that the dog has a large amount of brownish concretion built up around the
majority of the upper teeth. Some (3-4) teeth show a creamy greenish material at the junction of the gums and
teeth. The gums surrounding these teeth are colored a dark purple.
Dental disease is a painful condition that can lead to other illness including infections, weight loss, and systemic
disease. This dog must be examined and treated by a licensed veterinarian to treat the current dental disease and
prevent further deterioration due to this condition.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Several of the wire doors on the inside portion of the primary enclosures have a build-up of rust on the wire. Also,
some of the frames of the dog doors separating the inside and outside portions of the primary enclosures have
significant scratch and chew damage. Microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites can contaminate
these roughened surfaces and escape routine sanitization, and therefore pose a disease risk to the animals
contained therein. All surfaces in contact with the dogs must be repaired or replaced to enable proper cleaning and
sanitizing.
