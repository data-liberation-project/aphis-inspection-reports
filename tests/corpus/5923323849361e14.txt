Facilities, general.
In the large hoof-stock enclosure (front pasture), housing 11 cattle and a bison, there is a large composting pile of fecal
material, hay, straw, and debris in the pasture in an area where the animals spend a significant amount of time. The pile is
also in close proximity to the hay feeder. Compost piles should be maintained in an area that minimizes animal contact.
Leaving the waste material in the field for composting exposes the animals to insect infestation, disease, and
contamination. The compost pile of waste must maintained in an area away from the animals to prevent disease and
minimize contamination of food. Correct by April 30, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
