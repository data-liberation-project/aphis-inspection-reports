3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The macaque's night house has areas which cant be adequately cleaned and sanitized due to the wood surfaces no
longer being painted and damaged. The surfaces of housing facilities--including perches, shelves, swings, boxes,
houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures or objects within the facility--must be constructed in a manner and
made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.
