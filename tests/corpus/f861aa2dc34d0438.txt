3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outdoor runs being used by at least 20 dogs have an excessive accumulation of animal waste, snow and ice in
them. The feces is mixed with snow and ice on the ground surface of the enclosures. Most of the dogs have to walk
on the packed snow and feces to get from one end of the enclosure to the other. The licensee stated that the pens
were cleaned a couple days ago. The licensee also stated the snow, ice and inclement weather has affected the
frequency in which the outdoor runs are cleaned.
Excessive accumulations of animal waste in the primary enclosures can increase disease risks and can result in the
dogs becoming soiled. The licensee must ensure that excreta is removed from all primary enclosures on a daily
basis or more often if needed.
Exit briefing conducted with the licensee.
