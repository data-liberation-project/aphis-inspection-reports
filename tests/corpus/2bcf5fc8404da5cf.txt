3.56(b)(3)

Sanitation.
In the facility, rabbit enclosures are pressure washed and food bowls are cleaned with soap and water. The enclosures
and food bowls are not being sanitized since the temperature of the water does not reach 180 °F and a disinfectant
solution is not being applied. When enclosures are not sanitized adequately, there is a higher risk of large numbers of
harmful germs remaining on the surfaces which creates a health hazard for the rabbits. Primary enclosures for rabbits
shall be sanitized by washing them with hot water (180 °F.) and soap or detergent as in a mechanical cage washer, or by
washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled
surfaces with live steam or flame. Food bowls must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks while primary enclosures
must be sanitized at least once every 30 days. To be corrected by December 23rd, 2022.
3.126(b)

Facilities, indoor.
Upon entering the heated detached garage housing the animals, a strong odor of ammonia was detected. The inspector
experienced some eye stinging when in the garage which improved once two garage doors were opened halfway for
approximately 15 minutes. The ventilation in the facility is not well suited at minimizing odor and ammonia build up.
Excessive ammonia inhalation can be detrimental to animal’s comfort and health especially affecting the respiratory


system and irritating the eyes of those housed indoors. The housing facilities must be sufficiently ventilated for the health
and well-being of the animals by minimizing odors, drafts, ammonia levels and moisture condensation. To be corrected by
December 23rd, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
