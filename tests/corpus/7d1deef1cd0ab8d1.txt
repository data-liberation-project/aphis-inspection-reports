2.40(b)(1) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During the week of 15 July 2019, there were multiple veterinary care priorities and only one veterinarian and no
veterinary technicians employed. This staffing level was insufficient to provide adequate veterinary care, resulting in
the delayed euthanasia of a female chimpanzee.
The availability of appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and services must be maintained to provide
adequate veterinary care. The facility has since employed another veterinarian and two veterinary technicians.
Corrected prior to this inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
