2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30 on
05-Sep-17. The licensee stated he was unavailable to accompany the inspection on that day. He did not indicate
optimal hours for inspection at that time.
Without access to conduct inspections, the regulatory process is impossible. The licensee must ensure a
knowledgeable facility representative is available to accompany inspection during normal business hours.
Correct from this time forward.
