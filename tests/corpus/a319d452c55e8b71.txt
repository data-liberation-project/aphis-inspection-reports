2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female black and white Shih Tzu named Zena with microchip number 099802527 has a brownish grey
material covering all the teeth that were visible during a very cursory exam. The gums looked slightly reddened at
the base of the molars and cheek teeth on both sides. The dog was very active and difficult to hold still, and the
inspector could not get even one picture of the inside of the mouth.
Dental problems can be painful, make it difficult to eat, lead to the development of other health problems, and can
affect the health and well-being of the animal.
The licensee must consult with a veterinarian by August 19, 2015 for a proper diagnosis and to develop and follow a
treatment plan. The licensee must document the veterinarian's findings; the treatment plan that is followed, and
have the records available to the inspector upon request.
***The adult female brown and white Shih Tzu number 074783527, the adult female fawn Pekingese number
069074294 and the Program of Veterinary Care all cited on the previous inspection dated January 20, 2015 were
addressed.
Inspection and exit interview conducted by Lynn Clarke with facility representative.
