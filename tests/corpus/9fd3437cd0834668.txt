FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is approximately 80 feet of outdoor enclosure fence for the petting zoo animals which is made up of multiple
layers of fencing material. Pieces of welded wire panels have been added in several locations along the "back
fence" to prevent escape of the animals housed inside the petting zoo. Several protruding metal wires were noted
on these panels which could potentially injure the farm animals housed in this enclosure. The employee access
gate located along the "back fence" has an old wooden post which is held together by multiple wire ties. This gate
fence post is deteriorating and could potentially fail to contain the petting zoo animals. Outdoor housing facilities
must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals. To be corrected by: June 1, 2015.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
