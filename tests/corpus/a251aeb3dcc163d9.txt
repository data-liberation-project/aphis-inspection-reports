ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female black bear (cid:28)Molly(cid:29) was observed pacing a well-worn path in her enclosure. She was observed the first
time for ~5 minutes in which the pacing never stopped. The path is well-worn, indicating this is a common activity for
her. Pacing in such a manner is considered an abnormal behavior (stereotypic behavior). A veterinarian should be
consulted about this activity and an appropriate action plan established to address the issue.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
There must be sufficient distance and/or barriers between the exhibited animals and the general viewing public so
the safety of the animals and the public is assured. The new raccoon enclosure has a public barrier consisting of 2
horizontal wires spaced approximately 24"(cid:29) apart. While the inspector was viewing the enclosure a small child went
between the wires and walked up to the enclosure. The child could have been injured, or may have injured the
animals. An additional type of barrier is needed to prevent the public from contacting the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Many animal enclosures were noted to be in need of maintenance. These include:
***Damaged kick-ins (overhangs). Kick-ins are an important part of the enclosure fence that keep animals from
climbing out and escaping. All kick-ins must be maintained in good condition to ensure the animals can be securely
contained.Cougar enclosure (contains 2 cougars) (cid:19)has an approximately 12'(cid:25) long part of the kick-in that is damaged and
instead of protruding into the enclosure, it is bent downwards or straight vertically (parallel to the fence). Also, in the
overlook area, the kick-in is very flexible with no solid support. It is easily accessible to the public who can bend it
over and damage it.

Silver fox enclosure (contains 2 fox) (cid:19)has an approximately 15'(cid:25) long part of the kick-in that is bent over and part of it
is no long connected to the support bars.
Correct by: 1/23/16
Bison/elk north pasture (contains 27 bison and 25 elk) has several areas of the north line of fence where the kick-in
is damaged and bent downwards.

***J hooks above ground in animal enclosures. The J hooks are used to secure the ground line that keeps the
animals from digging out. These hooks are protruding anywhere from 6(cid:29)" to 12"(cid:29) above the ground. An animal can
easily be injured by these protrusions by catching or trapping a paw. All J hooks must be placed below the ground
line or removed.
The cougar, coyote (contains 2 coyotes), and red fox (contains 2 fox) enclosure have many exposed J hooks.

***Many ground lines (the chain link buried under the ground to keep animals from digging out) were exposed.
Exposure in these enclosures ranged from 2'(cid:25) to more than 15(cid:25)'. Injury could occur if an animal got a paw trapped or
caught in the ground line. All ground lines should be covered to prevent animal injury.
The lynx (1 lynx), bobcat (2 bobcats) and coyote (2 coyote) enclosures have exposed ground line.

***The raccoon enclosure (contains 2 raccoons) has numerous sharp metal points on the wire used to make the
enclosure. The sharp metal points are on all sides and the top of the enclosure. When testing the sharpness, the
inspector could easily have broken her own skin by applying mild pressure to the point. Raccoons are climbers and
were observed climbing all over the metal on the enclosure. It would be very easy for one of the animals to be
injured by the metal points. All sharp metal points must be removed.

***An enclosure containing 11 goats has a back fence that is in poor repair. It is very rusty and bent out of shape.
There is also a large hole that has been dug under this fence. This hole can easily allow entry of unwanted animals
or trap a goat (either a foot or horn). The integrity of the fence is compromised by the bending and the rust and may
not safely contain the animals. The hole could allow entry of a predator or could cause injury to the goats. The
enclosure must contain the animals safely and securely and protect them from predator entry.Correct by: 3/5/16
***The enclosure containing (cid:28)Big Mike(cid:29) the bison has a significantly bent area of fence and a gap between the gate
and the fence. The structural integrity of the fence is compromised when it is bent and may not be able to prevent
an animal from escaping. The gap is approximately 6"(cid:29) wide at the bottom and gets wider at the top. This is an area
where the bison could get a leg or horn trapped, or that an unwanted animal could enter. The enclosure needs to be
fixed so that it safely and securely contains the animal.

***The north pasture containing 27 bison and 25 elk has fencing in need of repair. Along an area of new fencing,
there is a large area (~40 feet long, and 3(cid:25) feet deep) of washout, creating a large gap between the ground and the
fence. It would be possible for a small elk or calf to roll under the fence and escape. Along the north fence line,
there are least 2 areas where holes (big enough for a large raccoon or small coyote) have been dug under the
fence. This allows entry of unwanted animals that could cause injury to the animals. The fencing needs to be fixed
and maintained in a way that safely and securely contains the animals and keeps unwanted animals out. Also in the
north pasture, there is a ~25'(cid:25) long section of chain link fence lying unused on the ground. Weeds have started
growing through and around the chain link. This fencing is a hazard to the animals; they could get their legs or
horns/antlers hung in the fencing and injury themselves. The fencing needs to be removed from this area.

***An enclosure containing one adult male black bear (TR) does not have a hot wire that is working. The bear was
seen sniffing at the wire (or something right at the wire). He had no reaction, indicating that he did not receive any
sort of shock from the wire. Also, in the badger enclosure, the hot wire entering the enclosure was not connected to
the wire running around the enclosure. The lack of hot wire can compromise the ability of the enclosure to maintain
the animals, allowing them to escape. A system in which the hot wire can be maintained and checked for function
needs to be established.
