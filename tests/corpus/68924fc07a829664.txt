ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- A goat in the petting zoo area was found with overgrown hooves, affecting all four legs. The animal was able to
walk with no indication of lameness, but the hoof length was affecting the normal standing posture. Overgrown
hooves are a potential source of discomfort to the animal, and can reach a length where gait and normal hoof
position are drastically affected. The affected goat must have the hooves trimmed within 1 week. All hooved
animals must be properly observed and maintained on a program of hoof care to ensure there is no overgrowth in
the future.
3.75(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In an enclosure housing two red lemurs, there are a pair of old rusted metal farm implements being used as
enrichment. Multiple spots on these implements have sharp points and jagged edges. Sharp areas are a source of
potential injury to the enclosed animals. The implements must either be removed or made safe for the primates.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the middle section of the walk through area next to the primate barn, there is an enclosure housing three young
baboons. The shelter for these animals, located at the top of the cage, is dirty and heavily stained.
- In an outdoor enclosure in front of the primate, the shelter for two red lemurs is dirty and stained.
- On the back row behind the giraffe feeding area, four ring-tailed lemurs are in an outdoor cage which has old food
and other waste in and around the cage. Numerous flies were present in and around this area.
- In the drive through area, two enclosures contained a heavily contaminated PVC pipe and a dirty, stained PVC
enrichment device.
Dirty surfaces increase the risk of contamination to enclosed primates. All surfaces which contact the primates
must be kept clean and sanitary.Correct by: 1 June 2016
3.81(b)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
- There is a widespread, systemic lack of enrichment for the primates throughout the facility. Many of the primates
in the park had no or very few enrichment items added to their cages. Too many of the enclosures in this facility are
just bare in appearance. All primates need enrichment to help maintain mental and emotional health and well
being. Some species need more than others, and individual animals may also require more than the "normal"
amount of enrichment. The facility must re-evaluate its primate enrichment plan, and implement a more varied and
thorough approach to enrichment. This is a complex process and care should be given to species variance, special
needs animals, as well as the differences between primates of different ages. The facility must consult with the
attending veterinarian, and should contact other sources of professional help and advice.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the enclosures housing muntjac and wallaby, the gate between the enclosures has rusted through at the top.
The gate itself is hanging only by the bottom hinges. This is not functional, and is a potential source of injury to the
enclosed animals. The gate must be repaired or removed.
- In the drive through section of the park, the enclosure housing three red foxes has a layer of wire covering the
ground which is warped in multiple locations, creating holes and gaps in the sheet of wire. This needs to be
stretched flat and secured properly to provide a stable layer for footing. The second level of this enclosure consists
of a wire floor with a couple of wooden running boards. This wire does not provide stable footing for the foxes, and
should be covered with an appropriate surface.
- In the lion pen housing Kuvo and Keara, the climbing structure has several badly broken boards with a row of
exposed nails. This is a source of potential injury to the enclosed animals.
- The kangaroo enclosure fence along the road and driveway is leaning sharply and does not provide an effective
barrier.
All facilities must be maintained in good condition and repair to protect the health and welfare of the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There were problems with outdoor shelters throughout the facility.
- Two warthogs in an enclosure near the petting zoo area had no natural or artificial shelter available to them.
- Two shelters in the Wallaby and Muntjac enclosure had holes in the exterior walls, interior walls ,and interior
ceiling, with a nail head exposed in one hole. This is a source of potential injury to animals using these shelters.- The first enclosure housing oryx had a shelter with a damaged roof, including a strip of metal hanging down the
side of the shelter.
- A second shelter in the oryx area had a hole in the interior ceiling, with a large strip of metal dangling into the main
area of the shelter.
Lack of shelter exposes the enclosed animals to weather and ambient temperature without any opportunity for
refuge. Existing shelters must be maintained to ensure they are safe and effective for the animals. All shelters
must be repaired. Any animals lacking natural or artificial shelters must have shelter provided.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- On the upper row of the big cat hill, two enclosures housing lions did not have any source of natural or artificial
shade present. Given the normal heat and humidity present at this time of year, all animals should have shade
available at all times. The facility must provide a source of shade for the animals in these enclosures.

WATERING.
- Three porcupines housed with primates in enclosures around the primate barn had no water at the time of
inspection.
With the heat and humidity of the early summer, lack of water can quickly result in serious health impacts. Clean,
potable water must be available to these animals as needed. The licensee must take the ambient heat and
humidity into account when deciding on the frequency of watering.
- On the big cat hill, numerous water troughs were dirty with an accumulation of green algae and other
contaminants. Access to clean water is crucial at all times of the year, but particularly so during the heat and
humidity of summer. The affected water troughs included numerous big cat enclosures, the bear enclosure, and the
enclosure housing ponies with Jacob's sheep. All water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized as soon as
possible. The facility must ensure that these water receptacles are maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in
the future.

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
- There were numerous flies present in the main food storage area, food preparation room, and the big cat meat
storage barn. All areas had open trash cans containing waste. The big cat area had spilled vegetables and other
foods on the barn floor just outside the meat freezer. None of these areas had any effective fly control methods. Waste and spilled food are powerful attractors for flies and other pests that can contaminate food and food
preparation equipment. To ensure the animals are fed healthy diets, an effective fly and pest control program must
be implemented. All trash cans should be covered with locking lids. Spilled food cannot be left on the floor, but
must be properly disposed. Knives, cutting boards, and other food preparation material must be cleaned in a timely
manner, and maintained in a sanitary condition. This will help eliminate pest attractants. The facility should also
use safe fly control measures and traps as needed.
