WATERING.
In the large breed dog building, the water receptacles are hard plastic buckets or rubber pans. Three of these
receptacles have a buildup of green algae on their inside surfaces. There are a total of seven dogs that consume
water from these receptacles. Algae buildup can contaminate the drinking water and increase health risks to the
dogs. All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized at least once every two weeks, or as often as
necessary to prevent the buildup of algae and any other potential health hazards.
