2.75(b)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Acquisition records for Oreo, the sheep, were incomplete and the required information under 2.75 b (1) was not
maintained in Oreo's file. The acquisition information was found in the file of Tux, another sheep who had been
acquired from the same source. A system of recordkeeping must be maintained that includes all the required
information for each animal covered under the Act.
Corrected during Inspection.
Exit Interview conducted with facility personnel.
