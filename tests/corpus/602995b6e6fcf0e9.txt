3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
Six enclosures, housing one dog per enclosure, have areas of rust on the chain link fencing and supports. The
surfaces are rusted to the point that it is pitting and flaking. The licensee stated that she had painted the rusted
areas before but it needs to be painted again. The more severe areas of rust are located along the bottom frame of
the enclosures where the dogs can come in contact with it.
The pitted and flaking surfaces cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized and can harbor disease hazards. The
surfaces need to be repaired and/or replaced to allow for proper cleaning and sanitizing. All surfaces must be free of
excessive rust that prevents required cleaning or that affects the structural strength of the surface.
There are worn and chewed wooden surfaces in the front room of the Indoor Facility where three dogs are housed.
The wooden flooring is worn and no longer impervious to moisture. There's also gaps and cracks in the flooring that
can collect dirt, grime and other debris. The door frame in the room is excessively chewed and is rough and jagged.
This wooden surface that the dogs can come in contact with is also not sealed and cannot be readily cleaned or
sanitized. The bare wooden surfaces can absorb liquids and create disease hazards for the dogs. The door frame
also has areas of sharp metal edges the the dogs can come in contact with. These sharp edges can cause injuries.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities that
cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Drainage and waste disposal.
There are two enclosures in the Kennel Building that have pools of standing waste water. Almost half of the floor
surface in the enclosures are covered in urine and waste water. The dogs are standing in and splashing the liquid.
There's also a strong odor of urine and other noxious fumes within the building. The licensee stated that the dog in
the far left enclosure urinates a lot and the floor does not allow liquid to drain properly. The licensee also stated that
she washed out the kennels earlier this morning.
Inadequate drainage and not spot cleaning often enough daily, can lead to disease risks which can affect the healthand well-being of the dogs.
The licensee must provide for regular and frequent removal of animal waste, water and other fluids, in a manner
that minimizes contamination and disease risks. Standing puddles of water in animal enclosures must be drained or
mopped up so that the animals stay dry.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary enclosures.
An adult Shar-Pei was being contained in a damaged wire crate during the inspection. When the inspector walked
into the room, the dog was breaking through the wire door on the crate. The inspector observed broken and bent
wires on the front of the crate. The gaps created by the broken and bent wires were becoming large enough to
where the dog could get its head or other body parts caught. The bent and broken wires could also lead to injuries.
Primary enclosures must be designed and constructed of suitable materials so that they are structurally sound. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures being used are maintained, contain the dogs securely and protect the dogs
from injury.
Corrected at time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
