3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At least eight wooden shelters located in the outdoor housing area have chewed and worn surfaces around the front
entrance. Unsealed wooden surfaces are exposed where the green paint is flaking or peeling off. Thirteen adult
dogs are using these shelters and can come in contact with the affected areas. Untreated, chewed or worn wooden
surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
The south outdoor enclosure containing an adult Border Collie and three puppies, has surfaces along the front of
the shelter that are in disrepair. The lower half of the sheet metal on the front exterior side of the shelter is rusty and
pitted. The affected area has deteriorated and created several rusty edges the dogs can come in contact with.
These rusted surfaces cannot be properly cleaned.
Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis can lead to unsanitary living conditions and potential disease or health
risks for the dogs. The licensee must ensure all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis or be replaced when
worn.
To be corrected by: September 9, 2016.

*The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 19, 2016.
