Facilities, general.
A 30-foot diameter circular pool housing one single male dolphin calf contained 6 plastic water jet inserts in the walls of
the pool which were in poor condition. There was clear plastic silicone around the edges of all 6 jets that was peeling,
irregular, and coming away from the surface of the wall.
Marine mammals may chew, pull, or tear at equipment in their pools, resulting in digestion of foreign materials by the
animal or damage and dysfunction of the equipment.
Correct by August 1, 2021 by maintaining marine mammal enclosures in good repair to protect the animals(s) from injury.
