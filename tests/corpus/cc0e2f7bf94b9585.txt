2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The following dogs were identified to have matted fur behind the ears, along the hind legs and underneath the
neck. Matted fur pulls and separates from the skin causing skin irritations. Additionally many of the dogs that were
matted along the anal region had feces caught in the mats which can cause additional irritation. A grooming
program needs to be put into place so these dogs are routinely groomedto prevent this level of matting and for their
comfort and well being. The dogs identified were # 113 (poodle) # H02 (Bernese Cavalier X), #C19 (Cavalier), #H66
(Lhasa), #H01 (Bernese Cavalier X), #C40 (Pekingese) , #H71(Pomeranian), #H97( Maltese), #129 (Maltese), and
#187 (Havanese).
*** Dog # H02 in addition to being matted had a strong smell of yeast coming from the left ear. This ear needs to be
treated for the health of the dog.
*** Dog # C53 had excessive debris in the left ear canal and on the fur around the ear. This ear needs to be treated
for the health of the dog
*** Currently the facility is using one syringe and needle per 25 count of vaccines. For the health of the dogs and to
reduce the potential spread of diseases, a needle can be used once per litter for vaccines but should not be used on
multiple litters of dogs. This needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** Certain areas of the enclosures and kennels are not being cleaned and sanitized properly. There is a buildup of
dirt, debris and hair underneath the enclosures, along the back and side walls and in corners of enclosures where
hanging buckets are over. This excess hair can trap urine and fecal debris causing strong odors throughout the
kennel. These areas of the kennel need to be effectively cleaned and sanitized once every two weeks for the health
of the dogs.
