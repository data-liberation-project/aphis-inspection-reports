is large enough for it to at least submerge its body into water. The capybara has a water dish and a shallow pan
with about 2 inches of water where it defecates. Under natural conditions capybara spend a significant portion oftheir time in water. Compliance with space requirements means there should be both dry and aquatic portions of
the primary enclosure, each which, at a minimum, provide sufficient space to allow the animal to make normal
postural adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. The licensee informed the APHIS official that the
capybara had access to its outdoor pool until the weather turned cold this past week. Correct by providing the
capybara a water receptacle that is large enough and deep enough for it to submerge its body into the water and

the animals. Once the APHIS official identified the condition of the floor of the shelter, the licensee cleaned the
floor. Correct by maintaining the floors of the sheltered area of the enclosures reasonably free of excreta/feces for
the health and comfort of the animals from this day forward.
