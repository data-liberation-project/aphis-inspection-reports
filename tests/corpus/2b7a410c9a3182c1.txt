2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
All thirty-eight puppies throughout the facility were not identified. The licensee did have records of their births in
their files, but did not identify the animals by any means.
Lack of identification can cause inaccurate medical treatments, records, and sales. The licensee must identify all
puppies less than 16 weeks of age.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the farthest part from the main door of the "old kennel" there was a strong odor from possibly high ammonia
levels. The flow of air from fans and air conditioning were directed to that area and there was not a sufficient means
to remove the odor where it was becoming concentrated. There were vents on the roof that were missing pieces
and were not functioning correctly.
Lack of sufficient ventilation can cause respiratory, eye, and general health risks. The licensee must sufficiently
ventilate the facility at all times to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia levels, and moisture condensation.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the "old kennel" a litter of four puppies feet were passing through the mess floor of the enclosure.
Surfaces that allow the feet to pass through can cause injury or inhibit the movement of the puppies. The licensee
must construct the floors in a manner that does not allow feet and legs to pass through the openings in the floor.TO BE CORRECTED BY: JULY 6, 2016
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensees, ACI Bartels, and IDALS.
