2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***Facility personnel did not perform adequate daily observations of two sheep, ID #7070 and #8020, by failing to
communicate their health conditions to the attending veterinarian.
Written daily observations provided by the facility indicate that on 06/03/18 sheep #8020 “had no interest in food.”
On 06/09/18, sheep #8020 “wasn’t eating and was laying down.” On 06/10/18 he was treated for urinary calculi,
however a facility representative stated that the sheep had not been examined by or diagnosed by a veterinarian.
On 06/11/18, he was observed to be down and "didn't get up this morning." At the 1PM observation later that day,
records indicate that “8020 died due to complications from urinary calculi.”
Written daily observations provided by the facility indicate that from 06/04/18-06/25/18, ewe #7070 had been
vomiting almost on a daily basis. A facility representative informed the APHIS inspector that he had been feeding
her alfalfa pellets separately from the herd, as she was very thin and her teeth were worn down. He stated that she
had not been seen by a veterinarian recently. On inspection, APHIS inspector observed that ewe #7070 was thin,
and her spine and hip bones were protruding. The attending veterinarian stated that neither he nor the other
veterinarian on staff had examined either of these sheep.
Adequate daily observation of all animals and direct communication with the attending veterinarian is critical to
ensure that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being can be diagnosed and treated in a timely
manner. Injuries, diseases, and medical conditions that are not treated properly (as directed by a veterinarian) may
be worsened and can lead to prolonged suffering.
Each research facility shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include daily
observations of all animals to assess their health and well-being; provided, however, that daily observation of
animals may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian; and provided further, that a
mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected from this date forward.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
