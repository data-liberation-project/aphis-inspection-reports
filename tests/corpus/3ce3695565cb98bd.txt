ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****In the whelp house was a female Boston Terrier (Sandy Sparrow; m/c# 043266323) with six 5- week-old
puppies. The female was very thin and her hair coat was thin. The ribs, vertebrae, hip bones and shoulder bones
were very easily seen and there was a distinctive abdominal tuck. The haircoat was thin overall with patchy areas
of missing hair on the rump and hind legs. The owner had increased the dog's food, but the dog continued to lose
weight. A veterinarian had not seen the dog for these conditions. Weight loss can be the result of parasites, lack of
adequate nutrition, or an underlying medical condition. Missing or thin hair can be the result of parasites or an
underlying medical condition. The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a veterinarian for diagnosis and
treatment, must keep a record of the treatment, and must present this record to the inspector upon request.
THE DOG MUST BE TAKEN TO A VETERINARIAN BY THE END OF THE DAY ON FEBRUARY 27, 2015.

(3) Cleaning.
****In the outdoor enclosures were 4 enclosures that had bird feces along the front wall and on the lid of 1 feeder.
Birds have been roosting at the top of the welded panel and the feces dripped down the panel. Bird feces can
contain parasites and bacteria that can cause illness in the dogs. To provide a healthier environment for the dogs,
the owner must remove the feces from the feeder and enclosures and thoroughly clean and sanitize the surfaces.
Removal of bird feces must be a part of the daily cleaning.
