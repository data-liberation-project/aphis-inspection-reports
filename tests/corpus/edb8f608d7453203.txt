2.126(b)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 pm on August
10, 2022. I spoke with the licensee on the phone and was informed that they have moved the dog kennel to a new site in
a different town. I instructed licensee to contact the office with their new address so that a new site inspection can be
completed.
