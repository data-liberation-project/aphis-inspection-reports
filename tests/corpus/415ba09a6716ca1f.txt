ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany an APHIS Official during the inspection process from 2:00 -
2:30pm on 2/1/2016. I knocked on doors and no one I answered. I also honked the horn on my vehicle. I called
the number on file and the phone service said the number is disconnected.
