2.38(f) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
Three mini pigs suffered leg injuries during husbandry or study activities and were subsequently euthanized. One
was during a waterline check where the enclosure door was opened and the animal either jumped or fell out,
injuring a leg during the fall. Another was during removal of the animal from its enclosure for an undetermined
purpose (cage cleaning/study activity/other), and the animal’s hoof was somehow injured in the process; a clear
cause of the injury was not able to be determined. A third animal was being dosed via oral gavage and experienced
a leg injury while in the restraint sling. In all three of these instances, the injuries were immediately noted, reported
to the veterinarian, and euthanasia was performed in a timely manner. The facility has reviewed each incident
individually to determine cause, and in each case corrective measures were taken, including re-training of staff and
implementing adjustments to water checks and cage removal procedures to prevent recurrence of such injuries. A
review of husbandry procedures suggested there is no current or ongoing risks of recurrence. However, these
incidents caused serious impacts to animal welfare. Handling of animals must be done as expeditiously and
carefully as possible, in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress,
physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. Correct from this time forward.
This inspection was conducted from 20-22 March 2017 with veterinary and compliance staff. An exit interview was
conducted on 22 March 2017 with the site director, veterinary and compliance staff.
