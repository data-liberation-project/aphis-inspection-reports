Separation.
The facility has had compatibility issues between two male sea lions, Osborn and Bruiser. Upon reviewing records, there
were three instances of Osborn presenting with bite wounds between the dates of 8-June-2021 and 3-April-2022. After
the event on 3-April-2022, staff changed their positioning when moving sea lions to eliminate the chances of bites through
enclosure fencing while transferring between enclosures. On the night of 25-April-2022, Osborn and Bruiser were housed
together overnight. These animals were placed together while maintenance was conducted on one of the main
enclosures. On the morning of 26-April-2022, Osborn presented with a facial wound consistent with raking. At the time of
this incident, trainers were aware of negative interactions between these animals and had procedures in place to distract
Bruiser with enrichment items so Osborn could drink fresh water. It was determined at this point that these two animals
were incompatible to be housed together. Animals not compatible with each other may cause mild to serious injury and
cause undue stress on the animals.
Marine mammals that are not compatible must not be housed in the same enclosure. The facility must not house
incompatible groups of sea lions together in the same enclosure.
To remain corrected from this day forward.
