Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A wild caught, recently imported adult female coati has a wound on the tip of her tail. There is approximately 1/4 inch of
white bone sticking out of the tip of the tail, surrounded by approximately 1/2 inch of bright red tissue. The animal was
observed to be highly stressed by the presence of the inspector, and started chewing on the tail wound. The licensee
stated that they had observed the animal chewing at her tail a few weeks ago and had contacted the attending
veterinarian (AV) at that time, who recommended monitoring and enrichment to decrease stress, which the licensee had
been doing. The inspector contacted the attending veterinarian and the AV stated that she had not been aware that there
was exposed bone before the inspector identified the issue on 01/21/22. Exposed bone and tissue at the tip of an animals
tail may be be caused an injury, frost bite, irritation caused by parasites, or self mutilation. Wounds may be a source of
pain for the animal, and can become infected. It is important to communicate with the attending veterinarian regarding an
animals response (or lack of response) to treatment so that the veterinarian can provide adequate veterinary care. Correct
by January 26, 2022 by obtaining a consultation with the attending veterinarian or another veterinarian with experience in
this species regarding the current condition of this animal's tail.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.


Acquisition records for most animals did not contain the address or USDA license number (or driver's license number) for
the source of the animals. Complete recordkeeping is important for animal traceability in the event of lost, stolen, or sick
animals. Correct by 02/24/22 by maintaining records that contain all information required by the Animal Welfare Act.

Facilities, outdoor.
3 red kangaroos are contained in a large enclosure with 8-foot-tall chain link fence. The perimeter fence around the
kangaroo enclosure is made of wire farm fencing and is only 5 feet tall. A perimeter fence must be strong and tall enough
to prevent entry of unauthorized people and animals, and to act as a secondary containment system in the event that an
animal escapes from its primary enclosure. Correct by maintaining a perimeter fence around the kangaroo enclosure that
is at least 6 feet tall and 3 feet away from the animals primary enclosure, or by obtaining a variance from USDA. A
perimeter fence must also be maintained around any existing or new exotic animal enclosures in accordance with the
Animal Welfare Act regulations.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
