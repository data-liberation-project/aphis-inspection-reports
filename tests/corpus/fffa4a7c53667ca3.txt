2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female Boston terrier named Buffie (m/c# 003271001) repeatedly rubbed her face and sides along the
fence of the enclosure. The licensee had taken the dog to a veterinarian on November 30, 2016 and he diagnosed
diffuse superficial pyoderma. The veterinarian dispensed 28 pills of Clindamycin with instructions to give one pill
twice a day for 14 days, beginning that night. However, 25 of the 28 pills were still remaining in the pill container.
The licensee did not have a written treatment record, Failure to follow the veterinarian's directions can result in the
dog's condition worsening or healing incompletely and can prolong the pain associated with the condition. The
licensee must ensure that all the veterinarian's treatments and instructions are followed as directed.

3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The outdoor shelter for three adult Beagles had almost no bedding. The licensee is using hay for bedding, but
nearly all of the shelter floor was visible and not covered in bedding. The ambient temperature during the
inspection and the night before was about 42 degrees F. Insufficient bedding can cause the dogs to become cold
and stressed, making them more susceptible to health problems. The licensee must ensure that all dogs have
adequate dry, clean bedding whenever the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees F and additional bedding
when the ambient temperature is 35 degrees F or lower.
TO BE CORRECTED DECEMBER 6, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and a MO Dept. of Agriculture inspector.
