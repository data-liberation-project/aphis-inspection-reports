Watering.
In the enclosure containing two female reindeer at Luminaria at Ashton Gardens, Thanksgiving Point, Lehi UT, the
galvanized metal water tub contained cloudy rust colored water. There was foamy scum on one side, floating debris, and
an oily film present on the surface of the water. There was no other water source for the animals to drink.
Contaminated or unpalatable water could lead to dehydration or illness in animals.
All water receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary to provide adequate potable water for the animals.
To be corrected by 12/23/2022.
