ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***A male Bichon Frise #086.124.582 (approximately 12 yr old) had a heavy build-up of grayish brown material on
the teeth. This abnormal build-up of material covered the majority of the teeth and extended into the gum-line. The
gums had receded along some of these teeth and a creamy, grey to white material was noted along the gum line of
some of these teeth. The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth
structures. This can be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the overall
health of the animal. The licensee must develop and establish an effective dental care program as part of the
overall program of veterinary care for the animals in the facility.
A female Boston Terrier # 4C13036D22 had areas of hair loss, with small reddened skin lesions within these areas,
on the front of both front legs just above and just below the joints above the feet. The skin in these areas appeared
flaky and pinkish red and each had a few pin head sized reddish skin lesions and/or brown scab-like skin lesions.
These areas of hair loss and skin lesions could be the result of injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition
which could negatively affect the health of the animal and/or may be uncomfortable. According to the licensee,
neither of these dogs had been seen by a veterinarian nor were they being treated for these current conditions.
The licensee must have these dogs seen by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that accurate diagnoses are
made and that appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must document this
information and make it available to the inspector upon request. All dogs must receive adequate veterinary care at
all times.

Cleaning.
***The outside portion of the sheltered building had fecal matter covering the flooring. In at least 4 enclosures on the
north side and 3 enclosures on the south side, affecting approximately 12 dogs, the raised plastic flooring was
mostly covered with fecal material. The fecal material was also caked in the square holes in the flooring in some
places. The amount of smeared fecal material made it difficult for the dogs to stay out of it. The licensee stated they
scrape out the enclosures daily, but only power wash about once or twice a week. There were also some walls thathad a brownish grime on them. Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly or often enough, increase the
risk of disease hazards for the dogs or puppies. Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the animals.
The licensee must ensure that enclosures are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least every 2 weeks or more often
if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt and grime and other disease hazards.
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste Removal
***The washdown area under the outside sheltered enclosures had a build-up of feces. The excessive amount of
feces in the washdowns caused odors and the drain holes were plugged with piles of feces. The build-up of dog
waste prevented the washdowns to function properly causing the waste to back up and drain into the yard next to
the kennels. Having waste close to the facility can attract pest and vermin that can harm the dogs. The licensee
must provide for regular and frequent collection, removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes, debris, garbage,
water and other fluids and wastes in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. The waste disposal
system must dispose the waste far enough from the facility to prevent odors, diseases, pests or vermin near the
animals.
