2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Four bottles of euthanasia solution with expiration dates of May 2016 were identified during this inspection. Expired
drugs may lose their effectiveness and the use of expired drugs does not meet acceptable standards for adequate
veterinary care. The facility must use appropriate methods for all veterinary procedures including euthanasia. The
facility program for the identification of expired drug inventory should be reviewed.
The facility corrected this non-compliance during the inspection by identifying the bottles as expired and removing
from use.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with management.
