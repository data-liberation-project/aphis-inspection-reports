2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On November 7, 2014, "Kabibe", a 16 month old lowland gorilla, was killed when a hydraulic gate was accidentally
closed on her body.
Factors contributing to this accident were an apparent failure to adhere to the posted protocol regarding operation of
the controls for the gates, and an enclosure design which makes visually assessing the shifting of animals difficult
with only one person present, which was the case when the accident occurred.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
harm. The facility should immediately take steps to ensure that such incidents will not recur.
This was a focused inspection on the gorilla death incident.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
