3.31(a)(4)
SANITATION.
The licensee stated during the inspection that he disinfects the guinea pig enclosures using clorax, but does not use
a detergent. Lack of a proper sanitation program exposes the animals to potential disease hazards such as
bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks or as
necessary with proper agents to sufficiently disinfect all surfaces that the guinea pigs may come in contact. Proper
sanitation of primary enclosures is necessary to minimize the risks of disease to the animals housed therein.
Correct by ensuring a proper sanitation method is established and maintained.
