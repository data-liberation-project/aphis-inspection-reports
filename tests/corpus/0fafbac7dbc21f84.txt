2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of the inspection there was an alpaca that was down and appeared lethargic. The owner was treating for a
meningeal worm for 2 days without contacting the attending veterinarian. The attending veterinarian was unaware of the
animals condition and had not examined the animal. The animal's condition should have been communicated to the
veterinarian in a timely manner so that it may receive adequate veterinary care. The animal was later seen after the
inspection and treated for a thiamine deficiency per the veterinarian's guidance. There should be adequate care provided
to the animals and their health maintained by the employed attending veterinarian for the well-being of the animals.
Correct immediately.
3.75(c)(1)

them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled to promote cleanliness and prevent
disease. Correct by August 8, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
