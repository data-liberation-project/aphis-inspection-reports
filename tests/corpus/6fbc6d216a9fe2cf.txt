3.81(a)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The environmental enhancement plan needs to be updated to reflect the current status of all non-human primates.
Currently there are 6 singly housed non-human primates at the facility. One of these primates, the patas, proved
incompatible with other patas at his former facility, so due to safety considerations, no attempts have been made to
pair house him at this facility. Although an attempt was made at one time to co-house the spider monkey and the
capuchin, no recent attempts have been made to find companions for these two, or to try again to house them
together. Although there are 2 rhesus and one pigtail macaque each individually housed, there have been no
recent attempts to work toward socially housing any of these macaques with each other or with the currently pair
housed rhesus macaques. Although non-socially raised non-human primates may not be able to be compatible
with others of their own species, efforts need to be made to try and provide for the social needs of species known to
exist in social groups. To be corrected by 7-16-15.
3.81(b)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Although the environmental enhancement plan describes structural and object enrichments to be provided each
non-human primate, many of these items are no longer present in many of the enclosures nor are they available in
the enrichment storage building. Examples of items not seen in the enclosures but stated in the program include
foraging and activity boards, straw, burlap bags, magazines, wind chimes, multiple perches, climbing tube, large
plastic toys, and cargo nets. Although some enclosures have more structural items than others, several have a
minimum of structural items, or none of the items described in the enrichment plan. Some enclosures have items
which are no longer used as structure rotation is not being done. Although the primary caretaker is providing some
other enrichment items, primarily food, overall more enrichment needs to be provided to promote species typical
behaviors. To be corrected by 5-16-15.
3.81(c)(1)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Because the two snow macaques are a breeding pair and had offspring each of the last two years, the enrichment
program needs to describe how these infants are to be handled. The infants are not being kept but are removedfrom their parents. The program needs to describe how and why this is done. To be corrected by 5-16-15.
3.81(c)(2)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Although the enclosure for the patas monkey was increased in size and complexity by opening the doors to the two
adjacent enclosures, this non-human primate is still showing excessive pacing and agitated behavior. There are no
elevated perches in the outdoor areas and during this inspection, no toys or foraging items. Because this
non-human primate is singly housed and exhibiting agitated behavior, special attention needs to be made to provide
him additional enrichment and to promote species typical behavior. To be corrected by 5-16-15.
3.84(b)(3)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the enclosure with that contain two rhesus macaques several of the 2(cid:29) X 6(cid:29) boards are green with algae. A few
boards and fire hoses in other enclosures are also turning green. It is important to sanitize all surfaces to prevent
potential disease. All hard surfaces of primary enclosures need to be cleaned and sanitized to remove organic
material. To be corrected by 5-15-15.
This is a focused on the primates.
