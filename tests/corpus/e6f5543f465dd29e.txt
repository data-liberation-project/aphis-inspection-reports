2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One adult goat was observed on inspection with bilateral ocular discharge with noticeable crusting along the inner eyes.
In addition, one sheep in an adjacent enclosure was squinting its left eye. While both animals presented bright and alert
and the attending veterinarian would now be contacted, neither animal’s condition had been noticed by the applicant until
it was brought to their attention during the inspection.
Failure to appropriately identify and treat diseases can lead to prolonged suffering, infection, pain, and other veterinary
care problems. In addition, failure to observe all animals daily can result in deterioration of the animal's health.
Daily observations of all animals shall be done to assess their health and well-being. Timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being noted during daily observations must be communicated to the
attending veterinarian so that appropriate veterinary care can be provided.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The facility did not have complete disposition records for two alpacas. The complete name, address, and remaining
required information was not available upon review of records.
Records containing the required information for animals acquired or dispositioned for use in regulated activities, including


those offspring born on premise, are necessary to accurately track animals being used to ensure their humane care and
use. The applicant shall make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition of all animals that fully and correctly discloses
the required information.
3.127(c)

Facilities, outdoor.
The outdoor enclosure housing one camel and one goat was excessively soiled and muddy. Although the recent
occurrence of rainfall increased the amount of water exposure for this enclosure, there were no dry areas available for
any of the animals to stand within the entire outdoor enclosure.

Animals that do not have access to any dry ground can result in discomfort or adverse health conditions, especially during
inclement weather. Animals kept outdoors shall be afforded protection and preventative measures from discomfort of local
climatic conditions, as well as dry ground to avoid prolonged exposure in the elements.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by February 3, 2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
