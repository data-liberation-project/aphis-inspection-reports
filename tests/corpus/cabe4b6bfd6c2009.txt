2.31(c)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC meeting held on Nov 30, 2015 had 5 of 12 members present. Five of 12 members does not constitute a
quorum therefore this is not considered an official IACUC meeting. The Nov meeting was the only IACUC meeting
held within a six month period. Since the Nov meeting is not considered an official meeting the facility did not meet
the requirement for an official IACUC meeting at least once every six months.
The facility needs to ensure that at least one IACUC meeting consisting of a quorum occurs every six months.
To be corrected immediately.
