OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Bedding.
Three shelters in the outdoor enclosures, housing 1 Corgi each, did not contain sufficient bedding material for the
temperature at the time of the inspection, which was 24F degrees. The bedding material was hay and straw but
was very sparse on the floor, with portions of the floor exposed. The owner stated that he had placed fresh bedding
material in the shelters several days before and that the dogs kicked it out. During the previous 5 days,
temperatures at night have been less than 20F degrees and daytime temperatures have been less than 50F
degrees. Lack of sufficient bedding in cold environments increases the risks of sickness and hypothermia situations.
Sufficient clean dry bedding material is necessary to provide protection when the temperature is less than 50F
degrees. More bedding material is necessary when the temperature is less than 35F degrees for the dogs to
burrow into and remain clean and dry and have better protection from the cold. The owner must provide more
bedding for the dogs and maintain it at sufficient levels any time the temperature is less than 50F degrees and
additional bedding must be added when the temperature is less than 35F degrees.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: ON 26 FEBRUARY 2015, licensee was verbally instructed to provide more bedding
before the end of the day and to maintain sufficient bedding when the temperatures are less than 50F.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Pest control
***There are numerous mice droppings noted inside the building on top of a stack of transportation crates and along
the floor between items under the enclosures. This indicates the presence of mice that can carry diseases to the
dogs and contaminate food and the environment. The owner must thoroughly clean the area and establish an
effective pest control program.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: 27 FEBRUARY 2015.
