2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
**While reviewing the current animal inventory it was noted that an 8 week old Canadian Lynx had been acquired on
July 1, 2013 however there was no record of the acquisition available for review. Records should be maintained
when animals are purchased and/or acquired that fully disclose where the animal(s) come from. Failure to have
complete records does not allow for proper tracking of animals. Complete and accurate records must be
maintained in order to meet with the requirements of this regulation.
