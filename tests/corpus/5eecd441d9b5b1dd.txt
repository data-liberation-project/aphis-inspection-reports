ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:40 am to
11:10 am on 11-JUN-19. Attempts to make contact with the licensee were done by knocking on the door, honking
the GOV's horn, waiting in front of the facility for 30 minutes and calling the licensee's phone number and leaving a
message.
