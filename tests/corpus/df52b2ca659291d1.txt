2.50(a)(2)

Time and method of identification.
Approximately 28 weaned puppies less than 16 weeks of age are not maintained in distinct litters, but are co-mingled
together in 3 separate enclosures. The puppies do not have any form of official identification. Failure to provide official
identification interferes with the ability of APHIS officials to identify dogs and trace their movements.

Live puppies, less than 16 weeks of age, shall be identified by either an official tag, legible tattoo marking approved by the
Administrator, a plastic-type collar containing the required information, a microchip, or by a cage card as long as the
puppies are maintained in a distinct litter and reside at the facility which they were born. The licensee must apply an
official form of identification to each of the puppies and the licensee must also ensure that all dogs at the facility have an
official form of identification at all times.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Approximately 25 weaned puppies less than 16 weeks of age are not kept in distinct litters but are co-mingled together in
three separate enclosures. These puppies are not recorded on APHIS form 7005 (Record of Acquisition of Dogs and

Cats on Hand). Failure to maintain records of all animals at the facility interferes with the ability of APHIS officials to
identify dogs and trace their movements.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the required information
for all dogs acquired, owned, held, controlled, transported, euthanized, sold or otherwise disposed of. The licensee must
input the required information for each of these puppies onto APHIS form 7005. The licensee must ensure that all dogs
are properly documented at all times.

Housing facilities, general.
The facility uses wood shavings in the enclosures to absorb waste from the dogs. One open bag of shavings is sitting on
the floor in a corner of the kennel. Open bags of shavings are at risk of contamination from pests such as flies or mice.

All open supplies of food and bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination
and spoilage. The licensee must place the open bag of wood shavings into a leakproof container with a tightly fitted lid in
order to protect it from potential contamination. The licensee must ensure all open supplies of food and bedding are
properly stored at all times.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.

The facility uses a plastic scoop to place dog food from the food container into the metal self-feeders. Approximately one-
third of the interior surface of this plastic scoop is coated in a thick buildup of a brown organic material. The facility
representative stated that the scoop was previously used to feed horses and the buildup came from an additive applied to
the horse feed. A buildup of organic material on the scoop could cause contamination of the dog feed and increase the
risk of disease hazards.

Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and
more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The
licensee must clean and sanitize the plastic scoop in order to remove the buildup of material and to eliminate the risk of
food contamination. The licensee must ensure all food receptacles are free of a buildup of potential disease hazards at all
times in order to support the health of the animals.

3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee's Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is incomplete. The following sections state:

Ectoparasites: every 2 weeks
Blood parasites: monthly
Intestinal parasites: bi-monthly

Each of these sections is missing the name and dosage of the products that are to be used and the PVC does not

accurately reflect how often adult dogs and puppies receive the treatments. The facility representative stated that the
ectoparasite treatment is not given year round, but only during the warm months and the intestinal parasite treatment for
puppies might be given at intervals other than bi-monthly. The plan to sample for heartworm and intestinal parasites is
also missing from the document. A complete Program of Veterinary Care is necessary for APHIS officials to determine
the dogs are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Each dealer must follow an appropriate program of veterinary dare for dogs that is developed, documented in writing, and
signed by the attending veterinarian. The missing information must be added to the Program of Veterinary Care and the
licensee must ensure that the Program of Veterinary Care contains all the required information at all times.
