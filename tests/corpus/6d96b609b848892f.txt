ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 300pm on
06-Mar-17.
I went to both the site where the regulated animal is kept, and the home of the licensee and was unable to make
any contact. I tried calling the 4 phone numbers I had for both the licensee and her son, however all lines were
disconnected. I have been unable to contact anyone at this facility by phone or in person.
