INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The last time the IACUC inspected the animal facility was 27 May 2015. In order to fulfill the requirements of the
AWA the IACUC must inspect all of the research facility's animal facilities, including animal study areas at least
once every six months. The IACUC should have conducted a facility inspection in November 2015. Inspections of
the animal areas in the facility ensures the safety and appropriateness of the animal enclosures and other animal
equipment and ensures that the overall facility complies with the Animal Welfare Act. The IACUC must complete an
inspection of the research facility's animal facilities at least once every six months.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC did not conduct appropriate reviews of the animal activities for Surgery protocol VT-011-14 to ensure
that the veterinarians are following the approved protocols. The animal use activity involved surgery and anesthesia
procedures for dogs and cats.
The protocol states:

A male DSH cat underwent an orchiectomy (neuter) for teaching purposes on 11/02/2015. His anesthesia record
indicated he received Ketamine at a concentration of 100 mg/ml and a dose of 78 mg IM and Xylazine at a
concentration of 100 mg/ml and a dose of 8.6 mg IM. There are no records of any other medication being
administered. The protocol directs for the use of Buprenorphine for post-operative pain management for cats. Also,
Xylazine is not listed as approved for use in cats in the protocol.

A female DSH cat underwent an ovariohysterectomy (spay) for teaching purposes on 11/02/2015. Her anesthesia
record indicated she received Xylazine at a dose of 2.2 mg/kg IM and Ketamine at 20mg/kg IM. There are no
records of any other medication being administered. The protocol directs for the use of Buprenorphine for
post-operative pain management for cats. Also, Xylazine is not listed as approved for use in cats in the protocol.

A male dog underwent an orchiectomy (neuter) for teaching purposes on 12/17/2015. His anesthesia record
indicated he received Acepromazine preoperatively at a dose of 0.02 mg IV. There are no records of any other
preoperative medication being administered. Acepromazine is not listed in the protocol as approved for use in dogs
and there are no records of preoperative pain medication being administered. The protocol was not followed for
induction medications and postop pain management.

A male dog underwent an orchiectomy (neuter) for teaching purposes on 12/17/2015. His anesthesia recordindicated he received Acepromazine preoperatively at a dose of 15 mg orally and 3 mg of Acepromazine IM. There
are records indicating Propofol 197 mg IV was used as well as Carprofen 50 mg PO BID 5 days and Tramadol 100
mg PO BID for 3 days. Acepromazine and Tramadol are not listed in the protocol as approved for use in dogs.

The animals approved for use in this protocol involves the potential for pain and distress for which the Principal
Investigator (PI) has provided criteria for relief through medication. These animals used for teaching purposes did
not receive pain medication outlined in the protocol that was approved by the IACUC.
The IACUC shall conduct continuing reviews of activities covered by this subchapter at appropriate intervals as
determined by the IACUC, but not less than annually to ensure that all animal activities are being conducted as
approved.

2.33(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The Euthanasia Policy and Procedure does not give the Attending Veterinarian appropriate authority to ensure the
provision of adequate veterinary care. Rather than provide the AV with access to the requested correct medications
for humane euthanasia for animals, the policy of the facility requires that if an animal is in a life threatening situation
while undergoing a procedure, the staff must call the owner to come pick up the animal and transport it to another
hospital facility. If the owner cannot be contacted then the staff must transport the animal to the nearest veterinary
hospital which is 10 minutes away. When the Interim Executive Director was asked about the veterinarian's
authority by the inspector the Interim Executive Director stated that she could tell a veterinarian what they could and
could not do while on her campus. The Animal Welfare Act clearly states that the attending veterinarian has
appropriate authority and provisions for adequate veterinary care. Failure to allow the AV authority to provide
adequate veterinary care can result in an animal that does not receive needed medical care. In this case, it would
delay the time until humane euthanasia could be provided to an animal that is in pain or is otherwise suffering. The
research facility must assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the adequate
provision of veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.
To be corrected by 30 May 2016
2.33(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The following medication stored in the current drug storage area was past the expiration date:
Previcox 227 mg tablets that expired 07-2015.
This medication was intermingled with other pharmaceuticals that are currently being used in the facility and aretherefore ready for use.
Use of expired medication is not an appropriate method to prevent, control, and treat diseases or injuries since the
expected results cannot be guaranteed and the animals may experience pain and distress due to
mistreatment, unrelieved symptoms, or due to unexpected side effects.
The licensee disposed of the expired medication during the inspection. The licensee must ensure that all
medications used in the facility are not expired and labeled properly in accordance with standard veterinary
practices and manufacturer's recommendations.
2.33(b) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The facility does not employ a full-time veterinarian and there was no written program of veterinary care available at
the time of inspection. The last full time employed attending veterinarian left the facility in September 2015. Several
part time veterinarians have been used by the facility since that time, however no formal agreements or written
program of veterinary care were completed. A written program of veterinary care is required for facilities which do
not employ a full-time veterinarian. On 22 March 2016 a letter appointing an attending veterinarian to the IACUC
committee was drafted. The attending veterinarian oversees all aspects of medical and husbandry care of the
animals at the facility and provides required guidance to the IACUC while approving activities using animals. There
must be a written program of veterinary care giving the attending veterinarian direct or delegated authority and who
is a voting member of the IACUC. The attending veterinarian must have delegated program responsibility for
activities involving animals at the facility. The IACUC, in coordination with the attending veterinarian, must provide
more specific information on the type of products used at the facility and the frequency of use. This is not
considered to be adequate veterinary care when information on how the licensee provides veterinary care for all
animals have not been recorded. The licensee must ensure that the program of veterinary care is updated with
current preventive practices to ensure that all animals are provided adequate veterinary care. The program of
veterinary care must be made available for review during inspections to ensure adequate veterinary care is being
provided.
2.35(a)(3)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
The IACUC utilized a checklist and conducted a semiannual facility review on 27 May 2015. Minor deficiencies were
noted. The deficiencies consisted of no light over the surgery prep table and a need for light in the surgery room. No report was generated by the IACUC to appropriately document this facility review. This report informs the
Institional Official, who is ultimately responsible for the appropriate care and use of animals in regulated activities at
the institution, of deficiencies and non-compliances in the facility. The report must be generated, signed by the
majority of the IACUC committee, include any minority views and be submitted to the Institutional Officer. The
reports must distinguish significant deficiencies from minor deficiencies. If program or facility deficiencies are noted,
a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency is required in order to ensure
that all deficiencies are addressed in a timely manner to protect the health and well-being of the animals. The
IACUC must ensure that all future facility and program review reports contain a specific plan and schedule with
dates for correcting each deficiency identified and this report must be submitted to the Institutional Officer in a timely
manner.
