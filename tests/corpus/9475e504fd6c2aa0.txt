CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
At time of inspection, there were two shipments present in the cargo terminal of Lufthansa Airlines at LAX, Both
arrived on Swiss International Airlines Flight# LX040 / 31. All puppies in both shipments were French Bulldogs.
-Shipment #1 consisted of 6 puppies in three crates, originating in Budapest and connecting in Zurich, waybill #724
BUD 1989903.
-Shipment #2 consisted of 22 puppies in 11 crates, originating in Vienna and connecting in Zurich, waybill# 724 VIE
15679381.
Both shipments failed to have consignor certifications with complete information regarding feed and water
instructions. Consignor certifications are required to ensure that animals in transit, especially young animals, are
adequately fed and watered before and during transport.
Shipment #1: Label on crate stated (cid:28)Last feed and water: 30.01.2014 11.00 A.M. Pls feed and water at transit
point(cid:29). An additional label stated (cid:28)ZRH datum/time 31.01 2014 / 10:30 Water Food(cid:29). These labels did not
contain the consignor(cid:25)s signature with date and time, and specific instructions for the next feeding(s) and
watering(s) for a 24-hour period, as required.
Shipment #2: There was no label indicating time last fed and watered before shipping; no feeding instructions; and
no signature of consignor with date and time as required. It is not possible to determine if puppies were fed and
watered within 4 hours before being transported in commerce. A label was present stating (cid:28)ZRH datum/time 31.01
2014 / 10:30 Water Food(cid:29). As no food was attached to the crates, it is not known if the puppies were both
fed and watered at the time indicated.
3.14(a)(6)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
Shipment #2: Labels affixed to the top of the crates had (cid:28)Live Animal(cid:29) labels with lettering ½ inch high, not the 1 inch
high required. Labeling of sufficient size is necessary to ensure crates can be quickly identified as containing liveanimals.
3.15(h) DIRECT
PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
Shipment #2: 9 of 11 crates had been sprayed with a black oily substance, splattered along sides and tops,
including areas with ventilation openings into the crates. There was no such material on the pallet the crates arrived
on, and the oily material did not dry during the 2.5 hours of inspection. The pattern of the substance on the crates
makes it clear it would have entered the crates, and could have contaminated the puppies in them. Live dogs may
not be transported with any material or substance that may reasonably be expected to harm the dogs or cause
inhumane conditions. An unknown oily substance that could have been ingested, or interfered with the ability to
conserve body heat if in contact with the puppies, has the potential to cause harm to the puppies in the crates.
3.16(a)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
Shipment #2: Puppies and kittens less than 16 weeks of age must be offered food at least once every 12 hours.
Each dog and cat must be offered potable water at least once every 12 hours. These time periods apply to carriers
and intermediate handlers starting from the date and time stated on the certificate provided under Sec. 3.13(c) of
this subpart. Each dog and cat must be offered food and potable water within 4 hours before being transported in
commerce. The absence of a consignor certificate and feeding instructions, and the lack of food attached to the
crates, makes it impossible for the carrier to determine if this requirement has been met. Lack of food and water
could lead to serious health consequences for young puppies.
3.19(b)
HANDLING.
Shipments 1 & 2: Crates of puppies were transported on top of a pallet containing cardboard boxes of garments,
wrapped in plastic, with crates on top of plastic, and netted to the pallet. Several crates were tilted, including one at
a sharp enough slant that puppies would have been forced to a lower edge. Other crates were unbalanced and
unsteady. Conditions such as these, especially on a long international flight, could cause distress to the puppies in
the crates. Any shifting of the cargo below the crates could result in injury to the animals. Handling must use care to
avoid distress or harm to the animals being transported.
