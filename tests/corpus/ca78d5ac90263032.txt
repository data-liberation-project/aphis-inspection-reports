2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:30 pm on
24-FEB-20. I attempted to contact the licensee by phone and by honking the horn after arriving at the facility. The
licensee's husband came out to the property gate and informed me that the licensee was gone and he didn't know
when she would return. I waited for the licensee to return my call for thirty minutes without without success.
A responsible person shall be available to accompany inspection during business hours.
