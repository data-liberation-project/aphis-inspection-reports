2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
A current record of guinea pigs on hand was not available for review. A total of 654 guinea pigs including adults,
weanlings, and newborns were counted during this inspection. There were no inventory records present indicating the
number of adults, weanlings, and newborns held or on hand or the number of guinea pig that died in the last few months.
Failure to keep inventory records including births and deaths makes it difficult to track changes in production, losses due
to death, and to assess the animal care program. Licensee must ensure that records are kept and maintained on guinea
pig held, owned, including births and deaths to help keep track of animals, document changes in ownership, and to help
assess the animal care program. Correct by February 14, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
