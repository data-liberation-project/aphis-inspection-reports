3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Non-compliant item previous identified from the last inspection that still has allotted time for correction.
* The concrete flooring for four outdoor enclosures, housing seven adult dogs, has a rough surface. There are
cracks in the concrete approximately 1 foot to 3 foot long and ¼ inch to ½ inch wide. The worn concrete surfaces
and cracks do not allow for proper cleaning and sanitation. The moist fluid waste on the surface indicates the
concrete is not properly sealed. Concrete surfaces that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized can increase the
disease potential. The concrete surface is in need of treatment and repair. All surfaces must be maintained on a
regular basis. This will allow for proper cleaning and sanitization. Thus, the disease potential is reduced for the
dogs.
To be corrected by, 20-August-2014.
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
This inspection report will be sent both regular and certified mail.
