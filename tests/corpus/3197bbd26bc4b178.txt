3.3(e)(1)(iii)

Sheltered housing facilities.
Two adult dogs and 5 puppies are being housed in a converted workshop with cement floors and unfinished walls. The
walls are made of a rough chipboard from the floor to ceiling. The chipboard is not painted, stained, or otherwise sealed
so it is not impervious to moisture. Enclosures that are not impervious to moisture cannot be adequately sanitized and can
harbor disease. Correct by October 8, 2022 but ensuring that all areas the animals come into contact with, are impervious
to moisture.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
