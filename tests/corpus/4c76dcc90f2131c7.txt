2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care dated 7-24-15 is still the most current version. No changes have been made
since the last inspection. The program is still incomplete lacking information in many areas. There is no information
regarding dosages and frequency of administration of any drugs for the control of internal, blood and external
parasites and vaccines. There is simply a statement that the veterinarian does not administer these drugs.
Conversations with staff and the owner show that the animals are currently being dewormed orally and treated with
fly spray. The section in the PC regarding capture methods states that rompum and ace are to be used but does not
state who will be administering these drugs and if the facility staff is to do so what dosages they should use for the
different species. There is nothing written regarding any TB testing of susceptible species to include some of the
hoofstock and the non-human primates.
The facility and the attending veterinarian need to jointly decide on all preventative veterinary procedures, drugs and
vaccines to be administered to the animals even if they are going to be administered by the facility staff. The
instructions for these procedures, drugs and vaccines should be detailed in written form and then the facility shall
ensure that they are followed. The facility shall document and maintain a written program of veterinary care
approved by the attending veterinarian to ensure the appropriate health care for the animals at the facility.
3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outside portion of the sheltered snow macaque housing has areas of excessive rust. The bottom corner nearest
the currently empty large enclosure composed of a solid sheet of metal has a rusty area approximately 1 ft x1 ft.
The rust has led to structural instability with the sheet metal no longer attached to the metal bar at the bottom. The
edge of the sheet metal is jagged and is loose. There is also rust, some pitted, of the bars forming the lower part of
the caging between the two macaque enclosures. The presence of excessive rust prevents the required cleaning
and sanitization and affects the structural strength of the surface. The macaques can also injury themselves on the
jagged loose metal surface. Correct by maintaining the surfaces such that they can be readily cleaned and sanitized
and such that they are structurally sound. Correct by 5/15/16. 3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following enclosures are not structurally sound and are in need of maintenance:
*The fencing of the water buffalo enclosure needs some repair. One section consists of wooden boards that are
leaning due to a loose post. The fence post is rotted.
*The fencing for the deer enclosure needs repair. One fence post is loose with separation between the metal parts
of the post leading to leaning of the fence.
Loss of structural integrity of fencing materials can lead to enclosures that are not sound allowing animals to escape
or other animals to enter and may lead to injury of the animals. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound
and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The enclosure currently housing the African Crested porcupine does not sufficiently provide protection from the
elements. The damaged pet taxi type crate with the damage to the top has been replaced but there are still
openings for ventilation on three sides and one side is completely open (where door usually is). The numerous
openings do not keep out the cold, wind and rain. Lack of adequate protection from the elements can lead to
discomfort and potential distress. Facility representative stated she has some extra tin roofing material she can use
to protect the area the crate is in but has not yet competed the project. The porcupine needs to be supplied with
shelter appropriate for the animal to afford it protection from and to prevent discomfort from inclement weather.
