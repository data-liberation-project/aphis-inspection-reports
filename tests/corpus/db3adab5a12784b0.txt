ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:40 pm on
30-Jul-18.
When I arrived at the facility at 3:40 pm, no one answered the door when I rang the doorbell. I called the facility
representative at 3:40 pm and again at 3:58 pm. The facility representative called me back at 4:15 pm, stating that
he was out of town and could not meet with me to do the inspection on this day.
