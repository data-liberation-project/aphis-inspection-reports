FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
This is a new site inspection as the licensee moved. At this new location, the licensee has built an outdoor area for
the animals to exercise consisting of a covered pen. A 6 foot perimeter fence is around 3 sides of this pen. On the
forth side the animal pen is placed directly against the back deck - not three feet away- and there is no fence barrier
under the deck next to the animal pen. The licensee needs to fence under the deck and have the exercise pen at
least 3 feet away from the perimeter fence or request a perimeter fence variance.
This is a pre-use site inspection for a new location.
No regulated activity allowed until above item is corrected and there are no other non-compliant items.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
