2.132(d) CRITICAL
PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
Section 2.132(d) Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals: The facility purchased two female Hartmann’s
mountain zebra on 6/06/16 from a person who does not hold a valid USDA license. Selling wild/exotic animals to an
exhibitor requires a valid USDA license. Facilities with a valid USDA license are required to comply with the Animal
Welfare Act regulations and standards to ensure the animals receive adequate care, including veterinary care,
husbandry and recordkeeping requirements. This facility was cited under this section in 2013 for leasing a reindeer
for a holiday exhibit from a person who did not have a valid USDA license. No exhibitor shall knowingly obtain any
dog, cat or other animals from any person who is required to be licensed, but who does not hold a valid, and
unsuspended license. Correct by only purchasing wild/exotic animals from people with a valid USDA license.
Correct from this day forward.
3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: A review of the prairie dog records during this inspection revealed that one
young prairie dog was eaten by a red-tailed hawk on 5/28/16. The prairie dog enclosure is an outdoor enclosure
that is open to the sky/not covered. After the incident no modifications were made to the prairie dog enclosure to
help ensure that red-tailed hawks or other birds of prey could not get into the enclosure to kill more prairie dogs.
Outdoor animal housing facilities must protect the animals from injury, including keeping known predators out of the
animal enclosures. Correct by modifying or changing the prairie dog enclosure to prevent animals from being killed
by birds of prey or other predators and by ensuring that all enclosures protect animals from injury. Correct by
November 18, 2016.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR. Section 3.127(c) Drainage: The water receptacle for the male elk is surrounded by standing water and mud.
Animals should not have to walk through water/mud to get to their water, food or shelter. Standing in water and
mud may cause hoof problems such as foot rot. The drainage must be improved to rapidly eliminate excess water
to prevent muddy conditions and to protect the health of the animal. Once the APHIS official identified the muddy
condition around the water receptacle, facility personnel moved the water receptacle. Corrected during the
inspection.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(d) Perimeter fence: A beverage service area by and inside the perimeter fence at the edge of the
bison enclosure has a wood bar that is about 37 inches high that is attached to the 8 foot high perimeter fence.
This 8 foot fence is part of the perimeter fence for the entire zoo. The wood bar attached to the perimeter fence
effectively reduces the height of the perimeter fence as it could be used by an animal as a platform to help get over
the additional 5 feet of the perimeter fence. The perimeter fence functions as a secondary containment system for
the animals in the facility and must be at least 8 feet in height for potentially dangerous animals. Correct by moving
the wood bar away from the perimeter fence so it may not be used as a platform for getting over the perimeter fence
by a lose animal. Correct by October 25, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility lead zoo keeper.
