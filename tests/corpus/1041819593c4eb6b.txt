3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are places in the large dog enclosures where the metal pipes have rusted. This rusting has left some pipe
joints unsecure and in other places the rust has resulted in jagged metal edges. Jagged edges may cause injury to
the dogs. The rusted joints may affect the structural strength of the pipes. All surfaces must be constructed in a
manner that are free of excessive rust that affects the structural strength of the materials or that results in jagged
edges. Correct by 25 July 2014.
