3.10
WATERING.
***The metal water receptacles in two primary enclosures, each containing one adult, male golden retriever, were
unable to be properly sanitized. Portions of the paint lining the interior surfaces of the two water buckets had worn
away, exposing rusted metal.
Rusted water receptacles are unable to be properly sanitized, which could increase risk of disease for the dogs.
Water receptacles provided for the dogs must be kept clean and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (b) of this
subpart.
