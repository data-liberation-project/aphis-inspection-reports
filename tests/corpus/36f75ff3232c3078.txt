2.75(a)(1)(3)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee purchased 5 breeding animals from 4 non licensed USDA persons without obtaining the vehicle
license number and state, and the driver's license number and state to record on the inventory of animals on hand.
This does not allow APHIS Officials to track animals as necessary. Ensure all required acquisition information for all
animals is obtained and recorded as required. Correct from this time forward.
Inspection conducted with the licensee and facility staff. Exit briefing conducted with the licensee, Veterinary
Medical Officer Dr. Debra Sime and Animal Care Inspector Kimberly Miller.
End of report.
