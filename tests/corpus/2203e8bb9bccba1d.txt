FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the middle exotic cat enclosure containing two cats, there is a 2 X 4 wire introduction cage with a den box in it.
The floor of this introduction cage is also uncovered 2 X 4 wire. In this same cage is a hanging panel of 2 X 4 wire
with an astroturf carpet placed over it. The astroturf has become unattached and blown back uncovering half of the
suspended wire platform. The cage floor wire and the hanging wire panel need to be removed or covered so the
cats will not have to walk on it, as this could be potentially hazardous.
In the first exotic cat enclosure containing three cats there is a loose support 2 X 4 board under the lean to shelter.
There is also a long screw sticking down from the ceiling. These items need to be repaired or replaced to maintain
the enclosure safely for the cats.
To be corrected by 5-9-16.
Exit briefing conducted with licensee.
