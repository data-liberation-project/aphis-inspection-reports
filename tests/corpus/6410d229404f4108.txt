2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The protocol that has been approved by the IACUC indicates approximately 100 rabbits will be used per year. In the
Fiscal Year 2015 Annual Report, 162 rabbits were reported in category C. In review of the records, 142 rabbits
were utilized during the renewal year of the protocol, and there is no documentation of an additional amendment or
IACUC approval for the increase in animal numbers.
Protocol changes of this type can have a significant impact on animal well-being and require approval by the IACUC
prior to being instituted. A system should be in place which would ensure that proposed significant changes to
activities involving the care and use of animals are reviewed and approved by the IACUC prior to their
implementation.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In several rabbit barns, uncovered light bulbs are hung over a portion of the rabbit enclosures, particularly over food
receptacles. In the event of breakage, rabbits could be injured by shattered glass. A system should be in place to
ensure light sources in animal facilities are maintained in a manner that doesn't pose a risk to the animals.
Indoor and outdoor housing facilities for rabbits shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair, to
protect the animals from injury, to contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals.
