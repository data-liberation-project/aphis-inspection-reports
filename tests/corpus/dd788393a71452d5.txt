2.131(c)(1)

Handling of animals.
The facility reports on 7/17/21 a visitor was bit by a prairie dog on a finger and the bite broke the skin. The licensee said
the the family was not forthcoming on how the person was able to get within reach of a prairie dog and I observed the
barrier doesn't permit an average-sized adult to get into reach of the prairie dogs.
The licensee has made plans to reconfigure the viewing area to prevent any type of reaching over the barrier. Sufficient
distance and barriers are necessary to prevent public contact with animals and to decrease the risk of harm to the public
and exhibited animals. For the safety of the animals and the public, ensure that adequate barriers and distances are in
place between exhibited animals and the general viewing public.

Correction: Ensure that corrective plans are completed to prevent further occurrences.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
