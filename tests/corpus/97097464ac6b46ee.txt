2.40(b)(3) Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Dog #0819 (M Yorkie DOB 11-22-19) had a loose upper tooth (L upper premolar) and both of the tooth roots could be
seen. Also, on its right upper cheek it had a small hairless area that when lightly touched first had some pus and then
clear red drainage. On its left upper cheek under the eye, it had a small area of matted hair and while looking at the loose
tooth, some red drainage was seen under the matted spot. After parting the hair, an open draining sore/wound with clear
red liquid and light bleeding was seen. The dog made no observable reactions when these areas were touched. These
problems, while difficult to see until up close to, had not been observed by the facility prior to inspection. While this dog
appeared bright and alert in inspection and per the facility has been eating, drinking and behaving normally, the loose
tooth and draining areas on the cheeks are problems that could worsen and make it sick if not treated per the attending
veterinarian's instructions. Ensure that close daily observations of all dogs are made so that health problems can be
communicated to the attending veterinarian right away.
***Note: The licensee called the attending veterinarian prior to the exit interview and is scheduled to see this dog on
1/31/2023. Ensure that the veterinarian does see this dog and follow the recommended treatment(s).

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee. End of report.
