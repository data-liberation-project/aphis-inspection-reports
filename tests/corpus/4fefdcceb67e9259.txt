2.126(b)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:15 A.M. on
27-Apr-17.The inspector knocked on the door and then called and left a message at the phone-number on file.
The inspector then waited 30 minutes in the driveway of the facility before leaving the premises.
Lack of availability for inspection inhibits the regulatory process. The licensee must ensure a knowledgeable,
responsible adult is available during regular hours to accompany inspection.
Correct from this time forward
