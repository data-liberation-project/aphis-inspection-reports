Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:40-3:15pm on 09-
NOV-2022. Upon arrival, no one answered the door in the kennel building and there didn't appear to be anyone on the
property. I called the licensee at 2:45pm and left a message. Unable to make contact with anyone, I left an Attempted
Inspection flyer in the kennel door with my contact information and left the facility at 3:15pm.
