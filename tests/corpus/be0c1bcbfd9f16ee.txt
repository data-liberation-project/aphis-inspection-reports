Sec. 3.78 0utdoor housing facilities. (d) Perimeter fence.
* A section of perimeter fence on the backside has been taken down. There was cattle paneling on the backside.
This paneling has large openings and is not 6 feet tall. This paneling could let in unauthorized humans and animals
to go through it or under allowing for unauthorized contact to the two primates. The primates housing facility must
have a perimeter fence that is 6 feet tall. The perimeter fence must be constructed so it protects the primates by
restricting unauthoraized humans and animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going through it or
under it. Therefore, preventing unwanted contact and protection that will be provided with the perimeter fence.
