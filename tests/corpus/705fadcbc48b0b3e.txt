HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The brown lemur enclosure had a a build up of feces and food waste/debris that needs to be clean more frequently
to prevent food contamination. The baboon's primary enclosure had old and fresh excreta that was attracting a large
amount of flies. The baboon's enclosure must be raked with sufficient frequency to ensure all animals the freedom
to avoid contact with excreta. Contaminated material needs to be removed daily to eliminate the potential for
disease, insects, pests or vermin infestation. The baboon's enclosure needs to be cleaned daily/often to satisfy the
generally accepted husbandry standards and practices for non-human primates.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The area and building housing the brown lemur is dirty and contains miscellaneous clutter, power tools, cleaning
chemicals, motor oil and motor vehicles stored in close proximity to the animal enclosure. To reduce disease
hazards, insects and pests the dirty floors and area near the lemur enclosure need to be thoroughly cleaned, and all
clutter and miscellaneous items need to be picked up and organized.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Excessive worn or damaged wooden surfaces are not been routinely repaired or replaced.
The wooden framework for the lock out enclosure in Diamond and Shakira’s enclosure is severely damaged
exposing nails and splintered edges. This may compromise the use of the lockout preventing normal maintenance
of the enclosure. A post attached to the shelter in the same enclosure is extremely worn and thin and its structural
strength in compromised.The shelter for the first enclosure on the left containing one tiger (middle/second section) is severely damaged and
broken on one side. A support post within the same enclosure is also worn.
The roof wood boards of a tiger's shelter house located at the second enclosure section is rotted, warped and
extremely damaged containing protruding/exposed screws that could potentially cause injury to the animals. All
wood structures at the facility must be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect animals
from injury. The damaged wood must be replaced or repaired and routinely maintained.
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several boxes of inedible food and vegetable wastes and trash were piled up in close proximity to the food storage
and preparation trailer. These boxes were observed to be attracting many flies in the area and could potentially
attract other vermin. To minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards to regulated animals, the facility
needs to make provision for the quick removal and disposal of animal/food wastes, trash and debris.
3.130
WATERING.
The water receptacle at the black leopard enclosure contained yellowish-greenish water and excessive algae
growth. To ensure the health and comfort of regulated animals, all water receptacles need to be cleaned and
should be kept clean and sanitary at all times.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Most primary enclosures at the facility had old and fresh excreta that were attracting large amount of flies. All
affected enclosures needs to be cleaned more often to reduce pest problems and to minimize disease hazards to
regulated animals.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The area around the big cat enclosures is excessively overgrown with tall grass and or weeds. The facility has
previously had problems with venomous snakes entering the animal enclosures. The excessive growth also covers
ditches and other hazards, including snakes, that cannot be clearly seen when inspecting the animal enclosures
and poses a hazard to USDA inspectors when trying to inspect the facility. Failure to adequately control tall grass
prevents adequate control of snakes which could result in injury or death to the animals. Tall grass or weeds mustbe adequately controlled to minimize hazards to the animals and to allow adequate access to the premises for
inspection.
The pools for the single housed black bear are dirty and must be cleaned. Bears generally utilize pools to meet
their physiological needs and the pools must be cleaned often enough to allow use of these pools.
The pools for the two juvenile tigers and Diamond are dirty and must be cleaned. Additionally, the dirty pool used
by the juvenile tigers was attracting an excessive amount of flies.

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
An excessive amount of flies was observed throughout the facility. The juvenile tiger enclosure was particularly
noted with swarms of loudly buzzing flies hovering the pool and on fecal matter deposits. The facility needs to
revamp its current pest control program and cleaning/housekeeping practices so that fly control is safe and
implemented effectively throughout the premises.

EMPLOYEES.
Several of the big cat enclosures have damaged and worn shelter structures, the areas around the big cat
enclosures are extremely overgrown with tall grass. Excreta is not being removed from animal enclosures often
enough to meet generally accepted husbandry practices and to reduce fly problems. The lack of facility compliance
indicates there are not enough employees present to maintain the required husbandry practices or maintain the
facility in good repair.
