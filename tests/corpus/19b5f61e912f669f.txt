2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:15 PM on
16-MAR-20.
Upon arrival at the facility, I called Mr. Wilbur's mobile phone number. Although Mr. Wilbur indicated he was
unavailable for the inspection, he provided the phone number for a family member who might be available. I called
and left a voice mail for the family member. After waiting for 60 minutes at the facility, I called the family member a
second time, and after no answer, I left a voice mail and then left the facility.
