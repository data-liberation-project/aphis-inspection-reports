FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On November 19th, 2015 a female red panda went missing and verified had escaped the zoo grounds at 2:30 P.M.
By 3:30 P.M. local law enforcement and animal control were informed of the escape and a press release was issued
at 5:00 P.M. on November 19th 2015. Media blasts and a flashing sign reading (cid:28)"Drive with caution-Panda in
area(cid:29)" resulted in a 911 call around 11 P.M. on November 21, 2015 from citizen reporting sighting of panda. Zoo
staff responded and found panda in small tree. A perimeter barrier was constructed around the tree and panda was
lured to ground with food where she was netted and kenneled. She was returned safe and sound to zoo quarantine
area after being gone for approximately two days. During the interim an in depth inspection of the enclosure did not
reveal an apparent path of escape. On closer inspection, myself and zoo staff found a Plexiglas wall at the viewing
area that was just over 4'(cid:25) tall and could have been the escape route for a determined panda. Although published
data indicate a slick surface of 4(cid:25)' is sufficient to contain red pandas this wall should be extended to at least 5'(cid:25) to
ensure containment. There should be regular inspection of all enclosures to make sure they are properly
constructed to contain the species they house.

Note:
The female red panda that escaped on 19th November had been exhibiting dispersing behavior. Zoo staff had
contacted the appropriate SSP with this information and had received a mandatory recommendation to transfer her
to new surroundings at the Knoxville Zoo. The zoo staff was awaiting pre-shipment requirements form Knoxville
Zoo when the escape occurred. All exams and pre-ship test have now been done and transfer to Knoxville Zoo is
scheduled for early January 2016.
