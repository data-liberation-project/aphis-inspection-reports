2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has an attending veterinarian and a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC), however, the written
PVC does not accurately reflect the current ectoparasite control program at the facility. The most recent PVC
dated 9/2015 states under the (cid:24)ectoparasites(cid:25) section that (cid:28)animals are inspected daily and treated as needed. Can
be
dipped with amitraz or permethrin or pyrethrin as often as every 2-3 weeks according to package direction(cid:29).
However,
when asked what he uses for ectoparasite control, the licensee stated that he is presently using (cid:28)Ivomec down the
backs(cid:29), which is not included on the written program. The licensee must consult with the attending veterinarian and
develop a complete and accurate written program of veterinary care that reflects the practices at this facility. The
written program of veterinary care will ensure that there is accurate communication between the licensee and the
attending veterinarian and ensure that all routine medications and vaccines provided to the animals by the licensee
are
done with the direction and knowledge of the attending veterinarian.

2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a male merle Cocker Spaniel (#000016701496) that was observed scratching at its left side. Upon
closer
observation of the dog, the left ear flap had an approximately 1 ¼ inch long fluid-filled-like mass noted near the ear
canal. A slight yeast-like odor was noted; the inside of the ear canal was not well visualized. The left eye also had
a
small amount of thick green discharge that had accumulated at the bottom of the eye. Brown-green crusty material
was mostly present in/near the corner of the left eye and in the fur under the eye. According to the licensee, he was
unaware of the dog's condition and had not consulted with a veterinarian. This dog(cid:25)s condition could be due to
injury, infection, parasites and/or a variety of other veterinary medical conditions which may be uncomfortable for the dog.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate
diagnosis
is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document this
information
and make it available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate
veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Cleaning and Sanitization
Inside the indoor whelping facility the expanded metal flooring, with diamond shaped openings, and some of the
PVC
support pipes have an accumulation of hair, dirt, and grime built up on them and hanging from the underneath side.
Also inside of the whelping building there were three plastic type whelping boxes that have been chewed which has
created pitted areas. There is an accumulation of dirt and grime built up in the chewed and pitted areas.
This affects 7 dogs and 7 puppies.
The accumulation of the hair, dirt, and grime on the underneath side of the flooring and the embedded grime in the
chewed areas on the whelping boxes does not allow for proper sanitization to occur. The licensee must remove the
hanging hair, dirt and grime from the underneath side of the metal flooring and must smooth the chewed areas on
the
whelping boxes or replace the whelping boxes and clean and sanitize these areas. The licensee must ensure that
hard surfaces with which the dogs come into contact with are spot cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every
two
weeks or more often if necessary. All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when
necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.
