ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A written program of veterinary care was not available for review at the time of inspection. There was no
documentation available to indicate that the veterinarian had inspected the facilities in the past year.
Although the dogs appeared to be currently in good health, not having a veterinarian examine the animals at least
once a year can put the dog at risk of disease not being diagnosed and treated.
It is vital to maintain a current program of veterinary care to ensure that adequate veterinary care is being given to
the animals.
Contact the veterinarian and schedule an inspection and obtain a written program of veterinary care.
The program should include guidance on all medications and vaccines to be given as well as guidance on wound
care, birthing concerns, oral care and other aspects of routine health care.
Contact the veterinarian by Close of Business August 4, 2015.
Obtain a written program of veterinary care by August 21, 2015.
Maintain records as needed to show compliance with the guidance provided by the veterinarian.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The front door of the kennel was propped open to allow a cross breeze. The open door however allows flies and
other biting insects to enter the building. There were a large number of flies observed inside the kennel. Flies can
bite and spread disease and are a source of nuisance and discomfort for the dogs.
Provide adequate pest control by closing the door or provide screening to eliminate the pests inside the building.
