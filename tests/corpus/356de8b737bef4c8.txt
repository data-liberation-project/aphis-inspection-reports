INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol OCVT19-24 involving pigs includes laparoscopic and thoracoscopic procedures in the course objectives
section of the protocol, but there are not complete descriptions of these procedures in the protocol. A complete
description of proposed activities is necessary for an adequate understanding by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC) members in order for them to assure the humane care and use of the animals. In order for
the IACUC to approve a protocol, it must contain a complete description of the proposed use of the animals.
