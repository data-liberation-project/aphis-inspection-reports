2.31(d)(1)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
**The principal investigator for several protocols (Vet 212-1, 212-2, 212-3, 212-4) had not provided a written
narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine alternatives since May 2004. Protocols that
involve activities with the potential for painful and/or distressful procedures should include a current written narrative
description of the methods and sources utilized in determining alternatives. It is the responsibility of the IACUC to
ensure the principal investigator has provided a current written narrative of alternatives to potentially painful and
distressful procedures as required by the Animal Welfare Act.
