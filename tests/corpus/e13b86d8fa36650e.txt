2.40(b)(4) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Inadequate guidance had been given to personnel regarding different handling techniques to include distraction, shift
gates, tranquilization, and euthanasia.
Issues became apparent during a deer handling incident that ended in the animal’s death by gunshot. One issue was the
lack of guidance to ensure that all animal personnel were aware of the location of the different animals and in what
pastures. Both the seasonal employee and park superintendent indicated that they were unaware of the location and
number of animals in the “big pen.” Not identifying the location of all animals led to a preventable confrontation with the
three-year old buck. Another issue was the improper handling by the park superintendent demonstrated by further
wrestling with the already stressed deer instead of using alternative methods such as distractions, physical barriers, or the
use of tranquilizers. The Program of Veterinary Care lists the word “gunshot,” but does not give any guidance to the
qualifications of the person(s) performing the gunshot, the type of weapon, caliber of bullet, or shot placement. Nor does it
indicate the type of situation that would warrant death by gunshot.
The absence of guidance to personnel involved in the care and use of animals regarding handling, tranquilization, and
euthanasia in this emergency put both the deer and the employee in unnecessary danger.

The licensee must ensure that appropriate guidance and instruction are developed and implemented with the attending

veterinarian’s input. This guidance must reference the handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, and tranquilization
of animals present. Euthanasia guidance should also encompass communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure
necropsy, tag removal, and carcass disposal guidelines are followed, if needed. This guidance and instruction are
required for the prevention of injury and unnecessary death, and to provide adequate veterinary care.

Handling of animals.
Inappropriate handing of a three-year-old whitetail buck resulted in undue stress to the animal and ultimate death by
gunshot.
In the early morning hours on September 8, 2021, a new seasonal employee on his first day by himself, drove through
both the southeast perimeter and enclosure gates of the “big pen” as a short cut to the feed barn, as opposed to using the
public paved road to access the feed barn. This “big pen” was occupied by a sexually intact three-year old whitetail buck
“Johnny,” a yearling buck, and a doe, all of them hand-raised orphans. The employee got out of his truck to open the
north end gate, who said he was unaware of the location of “Johnny.” When he got out of the truck, “Johnny” butted the
employee, managing to gore him in the leg, resulting in an ongoing physical struggle with the employee trying to redirect
the buck’s antlers. Police were summoned by a park attendee, and police dispatch notified the park superintendent.
Seeing the attack occurring upon his arrival, the park superintendent entered the pen on foot without any equipment. He
physically grabbed the buck by the antlers, attempting to restrain the deer to allow the employee to get off the ground.
The stressed deer reacted by struggling with and injuring the park superintendent. The employee re-entered the physical
struggle by grabbing the buck’s antlers and head, along with the superintendent. They were both struggling to hold onto
the buck’s antlers and head when the police officer arrived. The park superintendent then requested that the police officer

shoot the deer to prevent further injury to themselves. The officer shot the deer in the “heart area,” as there was no clear
head shot due to the position of the men. Per the police report, the deer broke free, ran approximately fifteen yards,
collapsed, and finally died.
Improper handling of the three-year-old whitetail buck “Johnny” resulted in undue behavioral stress, unnecessary
discomfort, and the ultimate traumatic death of the animal without producing a rapid unconsciousness devoid of evidence
of pain or distress.
The licensee must develop and implement protocols and safety measures with the attending veterinarian’s input to handle
all animals as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive
cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, unnecessary discomfort, or death.

Employees.
Adequately trained and sufficient numbers of caretakers are unavailable to maintain professionally acceptable levels of
husbandry necessary for the animals.
At the time of inspection there was currently only one full time caretaker who appears to be adequately trained and
knowledgeable in the care of the regulated species present at the zoo. Seasonal employees with minimal training are
used for the only full-time caretaker’s vacation or sick days, with the most recent trainee having only two weeks of training
to include only two hands-on feeding experiences. Additionally, there are no known documented or established training
methods to ensure employees receive consistent information regarding husbandry practices including, but not limited to:
nutrition, feeding schedules, pasture movement, or animal behavior issues such as: rut season, sparring, aggression,
heat cycling, gestation, birthing etc. that could impact the safety of the employees, animals, and the public. In addition, the

current supervisor who is the park superintendent oversees all aspects of the park and has no specific animal care
background or training.
Having a lack of adequately trained employees, and a supervisor (park superintendent) with no specific animal care
background or training resulted in significant injuries to one employee, injuries to the park superintendent, and the undue
stress and ultimate traumatic death of the three-year-old whitetail buck, “Johnny.”
The licensee must ensure that there are enough adequately trained employees to maintain the professionally acceptable
level of husbandry practices set forth in this subpart for the species on site and supervised by someone who has a
background in animal care. This is essential to protect the health and well-being of the animals, as well as the safety of
the employees and the members of the public.
