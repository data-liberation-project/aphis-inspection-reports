INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Based on the large number of IACUC related and facility non-compliances on this inspection report including repeat
non-compliances and based on conversations with IACUC members there is a lack of adequate training of IACUC
members. There are no documentation records regarding IACUC member training in the IACUC records office
available for review. There are no IACUC approved policies or SOPs for training of new and current personnel. CITI
training is apparently available but not up to date. The facility must ensure that IACUC members are qualified
through experience and training to be able to fully assess the facility's animal program, facilities and procedures to
include program review, facility inspections, protocol review and all other IACUC functions. The facility shall ensure
that all IACUC members are qualified by experience, expertise and training and maintain documentation of such.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The semi-annual report to the Institutional Official dated Nov. 30, 2015 is not complete. The section of the report
discussing the semi-annual program review done by the IACUC states that "animal care and use programs were
evaluated and found to be working effectively with only minor issues". It was not clear from reading the rest of this
section of the report exactly what these "minor issues" were. The departures were not specifically stated with a
reason for the departure, specific correction plans or dates for correcting each deficiency. The section of the report
discussing the semi-annual facility inspection did state each departure with a correction plan but did not include
dates of correction for each deficiency. The semi-annual evaluation report to the IO is an important document that
updates the IO on the status of the facility's animal care and use program and allows the IO to know when to
intervene to ensure that the facility meets the federal guidelines. The IACUC's semi-annual reports of evaluations of
the program of animal care and use and facility inspection must identify specifically any departures from the Animal
Welfare Act Standards and Regulations, must state reasons for each departure, must distinguish significant from
minor deficiencies and must contain a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each
deficiency. Correct from this day forward. 2.31(c)(6)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Acquisition/disposition records for dogs and cats show that both dogs and cats were used as teaching animals in
the vet tech program in the Fall 2015 semester. The activity being conducted (clinical skills labs) was done without
an IACUC approved protocol. A previously approved protocol for this activity (130801-05-03-C) had expired due to
the PI leaving the facility in the spring of 2015 and no new protocol was submitted to the IACUC or approved by the
IACUC. All animal activity must be approved by the IACUC to ensure that it is in accordance with the Animal
Welfare Act Regulations and Standards and to ensure the welfare of the animals used in the facility's animal
programs. The IACUC shall review and approve, require modifications in to secure approval or withhold approval of
those components of proposed activities related to the care and use of animals. Correct from this day forward.
2.31(c)(7) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 130311-01-05-D involves ovariohysterectomy and castration procedures in dogs and cats. This protocol
was cited on the previous routine inspection as the surgeons listed on the protocol and performing the surgeries
were no longer with the program. Dog and cat acquisition/disposition records for the fall 2015 semester show that
dogs and cats were used on this protocol. without the protocol/personnel being updated. The officially approved
protocol on file at the facility is the same protocol inspected at the last inspection. The Nov. 30, 2015 IACUC
meeting minutes state that the IACUC has not received a new updated protocol to review and that the IACUC
assumed the protocol was "on hold" and no animals were being used on the protocol. Significant changes must be
reviewed and approved by the IACUC before being instituted to ensure appropriate oversight of the animal use.
2.31(d)(6)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
An email was sent to the PI of protocols 130123-05-03-C and 130311-01-05-D by the IACUC chair on 5/4/15 in
which a "hold" was placed on the protocols. According to the email, "when a protocol is on hold, animals may not be
used or acquired for the protocol until the deficiencies are corrected and approved by the IACUC". Review of
IACUC meeting minutes for 2015 show that no meeting was convened at which the previously approved animal
activity protocols were reviewed and voted on. The IACUC may suspend an activity only after review of the matter
at a convened meeting of a quorum of the IACUC and with the suspension vote of a majority of the quorum present.

3.8(c)(1)
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
The current attending veterinarian (new as of Nov. 2015) has not reviewed the current canine exercise plan todetermine if the frequency, method and duration of the opportunity for exercise is appropriate. In addition, the
IACUC has not been consulted about or approved the canine exercise plan. Adequate exercise is necessary for the
physical health and the psychological well-being of the dogs. The attending veterinarian shall determine methods
and periods of providing exercise opportunity in consultation with and approval by the IACUC. A written copy of the
approved plan shall be maintained. Correct by Feb. 15, 2016.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The back exterior door to SAVS north kennel has a gap at least 1/4 in wide running the length of the bottom of the
door. Sunlight is visible through the gap from inside the building. Insect pests were noted just outside the door.
Vermin can gain entrance to the building through such a gap. The kennel building is currently empty and not in use.
Premises, including building doors, must be kept in good repair to facilitate husbandry practices.

The cat "pet carriers" stored above the cat cages and the dog "pet carriers" stored bungee corded in the transport
vehicle are not clearly marked on top and on one or more sides with the words "Live Animals" and do not have
markings to indicate upright position. Appropriate marking is necessary for proper handling of the transport
enclosures to limit the potential for injury to the animals being transported. All enclosures used to transport live dogs
and cats not permanently affixed to the conveyance shall be clearly marked on top and on one or more sides with
the words "Live Animals" in letters at least 1 inch high and with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct
upright position of the enclosure. Correct by Jan. 15, 2016.
