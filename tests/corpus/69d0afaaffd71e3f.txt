Watering
An enclosure with three adult dogs in it had a water dish that didn't have water in it. The licensee said it was filled in the
morning and filled it during inspection; the dogs were not interested in drinking and did not appear thirsty, however the
requirement is that dogs have access to potable (clean) drinking water continuously. Ensure that dishes are big enough
to provide continuous access to water or that the water system is maintained so that all dogs have continuous access to
water.
***Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
