2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**While reviewing records it was noted the written program of veterinary care had not been correctly completed.
Section II (Dogs and Cats) had been incorrectly completed to include the parasite program for a tiger housed at the
facility instead of Section III, Wild and Exotic Animals, Part B Parasite Control Program. Sec III, Wild and Exotics
Animals did not list the correct current inventory of animals. The inventory included a lynx and fox that are no
longer housed at the facility and did not include coyotes and a porcupine currently housed at the facility. The
program of veterinary care should be updated to accurately reflect a parasite program for the appropriate species
and correct animal inventory. Lack of a complete program of veterinary care does not ensure that proper veterinary
care is being provided in accordance with currently accepted veterinary medical standards.
