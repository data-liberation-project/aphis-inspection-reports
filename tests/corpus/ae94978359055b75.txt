Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The acquisition and disposition records are not up to date. The Record of Animals on Hand APHIS Form 7019 recording
the animals on exhibition reviewed during the inspection had not been updated since the last inspection. The facility
manager was contacted the following day and supplied a handwritten document that listed the species and number of all
animals at the facility including both the pet store and the exhibit animals. Together the two records did not contain all the
required information for the new exhibit animals (one African Crested porcupine and one rabbit) acquired since the last
inspection. Missing information included the name and address of the person from whom the animals were acquired, the
USDA license number or if not licensed the vehicle license number and state and driver’s license number and state of the
person and the date of acquisition. In addition, the records did not contain any disposition information for 16 rabbits and 7
prairie dogs on exhibit in 2019 but no longer at the facility.
Complete and accurate acquisition and disposition records must be kept to allow for accurate identification of the animals
and to allow for medical and legal tracking. The facility shall make, keep and maintain records that fully and correctly
include all the required acquisition and disposition information. This information must include the name and address of the
person from whom the animals were acquired, the USDA license number of the person if licensed or the vehicle license


number and state and driver’s license number and state if not licensed, the name and address of the person to whom an
animal was given/sold, the date of acquisition or disposition, the species of animal and the number of animals involved.

Feeding.
During the inspection the following food items were noted remaining in the food receptacle of the marmosets: cheese
cubes, shrimp, and produce. The facility representative stated that she feeds the marmosets the following items on the
days she works: shrimp or deli turkey, cheese, produce, marshmallows and a half a tums tablet for each marmoset as a
calcium supplement. Except for the addition of the Tums tablet, this was basically the same diet the marmosets were
eating during the last inspection. The facility manager confirmed the next day that these items were being fed. She stated
that they had monkey biscuits in the refrigerator but that the marmosets did not like them. The attending veterinarian was
contacted and he stated he had not been contacted by the facility regarding dietary recommendations.
Marmosets require very specific levels of nutrients in their diet such as for example specific levels/types of protein, vitamin
C and vitamin D in order to maintain a healthy condition and meet their normal daily nutritional requirements. The facility
shall contact their veterinarian or a veterinary nutritionist and ensure that the diet fed to the marmosets is appropriate for
the species according to generally accepted professional nutritional standards.
3.84(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The marmoset enclosure needs to be sanitized. A large number of small flies were noted in the enclosure especially on
the ledge on the right side where the food and water bowls are placed. Several dead flies were noted in the water bowl.
When one of the marmosets came down to grab a piece of food a cloud of flies rose up from the area. The marmosets
were noted scratching at themselves. The walls and ledge areas are made to look like natural materials and have many
ridges and indentations. A closer look at these areas showed a large accumulation of debris in the ridges and


indentations. The facility representative stated that the absorbent bedding material at the bottom of the enclosure and the
bowls were cleaned daily by the staff and they did appear clean. She was not familiar with the sanitization process. The
facility manager was asked about the cleaning and sanitization schedule. She stated that it was done as needed since the
marmosets were scent marking animals.
Based on the amount of debris noted and the number of flies present, the sanitization frequency needs to be increased to
ensure that the marmosets are comfortable and to prevent disease hazards. Indoor primary enclosures must be sanitized
at least once every two weeks or as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of dirt, debris, waste, food
waste, excreta or disease hazard. Since the marmosets engage in scent marking, the facility shall contact their
veterinarian to help develop a regular sanitization schedule and procedure that is in accordance with generally accepted
professional and husbandry practices. Correct by 3/12/21.

Watering.
The water receptacles for the exhibit prairie dogs and the exhibit African Crested porcupine were dirty. The receptacle for
the prairie dogs was covered in dried on mud. The water was discolored green brown and debris was floating on the
water and adhered to the inside walls of the receptacle. The water receptacle for the African Crested porcupine contained
opaque brown water. The sides and bottom could not be visualized. The facility representative stated that she had
changed the water for the porcupine earlier in the day but that the porcupine liked to get into the water receptacle.
Potable water is necessary for the health of all animals. Dirty water receptacles may lead to water that is not potable or
may discourage the animals from drinking the water. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary. Correct by
3/1/2020.
3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.


The facility currently exhibits the following species outdoors: prairie dogs, cavy and an African Crested porcupine. The
outdoor housing facilities for these species are not currently completely enclosed by a perimeter fence at least six feet
high and more than three feet in distance from the primary enclosures. The facility does have some perimeter fencing in
place but the fence is less than six feet high and it is not complete.
A perimeter fence protects the animals by restricting unwanted animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or
under it and having contact with the animals in the facility and also functions as a secondary containment system for the
animals. The facility shall ensure that the outdoor housing facilities are enclosed by a perimeter fence at least six feet high
and more than three feet in distance from the primary enclosures or apply for written approval for fencing that does not
meet those requirements. Correct by 5/2/21.

This inspection was conducted with the facility representative. The follow-up conversation and exit interview were
conducted with the facility manager by phone.
