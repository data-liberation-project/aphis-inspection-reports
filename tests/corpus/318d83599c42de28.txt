3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the sheltered building housing primarily savannah cats, the enclosures consist of an interior area within the
building connected to outdoor runs via small access doors. In at least 5 of these outdoor runs, the metal walls
around the access doors have areas of moderate to severe rust. In several spots sections of the outer wall are
worn away, revealing the wooden frame beneath. Heavily rusted areas may affect the structural strength of the wall
and are potential sources of injury and/or entrapment to the enclosed animals. These rusted areas must be
covered, replaced, or repaired to help protect the health of the animals. All housing areas must be maintained in
good repair.
