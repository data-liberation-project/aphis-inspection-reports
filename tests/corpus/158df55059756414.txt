ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 9:30 AM on

Spoke with the licensee via cell phone. He was unavailable today and gave me better days and hours of
availability.
