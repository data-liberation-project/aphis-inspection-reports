ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
At least 5 of the camelids - 34397, 44652, 34490, 38876, and 32376 - need nail trims. Some of the nails are
overgrown to the point that the toes are distorted from their normal position.
Records for 34397 do not show any nail trims between 9/11/12 and 12/11/14. He was trimmed on 12/11. He was
next trimmed on 9/24/2015, then on 12/30/2015, then 2/17/2016, 8/10/2016, and again on the day of inspection
after the situation was pointed out.
Records for 44652 show he was trimmed on 1/8/2015, 3/19/2015, 9/24/2015,12/30/2015, and 2/24/2016. On
8/24/2016, the record says his claws were overgrown and breaking, and a trim was performed. He was trimmed
again on the day of inspection after the situation was pointed out.
Records for 34490 show she was trimmed 9/16/2013, 9/15/2014, and 12/11/2014. Entry on 5/29/2015 says
"overgrown hooves," but doesn't note that they were trimmed. A trim is documented on 7/8/2015, 12/9/2015, and
1/28/2016. On 9/1/2016, it is noted that she had "Overgrown front nails, trimmed nails." Nails were trimmed again
on the day of inspection after the situation was pointed out.
Records for 38876 show no nail trims between 9/14/2012 and 9/16/2013 when she was trimmed. She was next
trimmed on 2/4/2016, 3/16/2016, and on the day of inspection.
Records for 32376 show no trims from 9/10/2013 and 9/15/2014 when they were trimmed. He was next trimmed on
12/9/2015, 8/31/2016, 9/14/2016, and on the day of inspection when long nails were pointed out.
The records of these five animals show that trimming is inconsistent in frequency, and likely quality. Improved
supervision of the personnel doing the trimming should be implemented.
Overgrown nails to this extent can cause discomfort to the animal and the misalignment it causes can contribute to
degenerative joint disease. Animals that have progressed to the point of anatomical distortion need frequent
corrective trimming to get and maintain them as close to normal as is possible. Corrected on the day of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility personnel on 9/21/2016, and additional information
review and exit briefing was conducted on 9/26/2016 with LARC and IACUC personnel.
