INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol # A1500116 & 9040115 do not contain complete descriptions of the proposed use of the animals, nor does
it contain the actual numbers of animals that will be studied. These activities involving primates are reportedly a
continuation of other PI's terminated work but there is no mention of this in either protocol.
All protocols must contain a complete description of the proposed use of animals and the rational for such use. If a
protocol is an exact continuation of previous work, that shall be so stated in the protocol and available for review
during an Animal Welfare inspection. Any deviations to those previous protocols shall also be completely
described.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Primate 8Q6 was observed to have an opacity in the right eye. The vet techs indicated that he was born with large
eyes and has been this way since birth. They are continuously observing this condition. This condition, however,
was never reported to the attending veterinarian for examination, and has never received any veterinary care. The
veterinarian is the person who is qualified to assess the animal's health and well-being, and is the one who would
determine if an animal is suffering, or is experiencing pain &/or distress. He is also the one who would decide
whether no treatment, treatment, or euthanasia is appropriate.
A mechanism of direct and communication is required so that timely information on problems with animal health and
well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that he may determine if this animal is in pain, distress or
suffering; and to decide whether veterinary examination, care, or euthanasia is appropriate.

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Recently a mainland operator is offering jet ski tours to the public which stops a few hundred feet offshore from the
island. The participants get off of their jet skis and then snorkel in the shallow waters. There is photographic
evidence that some of these participants actually gained access onto the island.
The primates can become stressed due to observing new people. This stress reaction can possible alter the
behavioral research that is being conducted. There is also a health risk to the public if the primates should attack,
bite, scratch, defecate or urinate on them since they can be on the ground, overhead in the trees, or in the water. It
is also known that some of the primates on this island are Herpes positive which also poses an additional health risk
to the jet ski participants.
The registrant has hired security to patrol these particular areas, but the security leaves the island mid day and
before these jet ski operations end for the day.
Additional security (or other) measures shall be established to ensure that the unauthorized persons cannot get
close or gain access to the island and make direct or indirect contact with the primates, so as to ensure both the
safety of the primates as well as the public. This can be accomplished (but not limited to) additional security,
erection of a fence or other type of barrier, or continuous video surveillance.
