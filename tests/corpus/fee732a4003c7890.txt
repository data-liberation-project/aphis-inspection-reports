ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 am on
21-Aug-18.
Dr. Michael Neafsey and myself arrived at the facility at 11:00am on 8/21/2018. We knocked on the front door and
rang the bell with no answer. We also called out to see if anyone was present in the surrounding buildings with no
answer. I then called the contact number provided and left a message stating our wish to conduct an inspection at
that time. We waited 30 minutes and left the facility.
