2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
***In early December 2015, a Dall sheep became injured and ultimately died due to an employee not following
proper procedures. After finishing routine husbandry in the Dall sheep enclosure, the employee did not secure the
enclosure gate properly. The sheep was able to gain access to a goat enclosure and while in that enclosure,
suffered a terminal injury from an encounter with a male goat. Since the incident, the facility has retrained the
employee and modified the gate with additional security measures.
The handling of this animal was not conducted in a manner that prevented trauma, behavioral stress, and physical
harm. Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not
cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. The
facility must continue to handle all animals as expeditiously and carefully as possible.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
Inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility C.O.O.
