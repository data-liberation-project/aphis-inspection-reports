3.6(a)(2)(x)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
One enclosure containing one adult Cavalier Spaniel and three puppies has flooring constructed of wire. At least
two puppies were seen with their legs passing through the openings in the flooring. Openings in the flooring that
are large enough for the legs of the animals to pass through could result in injury or entrapment.
Primary enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs’ feet and legs from
injury and does not allow the dogs’ feet to pass through the openings in the floor. The licensee must alter the
flooring in a manner that does not allow the puppies’ feet and legs to pass through the openings. The licensee must
ensure that the flooring in the enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.
