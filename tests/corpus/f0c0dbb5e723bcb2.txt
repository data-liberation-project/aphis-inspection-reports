2.33(b)(4) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
During inspection there was a surgical procedure being conducted on pigs. I observed an expired bag of sodium
chloride (Feb 2012) being used on one of the pigs on the surgical table. When questioned I was told it was a
terminal procedure and they were allowed to use expired fluids for this type of surgery. When I questioned the
IACUC chair if there was a written policy allowing this, I was told that it is a verbal policy that no expired medications
are to be used in the facility. Adequate guidance to principal investigators and surgical staff involved in the proper
use of medications shall be provided.
2.35(a)(1)
RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.
The IACUC minutes reviewed do not fully capture deliberations during the IACUC meetings and the changes to
policies granted outside of a fully convened meeting. In August 2014, a new food restriction policy was voted on
and approved by the IACUC to be used as the standard in food restriction protocols. The policy was implemented.
There were complications when applied to one of the protocols resulting in the NHP's no longer performing their
tasks. The PI for this protocol requested an exemption which would allow greater restriction. There is no IACUC
documented discussion or deliberation for review that indicates the initial review of the alternate policy was
conducted in consultation the Attending Veterinarian. Emails review that were not provided with the IACUC records
but provided later indicate the alternate policy was reviewed by 2 IACUC members and then sent via email to
committee members for a yes or no vote to allow a variance on the food restriction policy. The variance was
approved by majority vote and implemented prior to a full committee vote. The full committee vote took place in
November. In contradiction, the physical exams in the animal records during that period of time document a
treatment plan to increase the NHP's daily intake to allow them to gain weight. The IACUC records provided and
veterinary records are not in agreement. The activities of the IACUC are not fully reflected in the IACUC minutes.
The research facility shall maintain IACUC records that include all activities of the committee and committee
deliberations. Correct by next IACUC meeting (March 2015)
2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.An animal incident occurred in July of 2014 resulting in the unexpected death of a pig. The pig was found dead in its
enclosure the day after a surgical procedure had been performed. This incident is currently under review.
