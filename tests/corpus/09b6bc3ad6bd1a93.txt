HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A few piles of clutter are in the main dog area within the facility. The clutter is located on top of three dog enclosures
containing a total of three adult dogs and three puppies. The enclosure housing one adult and her 3 puppies had a
heat lamp in amongst the clutter and created a fire hazard. The clutter consists of boxes, paperwork, clothing
materials and towels, etc. There was a pile of trash and few plastic bottles in the outdoor portion of the facility.
The accumulation of debris, unused materials and equipment, can impede the ability to clean and sanitize
sufficiently and can lead to vermin infestations. The licensee must remove the clutter from on top of the dog
enclosures and ensure that all dog areas remain free of clutter and trash at all times.
3.1(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were five enclosures that had excessive rust towards the bottom of the sides and along the bottom.
Excessive rust does not allow for adequate cleaning of the enclosures and could affect structural integrity. The
surfaces in the housing facility must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily
cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled. Interior surfaces and any surfaces that come in
contact with dogs or cats must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or that
affects the structural strength of the surface
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were two enclosures housing a total of two adult dogs and two puppies that had wood that was used as
visual barriers between enclosures with chewed edges along the top. This impacted 2 adult dogs and 2 puppies.
Chewed and worn surfaces can not be cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled.
To be corrected by: November 25, 20193.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Throughout the area housing all the dogs and the enclosed porch area that is used to access the the outdoor
portion of the facility there was a buildup of debris, including food, feces, hair, urine, and unknown brown residue.
The lack of cleaning can lead to the health issues. Hard surfaces with which the dogs or cats come in contact must
be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent accumulation of excreta
and reduce disease hazards.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee and a facility representative.
