2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two animals identified on the previous inspection to have veterinary conditions requiring examination, diagnosis,
treatment plan, and resolution or follow-up evaluation by a veterinarian were no longer present at the facility and no
records were made by the licensee to show that the directions provided by the Attending Veterinarian (AV) on
9/23/15 were followed and that the veterinary conditions identified were resolved.
**A female hedgehog located in Bin #43 on 9/23/15 had lost a significant amount of weight (13% of total body
weight) following weaning of pups. Veterinary evaluation on 9/23/15 indicated that this animal be monitored for a
month to determine if she continued to lose weight or if she regained her pre-pregnancy body condition. This
female hedgehog was transferred to a second site for this licensee and had not been monitored nor reweighed to
determine if she had recovered. All four female hedgehogs on site were evaluated and weighed during the
inspection of site 002 on 11/6/15. One female with pinto markings similar to the one seen at site 001 from Bin#43
on 9/21/15 and 9/23/15 weighed 390 grams on 11/6/15 which would be an improvement if this is the same animal
but there was no mechanism nor records by which this could be determined.
**A juvenile male hedgehog was evaluated by a veterinarian on 9/21/2015 where a diagnosis of mild upper
respiratory infection was made. The veterinarian initiated treatment for the diagnosed condition and there is a plan
to repeat antibiotic treatment in two weeks if animal has not improved. This hedgehog had been sold according to
the licensee and no records were made to show that this animal responded to the treatment prior to release for sale.
Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries, and the availability of
emergency, weekend, and holiday care.
