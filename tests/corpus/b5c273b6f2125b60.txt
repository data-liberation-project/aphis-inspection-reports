2.33(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
On July 21, 2015 twelve nonhuman primates (NHP's) located at enclosure 22B were found eating rat bait pellets. A
lawn care contractor admitted moving the rat bait stations from its fixed position so he could mow easier around the
enclosure; contractor failed to notify facility personnel about the bait station movement. The bait station was placed
within the reach of the NHP's allowing them to grab and ingest warfarin-type bait pellets. The research facility must
maintain in its program of veterinary care detailed guidance for service contractors when working around NHP's, to
minimize accidental exposure to potentially harmful chemicals which could harm animals. All animals were
hospitalized, observed and tested; no abnormalities were detected.
This noncompliance was corrected prior to the time of inspection.

MISCELLANEOUS.
On September 3, 2015, while moving sedated non-human primates (NHP's) out of field cage 16B, two non-sedated
animals escaped from their primary enclosure. The animals were able to escape because two doors (man-cage
area and secondary compartment) were momentarily open at the same time. The two NHP's were successfully
recovered and unharmed approximately two hours after escaping. Handling of all animals shall be done as
expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling,
behavioral stress, physical harm, unnecessary discomfort, or escape from their primary enclosure.
This noncompliance was corrected prior to the time of inspection.
3.75(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several metal and plastic sharp points and edges were found at several primary enclosures throughout the facility.
Most sharp points/edges were identified on wire ties, hose clamps and hard plastic bases (attaching enrichment
toys). Housing facilities for nonhuman primates (NHP's) must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the
animals from injury and contain the animals securely. Primary enclosures for all NHP's at the facility must be free ofjagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animals. Facility maintenance was notified immediately, and
some repairs at the enclosures were completed before this inspection.
