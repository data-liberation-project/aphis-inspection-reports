SANITATION.
At the time of inspection the flying squirrel enclosure had an accumulation of grime on the bottom edges and floor of
the epoxy-coated wire enclosure. The epoxy was flaking off in large pieces on the floor of the enclosure allowing for
a potential of rust to develop on the exposed metal. The animals housed could be adversely affected by this flaking
epoxy or debris present in the enclosure. The facility must ensure that premises are kept clean to protect the
animals from injury.
