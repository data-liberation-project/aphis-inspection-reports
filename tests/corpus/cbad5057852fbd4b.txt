ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1115 on
07-NOV-19.
Upon arrival at the facility I knocked on the door. I then called the contact number and left a message. The
licensee called me back and stated that he was away and would not be able to return for an inspection. I then left
the facility.
