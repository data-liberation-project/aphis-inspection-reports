2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Many goats and sheep had overgrown hooves that extended outward and some toes were turning inward. The
hooves on all feet were long due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can
cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s program of preventative
veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof care in a timely manner.
