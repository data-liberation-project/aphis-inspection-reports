2.75(a)(2)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection report of August 12, 2014, majority of the puppies sold were listed on a bill of sale
instead of APHIS form 7006. Each dealer is required to use the Record of Disposition of Dogs and Cats (APHIS
Form 7006) to make, keep, and maintain the information required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, unless the
dealer has obtained a variance to use a form other than APHIS form 7006.
Licensee must complete and maintain a copy of APHIS form 7006 for all dogs and puppies sold to comply with the
regulations, document changes in ownership, and to keep track of animals.
Correct from this day forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
