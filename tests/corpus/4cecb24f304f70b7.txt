Sanitation.
The rabbit’s indoor primary enclosure, including their food and water receptacles, as well as their outdoor enrichment
enclosure are not being sanitized with sufficient frequency. When asked, a facility representative stated that both the
indoor and outdoor rabbit enclosures are cleaned up to twice weekly but are not sanitized at least once every 30 days.
The rabbit’s food and water receptacles are being cleaned with soap and water daily, but not sanitized at a minimum
frequency of once every 2 weeks. When enclosures, and food and water receptacles, are not sanitized adequately, there
is higher risk of large numbers of germs remaining on the surfaces which creates a health hazard for the rabbit. Primary
enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized by washing them with hot water (180 degrees F) and soap or detergent, or by
washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled
surfaces with live steam or flame at least once every 30 days or sooner if dirty. Also, all food and water receptacles shall
be kept clean when dirty and be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks.

Outdoor housing facilities.


Upon arrival for inspection, two lemurs were not in their indoor enclosure, but the facility representative said they were in
their outdoor enclosure as part of their enrichment at that time. When inspecting the outdoor enclosure, after the lemurs
had returned to their indoor enclosure, there was not a complete perimeter fence surrounding it. Currently, only two sides
have a sufficient perimeter fence created by two walls of the main building. Otherwise, there is no perimeter fence along
the other two sides that face public walkways. A perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet high and 3 feet from the outdoor
enclosure is needed on all four sides with sufficient wire spacing to prevent unauthorized humans and other animals the
size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going through or under it. The perimeter fencing is necessary to keep unwanted
species of animals and humans out as well as serve as a secondary containment. The facility shall ensure the outdoor
enrichment housing facilities for the lemurs are enclosed by an appropriate perimeter fence, or a variance, if appropriate,
needs to be obtained and can be requested from the Administrator/Regional Office.

3.84(b)(3)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The food and water receptacles for the lemurs and tamarins are hand washed with water and soap daily, but sanitization
doesn’t occur at the required two-week frequency. Not sanitizing their food and water receptacles properly creates risk for
illness and/or disease. Food and water receptacles must be kept clean and must be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks using one of the following methods: 1) live steam under pressure, or 2) washing with hot water (at least 180
degrees Fahrenheit) and soap or detergent, or 3) washing all soiled surfaces with appropriate detergent/disinfectant
product that accomplishes the same purpose, with a thorough cleaning of the surfaces to remove organic material first,
and then to provide sanitization followed by a clean water rinse, or as often as necessary to provide for the health and
well-being of the animals.
