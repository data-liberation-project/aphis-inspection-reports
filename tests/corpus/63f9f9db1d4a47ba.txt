2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were three tubes of an anti-parasitic medication that were expired (dated March 2014) and another bottle of
medication used as an adjunct for euthanasia that was expired (dated 2011). The second medication had not been
used for at least a year. Medications must not be used beyond the expiration date determined by the manufacturer
in order to be considered appropriate for the prevention, control, and treatment of disease or injury in USDA
regulated species. This is because the components of a medication may deteriorate over time and can potentially
result in toxicity or ineffectiveness of the drug.
Correct from this day forward.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the President.
