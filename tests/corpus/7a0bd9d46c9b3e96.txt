Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1400 on

Upon arrival I spoke with the licensee who was not able to stay for the inspection process. Future hours of operation
were discussed.
This is the first attempted inspection.
