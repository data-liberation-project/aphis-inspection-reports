ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 AM on
06-Sep-16.
The CEO of the facility left a message on my cell phone at 10:15 PM on 9-5-16 to let me know he would not be at
the facility the next day. In one of the two previous weeks he had left a message to let me know that he was
unavailable for inspection the entire week. The CEO of the facility has stated that he is the only person that can
host USDA inspections. He has designated that he is available Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning of
each week for these inspections. This facility has a poor history of compliance and requires an additional inspector
to conduct inspections. These inspections are set up well in advance with the additional inspector. This poor
compliance history makes it imperative that we conduct timely unannounced inspections. When on site we left a
message on the facility answering machine and waited outside the gait for 30 minutes.
Additional Inspectors
Bongard Carrie, Animal Care Inspector
