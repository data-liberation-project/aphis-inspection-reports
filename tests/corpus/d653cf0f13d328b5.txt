HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the circus intermission, one of the tigers was exhibited in a transport enclosure with a plexiglass panel on the
front side with members of the public sitting in a chair in front of the enclosure for photo opportunities. A
bicycle-rack type barrier was present on two sides but was within approximately 1.5 feet from the transport
enclosure and could allow members of the public to reach into the enclosure and make contact with the tiger while
the facility representatives were directing the photo opportunities.
Following the circus performance, the Tiger Trainer left the area where 4 tigers and 1 liger were housed between
performances and was unable to be reached by phone or by knocking on the door to his recreational vehicle for
when APHIS personnel were present to conduct an inspection at 3 PM. No contact with the Trainer was made until
3:30 PM. The public barrier gate that surrounded the 4 tigers and 1 liger in their transport cages was open at the
entryway and no attendant or security personnel were present to prevent contact with members of the public
passing by the cages. The public barrier was open approximately 3-3.5 feet at both ends of the line of transport
cages and was only approximately 1.5-2 feet from the cages. This can allow for an animal or person to enter or exit
the area holding the big cats and for a person to reach into the mesh cages and contact the animals. This area was
accessible to the general public and, during the time APHIS was waiting for a representative to conduct the
inspection, approximately 6 people walked down the corridor adjacent to the barriers and stopped to take pictures,
reaching their arms and hands close to the enclosures. The area where the transport cages are located is a busy
corridor and, during the inspection, vehicles were moving equipment past the cages which required the barrier gate
to be moved within a foot or less of the enclosures.
If sufficient distance and/or barrier is not established between the animal and general viewing public this can
increase the risk of harm to the animal and the public.
Sufficient distance and/or a sufficient public barrier and/or a knowledgeable attendant must be in place in order to
keep unauthorized people or other animals from coming into direct contact with the animals.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
***There are 2 adult tigers, 1 golden tabby named Apollo and 1 white tiger named Mohan, that were being housed in
a transport cage that was divided into two by a panel. The full enclosure measured 11 feet 5 inches length x 84
inches (7 feet) width which would give each of these two animals 5 feet 8 inches by 7 feet in floor space. Two of the
other animals, 1 adult liger named Apollo and 1 adult orange tiger named Sherkhan, were housed together in the
same size enclosure but did not have the dividing panel in place. The remaining tiger, a large male white tiger
named Zeus, was housed in the same size enclosure without a dividing panel.
The licensee has a written policy for providing the cats exercise one to two hours daily in the large mesh pen used
for performances. The Tiger Trainer stated that the tigers were being kept in the transport cages and would not be
getting the one to two hours of exercise daily due to the performance schedule.
The inability for the tigers to have any opportunity to make normal postural adjustments with adequate freedom of
movement could be detrimental to their health and well-being and cause unnecessary discomfort.
The tigers should have an opportunity for exercise outside of the limited space of their transport cages where they
should be able to stretch to their full vertical height and length with adequate freedom of movement in a safe and
secure location and as directed by the written protocol.

FEEDING.
The food storage freezer had cardboard boxes of packaged muscle meat and chicken parts that had fallen over and
tumbled inside the freezer which caused damage to some of the boxes. Some of the meat was visible through the
plastic packaging and appeared to have excessive ice crystal buildup and what appeared to be frozen, pooled blood
in the plastic packaging that was protruding from the cardboard box. This may indicate that the meat has thawed
and refrozen which can degrade the nutritive value of the meat and lead to bacterial overgrowth that can be a risk to
the animals' health.
The food shall be stored in a manner to ensure it is wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of
sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good healt. To be corrected by April 12, 2015.
3.138(a)
PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
Exposed insulation material was present due to broken and/or missing wall board in the upper, middle panel of the
interior of the cargo space for transport of 4 tigers and 1 liger. This exposed insulation material can harbor
infectious material due to a build-up of excreta and other debris in the cargo area and it cannot be cleaned or
sanitized.
The cargo space in vehicles used to transport animals should be kept in good repair to protect the health of the
animals.

3.138(e)
PRIMARY CONVEYANCES (MOTOR VEHICLE, RAIL, AIR, AND MARINE).
The transport vehicle for 4 tigers and 1 liger was not being kept clean:
--a foul odor was immediately noted when the back doors were opened
--numerous flies were present in the cargo space and maggots were tumbling from the grated floor adjacent to the
door out onto the street
--debris had built-up in the grated floor and corners of the transport vehicle that appeared to be hair, food waste,
and excreta
The food and excreta build-up along with the presence of flies and maggots pose a risk to the health of animals that
would be transported in this vehicle due to the presence of and risk for spread of infectious organisms.
The interior of the animal cargo space shall be kept clean.
To be corrected prior to transporting the animals on April 12, 2015.
