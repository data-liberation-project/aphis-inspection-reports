ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are two male guinea pigs that have old wounds on their hindquarters and appear to have scabbed over. The
licensee stated that he has not seen these wounds before. The licensee must observe all animals daily to assess
their health status. The licensee must also establish a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with the
attending veterinarian, so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and
well-being is conveyed in an accurate and timely manner.
Correct from this day forward.
2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of vet care states "Blunt Force Trauma" as a form of euthanasia for guinea pigs by the licensee. The
licensee said that he does not do blunt force trauma but it is written on the program of vet care. Blunt force trauma
is not an approved method of euthanasia for guinea pigs. This facility currently has multiple species and the current
program of vet care does not state the method of euthanasia that will be used for each of these species. The
program of veterinary care does indicate beuthanasia as the form of euthanasia performed by the attending
veterinarian but does not state which species to be euthanized. The attending veterinarian must approve in writing
the methods of euthanasia to be performed, who will perform the euthanasia of regulated species and said persons
must be properly trained in the methods of euthanasia. It should also reflect drug name, route, and dosage.

have old wounds on their hindquarters that appear to be scabbed over. The licensee told the inspectors that the
wounds were caused by the two male guinea pigs fighting. Animals that are incompatible in the same enclosureputs the animals at risk of injury. Animals that are housed together must be compatible and maintained in
compatible groups.

The dingo water receptacle had a dead rat inside of the water receptacle. Rodents can harbor disease causing
organisms and could cause potential contamination in the potable water receptacle. Contaminated drinking water
may pose a health risk for the animals. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
