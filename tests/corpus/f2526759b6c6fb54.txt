Six pens contained a total of eight dead young guinea pigs and a dead adult breeder was also present at the time of
inspection. Four adult guinea pigs were noted to have significant hairloss and rough haircoats. The owner had
previously noted the hairloss and was tracking deaths. The veterinarian had been to the premise 24 April 2015 and
the entire population was treated with ivermectin solution but no written direction for the application was available
and the results of the application were not clear. The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases must be established and documented to assure that the animals have the best chance for healthy
life. Correct by having the animals re-examined and establishing a treatment plan that is clearly written and
includes duration of treatment, dosage, application and preparation as well as what actions are to be taken if the
issue does not resolve. Correct By 30 May 2015

SANITATION.
One enclosure containing nine adult guinea pigs and several young ones, was wet on the end nearest the water
nipple for approximately half of the enclosure. The drip tray to drain water away from the enclosure was full of wet
shavings that allowed the water to back up into the enclosure and the animals were huddled in the dry end of the
enclosure. The drain was opened and new shavings added to the enclosure at the time of inspection. In the event a
primary enclosure becomes soiled or wet to a degree that might be harmful or uncomfortable to the animals therein
due to leakage of the watering system a clean and dry primary enclosure must be provided. Correct by assuring the
water system drains properly away from the enclosure and the enclosure remains clean and dry. Correct from this
point forward.
An exit interview was conducted with the owners spouse.
