2.33(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A written program of veterinary care was not available for review at the time of the inspection. The facility is
temporarily employing part-time veterinarians until a new full-time veterinarian is in place.
A written program of veterinary care is necessary to convey the attending veterinarian's expectations for routine
preventative medical care and euthanasia for animals used by the facility. The lack of a written program may result
in inadequate or inappropriate animal care and thus be detrimental to the health of the animals. The facility should
ensure that a program of veterinary care is in place for each regulated species used for teaching purposes and that
the document contains sufficient detail so that they may follow the attending veterinarian's recommendations.
