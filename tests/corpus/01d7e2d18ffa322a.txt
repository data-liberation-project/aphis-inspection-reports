an adequate number of trained and knowledgeable employees to conduct adequate husbandry practices. Without
an adequate number of employees, the facility can fall into disrepair, animals with health problems may go
unnoticed and there is a health and safety risk to the public. The licensee must gain a sufficient number of
adequately trained employees, supervised by a person or persons with a background in animal care.

abnormalities.
