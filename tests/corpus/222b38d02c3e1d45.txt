2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Hamton, a pot-bellied pig in the domestic interactive area walked with an abnormal gate. He was slow to stand and
when he did, he walked slowly around his pen. He did not walk with a smooth motion, but instead appeared to have
a stiff gait and positioned both hind limbs next to each other and directly underneath him for support.
Ongoing lameness issues could cause pain and discomfort to the animal if left untreated. This animal must be
evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an effective treatment plan. The
diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Hamton, a pot-bellied pig in the domestic interactive area walked with an abnormal gate. He was slow to stand and
when he did, he walked slowly around his pen. He did not walk with a smooth motion, but instead appeared to have
a stiff gait and positioned both hind limbs next to each other and directly underneath him for support. He was on
Metacam in the past for arthritic issues, but this was stopped in March for an unknown reason and there were no
other records documenting his daily lameness issues.
Failure to observe and properly communicate animal health issues to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner
can result in prolonged pain and suffering for the animal and potentially worsen a current medical condition.
Daily observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being
are recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior
must be conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate
care. The facility must conduct daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns
are found in a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
