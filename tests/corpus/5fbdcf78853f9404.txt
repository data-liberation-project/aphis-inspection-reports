3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Four enclosures, all housing six adult dogs, have metal dog door inserts. The surfaces for the bottom portion of
the metal inserts are excessively rusty, flaking and corroded away in areas. These surfaces cannot be properly
cleaned and sanitized, thus increasing the disease potential. The structural strength of the surfaces is affected.
To maintain the structural strength and for proper cleaning and sanitization, all metal surfaces must be kept free of
rust. This will decrease the disease potential and ensure the metal surfaces are structurally sound.
To be corrected by, 20-November-2017.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The concrete flooring for 10 enclosures had an accumulation of fecal waste on the surface. When asked when the
flooring was cleaned last, the owner stated, the other day. This accumulation of fecal waste indicates that daily
spot-cleaning is not taking place and could increase the disease potential for 18 adult dogs.
For the prevention of an accumulation of feces and reduction of disease hazards, all hard surfaces with which the
dogs come in contact with must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b), at least every two
weeks or more often if necessary.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and Randall Wagner (ACI).
This inspection will be sent by certified and regular mail.
