ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the "White Building" there is a female brown and white English Bulldog (microchip #006 816 833) with areas of
hair loss on the left side of her neck. There is a large area of hair loss on the upper section of her neck and two
smaller circular areas of hair loss lower down her neck. The skin of these areas appears slightly reddened and
moist. The hair that is surrounding these areas of hair loss is wet. The licensee had not noticed the condition of
this dog'(cid:25)s neck and she has not been seen by a licensed veterinarian. Areas of hair loss could be an indication of
underlying health problems.
This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. The diagnosis
and treatment plan must be documented and available to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure
that all the dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "Barn" there are at least two enclosures, containing four dogs, which have wooden posts along the back wall
that have been excessively chewed by the dogs. The damage caused by the chewing does not allow for the wood
to be properly cleaned or sanitized.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. All surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must
be replaced when worn or soiled. The chewed, damaged wood posts must be repaired, replaced or altered in a
manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces remain in
good condition at all times.

3.1(e)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the "White Building" there are three sacks of open dog food sitting in a plastic container with no lid. There is also
one open sack of dog food sitting on the floor next to the container. Open sacks of food could spoil, become
contaminated, and be infested by pests.
All open supplies of food must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and
spoilage. The four open sacks of food must be moved to a leakproof container with a fitted lid and the licensee
must ensure that all food is stored in a manner that protects it from spoilage, contamination, and pest infestation.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the "Barn" there is one enclosure, containing two dogs, that has a wooden post that has been chewed on by the
dogs. This damage to the post has exposed the sharp end of a nail at the level of the dogs. Another enclosure,
containing two dogs, has wire fencing along the front of it. This wire has broken resulting in two sharp points
protruding into the enclosure at the level of the dogs. Sharp points can cause injury to the dogs.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that may cause
injury to the dogs. The nail and the broken wires must be removed, repaired, or altered in a manner that eliminates
the injury risk to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures remain safe for the dogs at all times.
3.6(a)(2)(10)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the "Whelping Room" of the "White Building" there is one enclosure, containing one adult dog, which has a
section of flooring that has a corner that(cid:25)'s sagging and creating a small gap along the wall. The dog could injure
her foot or leg if caught in the gap.
Enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury. The
sagging flooring must be repaired, replaced, or altered in a manner that protects the dog from potential injury. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures remain in good repair and are safe for the dogs at all times.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the "White Building", the enclosures in the "Whelping Room" are covered in an excessive number of flies. Flies
were seen on the sides of the enclosures and on the bedding. Numerous flies were observed to be floating in at
least two water bowls and on the dog food in all the food bowls. The flies were also seen sitting on the adult dogs
and puppies. This room houses a total of five adult English Bulldogs and fifteen English Bulldog puppies.
Also in the "White Building", the "Adult Dog Room" has an excessive number of flies. Flies were seen on the dog
food, sides of the enclosures, floating in at least one water bowl and sitting on the dogs. There are twenty-eight
adult English Bulldogs housed in this room.
Excessive flies could cause contamination of the dogs' food and water and can increase the risk of health hazards.
Although the licensee has hung fly traps from the ceiling, an effective program for the control of pests must be
established and maintained to promote the health and well-being of the dogs and reduce the risk of contamination
by the flies.
