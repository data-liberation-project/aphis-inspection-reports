ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Many of the animals observed (baboon, two lions, sheep, bear, et. al) are very obese. Obesity can lead to many
other health issues. There are no records to indicate that their diets have been evaluated by the veterinarian and
determined to be appropriate. The diet for these animals shall be evaluated by the veterinarian and adjustments
made to better control the animal weights and protect their health. Correct by November 12, 2015.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The barn that houses the giraffes and the camel is in disrepair. It is very old and has had several quick patches
over time that are compromising the structural integrity. There are two main doors to the barn. One of the doors
currently used for the giraffes to enter the barn is propped open by large rocks which the giraffes may stumble on
and become injured. The door is tilted and leans in at the top making it not structurally sound. There are two stalls in
the barn and the giraffes are separated and locked in them during extreme cold weather. The second door which
would be necessary for access to the giraffe when locked in on that side, is not functioning and has to remain
closed. The aluminum or tin panels on the doors and outside walls of the barn have exposed sharp edges and
sharp points which may allow the giraffes to get cut or become injured.
Inside the barn there are exposed electrical wires joined with caps in an open electrical box. The light switches are
also in open electrical boxes. The electrical boxes, wiring, and light fixture are dusty, dirty, and covered in spider
webs creating a fire hazard. This areas needs to be cleaned and repairs made to create a safe environment for the
animals.
There is chain link fencing separating the Capybara and Alpacas. The bottom support of the fence is bent
outwardly, creating a hole underneath. This hole, could allow for the Capybaras to enter the adjoining enclosure, or
create an area for injury by getting caught under the wiring.
A wooden patch has been applied to the ceiling in the corner of the giraffe/camel barn to repair a leak. The wood
has warped and partially separated from the ceiling which could allow it to fall and injure animals below. It appearsthat the repair is ineffective and the leak still present.
There is chain link fencing separating the Capybara and Alpacas. The bottom support of the fence is bent
outwardly, creating a hole underneath. This hole, could allow for the Capybaras to enter the adjoining enclosure, or
create an area for injury by getting caught under the wiring.
The metal fencing, composing the primary enclosure for the Rhino, is old, rusting, and has multiple areas of
corrosion.
There is hog wire fencing attached to the metal fence posts and railings. This hog wire is bent, broken, and in
disrepair creating sharp points and areas large enough for the Rhino to become caught and or injured in the gaping
holes.
There is a portion, near the bottom of the fencing, of the Camel enclosure that has been significantly damaged. It is
pushed out, raised, and has broken areas creating sharp points. The condition of the fence could allow the Camel,
as well as other smaller animals to become entangled within the mangled wire. The sharp points can result in injury
to the camel or other animals exposed.
The elevated metal rack, designed to hold the water trough for the Camel, is extremely rusted and has large areas
of corrosion. It is not structurally sound and the corrosion has left jagged edges that may allow the camel to
become injured.
On April 17, 2015 an older female Patagonian cavy was injured when a New Guinea singing dog housed in an
adjoining enclosure jumped over the fence and into the cavy's enclosure. The enclosure is not constructed in a
manner that will securely contain the singing dogs. Housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained to protect
the animals from injury and securely contain them.
The gate in the divider fence of the lion enclosure is not secured. Although the lions are currently allowed access to
both enclosures, the gate is used to separate the lions when needed. The welded lever used to open and close it
has broken off leaving the gate swinging freely. We observed the male lion swing the gate open to access the
adjoining pen. The gate should be secured whether it is open or closed to protect the lions from injury.
3.126(b)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Upon entering the reptile building where the sloth and genet are housed there is distinct strong odor and high
humidity. There is minimal ventilation in the building. In addition the enclosures are constructed primarily of glass
with very small vents in the ceiling. Poor ventilation may lead to respiratory illness or disease. It is not possible to
determine how much ventilation is provided inside the enclosure by the small vents. With the strong odor and high
humidity in the building additional ventilation must be provided. Correct by November 16, 2015.3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the drive through park where the water buffalo are located next to the dam there is a drainage hole in the ground.
It is about 2 to 3 feet in depth and does not have a cover or barrier around it to prevent animal access. The location
of the hole was marked by a piece of white PVC that has fallen into the drain hole. Should a juvenile or small
animal fall into the large hole, or a larger animal stumble on it they could potentially become trapped or injured and
unable to get out. The area shall be made safe to protect the animals.
The ground at the entrance to the giraffe barn is very muddy with several pools of standing water. The giraffes are
fed in the barn so in order to access their food they must walk through the muddy area. Muddy surfaces are slippery
and may cause the giraffes to lose secure footing and become injured. Prolonged exposure to the muddy ground
may lead to other hoof problems as well. Proper drainage must be provided to prevent standing water and muddy
conditions.
Correct by November 12, 2015.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
There is a bowl of food with no lid on it in the refrigerator. The food appears to be slimy and contaminated with black
particles and insects. The rim of the plastic or rubber bowl appears to have been chewed or otherwise damaged
leaving ridges and rough surfaces which prohibits proper sanitation and may lead to contamination of food in it.
Contaminated food may cause illness. The food shall be discarded to prevent feeding to the animals and the bowls
repaired or discarded. Correct immediately.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
There are numerous flies observed in the food prep room on the tables and other items in the room. Flies can
transmit diseases through contamination of the food. There are 6 fly strips hanging from the ceiling that were
recently changed (2 days ago) but are not able to control the flies. All of the fly tapes are covered with flies. The
doors for entering the food prep area do not have screens or a secondary barrier which would help to minimize the
entrance of flies into the kitchen. Additional pest control measures shall be put in place to minimize the presence of
flies and protect the animal food from contamination. Correct by November 12, 2015.
