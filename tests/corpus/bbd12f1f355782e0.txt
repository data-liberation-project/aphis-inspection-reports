At the time of this inspection the trailer was noted to be in need of repair. As you first walk into the trailer the floor is
sagging. Due to the fact that pigs have to walk over this area to get out into the show area this will need to be
addressed. There was also a white material on the walls and covering the wheel wells. One piece had been pulled
off the wall and the areas along the base of the wheel wells had been chewed and were pulling away from the
metal. There are now jagged edges present. To ensure the safety of these animals this trailer will need to be
addressed.
