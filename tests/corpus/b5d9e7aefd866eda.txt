2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
According to the licensee the following animal deaths have occurred since the last inspection:
A male kangaroo was found deceased approximately three weeks ago. A four horned sheep was found deceased
approximately two months ago. A Bennet Wallaby and a miniature horse were found dead several weeks ago. An
Axis and an Aoudad were found deceased this morning.
The attending veterinarian was not notified about any of these animal deaths, nor does the licensee know how the
animals died. He did say that many of these animals were found with a fresh wound on their side. Without
appropriate methods to diagnose and treat injuries and illness, animal conditions may worsen or in this case, the
animals condition may become fatal. Animals must have access to adequate veterinary care as prescribed in the
formal arrangements.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A black and white female goat in the petting zoo area continues to have what appeared to be an abnormal growth
coming from the rectum area causing swelling, discoloration, and a wet buildup around the rectum. Several goats
and two pigs in the petting zoo area had an excessive hoof growth.
A mature aoudad ram continues to be unable to use either front foot/leg in a normal manner when walking and the
front hooves appear to be overgrown. The animal was seen ambulating on the knees and when attempting to
weight bear on the front feet an obviously abnormal, exaggerated gait and weight shifting was apparent. The
attending veterinarian has not reexamined the animal in at least two months. Abnormal postures and gaits can
indicate a serious, painful problem with the feet.
2.75(a)(2) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.Three Llamas were recently given to the licensee. However, no record of acquisition, or any other written
documents stating where these animals or any other animal on at the facility came from could be presented to the
inspectors.
At least six animals have expired since the last inspection. However, no documentation or dates could be
presented.
Records of animals on hand, acquisition, disposition, and transportation of all animals that come go or reside in the
facility grounds is essential and necessary in order to properly track the animals whereabouts at any given time.
The licensee must develop a record of all mammals exhibited on the facility grounds and ensure that it is kept up to
date as needed when animals are born, expire, or are bought, sold or otherwise transferred on or off of the facility
grounds.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
At least a dozen members of the public were observed feeding and touching a white tailed deer in the sitting area
outside of the petting zoo in which there was no identifiable attendant present. No attendants and/or no or
inadequate barriers were present in the following areas in which the public could have access to animals: Giraffes,
cavies, goats, pigs, sheep. With out an adequate number of employees, there is a significant health and safety risk
for both the animals and public. The licensee must ensure that areas with public access be attended by an
adequate number of knowledgeable employees or have adequate barriers to ensure that the animals remain
secured and unmolested in their enclosures.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The entire facility ground is surrounded by a perimeter fence. However, a majority of the hoofstock animals have
free range access within the complex and are not enclosed in any type of pen causing the complex fence to act as a
large single enclosure without any sort of perimeter fence or secondary containment.
The licensee stated that the perimeter fence is approximately 7.5 feet tall. One rhinoceros at the facility requires a
perimeter fence at least 8 feet fall.
An appropriate perimeter fence is required to prevent public contact with the animal and to serve as secondary
containment. Perimeter fences less than 6 feet high or less than 8 feet high for dangerous animals, such as the
rhino, must be approved in writing by the Administrator and the facility would need to send in a variance request for
this.3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The Javalina enclosure contained animal feed and vegetables that appeared to have been dropped onto the ground
inside the enclosures instead of being placed into sanitized receptacles. Contamination of food by animal waste,
insects or vermin can cause animals who ingest it to become ill. Food must be given to animals in sanitized
receptacles.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
The licensee continues to have the same number of employees as he did at prior inspections. Based on the
number of noncompliances, animals observed with health abnormalities, and animal deaths since the prior
inspection, the facility does not have an adequate number of trained and knowledgeable employees to conduct
adequate husbandry practices. Without an adequate number of employees, the facility can fall into disrepair,
animals with health problems may go unnoticed and there is a health and safety risk to the public. The licensee
must gain a sufficient number of adequately trained employees, supervised by a person or persons with a
background in animal care.
