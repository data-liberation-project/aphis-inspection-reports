Facilities, outdoor.
At the time of the inspection, there was not sufficient shade available in the large sheep enclosure and sika deer
enclosure to allow all the animals to be out of the direct sunlight if they wanted to. Although there is an abundance of trees
throughout the park, the leaves have not come in and therefore no natural shade is available. The facility must provide
additional shade by artificial means to allow these animals the opportunity to protect themselves from direct sunlight.
