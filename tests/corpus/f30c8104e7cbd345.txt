2.1(a)(1)

Requirements and application.
The licensee holds a Class “A” license to sell dogs born and raised on his premises. The licensee acquired nine French
bulldog puppies that were not born and raised on his premises and then resold them. Selling puppies that were not born
and raised on the licensee’s premises is not an activity that is allowed to be conducted under a Class “A” license.
Purchasing and reselling animals not born and raised on the premises (“brokering”) requires a Class “B” license.
Conducting regulated activity without a valid USDA license is a violation of the Animal Welfare Act. The licensee must
either obtain a Class “B” license in order to sell dogs born and raised on other properties or the licensee must ensure he
conducts only activities that are allowed under a Class “A” license.

To be corrected by: The licensee was instructed at the time of the inspection, and during the exit briefing, that proceeding
with conducting any brokering activities without a valid USDA “B” license will continue to be a violation of the Animal
Welfare Act.
2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Female Cocker Spaniel (#16B) has a severely matted hair coat. Matted hair is located along the entire length of the
backside of all four legs. The mats are interwoven together to form large sections of matted hair which are thick and held

tightly against the skin. Large clumps of matted hair are located across the top of the dog’s head and behind the right and
left ears. A large section of tightly matted hair is located on the exterior surface of both the left and right ear and is tight
against the skin. Large clumps of grey colored tightly matted hair are attached to the top and bottom of both hind feet.
The inspector had to pull the hair apart in order to identify the dog’s toenails. Severely matted hair coats could cause pain
and discomfort to the animal as well as lead to further health issues.

Each dealer must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat injuries and illnesses. The licensee
must have all the matted hair removed from this dog’s hair coat. The licensee must ensure that the hair coats of all dogs
remain free of matted hair at all times in order to support their health and well-being.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is missing the acquisition information for the following animals:
• Five hundred and five puppies that were sold
• Two adult English Springer spaniels
• Two 5 month old yellow Australian shepherds
• One adult male Yorkshire terrier
• Approximately 4 adult Havanese
The facility currently has 3 litters of puppies located in Pen 1, Pen 19, and Pen 20 (approximately 12 puppies) that have
no recorded acquisition information.

The licensee is missing both the acquisition and disposition information for the following animals:

• One adult female Soft Coated Wheaton terrier
• All adult German shepherds that may have sire or whelped the following litters:
o Litter born on 5/2/20
o Litter born on 12/4/20
• All adult Boxers that may have sired or whelped the following litters:
o Litter born on 3/5/20
o Litter born on 5/25/20
• All adult Eskimos that may have sired or whelped the following litters:
o Litter born on 11/25/19
o Litter born on 11/18/20
o Litter born on 3/12/20
o Litter born on 3/21/20
o Litter born on 3/27/20
o Litter born on 5/8/20
o Litter born on 5/4/20
o Litter born on 3/28/20

Failure to provide acquisition and disposition information does not allow APHIS officials to trace animals to premises
where they have resided or are currently located and can interfere with the ability to properly identify dogs.

Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose all required information
concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or

her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of. The records shall include any offspring
born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control. The licensee must make, keep and maintain
all required acquisition and disposition information for all adult dogs and puppies that are under his possession or under
his control at any time.

2.75(a)(1)(vii)(A)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee sold 43 puppies that do not have their breeds documented on the disposition form. The term “Unlisted
Breed” is used in column F on the disposition form in place of the actual breed. At least 13 additional puppies have the
wrong breed listed in column F of their disposition forms. The licensee stated that some of these puppies were cross
breeds that were not in the computer system used to input the information on the form, but APHIS Form 7006, Record of
Disposition of Dogs and Cats, states that if the animal is a mixed breed then list the 2 dominant breeds. Failure to
document the correct breed on the disposition form can interfere with APHIS official’s ability to properly identify animals
and to trace animals to their destinations.

Disposition information must include a description of each dog including the dog’s breed. The licensee must ensure that
all disposition forms include the correct breed of dog.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Three-hundred and thirty-six puppies have no transport information documented on their disposition forms. Transport
information must be provided to allow APHIS officials to monitor the movement of animals from their point of origin to their

final destination and to identify individuals who may have had direct contact with the puppy during transport.

Disposition forms must include all required transportation information including method of transport and the name of the
carrier or intermediate handler. The licensee must ensure that all disposition forms include the required transportation
information.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is not using APHIS Form 7005, Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand, to document the required
acquisition information for at least 171 adult dogs on the premises. The licensee is using APHIS Form 7019, Record of
Animals on Hand (Other than Dogs and Cats) to document the acquisition information for each dog. During a courtesy
visit to the facility on 03-March-2021, the inspector provided the licensee with APHIS Form 7005, but the licensee has
failed to input the information for each dog onto the form by the time of the inspection.

Failure to use APHIS Form 7005 does not ensure that the necessary information is documented for each dog which could
interfere with APHIS official's ability to identify dogs and trace the animals back to their locations of origin.

Each dealer shall use Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS Form 7005) to make, keep, and maintain
all required information. The licensee must complete APHIS Form 7005 with the necessary information for each dog
residing on the premises. The licensee must ensure that APHIS Form 7005 is completed for all dogs that are acquired.

Records, disposition.
The licensee destroyed the acquisition information (cage cards) for 505 puppies. Failure to maintain the acquisition
information for the required amount of time could interfere with APHIS official’s ability to properly identify and trace
animals.
No dealer, exhibitor, broker, operator of an auction, carrier, or intermediate handler shall, for a period of 1 year, destroy or
dispose of, without the consent in writing of the Administration, any books, records, documents, or other papers required
to be kept and maintained. The licensee must maintain all acquisition information, including cage cards, for all adult dogs
and puppies. The licensee must ensure that all required documents are kept for at least one year after the final
disposition of the animal.

Housing facilities, general.
Within the sheltered housing building there are 3 enclosures, containing a total of 3 adult dogs and 13 puppies, that have
an opening cut in the fencing that will accommodate a self-feeder. The opening is located along the floor and did not
contain self-feeders at the time of the inspection. The openings are large enough to allow a puppy to escape from the
enclosure and one puppy was observed placing his head through the opening. Failure of the enclosure to contain the
animals could result in injury, inability to access food and water, and even death.

Housing facilities for dogs must protect the animals from injuries and contain the animals securely. The licensee must
alter the enclosures in a manner that removes the openings and eliminates the ability of the puppies to escape. The
licensee must ensure that all enclosures contain the animals securely at all times.
To be corrected by: April 15, 2021

3.1(c)(1)(ii)

Housing facilities, general.
Inside the sheltered housing building, enclosures #13, #14, #15, and #16 each have a self-feeder attached to the front
gate with twisted wire. The sharp ends of the wire are protruding into the enclosure and are located at the level of the
dogs. The inspectors observed the dogs coming into direct contact with these sharp points.

One covered outdoor enclosure, containing 3 dogs, has a dog igloo that serves as the shelter. The shelter no longer
contains a wind and rain break at the entrance, but part of its metal door frame is still attached to the shelter opening.
The metal frame has broken and created a sharp point at the level of the dogs.

In one enclosure, containing 1 adult dog and 3 puppies, the sharp ends of metal screws are protruding into the interior of
the whelping box and are located at the level of the adult dog.

The sharp points created by the twisted wire, broken door frame, and metal screws could cause injury to the animals.

Housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged edges that could injure the animals. The licensee must either
remove the broken metal door frame, twisted wire, and sharp ends of the screws or alter them in a manner that eliminates
the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures remain safe for the dogs at all times.

3.1(f)

Housing facilities, general.
Two pipes drain contaminated wastewater, food waste, and solid fecal material from the indoor housing area directly into
2 covered outdoor enclosures. All the waste material then passes through these enclosures to gutters that carry the

waste to the end of the building.

As the two pipes exit the indoor housing area they drain onto a small ledge along the backside of the dog enclosures and
the waste material runs down the wall to the floor of the enclosures, causing an accumulation of wet fecal material and
contaminated liquid waste on the ledge and walls and a buildup of solid fecal material between the wall and the flooring in
the back of the enclosures and along one side of one of the enclosures. The enclosure that has a heavy accumulation of
fecal material built up along both walls has a very strong odor. Approximately 8 dogs in these covered outdoor
enclosures are directly exposed to this contaminated water and fecal material. In one of the enclosures there was rodent
fecal material on the ledge, indicating that they are feeding on the accumulated waste material.

Waste from the sheltered enclosures is washed into a gutter system that drains to the outside through a corner of the
building. There is a large pile of fecal material and organic waste outside the building where the gutter empties.
Wastewater and rainwater flow through this pile and into another outdoor enclosure housing approximately 11 dogs which
were observed by the inspectors to be standing and walking in it.

Housing facility operators must provide for the removal, and disposal of animal and food wastes and other fluids and
wastes in a manner that minimizes contamination and disease risks. The dogs in this situation are directly exposed to the
fecal contaminated waste of many other dogs. This greatly increases the possibility of spreading parasites and infectious
agents and elevates the risk of disease for the exposed animals. This facility has had 2 separate outbreaks of parvo virus
diarrhea in the last year.

The drainage and waste disposal system must be modified so dogs are not directly exposed to contaminated wastewater

passing from one area to another, so that solid waste does not accumulate outside buildings where run-off can
contaminate other enclosures, and to ensure proper drainage and waste disposal for all animal areas.

Outdoor housing facilities.
Five large outdoor enclosures that house approximately 40 dogs, have insufficient shade or shelter for the dogs they
house. Two enclosures, housing a total of approximately 20 dogs, have an insufficient shade structure to contain all the
dogs at one time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun. Many of these are large, heavy coated breeds and in
the last week there have been two days where the outdoor temperature exceeded 80 degrees Fahrenheit. The shade
that is present in these enclosures is provided by rectangular sheets of metal roofing tied onto the corner of the
enclosures.

Two enclosures, housing a total of approximately 12 dogs, have no shade at all. The licensee stated that he has ordered
shade structures for these enclosures, but they are not yet completed at the time of the inspection.

Sufficient shade to provide protection from prolonged exposure to the harmful rays of the sun is essential for the welfare
of all animals. Prolonged exposure can easily cause heat stress, and in extreme cases, heat stroke that can lead to
death. Large, heavy coated breeds that still have their full winter coats at this time of year are particularly vulnerable.

One or more separate outside areas of shade that are large enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect
them from the direct rays of the sun must be provided in each enclosure. The licensee must ensure that all outdoor
enclosures contain an adequate amount of shaded areas at all times.

To be corrected by: April 17, 2021

At least 5 of the covered outdoor enclosures, housing a total of 25 dogs, do not have a shelter that is large enough to
accommodate all the dogs in the enclosure compliantly. In addition, 3 outdoor enclosures, housing a total of
approximately 20 dogs, do not have a shelter that is large enough to accommodate all the dogs in the enclosure
compliantly. In all 8 of these affected enclosures there is not enough shelter space to allow all the dogs to sit, stand, and
lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. Failure to provide sufficient shelter space may result in the inability of a
dog to escape adverse weather conditions and the health and well-being of the animal could suffer.

Outdoor enclosures must include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal and that are large
enough to allow each animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely. The
licensee must either alter the current shelters in a manner that will provide adequate space for each dog or provide
enough compliant shelters to accommodate the number of dogs in each enclosure. The licensee must ensure that all
outdoor enclosures contain shelters that provide sufficient space for the dogs at all times.

3.4(b)(3)

Outdoor housing facilities.
Three of the large outdoor enclosures, housing a total of approximately 23 dogs, do not have adequate wind and rain
breaks at the entrances to their shelters to keep out wind and rain. All these shelters have tattered pieces of what appears
to be a burlap type material at the entrances that served as wind and rain breaks. The temperatures during the previous
week had ranged from the 40s to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.


All dogs housed outdoors need to have access to adequate protection from wind, rain, snow and temperature extremes.
The lack of adequate wind and rain breaks on these shelters could expose dogs to the elements and temperature
extremes that can profoundly impact their physical and emotional wellbeing and lead to illness.

All shelters must have adequate wind and rain breaks at the entrance. The licensee must add wind and rain breaks to the
entrances of the affected shelters and ensure that all outdoor shelters have a wind and rain break at all times.
To be corrected by: April 17, 2021
3.4(b)(4)

Outdoor housing facilities.
In one outdoor enclosure, housing 11 dogs, the shelter has insufficient bedding material. A thin layer of straw is covering
approximately a quarter of the floor space inside the shelter and the rest of the floor is completely devoid of bedding
material. At least 2 covered outdoor enclosures, containing a total of 9 dogs, each have a shelter with either no bedding
material at all or just a few strands of straw. Temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit had been experienced in this
location in the previous three days and were forecast in the next 12 hours. The licensee was unaware that the shelters
were lacking bedding material.

For dogs housed outdoors, protection from the cold and extreme temperatures in essential for wellbeing and an important
part of protection from physical stress and disease.

Shelters in outdoor enclosures must contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 °F (10
°C). Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 °F (1.7 °C) or lower. The licensee must add
sufficient bedding to the affected shelters and ensure all shelters contain bedding when the ambient temperatures require

it.
Correction date: The licensee was notified that the shelters required bedding at the time of the inspection (April 7, 2021)
and was reminded during the exit interview that all outdoor shelters must have bedding every time the temperature drops
below 50 degrees Fahrenheit.
3.11(c)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
One of the empty enclosures in the covered outdoor area is being used to store housing materials and has an
accumulation of trash, organic material, and dirty or discarded food or water bowls. There was a pile of dirt and organic
waste material in the aisle outside the enclosure along with multiple small sections of unused flooring, and a dead rat was
lying on the ground a few feet away.

In the outdoor areas, there are many pieces of white and blue plastic bags littered around the 6 large outdoor enclosures
housing more than 40 dogs. One of the enclosures, housing 4 dogs, has an approximately 2 to 3-foot piece of blue
plastic caught in the fence and extending into the enclosure. Another enclosure with 8 dogs has a similar piece of white
plastic caught in the fence and extending into the enclosure. An enclosure with 10 dogs has many smaller pieces of white
and blue plastic caught against the inside of the fence. Another enclosure with 11 dogs has many small pieces of this
plastic on the ground.

Areas where trash, junk, and discarded waste materials are allowed to accumulate can serve as breeding and living areas
for rodents and other pests. Discarded pieces of plastic bags can be ingested by dogs and cause intestinal problems and
dangerous obstructions.


Premises where housing facilities are located, including enclosures and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in
good repair to protect the animals from injury, and to reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other
pests and vermin. The licensee must remove all the trash, organic material, and discarded items from the dog
enclosures. The licensee must ensure that the premises of housing facilities are free of trash, discarded materials, and
waste products at all times.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
A concrete ledge runs along the back wall of the covered outdoor enclosures and this ledge has a large amount of rodent
feces on its surface. Approximately 20 dogs are housed in these enclosures. The licensee stated that he has filled in a
few rat holes located near these dog enclosures and the inspectors observed a dead rat on the outside of the sheltered
housing building. Rodent control methods are being used inside the sheltered building but there are no rodent control
methods in place for the covered outdoor enclosures that surround the exterior of the sheltered building. Failure to have
an effective pest control program could increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs should they come into
contact with rodents and/or rodent droppings, as well as increase the potential for any dog food that is present to become
contaminated.

An effective program for the control of insects, external parasites, and birds and mammals that are pests must be
established and maintained. The licensee must establish an effective program to control the rodents located in the
covered outdoor enclosure areas. The licensee must ensure that all pest control programs are effective at all times.

Veterinary care for dogs.
Female Samoyed (ear tattoo #2) has poor dental health. Nearly the entire surface of the upper right and left cheek teeth
are covered in a thick brown tartar. The gums are moderately reddened and have receded away from the teeth. There is
a line of gray colored material located along the gum line of the upper right cheek teeth. The licensee stated that he knew
the dog’s teeth were poor and planned to have them cleaned by the attending veterinarian in the near future, but the
condition of the dog’s teeth, as well as the date the condition was identified and the treatment plan are not documented
and no medical record exists. Documenting veterinary care concerns assists in confirming that problems have been
identified and treatment has been sought in a timely manner, as well as establishes a documented medical history for the
animal.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records which include the date and description of the problem (such as disease,
illness, or injury), examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedures performed.
The licensee must create a medical record for Samoyed #2 which includes a description of the animal’s problem, the date
the problem was identified and the plan to treat the problem. The licensee must ensure that all veterinary care concerns
are documented and maintained in a medical record and available for APHIS inspection.
To be corrected by: The licensee was instructed at the time of the inspection (April 7, 2021) and during the exit interview
that all veterinary care concerns must be fully documented.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
