FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the vertical wood slats along the back wall of the goat enclosure is broken/missing which has created a gap
at the bottom. This hole is sufficiently large to allow a small goat to pass through it, and in fact, one of the goats
was observed outside of its' enclosure.
There are 2 thick blunt bolts located on the right side of the entrance gate that are protruding approx. 2 inches into
the enclosure. The lower bolt can potentially injure a pig if it should make contact with it.
All enclosures shall be constructed & maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The bales of hay are currently being stored uncovered in the center walkway in the barn. One of the stalls in this
area is being used to store the grain & dry feed. A bowl of dry cat food which is being offered to the barn cats was
observed inside this feed room as well as a chicken. Any feral animal easily gain access into the feed room or on
the hay, and in fact, a barn cats was observed sitting on the hay during the inspection.
This method of storing feed and bedding does not minimize the risk of contamination by vermin and does not
protect the food & bedding from contamination by avian & mammalian wastes which were observed throughout this
barn. These wastes can transmit bacteria & parasites which can be harmful to the regulated mammals.
All food and bedding shall be stored in facilities which adequately protects it from contamination.
