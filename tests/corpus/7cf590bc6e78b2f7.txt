2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- The licensee did not have an up-to-date APHIS Form 7002, Program of Veterinary Care, on hand. The Program
of Veterinary Care form was last signed by the Attending Veterinarian on 31 January 2014. This form must be fully
completed and signed by the current attending veterinarian. The veterinarian must also visit the facility at least
annually. The licensee called a new attending veterinarian who completed a new Program of Veterinary care and
emailed the form to me.
To be corrected from this point forward.
2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- At the time of the inspection there was a pig named Wilbur in the petting zoo area with excessively long hooves.
The lateral claws on both back feet were long and flattened. Wilbur did have a normal postural stance. The licensee
stated that the local Agriculture department comes out and trims the hooves. Excessive growth of hooves changes
the angle of the toes, affects the gait, and can lead to chronic problems in the feet and legs such as arthritis. The
licensee shall get Wilbur's hooves trimmed to ensure his health and well being.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
- The animal inventory was not up to date at the time of the inspection. Four cubs were born at the facility on
1-19-2015 according to an IES investigator that was at the facility on 1-20-15. The four cubs were not included on
the animal inventory at the time of the inspection. Also according to the licensee the binturong named Ogami died
on 3-3-15 and a Muntjac deer named Whisper died on 2-21-15 and both of these animals are listed on the inventory
with dates of acquisition and no date of death or disposition is present on the inventory. The licensee stated that he
acquired a serval kit 12 days ago and the kit was not on the inventory. The acquisition information must include the
date the animal was acquired as well as information concerning the person the animal was acquired from including
name, complete mailing address, USDA license number (if applicable), driver(cid:25)'s license number, and vehicle license
number. Specifically, there was not information on the acquisition of the new serval kit that was on display at thepark at the time of the inspection. The inventory form must be updated continuously as the inventory changes.
2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
- The facility is currently not conducting guided tours. Multiple areas were identified during the inspection as having
no or inadequate public barriers. These areas include the deer enclosure, the petting zoo, and the kangaroo pen at
the back of the park. In any area where the public is allowed to feed or is able to physically contact enclosed
animals there must be either an easily identifiable park employee, or a public barrier sufficient to keep the public at
least 3 feet away from the enclosure wall. The facility must provide public barriers in all areas of the park. In areas
where the facility will allow contact and/orfeeding of the animals, there must be an easily identifiable park employee
present to supervise the interaction with the animals.
3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- Peeling paint and excessive rust on numerous slats, access door, and the floor slats of the bird cage type primary
enclosure for two ring tailed lemurs, Tarzan and Nanners. The rusted surfaces were extensive and appeared to
affect the structural strength of the enclosure. Additionally, the surfaces of this enclosure have a buildup of grime
and dust and have not been appropriately cleaned or sanitized. Rusted surfaces cannot be adequately cleaned or
sanitized and pose a risk to the health of the animals due to an accumulation of food debris, excreta, and grime
which may harbor infectious organisms. Excessive rust may also reduce the structural strength of the enclosure
which can lead to injury or escape if the caging should break or collapse. Surfaces that come into contact with
nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust that prevents the required cleaning and sanitization or that
affects the structural strength of the enclosure.
Corrected during the inspection by moving lemurs into another enclosure.
3.80(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- The bird cage-type enclosure housing 2 ring tailed lemurs, Nanners and Tarzan, had cut sections of electrical wire
twisted through the latching mechanism to secure the access door and metal wires were used to secure the food
and water receptacles to the side of the enclosure. These wires had sharp points that were within reach of the
lemurs, posing a risk of injury to the animals. All sharp points and edges must be removed from this enclosure, and
ongoing maintenance of all facility enclosures must be performed to continually monitor potential hazards.
3.125(a) REPEATFACILITIES, GENERAL.
- The grizzly bear enclosure and black bear's enclosure had rust on the fencing panels with excessive rust noted on
the north side of the black bear enclosure. The licensee had painted all of the welds in these enclosures, however,
the panels are still rusted. There are loose boards on the top of the shade shelter area for the grizzly bear. These
areas are in disrepair and are structurally unsound, posing a risk of injury or possible escape.
- At the back of the enclosure, housing the 3 red kangaroos, along the east fence line there is a hole that appears to
have been dug by an agar for another fencing post. This hole has two flat long rocks laying on top but they do not
completely cover this hole, leaving a significant gap which poses a risk for injury and entrapment of a foot. The
licensee placed a large flat rock over this hole during the inspection.
-The chain link fence of the primary enclosure, housing a 13 year old male tiger named Rajah, a 15 year old lion
named Pharaoh, an 11 year old female lioness named Kiara, a 5 year old female tiger named Shakita, an 11 month
old male tiger named Maximus as well as other large cats, is approximately 10.5 feet in height. There is nothing else
at the top of this fencing. This fence height is inadequate to sufficiently contain the enclosed animals at all times.
The licensee has welded extension poles on the top of this fence, which when complete, would make the fence 16
feet in height. However, no fencing has been stretched on the upper section. The licensee must modify these
enclosures or move the large cats to enclosures that are constructed of such material that is appropriate for the
animals, of such strength that is structurally sound, and are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and securely contain the animals.
The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The
indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- Numerous bags of dog food were being stored at a barn away from the main facility. The bags were not properly
stacked and were sitting in the middle of an open barn aisle. One bag of feed was torn open and had not been
thrown away. This feed is subject to contamination from a variety of sources, including pests and wild animals.
Feed must be properly stored and adequately protected from contamination to protect the health of facility animals.

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- The facility perimeter fence has two areas that are not providing adequate security. In the corner behind the feed
storage room, there is a large hole underneath the fence. The facility was clearly aware of this hole, as severalpieces of metal had been placed into the hole in an attempt to block it. This is not sufficient and this hole provides
an easy way for animals to enter or exit the facility. On the fence separating the main park from the camel
enclosure, there is a large double door gate which was not latched. The facility has attempted to block these doors
from opening by driving t-posts on both sides. The doors are so loose and wobbly, however, that it would be easy
for unauthorized personnel to slip through the opening. Also, t-posts are not adequate security since they can
easily be removed by hand. Perimeter fence security is critical to prevent unwanted animals and persons from
entering the facility and to serve as a secondary means of containment to the park animals. The facility must
properly fill the hole under the fence and must repair and properly secure the double door gate. The perimeter fence
must be properly repaired and maintained at all times.

3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
- The water receptacles for several animals in the park including; Limpopo(serval), Dexter (camel), Orion(cougar)
and Shakita (tiger) had an accumulation of reddish, greenish brown algae debris on the sides and bottom of the
automatic watering receptacles. This is an indication that the water receptacles are not being adequately cleaned,
which could result in contamination of the drinking water. Lack of access to potable water is extremely dangerous
for animals. Water needs to be provided frequently enough to meet the physiologic needs of the animals and to
prevent dehydration which can lead to serious health issues, such as renal failure. If potable water is not accessible
to the animals at all times, it must be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal.
Frequency of watering shall consider age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. All water receptacles
shall be kept clean and sanitary.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with facility representative, IES, 2 USDA APHIS AC VMOs and one USDA
APHIS AC Supervisor.
