3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on the interior fiberglass wall of sixteen
enclosures. Fourty dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in outdoor housing. The affected area covers
approximately 30 to 40 percent of the interior wall area. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of
excreta and other disease hazards. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease
or health risks. Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly increase the risk of disease hazards for the dogs.
Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the animals. All surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and
sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. The applicant must ensure
that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11
(B) of this sub part to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards.
3.11(a)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
* Bird droppings were observed collecting on top of the metal pipe enclosure frame. Ten dogs are in contact with the
affected area located in outdoor housing. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, excreta
and other disease hazards. It indicates unsanitary living conditions exist that could increase the risks of disease
transmission, which negatively affects the health of the dogs. Adequate cleaning is a crucial aspect of animal husbandry

and helps to reduce disease hazards, odors and pests. The applicant must remove excreta and food waste from the
primary enclosure daily and from under the primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive
accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce
disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class B license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspection(s) or by December 4, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license
fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
