3.15(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
None of the four transport primary enclosures which are not permanently affixed to the conveyance had on their tops or
on one or more of the sides “Live Animals” or arrows to indicate correct orientation. The enclosures were not in use at the
time of inspection.
Identification of the enclosures as transporting animals is necessary such as for identification in case or accident or other
situations when a third party may need to rescue the animals from the conveyance.
All enclosures carrying dogs in transport must be marked with “Live Animals” in letters at least 1 inch high and with arrows
or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the primary enclosure.
Correct by 8/23/2022 or prior to transportation of animals covered by this regulation.
3.15(c)(1)(iii)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
At least three of the four primary enclosures used to transport dogs had maximum ventilation openings of approximately
9.6 on all four sides instead of at least 8% of each wall and a total of 14% of the total combined surface area of the
primary enclosures. The enclosures were not in use at the time of inspection.
Sufficient ventilation openings are necessary to provide optimum airflow, such as to prevent overheating and provide


adequate airflow for breathing.
All enclosures must provide the minimum amount of ventilation openings as required by 3.5 (c), including 3.5 (c)(iii). While
additional ventilation openings were being added at the time of inspection, all enclosures used to transport regulated
animals must corrected.
Correct by 8/23/2022 or prior to transportation of animals covered by this regulation.
3.15(c)(2)

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
None of the four transport primary enclosures which are not permanently affixed to the conveyance had any projecting
rims or similar devices to prevent obstruction of the ventilation holes. The enclosures were not in use at the time of
inspection.
Projecting rims or similar devices prevent primary enclosures from coming into contact or close to another surface,
resulting in inadequate ventilation which may cause stress or negatively impact the health of animals housed within the
enclosures.
All such transport enclosures used to hold dogs must have a projecting rim or other device large enough to provide a
minimum air circulation space of 0.75 inches between the primary enclosure and anything the enclosure is place against.
Correct by 8/23/2022 or prior to transportation of animals covered by this regulation.
