2.38(b) Repeat

Miscellaneous.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process from 12:16 PM to 1:20
PM on 16-NOV-2022.

This is a 2nd/Repeat attempted inspection. Following the first attempted inspection, the registrant informed the inspector
(via voicemail message) that the registrant would be onsite and conducting regulated activity on the day of this 2nd
attempted inspection (16-NOV-2022).

The inspector arrived at the property at 12:10 PM, but because of a "Private Property - No Trespassing" sign located at
the turnoff to the property, the inspector called the registrant and left a message at 12:16 PM (after driving to an area with
cellular service). Emails were promptly sent to both email contacts listed in the registrant's record (12:24 PM), and a text
was sent to the primary contact's phone number at 12:28 PM. After receiving no response, the inspector approached the
residence at 1:10 PM, and spoke with a family member. The family member expressed limited knowledge regarding the
registrant's regulated activity, and the inspector was informed that no one associated with the registration was available at


the time to conduct an inspection. The inspector left a "Sorry We Missed You" flyer with business card, and left the
property at 1:20 PM.
