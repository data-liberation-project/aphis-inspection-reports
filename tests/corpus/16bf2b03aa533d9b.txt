2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The smaller of two prairie dogs is missing hair over its upper back in an almost rectangular pattern about 2 1/2inx 1
1/2in in size. In addition, hair is sparse/missing on its face. The visible skin is pigmented and smooth. The attending
veterinarian has been contacted about other other animals and facility inspections/program of veterinary care but
has not examined the prairie dog. Appropriate veterinary care is necessary to ensure that medical problems are
addressed. The facility shall have the veterinarian evaluate the prairie dog in order to establish an appropriate
treatment plan.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility has added the following animals to outdoor enclosures in their seasonal exhibit: zebra, cavy, deer and
African Crested porcupines. Facility plans on resubmitting a variance request but has not yet done so. A secondary
perimeter fence is required to ensure that the animals are not injured/distressed by outside animals/wildlife/humans
and to act as a secondary containment system in case of escape. The housing facilities for all the outdoor non-farm
animal species exhibited must be enclosed by a secondary perimeter fence of at least 6 ft height or an addition to
the current variance needs to be obtained.
The following non-compliances from the 10-15-2014 inspection still have correction time remaining: 2.40a1, 2.75b1,
3.78a, 3.80b2i, and 3.81.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
