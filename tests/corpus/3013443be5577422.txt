ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A written program of veterinary care was not available for review at the time of this inspection. A formal relationship
with a veterinarian is very important for the health and well being of the facility animals. The veterinarian should be
involved in all aspects of animal care including decisions on frequency of routine health visits to the facility by the
veterinarian, determining preventative health protocols for the animals, and consultations concerning problems with
the animals' health, behavior, husbandry and diet. A document generated by the veterinarian outlining their plan to
accomplish the above functions needs to be available for review during USDA inspections.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the time of inspection, a bobcat was observed sitting in her enclosure with a hunched over posture. The bobcat’s
eyes were squinted and tongue was exposed as if she were breathing rapidly. The bobcat appeared to be showing
signs of pain and/or distress. When the licensee approached the bobcat to get a closer look, she growled but did not
move from her position in the enclosure. The licensee informed the inspector that she did not eat that morning and
is also usually more active. The facility has noticed the issues with the bobcat but has not contacted the veterinarian
yet on the health status of the bobcat. The bobcat must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for further diagnosis
and treatment.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Throughout the facility, there are no public barriers in place for regulated animals. The general viewing public has
the potential to walk up to any enclosure. Having this risk can lead to injury or harm to both the animals and general
public. Animals must be handled so that there is a sufficient barrier and distance between them and the general
public.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosure for the facility’s fox is made up of linked wires held together by four large wooden posts. On the right
side of the enclosure, towards the flooring was a gaping hole large enough to fit a hand through it. This gaping hole
poses a risk of injury to both the animal and the general public. Outdoor housing facilities must be in good repair to
protect the animal from injury and also contain them.
