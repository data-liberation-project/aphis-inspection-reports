Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
***One 7-month-old male tricolor Beagle dog was observed to be very thin during the inspection. The ribs, lumbar
vertebrae, and pelvic bones were easily visible. There was evidence of bony prominences and an obvious waist. Also,
there was brown loose watery stool present in the enclosure. The dog arrived on 9 Sept 2021 with a body condition score
of 2.5/5 and weight of 7.74 kg. The dog weighed 7.97 kg on 06 Oct 2021 and began an oral test article study on 07 Oct
2021. The dog is weighed weekly and has shown a consistent decline in weight. In six weeks, he has lost 12.17% of his
body weight. Veterinary staff reported the weight of the dog on 17 Nov 2021 as 6.654 kg in the morning and 7 kg after he
was fed with a body condition score of 1.5/5. The dog was inconsistently eating the dry kibble food according to facility
staff.

Initially, the veterinary staff advised the research staff on 19 Oct 2021 to increase the caloric intake by adding 4
tablespoons of peanut butter to the kibble. During the inspection there were no records found to verify that this was done,
and the staff could not confirm that this treatment was given. On 27 Oct 2021 veterinary staff advised the research staff to
increase the amount to 8 tablespoons of peanut butter to be added to the food. Records verify the 8 tablespoons of
peanut butter was started on 29 Oct 2021. Despite this increased caloric intake, the dog continued to lose weight. With a


slow continual weight loss still being observed, the veterinary staff changed the treatment plan from peanut butter to
canned dog food on 07 Nov 2021 and ran bloodwork on 10 Nov 2021. The blood panel showed an increased white blood
cell count (reported as “monocytosis”) and “inflammation (likely chronic), resulting in decreased appetite and reduced
body weight.” On 15 Nov 2021 the canned wet food was changed to a critical nutrition wet food, which the veterinarian
states as the cause of the loose stool observed during the inspection. To date no further diagnostic work has been done.

In order to protect the health and well-being of the animals the research facility must establish and maintain programs of
adequate veterinary care that provides appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
This dog must be given a complete examination and a diagnostic and treatment plan must be established and followed to
address the unexplained chronic weight loss.

***Two adult Yorkshire pigs were observed as having overgrown hooves. A few of the toes on the pigs were turning
inward due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities
which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s program of preventative veterinary care, they must ensure
that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
