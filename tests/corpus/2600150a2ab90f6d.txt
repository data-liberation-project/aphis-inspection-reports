ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1620 on
27-Apr-17. I went to the licensee's facility. I did not see anyone around. I knocked on the door to one of the barns
in the front of the property. No one responded. I called three phone numbers and left messages on two of those.
The other phone number had a full mailbox. I honked my horn. After waiting about 15 minutes, an employee drove
past. She was not comfortable going along on the inspection as she hasn't done it before. She attempted to
contact one of the other employees by phone, but was not able to get through to anyone. I told her I would write it
up as an attempted inspection and would try again another day.
End of report.
