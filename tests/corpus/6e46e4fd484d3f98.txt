2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility did not have a written program of veterinary care.
The facility has a part-time attending veterinarian. Facilities that do not have a full-time veterinarian on site must
have a written program of veterinary care in order to ensure that there is an understanding about expectations for
the care of the animals. Failure to maintain a written program of veterinary care could result in failure to ensure
optimal care for the animals.
The facility should create a new written program of veterinary care in collaboration with their attending veterinarian.
To be corrected by 9/3/2020.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A facility record titled "Pearl's Summary (January 2020 - June 2020)" pertaining to Pearl, an eight year old California
sea lion, stated: “On 5/13 it was documented that she had a large swollen bite on top of her head…” This injury was
not discussed with the attending veterinarian.
Daily observation of all animals in order to assess their health and well-being is an essential element of adequate
care, and any issues related to health and well-being must be promptly communicated to the veterinarian, who can
then make a determination as to whether any additional assessment / intervention / treatment may be needed.
Failure to communicate issues to the attending veterinarian could potentially result in unnecessary suffering and / or
a poor medical outcome.
The facility must ensure that any issues concerning the health and well-being of the animals are promptly
communicated to the attending (or substitute) veterinarian. To be corrected from this time forward.This was a focused inspection on facilities and records.
This inspection was conducted on 8/19/2020, and an exit interview occurred with facility representatives on
8/27/2020.
