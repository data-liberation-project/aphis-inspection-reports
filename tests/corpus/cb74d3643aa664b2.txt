2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) approved by their attending veterinarian; however, it
still lacks sufficient detail regarding capture and restraint methods for hoof stock, foxes, and wallaby and a detailed
description of products used for parasite control including product names, dosages, length and frequency of
treatment. An incomplete PVC does not allow the attending veterinarian appropriate authority to ensure the
provisions of adequate veterinary care and to oversee treatment plans and procedures regarding the animals.
Update the written PVC so that it reflects the care being provided to the animals and to ensure sufficient oversight
by the attending veterinarian.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength.
There were several areas within enclosures needing repair or having objects that could cause injury.
The enclosure housing 1 camel:
**Wooden rafters had 2 areas with broken wood having jagged edges and sharp points.
**Nails in the rafters and along vertical posts
**Cattle panels protruding into the enclosure causing sharp points
The enclosure housing 3 white-tail deer and 1 llama:
**A metal gate laying on the ground
**A pile of concrete debris with posts and wire sticking out
Failing to keep enclosures in good repair and free of sharp objects such as wood, nails, metal and wire creates
physical hazards that may cause injury to the animals. Repair, replace or remove all physical hazards from these
enclosures to maintain all enclosures in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 22 June 2014
3.125(c)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Storage.Produce including lettuce and melons are being stored on a shelf at room temperature in the lower level of the barn.
These food items are not being stored in a manner that protects the supplies from contamination by vermin and
perishable food items not stored by refrigeration can deteriorate. Store perishable food in a manner that protects it
from deterioration and contamination. Correct by 21 June 2014.
3.130
WATERING.
The plastic kiddie pool in the enclosure housing two wallaby contains dirty, green water with insects swimming in it.
Water receptacles not kept clean and sanitary may provide breeding areas for insects and increase disease
hazards, if the animals use this as their drinking source. Clean the pool and maintain on a more frequent basis to
prevent such risks. Correct by 21 June 2014.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Housekeeping
There are excess materials such as fencing and wood leaning against one side of the New Guinea Singing Dog's
enclosure. The small shelter structure in the enclosure housing three whitetail deer and one llama has excess items
being stored inside the shelter including plastic wrap material. The area where the whitetail deer feed is stored is
cluttered with miscellaneous items and the shelf above where produce is stored contains tools and other items that
should not be stored directly above food items. Remove items that are unnecessary to the care of the animals and
keep premises clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices and reduce living and breeding areas for
rodents.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Pest control.
Three occupied bird nests were observed in the rafters of the enclosure housing 2 armadillos and 1 new guinea
singing dog. A dead bird was observed in the enclosure housing 6 fox. There also could be seen areas of bird
feces along fencing in these enclosures. Failing to adequately control avian pests within enclosures contributes to
unsanitary conditions and husbandry of the animals. These conditions can increase the risk of disease hazards for
the animals. Eliminate and control the avian pests from all animal enclosures. Correct by 22 June 2014.
