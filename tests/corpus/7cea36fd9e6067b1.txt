ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The male, white-tailed deer named "Duke" has been treated for a congenital mouth condition for years. However,
during this inspection, a lump the size of a tennis ball was observed on his lower, left jaw. According to the keeper,
this lump was observed to be much smaller a few days ago but has now increased in size. This deer must be seen
by the attending veterinarian to determine was is causing the swelling and address the issue.
