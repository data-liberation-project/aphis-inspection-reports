Housekeeping.
The following housekeeping items were identified during the inspection.
1. The back room of the store is used as a general storeroom for equipment and supplies. It was disorganized and
cluttered in appearance as a result of the large number and variety of supplies, boxes, containers, and cleaning
equipment that were present on the shelves, flat surfaces, and the floor space in the room.
2. There were 4 AWA covered animals that were currently under treatment for medical conditions that were being
housed in the back room but there was not a separate area of the room designated for animal housing. One
enclosure with one rabbit was located directly on the floor next to the walkway that led to a separate larger storage
room; one enclosure with 2 hamsters was on top of the clothes dryer; and one enclosure with one rabbit was
located on a shelf next to some surplus supplies.
The disorganized and cluttered back room does not facilitate carrying out the prescribed housekeeping practices
that ensure premises are kept clean and this is not an acceptable condition for an area being used to house
animals. It is not appropriate to place animal enclosures on the floor, on appliances, or alongside stored materials.
Animals should be housed in areas of the facility designated for animal housing that are kept neat and free of
clutter, equipment and stored materials.
The back room needs to be cleaned and organized, and one section of the back room should be designated to be
used solely as an animal housing area that will be maintained appropriately.
Correct items (1) and (2) above by 3/10/15.
