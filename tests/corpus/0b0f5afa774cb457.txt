2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A significant changes was made to an activity using a regulated species without Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (IACUC) approval.
Ewes and fetuses had organs collected under deep anesthesia and died due to exsanguination rather than the
administration of a barbiturate euthanasia solution prior to organ collection as specified in the protocol approved by
the IACUC. As the animals were deeply anesthetized, the affected animals should not have experienced pain or
distress.
IACUC subsequently approved a protocol amendment that described the procedures used and that was submitted
by the principal investigator prior to the inspection.
Significant changes in the care and use of animals in ongoing activities may adversely affect animal well-being. The
IACUC should review proposed significant changes to activities involving animals prior to the implementation of the
activities.
Corrected prior to inspection.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a Facility Representative.
