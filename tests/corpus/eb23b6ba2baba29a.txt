SANITATION.
***In the enclosure housing 2 goats, there was an excessive accumulation of feces present on the ground. Due to
the accumulation, the animals could not lay in their enclosure without becoming contaminated by the waste
material. Animal enclosures must be cleaned routinely in order to provide for appropriate animal husbandry
standards, to reduce disease transmission, and to prevent the animals from becoming contaminated or soiled. The
licensee must clean these enclosures and ensure that all enclosures housing animals are cleaned as often as
necessary to promote appropriate husbandry standards.
To be corrected by 7/18/14.
A focused inspection on the educational and outreach animals was conducted.
Inspection and exit-briefing was conducted with the general curator.
