In the small dog indoor housing facility, two Yorkshire Terriers were entangled in the strings of a worn carpet
square. The carpet square had unraveled and the strings were wrapped around the hind legs of one dog multiple
times and also wrapped around the body of the other dog. The strings was loosely wrapped not causing any
injuries.
Worn surfaces can cause injury. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis.
