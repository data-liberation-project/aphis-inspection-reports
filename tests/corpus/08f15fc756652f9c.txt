2.31(c)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC's review of the animal use program had not been conducted at least every six months last year. The
facility's IACUC conducted a review of the animal use program in December 2015 and recently last week
(December 2016). The facility inspection was conducted by members of the IACUC in July 2016, however a review
of the animal use program was not completed at that time. To properly assess the animal use program, ensure that
the IACUC reviews the animal use program and inspects the animal facilities at least once every six months.
Correction: Maintain correct from this date forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
