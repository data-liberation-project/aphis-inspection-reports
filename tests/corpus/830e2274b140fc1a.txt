3.56(b)(1) Repeat

Sanitation.
50 plus percent of the approximately 50 rabbit enclosures have rusted areas on the urine guards. Rusted areas are
porous and cannot be sanitized.

Primary enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized at least once every 30 days in the manner provided in paragraph (b)(3) of
this section.

Remove, replace, or repair the rusted urine guards so that they can be properly sanitized to prevent odor and disease
hazards.
3.56(b)(3)

Sanitation.
The rabbit enclosures are being cleaned with Simple Green Bio Dog Bioactive stain and odor remover, and soap and
water. Neither one of these cleaning processes sanitizes the rabbit enclosures. One rabbit was noted to have a
yellow/green nasal discharge.

Primary enclosures for rabbits shall be sanitized by washing them with hot water (180 °F.) and soap or detergent as in a

mechanical cage washer, or by washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective
disinfectant, or by cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam or flame.

An appropriate method must be used to sanitize the primary enclosures for the rabbits a minimum of every 30 days to
reduce disease hazards.

Facilities, general.
-The male French Alpine goat and the male La Mancha goat got into a fight causing injury to both by one of the goats
breaking through a shared wall.
-The female Holstein cow's outside area had been muddy and the ground is extremely churned up. The uneven mud is
now frozen and there is no area of level ground for the cow to safely walk.
-Approximately 25 sheep in an enclosure with a sign labeled "Group 3 sheep" had sharp points on their primary enclosure
fencing, and a nail sticking out of a fence post. There was hair on the nail, and a sheep was noted with its head out of the
fence near the sharp points.
-Approximately 25 goats in an enclosure with a sign labeled "Group 1, and Group 2 Sheep" had sharp points where the
primary enclosure fence had been cut to allow the goats to stick their head out to get food from the food trough.

The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor
and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals
from injury and to contain the animals.


All facilities must be constructed and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury, and to contain the
animals.
3.127(b) Direct Repeat

Facilities, outdoor.
-A female Holstein cow was standing in mud in its only shelter. There was no bedding in this shelter. The temperature
was 23.8 degrees Fahrenheit with a wind-chill of 16.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
-6 yearling cows shared a shelter with two sides that had holes in them, or were lacking boards. There was snow on the
cows inside this shelter.
-2 dairy goats and 17 yearling goats are housed together. The largest shelters for the goats has a board missing at the
top allowing snow to fall on the animals using the shelter. There are also 2 calf huts in the enclosure and one of the calf
huts has excessive urine and feces in it causing the bedding to be wet.
-3 adult cows housed together had very little clean dry bedding in their shelter and had caked dry mud/feces on their
coats.
-16 sheep in the front pasture had one shelter that is not large enough to contain all animals.
-The male angora goat had removed the front of its shelter that protected it from the prevailing wind. This was corrected
at time of inspection in the presence of the inspectors.

Natural or artificial shelter appropriate to the local climatic conditions for the species concerned shall be provided for all
animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to prevent discomfort to such animals.


Appropriate shelter and bedding must be made available to all animals in these extreme temperatures to afford them
protection and comfort. These animals are suffering due to lack of appropriate shelter and/or bedding.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
The primary enclosure housing 3 male sheep has approximately 12" of manure pack in it.

Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.

Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and
reduce disease hazards.
3.132

Employees.
The French Alpine goat did not receive antibiotic treatment as directed by the facility executive director as no personnel at
the facility felt comfortable giving the injection. Enough adequately trained employees must be utilized to maintain
professionally acceptable levels of husbandry. Employees must receive training in how to administer basic treatments
when the executive director is away or alternatively, they must be instructed to contact the attending veterinarian for
treatment. Delays in treatment could affect the outcome and lead to unnecessary suffering for this animal.
