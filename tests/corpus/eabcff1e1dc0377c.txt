Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The feeders have a layer of grime on the inside of the feeder under the lip where the dogs eat from. These feeders have
not been cleaned on a routine schedule of every two weeks per this regulation. The feeders must be cleaned at least
once every two weeks to prevent an accumulation of debris and grime and to protect the food from contamination. This
needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs.

Veterinary care for dogs.
A male poodle named "Joe", id# 854 was observed favoring his right rear foot. When he was examined closer, it was
noted that he had long nails and his dewclaws on his right rear foot and right front foot were overgrown. The dewclaw
nails were overgrown to the point they were curling back into the pad and his right front dewclaw was imbedded in his foot
pad and could not be removed even when the nail was cut. This dog is very thin with prominent vertebrae, ribs and hip
bones and no visible fat covering. This dog also had severe tarter build up covering his teeth and his gums are red and
irritated. The condition of the mouth could be impacting his ability to eat properly. This dog should be examined by the
attending veterinarian to have his foot pad assessed and the nail trimmed and to assess his dental needs and overall

body condition.
