3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an excessive accumulation of feces in a pen with three puppies, and another pen with a single adult.
Some of the waste was dry and white, indicating that it had been present for longer than a day. Fecal accumulation
serves as a source of contamination, and can also attract flies and other pests. Waste must be removed daily or
more often if needed to allow the animals clean living space and to help protect them from environmental
contamination.
