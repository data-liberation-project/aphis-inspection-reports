2.31(c)(1) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There was no record in recent history of the IACUC's review of the facility's program for humane care and use of
animals. Although the IACUC meets every 6 months, there is no documentation that a program review is being
conducted at those meetings. When asked about this issue, the IACUC chair indicated that their review consisted
only of conducting ongoing review of their active protocols, but nothing concerning the IACUC functions as a whole.
At least once every 6 months, the IACUC must review the university's program for humane care and use of animals
and indicate minor vs. significant deficiencies with plans for correction. IACUC review of this program ensures that
the facility is using their animals in a humane way and providing them with appropriate care in adherence with the
Animal Welfare Act. Correct by completing a thorough review of the facility(cid:25)s program for humane care and use of
animals and continuing to review this program every 6 months as required. This review should include aspects of
animal husbandry, environmental provisions, procedures conducted, veterinary care, and all other items pertaining
to the humane care and use of animals.
This is a repeat non-compliant item that was cited on March 6, 2012 and remains uncorrected.
2.31(c)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC has not prepared a semi-annual report to the Institutional Official (IO) since August 20, 2012. When
asked about this issue, the IACUC chair admitted that the person acting as IACUC administrator had been replaced
since that time and the new administrator was not aware that this was a requirement. The IO is responsible for
ensuring all deficiencies are corrected in a timely fashion, and for reporting any uncorrected significant deficiencies
to APHIS within 15 business days of the elapsed correction date. It is important that the IO be kept apprised of
IACUC activities so that the humane care and use of animals at the facility is ensured and maintained in adherence
with the Animal Welfare Act. Correct by preparing a report of the IACUC's semi-annual program review and facilities
inspection to send to the IO by May 31, 2015. This report is to include a description of any departures from the AWA
or deficiencies found, designation as minor or significant deficiencies, specific plans and dates for correction, and
whether any minority views were expressed. A copy of this report must be kept with the IACUC records and bemade available for APHIS officials on inspection. This reporting process must be continually updated at least once
every 6 months when the IACUC completes its semi-annual review of the program of humane care and use and
facilities inspections.
This is a repeat non-compliant item cited under section 2.35(a)(3) on April 12, 2011, and again on March 6, 2012.
This item remains uncorrected.
2.31(d)(1)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The protocol #12 from renewal year 2014-2015 involves a surgical procedure conducted on guinea pigs to create a
traumatic spinal cord injury. This procedure can be expected to cause more than momentary or slight pain or
distress. There is no indication in the protocol that the Primary Investigator (PI) has considered alternatives to this
procedure. A thorough, well-designed search for alternatives to potentially painful procedures may reveal
refinements in surgical technique, analgesia, or post-surgical monitoring that may improve animal welfare. The
IACUC must require this written narrative of search strategies to prove that the PI has considered the applicability of
any alternatives found; this ensures that activities involving animals are conducted in a way that minimizes
unnecessary pain and distress. Correct by ensuring that a thorough search for alternatives to any painful
procedures is completed for this protocol, and by conducting IACUC review and approval of this protocol and the
alternatives search prior to any further surgical manipulation or other potentially painful or distressful procedure is
conducted. Additionally, ensure that alternative searches are conducted and described prior to obtaining approval
for all future protocols involving potentially painful or distressful procedures.
Correct by: prior to further surgical manipulations, not later than May 1, 2015.
2.36(b)(6)
ANNUAL REPORT.
The facility's annual reports from fiscal years 2013 and 2014 indicate no USDA-regulated species of animals were
used; however, there is an active protocol dating back to at least 2012 (further records predating this were not
available) that involves the use of guinea pigs. According to the investigator for this protocol, 20 guinea pigs were
used in each fiscal year 2013-14. The investigator was unsure of the numbers used in 2012. Animals used must be
reported accurately on the annual report in order to ensure proper regulatory oversight by and communication with
USDA. Correct by ensuring that numbers of animals used in regulated activities are accurate from this point
forward, and by submitting an amended report for the fiscal years 2013 and 2014 to:
USDA APHIS Animal Care

Inspection and exit interview was conducted with the IACUC chair and IACUC administrator.
