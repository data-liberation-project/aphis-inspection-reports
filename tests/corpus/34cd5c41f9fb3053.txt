2.31(d)(1)(x)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A NHP was erroneously assigned to a second study involving a major operative procedure. The animal had been
flagged in the research animal information system as surgically restricted, but the flag was overlooked. The animal
underwent a C-section in one study, and an embryo transfer procedure in the other. The animal has recovered
completely and without complications.
This non-compliance was corrected before the time of inspection by retraining the involved personnel to confirm the
status of the animal prior to use. They also created a second line of protection by building a flagging system into the
surgical records system. The surgery group will now also be alerted if a surgically-restricted animal appears on the
surgical schedule.
2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
A NHP being transferred between enclosures for a procedure injured his tail. The tail was caught in a gap between
the enclosures. The degloving injury was treated by amputation. The animal recovered without complications.
The gap between the cages resulted from a malfunctioning mechanism that connects the cages for transfers. The
problem was not apparent to handling personnel on visual inspection.
This noncompliant item was corrected prior to the time of inspection by improving the line of communication from
the animal care staff to the facility maintenance staff and training both groups in the new procedures to expedite
reporting and repair of facilities and equipment.
During a group release from a catch area following processing, a juvenile animal was able to get, unnoticed, behind
the wall-hung cages where he became entrapped and died.
This non-compliant item was corrected prior to inspection. Unable to determine exactly how the animal got into the
position where he was found, the facilty's corrective measures were comprehensive. New procedures include
assigning a safety observer to ensure that all animals released continue out into the corral, and ensuring that cages
from which animals have been removed are closed. Final checks must then be conducted to ensure all animals
have been removed from the cages and transfer systems in the catch area.This inspection and exit interview were conducted on 2/5/2018 through 2/8/2018 with facility and IACUC personnel.
