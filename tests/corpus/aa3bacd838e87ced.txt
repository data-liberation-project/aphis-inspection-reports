Housing facilities, general.
On Oct. 5, 2020, an adult female Bernese Mountain Dog (ID# 916-54) escaped from her enclosure at a breeding facility
and was unable to be recaptured. She was spotted occasionally over several days/weeks in the surrounding areas but
was later hit by a vehicle and died due to her injuries on Oct. 17, 2020.



Housing facilities for dogs and cats must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be
kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals
from entering.

Correct by ensuring that all enclosures are constructed and properly maintained to protect and contain the animals within.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
