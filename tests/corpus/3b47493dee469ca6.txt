2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Official identification has been acquired and assigned to each adult dog, however the identification tags were in
storage at the facility and not affixed to each dog. Proper identification is required and can be important for animal
health monitoring for each dog. Ensure that each adult dog is identified with a tag affixed to the animal's neck by
means of a collar made of material generally considered acceptable to pet owners as a means of identifying their
pet dogs.
