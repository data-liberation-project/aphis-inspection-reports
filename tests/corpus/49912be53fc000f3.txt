ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 3:48PM on
28-MAY-19.
Called licensee upon arrival to premise. Left a voicemail, in which licensee returned my call shortly thereafter. He
informed me that he works another job in a different city, unable to meet myself and other inspector for an
inspection on today.
Additional Inspectors
Jirsa-Smith Amy, Animal Care Inspector
