3.8 REPEAT
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
The facility does not have a documented exercise plan for the five dogs housed individually.The plan must
document that individually housed dogs have no less than twice the required floor space and need no additional
exercise regimen or document the plan for exercise if this minimum requirement is not met. The plan must be
approved by the attending veterinarian and be available upon request by APHIS officials. A documented exercise
program is required to ensure provisions for the physical and psychological well-being of the dogs.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the facility veterinarian and RVT.
