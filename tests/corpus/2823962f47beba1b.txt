2.126(c) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
An inspection was attempted at the licensee's home site from 13:55 to 14:30 hours on 12/08/2016. There was no
answer at the door of the residence upon arrival and no one entered the driveway during the next 35 minutes. The
licensee could not be reached by telephone at the number provided to the USDA as there was no answer and the
voicemail was full. No current itinerary has been received by USDA-APHIS-Animal Care.
In the case of traveling exhibitors, itineraries must be submitted to USDA via fax, mail, or electronic mail at least two
days prior to any overnight travel. The itinerary should contain complete and accurate information concerning the
whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. The
submission of itineraries allows USDA to conduct inspections in order to assess the welfare of the animals both at
home and while traveling. Current itineraries should be submitted to USDA in a timely manner.
