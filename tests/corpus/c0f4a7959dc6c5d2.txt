INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
At the time of the inspection, a guinea pig was discovered dead in its enclosure. A review of the animal's records
showed that it had undergone a major operative procedure three days earlier, and whereas the protocol called for
pain medication to be given at the time of the surgery, and then "every 8-12 hours for 48 hours post-surgery", the
animal had only received one additional dose at 12 hours.
Unapproved significant changes to the protocol could result in unanticipated pain and distress, and put the animal's
welfare at risk. Any significant changes to the approved protocol must be reviewed and approved by the IACUC.
To be corrected from this time forward.

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
For a ten month period beginning in November 2011, a member of a research team failed to give a second
protocol-required post-surgical dose of pain medication to thirty rabbits. This incident was identified, reported and
corrected by the IACUC, and there was no serious animal welfare impact documented.
A cohort mortality report for Protocol # 3339-01 states that on 2/5/13, a rabbit undergoing a surgical procedure
exhibited "an increased respiratory rate and abdominal breath pattern" at 1.25 hours into the procedure. At this
point, the research team doubled the concentration of the inhaled anesthetic. The respiratory rate continued to
increase, and the surgeon, who was the same person involved in the above-mentioned incident, administered an
additional dose of the injectable anesthetic drug combination (85% for drug A, and 200% for drug B of the original
dose given preoperatively). At approximately 2.5 hours into the procedure, the animal continued to decline, and the
surgeon called Vet Services, who arrived and determined that the rabbit had died.
The anesthetics administered during this incident were not in accordance with the protocol or the training on
anesthetics. For a second time, the Veterinary Staff, the IACUC and the Principal Investigator attempted to
communicate the problem and retrain the individual involved.Failure to verify that research members are adequately qualified to comprehend and implement procedures
according to protocol could jeopardize the health and well-being of the animals. The research facility should ensure
that members of the research team are qualified to perform their duties.
To be corrected from this time forward.
2.32(c)(1)(2)
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
During the inspection, a research assistant was observed carrying a large male macaque which was sedated. After
weighing the animal, the assistant placed it on its side on a cart, released the animal, turned her back and took
several steps across the hallway to open a door. The animal appeared semi-conscious, and could have fallen to
the floor if it had moved. A review of the Non-Human Primate sedation and anesthesia training module revealed
that there was no specific instruction on this handling issue.
All personnel handling animals must receive appropriate training on proper animal handling, so as to minimize the
risk of injury in order to safeguard animal health and well-being.
To be corrected from this time forward.
2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling. The IACUC reported that in 2013, a rabbit was found to have a fractured pelvis that resulted in paralysis
and euthanasia. Staff was unable to explain how the injury occurred, although the animal had been handled the
previous day for restraint training by a technician, as part of a research protocol, and the necropsy suggested that
the injury had occurred the previous day.
On the day of inspection, it was observed that in one room thirteen out of fourteen macaques had collars with chain
links attached that measured approximately four to eleven inches in length, with the final link measuring one to two
inches in diameter.
Animals should be handled in a manner that minimizes the risk of injury. Any fall or injury should be reported
promptly by personnnel, so as to be treated in a timely manner in order to minimize pain and distress. Dangling
chains attached to animals pose a risk of catching on something in the enclosure, which could result in serious
injury. Measures should be taken to minimize the risk of injury in order to safeguard the health and well-being of the
animals. Handling issues surrounding the rabbit incident are to be corrected from this time forward. Macaque handling and
equipment issues to be reviewed, with corrections completed by April 1, 2014.
Inspection conducted from 2/25/14 - 2/28/14.
Exit interview conducted with facility representatives.
