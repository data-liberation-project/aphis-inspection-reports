nest box in one enclosure is open on top and exposed to the elements. One enclosure contains no nest box; a pile
of hay is provided for shelter. The hutches each have a roof but no solid sides to stop the wind. Temperatures are
expected to dip below 40 degrees by next weekend. Exposure to temperatures below 40 degrees can be a health
hazard to the rabbits.
Provide adequate shelter from the cold for the rabbits. Correct by November 20, 2015.

Significant amounts of standing water and/or mud are evident in 7 enclosures.
The raccoon enclosure contains standing water and heavy mud covering at least two-thirds of the area.
The hyena enclosure contains heavy mud and standing water throughout the entire area. The only area that is
potentially dry is inside a small dog house shelter.
The coyote enclosure contains mud and standing water throughout the entire area. The only potentially dry area is
inside the housing structure.
The lion shelter contains standing water, providing no dry shelter from inclement weather.
All 3 pig enclosures contain standing water with feces and heavy mud. The only potentially dry areas are inside the
housing structures.
Standing water and mud can lead to hoof or foot problems and other health concerns for the animals that cannot get
or stay dry.
Ensure that all animals have a way to stay dry and out of mud/standing water. Ensure that the enclosures are
designed to provide for rapid water drainage.
