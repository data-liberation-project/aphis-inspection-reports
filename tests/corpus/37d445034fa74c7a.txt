2.132(d)

Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
During records review for the December 2021 auction, inspectors observed a record where a two year old marmoset was
accepted into the auction from an unlicensed person. Accepting animals from unlicensed persons who are required to be
licensed, prevents APHIS officials from ensuring accurate traceability and adequate animal welfare. The licensee must
ensure that no animals are accepted into the auction by persons who are required to be licensed, but do not hold a
current, valid and unsuspended license.
To be corrected by next auction in April 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
