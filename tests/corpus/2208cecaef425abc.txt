3.31(a)(1)

Sanitation.
The sanitization of the guinea pig primary enclosures is not being documented every two weeks. The facility
representative described the cleaning procedure, but there are no records of the enclosures being cleaned and sanitized
every two weeks as required. Routine sanitization of the primary enclosures with a safe and effective disinfectant
prevents the spread of disease and ensures the welfare of the animals.
