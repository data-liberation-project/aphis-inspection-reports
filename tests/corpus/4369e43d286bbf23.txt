HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The large shed dog shelter for the outdoor housed dogs (adult Bulldogs) currently has four "doggie door" openings.
The distance from the opening to the ground measures a foot to a foot and a half high for three of the openings. The
high drop may lead to injury to the dogs if they try to jump in or out of these high openings. The housing facilities
including shelter structures for dogs must be designed and constructed so that they protect the dogs from injury.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The windows of the indoor housing facility for the small breed dogs were open to provide ventilation but no fans or
air-conditioners were being used. The temperature measured with a Kestrel was 89.9 degrees F. in the building.
The temperatures all week are to be in the upper 80s and lower 90s with temperatures not dropping into the 70s
until after dark. The dogs were all bright, alert and responsive today but persistently high temperatures can lead to
heat stress and other health issues. The ambient indoor temperatures must not rise above 85 degrees F for more
than 4 hours when dogs are present. Correct by Sept. 30, 2016.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owners.
