FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The shelter for the deer pens on the right side of the guest walk way need to be addressed. The current shelter
is just a roof over a feed area. There are no sides to the area to provide protection from inclement weather for older
animals who may need it. A shelter should have a roof and two sides to to block the wind and to prevent discomfort
to the animals.

SANITATION.
*** There is an accumulation of feces in the zebra enclosure along the first wall as you walk down the guest path.
The licensee states that they are not able to get into the enclosure and clean due to the aggressive nature of the
zebra so the enclosure is not cleaned with any frequency. This needs to be addressed and some method of
cleaning needs to occur to remove waste as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and odors. This needs
to be addressed for the health of the animal.
