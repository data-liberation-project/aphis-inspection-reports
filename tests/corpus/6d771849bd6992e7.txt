3.1(b)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(b) Condition and site.
***Within the housing facility for ten puppies, there were several items sitting on the floor and immediately
surrounding the two occupied animal enclosures. These items included gasoline containers, bags of aluminum
cans and other garbage-like items, buckets, ladders, and many other miscellaneous items which were not all for the
care and husbandry of the animals. The area also contained an opened bag of puppy food and bedding. The
licensee must keep all animal housing areas neat and free of clutter to allow for ease of cleaning and to decrease
the risk of attracting pests and other disease hazards. Animal areas inside of housing facilities must be kept neat
and free of clutter, including equipment, furniture, and stored material, but may contain materials actually used and
necessary for cleaning the area, and fixtures or equipment necessary for proper husbandry practices. To be
corrected by: June 19, 2015.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces. (2) Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
***Within an enclosure housing puppies, there was a hard plastic panel which was chewed and damaged along the
edge of the panel as well as on the flat surface of the panel. The rough edges are easily accessible to the puppies
and there is some buildup of dirt and grime in these chewed/damaged areas of the plastic. These roughened edges
do not allow for proper sanitization of the surface and they also increase the risk of injury to the dogs with the sharp
edges. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized
are repaired or replaced when worn or soiled.
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(e) Storage
***Within a facility housing puppies, there was an open bag of bedding and an open bag of puppy food also with a
hole on the side of the bag. The open bags of bedding and food increase the risk for pests and contamination. Thelicensee must ensure that all opened supplies of food and bedding are kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting
lids to prevent contamination and spoilage. To be corrected by: June 13, 2015.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength.
***There were several areas with sharp points within the camels' enclosure. There was a non-attached wooden
framed fence lying against the primary enclosure fence with at least two sharp nail ends protruding into the
enclosure at the level of the animals. Also, there were several pieces of fence wire protruding into the enclosures
forming sharp points which could come in contact with the animals. One of the wire ends was observed with camel
hair attached to it. Sharp points increase the risk that the animals could become injured. The licensee must ensure
that housing facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury at all
times. To be corrected by: June 13, 2015.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(d) Perimeter fence.
***The camels and kangaroos were housed in the outdoor facility which did not have a complete perimeter fence
surrounding their primary enclosures. The licensee has a perimeter fence around a portion of the facility; however,
the fence is incomplete for several yards in multiple sections for the kangaroos' and camels' current enclosures.
The lack of a complete perimeter fence does not prevent unauthorized people or unwanted animals from having
access to the animals housed within the facility. Also lack of a complete perimeter fence cannot function as a
secondary containment system. The licensee must ensure that all outdoor housing facilities for the kangaroos and
camels are enclosed by a perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet high in order to protect the type of animals in the
facility at all times. To be corrected by: September 1, 2015.
The inspection was conducted on June 9, 2015 with the licensee and a representative from IDALS. The exit
interview was conducted on June 10, 2015 with the licensee.
