FEEDING.
In the back areas of the Uakari and the Howler monkeys: There is a moderate collection of debris and dried organic
material present under the freezer drawers of two refrigerators. Diets for the non-human primates are stored in
these areas and can become contaminated.
Diets fed to the non-human primates should be clean, wholesome and free from contamination. A system should be
in place to ensure refrigerators/ freezers are cleaned out as often as needed for the health and well-being of the
animals.

FEEDING.
The following was noted in the main commissary:
-There is a plastic cutting board and a plastic-handle knife used for food preparation. Both of these items
have a heavy build-up of dark organic material present.
-The plastic page covers of the animal-diet-notebook have a moderate amount of dried out fruit/vegetable juice and
other debris on them. The notebook was located on the food preparation table at time of inspection.
These items should be cleaned or replaced as often as necessary to minimize the risk of contamination of the
produce fed to the animals.
-In a freezer, there is an area underneath the fans where there are 15 plus water drips that have refrozen into solid
ice columns.These columns have formed on cardboard boxes containing meat used for the diets.
-There are plastic reusable containers that are used to store meat.The lids of these containers have a moderate
amount of dried blood and other debris present.
The plastic containers should be cleaned or replaced as needed and the meat should be stored and protected in
a manner that minimizes the risk of spoilage and contamination.
The present condition of the cutting board, knife handle, notebook, and plastic containers can serve as a source of
contamination for the diets. The food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination to maintain theanimals in good health.
To be corrected by July 28, 2017 and for all future inspections.
