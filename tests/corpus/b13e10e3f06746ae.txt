FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength:
The enclosure housing two bears has large cracks and pitted areas in the concrete floor. Water is pooling in the
eroded areas. Feces, food and debris may accumulate in the cracks of the concrete. The concrete floor must be
repaired to prevent debris and dirty water from accumulating in the cracks and eroded areas and to allow the floor to
be adequately cleaned. The facility must establish and maintain a program to keep the animal enclosures
structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. This is a repeat
non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.

3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Section 3.127(d) Perimeter fence: The following areas of perimeter fence must be repaired or maintained.

1) There are rolls of chain link fencing that were moved only a few feet away from the perimeter fence just past the
drive through gate off the main road. The rolls of chain link fencing may still be used as a ramp or platform by an
animal to get up over the perimeter fence. The rolls of chain link must be moved away from the perimeter fence so
it can function as a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
2) A fallen tree over the perimeter fence was removed, but the fencing is still only about 6.5 feet in height. The area
of fencing is beyond the rolls of chain link fence by the perimeter fence. The perimeter fence must be restored to its
original height of 8 feet for the dangerous animals housed at the facility.
3) The perimeter fence by the buffalo had the three loose wood fence posts straightened, but the fence is only 7-7.5
feet in height instead of 8 feet.4) The perimeter fence by the pond has the frame posts for the barbed wire angled more horizontal than vertical
resulting in the fence only being about 6.5 feet in height instead of 8 feet.

5) There is broken lattice work below the wood walkway for the zoo entrance below the perimeter fence. The area
under the walkway must be repaired to prevent unauthorized people or animals from going under the walkway and
perimeter fence and to act as a secondary containment system for animals housed in the facility.

The facility must establish and maintain a program to keep the 8 foot perimeter fence in good repair to restrict
animals and unauthorized persons from gaining access into the facility and to act as a secondary containment
system for the animals housed within the facility. This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
