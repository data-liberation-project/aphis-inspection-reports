3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the bear enclosures is being accessed through a single gate without securing the bears prior to entering the
enclosure. This is an extremely dangerous situation for both the keepers and the visiting public. The bears could
seriously injure a keeper while they are in the enclosure feeding or cleaning. Or, they could push through the single
gate as keepers are entering or exiting the enclosure and have access to public areas.
The bears need to be secured so that there is a fence between them and the keepers prior to the keepers entering
the enclosure. The bears should never have direct access to a keeper or an open gate between the exhibit and
non-exhibit area.
