FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural strength
*** Tiger enclosure (3 tigers): The wood portion at the top of the platform enclosure / barrier fence is crumbling. The
fence serves as a public barrier as well as provides the appropriate height for an open top tiger enclosure. The
attachment of the wood to the wire panel fencing provides strength to the enclosure fence. The wood must be
replaced and maintained to ensure the integrity of the fence is adequate for species contained within the enclosure.
*** The board fencing for the petting zoo animals (4 goats, 8 pigs, 1 sheep, 1 alpaca) are excessively worn and
portions of the fence are leaning. The fence post noted on a previous inspection has been repaired but the fencing
in general remains in disrepair. The primary enclosure fence must be structurally sound and in good repair to
contain the animals. The board fencing must be repaired as needed or replaced to ensure containment of the
petting zoo animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste Disposal
***Produce waste was on the ground outside the enclosure housing 8 pigs. The produce waste may attract rodent
pests. Provision must be made for the removal and disposal of food waste to minimize vermin infestation, odors
and disease hazards. Correct by March 5, 2015.
3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Drainage
*** The enclosure housing 2 pigs is excessively muddy with puddles of water by the water receptacle. The
enclosure housing 8 pigs has a pool of standing water around the water receptacle. The pigs should not have to
walk through mud or wade through muddy water to reach the water receptacle. Standing water and/or mud may
cause foot problems in the pigs, as well as excessive chilling in cold water. The water receptacle must not besurrounded by mud or standing water.
*** The alpaca was locked in a stall in the shelter with standing water and mud. The licensee stated the alpaca was
kept there while the enclosure was cleaned. The APHIS officials observed the alpaca locked in the stall around
10:30 a.m. and it was still in the stall at around 1:30 p.m. The shelter should not have standing water and/or mud.
Standing in water and mud may cause foot problems as well as excessive chilling in cold weather. Animals must
not be kept confined in areas with standing water and mud. Shelters must be clean and dry for the health of the
animals.
A suitable method must be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water for the health and comfort of the animals.

SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures
*** The enclosure housing the coati has an excessive amount of dried feces on the top front platform. The lower
front platform had a buildup of food wastes and the treat cup was soiled. Feces and food waste present a disease
hazard to the animal. Feces must be removed from enclosures to prevent buildup and to ensure an animal has a
clean area to rest. Surfaces must be kept free of a buildup of food wastes. Correct by March 6, 2015.
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
Pest Control
*** Rodent feces were present on the floor in the feed room. An unset rodent trap was located in one corner of the
room. Pest control measures, such as regular removal of spilled feed and the setting of traps, must be maintained to
prevent the attraction and harborage of rodents. Effective pest control measures must be taken to prevent the
attraction and entry of rodents in to the food storage area. Correct by March 11, 2015.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner; Gloria McFadden, VMO; and Mary Geib, VMO.
