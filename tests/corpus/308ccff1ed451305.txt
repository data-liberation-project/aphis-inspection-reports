3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The Puppy room: There are at least 4 enclosures that have a moderate buildup of rust. There were adult dogs and
puppies housed in these enclosures at time of inspection.
There did not appear to be structural issues in these areas at this time but these surfaces could easily trap dirt and
debris creating a potential source of disease or contamination to the animals. All rusted surfaces must be replaced
or repaired to allow for proper cleaning and sanitization of the surfaces and to prevent any potential for structural
damage.
The facility has replaced at least half of the primary enclosures that have rusted surfaces.
The remaining enclosures should replaced or repaired by March 1, 2018
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was a collection of discarded items in a corner area across from the outdoor dog runs. The accumulation of
trash may attract pests to animal areas. Premises must be kept free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste products,
and discarded matter... so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control, and to protect the health and
well-being of the animals.
