2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was no written program of veterinary care indicating what preventive care or treatments are appropriate for
each species, contacts in case of health emergencies, method of euthanasia, frequency and dosage of parasite
control, vaccinations (if any) etc.
If exhibitors employ a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant, formal arrangements shall include a written
program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.
A llama died and there was no veterinary care provided. The facility representative doesn't know what the llama
died from and this is why a PVC and regularly scheduled visits are important in order to keep healthy the rest of the
animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
