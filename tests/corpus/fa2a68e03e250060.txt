SANITATION.
- An enclosure in the walk through area of the facility held 6 Angora goats. There was a large pile of old horseshoes
next to a tree inside this enclosure, close to the enclosure fence. Many of the horseshoes had exposed nails and
are a potential injury hazard to any animals in the pen. The Angoras were new to this enclosure, which had
previously contained only birds. The facility corrected this issue during the inspection by raising a temporary fence
to keep the goats away from the horseshoes. The facility will decide how best to permanently correct the issue.
