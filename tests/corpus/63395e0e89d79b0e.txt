2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The left eye of a now 11 month-old female Pekinese/Pomeranian mix (no ID) is abnormal in appearance. The
licensee still has not had the attending veterinarian evaluate this dog's eye to see if it needs treatment. Eye
problems can be due to many things and may be painful. To ensure that the condition is not painful and/or receives
proper treatment this dog's eye must be evaluated by the Attending Veterinarian to be properly diagnosed.
Documentation of the dog's diagnosis must be kept for future inspections.
A female Pomeranian microchip #005-008-600 still has problems with her teeth and right ear. The upper teeth
were covered in a dark hard material and there was a pale discharge around them. Her right upper first pre-molar
(the tooth far back on the upper right side just behind the large tooth) of the mouth was loose to the touch. Her right
ear had a thick brown discharge matted in the hair. Tooth problems can be painful and cause further health issues
in dogs if not treated. The discharge from the ear may be a sign of a problem in the ear and needs to be evaluated
if it needs proper treatment. To ensure that this dog is not in pain and receives appropriate treatment have the
attending veterinarian evaluate it to diagnose the ear and teeth problems and treat them per the veterinarian's
instructions. Documentation of the dog's diagnosis must be kept for future inspections.
A medication labeled for goats (Safeguard--Fenbendazole) is being used for deworming. The licensee has
consulted with the attending veterinarian on the safety of this medication for dogs, however there is still no
documentation on the dosage amount that should be used for dogs. Use of medications in dogs that are labeled for
other species (off-label use) must be accompanied by written instructions from the attending veterinarian that
describe the dose/dosage, route (such as oral, injection, etc), and use for the medication.
The licensee is currently treating the female Pomeranian, microchip #005-008-600, with an over the counter ear
medication (Mita Clear). However, the licensee has not consulted with the attending veterinarian on the proper use
of the medication. Medications must be accompanied by written instructions from the attending veterinarian that
describe the dose/dosage, route and use for the medication.
2.50(a)(1) REPEATTIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
A now 11 month old female Pekinese/Pomeranian mix remains unidentified with official USDA identification. Lack
of official identification does not allow for the proper identification or tracking of the animal. Identify the adult dog
with official USDA identification.
2.50(a)(2) REPEAT
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Five 8 week old puppies and two 8 1/2 week old puppies are not identified by an official USDA identification method
(cage card, tag, or plastic collar). Lack of official identification does not allow for the proper identification or tracking
of the animals. Correct by identifying all weaned puppies with an official USDA method of identification.
2.126(a)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee was unable to locate the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). Not being able to review the PVC does
not ensure that the animals are being provided with approved methods of veterinary care. Correct by ensuring that
the PVC is available at the time of inspection. Correct from this date forward.
3.1(c)(1)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Excessive rust development remains on the metal door flaps in the enclosures of the inside/outside building. The
presence of rust can prevent the surfaces from being properly cleaned and sanitized. Eliminate the rust from the
metal door flaps.
3.1(c)(1)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Sharp wire points remain inside the second pen on the east side of the inside/outside building. Sharp points are an
injury hazard. Remove the sharp points from inside the runs.
3.3(e)(1)(3)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are 3 newly constructed primary enclosures housing 8 dogs in the side room of the whelping kennel where
the wooden supports that are in contact with the animals are not impervious to moisture. Areas that are in contactwith animals but are not imperious to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized to reduce disease hazards,
waste accumulation and odors. Place the wooden supports of these 3 primary enclosures in a condition that is
impervious to moisture. Correct by: 24 February 2016
