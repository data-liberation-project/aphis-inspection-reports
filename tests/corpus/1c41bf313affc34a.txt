3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the Bush Baby enclosure there were two areas on the ceiling that measured approximately twelve inches in
diameter where the paint was missing and peeling off, revealing a permeable surface.
Surfaces should be maintained in good repair so that the animal is protected from the possibility of ingesting paint,
and in order to facilitate the cleaning and sanitation of the enclosure.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence for the facility has many gaps along the bottom of the fence line that measure three to six
inches in depth. These occur along the bottom of the fence, and also under and around some gates. There is also a
section of fencing that is composed of vertical black painted metal bars that has a five inch gap under the fence, a
four inch gap between the bars, and in some sections this fence, and a wooden fence, do not meet the eight foot
height requirement which is called for when dangerous animals are housed on site.
The expectation is that the perimeter fence should keep people and animals from passing under or through the
fence, and also act as secondary containment for the animals within the park. Modifications should be made to the
fence in order to close openings that could allow animals to pass through, and the fence should be brought up to the
required height.
