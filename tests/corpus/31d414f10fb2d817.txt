ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***One adult female fallow deer's left eye was clouded, blue colored and was bulging. The animal did not appear to
have any discharge from the eye and when the animal was handled through the fence, the eye did not appear
painful to the touch. At the time of the inspection the staff had not noticed the animals eye and no treatment had
been given to the animal.
***The two Fennec foxes had moderate hair loss on their backs. The hair coat surrounding the hair loss appear
un-kept. These animals were active and appeared to be otherwise in good body condition at the time of the
inspection. These two foxes have a history of hair loss according to facility personnel. According to facility
personnel, the hair loss reoccurred after the animals were removed from winter housing and placed into a new
enclosure. These foxes had not been assessed by a veterinarian and had not been treated by park staff for the
most recent hair loss re-occurrence.
Veterinary care issues that are left unnoticed and untreated can cause the animals unnecessary
pain and discomfort. The Licensee must have observation of these animals on a daily basis. In addition, the
Licensee must have frequent communication with the attending veterinarian to ensure that all veterinary care
issues are treated within a timely manner.

***The enclosure fence for the fallow deer, which also acts as the perimeter fence, was curled up at the bottom of
the fence in several areas. This fence could allow for fawns to escape and could be a hazard to legs of the adult

FEEDING.
*** The mineral blocks for the fallow deer are directly on the ground in the back pen shelter. This mineral block is a
source of nutrition and should be placed in a feeding bin or stored off the ground to minimize contamination to the
mineral source. This needs to be addressed for the health of the deer.
*** The salt block in the Nialgai pen is in a food receptacle that has not been cleaned and there is a build up of feces
and debris around the salt block. This salt block is a nutritional supplement and should be kept in a food receptacle
that is cleaned on a routine basis to prevent contamination to the mineral.
*** The feeding pans used to feed the lions raw meat need to be cleaned more frequently. These pans are in
essence contaminated with raw chicken each time the pans are used and therefore should be cleaned between
feedings for the health of the animals.
*** The round cylinder used to feed hay to the Elk needs to be cleaned. There is a build up of old hay, grime and
debris. The old hay needs to be removed and the cylinder cleaned prior to fresh hay being added. This needs to be
done on a routine basis to prevent contamination to new food being added.

SANITATION.
*** Several of the enclosure shelter areas and areas at the entrance to the shelter areas have an accumulation of
feces that needs to be removed. These include the fallow deer and Nialgai. In addition, the camel barn needs to be
cleaned. These areas need to be cleaned as often as necessary to minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.

SANITATION.
***There were pieces of plastic streamer curtains on the ground of the white-tailed deer enclosure. The plasticstreamers had been hung from the top of the door to the enclosure to keep newly introduced animals within the
enclosure from running into the door. The streamers had weathered and had fallen apart over time. The strings
were found on the ground at the entrance to the enclosure.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the husbandry practices. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas and cleared as
necessary to protect the health of the animals.
