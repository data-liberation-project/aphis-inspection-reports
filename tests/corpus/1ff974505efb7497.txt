2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
While records required by regulation for animals acquired by the facility were maintained, offspring born at the facility and
in their possession did not contain the information required by this regulation including a description of the young dogs,
their breed, sex, date of birth or age, and their colors and distinctive markings.

These records are necessary, for example, to aid in identification of health matters related to individual animals and to
verify compliance with all Animal Welfare Act regulations during inspections.

Records must be documented and maintained to comply with this regulation for all animals to which it applies.
