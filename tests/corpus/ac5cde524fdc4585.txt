FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The wire fence material (used to prevent digging and escape) in the porcupine enclosure was exposed in several
areas. The exposed fence poses a risk of injury to the animal such as by abrading the foot pads or entrapment and
fracture of the legs. Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the
animals. A system of monitoring and maintenance should by in place so that all housing facilities remain structurally
sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
