ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The previously identified white female was evaluated and treated by the attending veterinarian. However in the
facility there is now one white adult male Chinchilla named Tobasco which needs to be reevaluated by the attending
veterinarian. The dealer stated and provided documentation the animal had been evaluated by the attending
veterinarian fifteen days prior to the inspection. However she stated and documented she had stopped treatment
after three days due to stress and biting of the animal. During the inspection the animal's left eye was closed shut.
The dealer must have the animal reevaluated and maintain written documentation of the evaluation, instructions and
all treatment to protect the health and welfare of the animals.
Affects one adult.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted by the Dealer and Sandra Meek, ACI.
