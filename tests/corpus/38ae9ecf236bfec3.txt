2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***Male Maltese #82 had brownish-black dried material, clumped with the hair on the inside corner of the left eye.
After the licensee removed most of the clumped material, the skin underneath was redden and moist. The area was
missing hair, and had a 1/4 inch oval lesion next to the tear duct. This dog was on the previous inspection report for
the grey spot on the left eye, which was addressed. This lesion could be the result of an injury, infection, or other
veterinary medical condition which may be painful. The licensee must consult with a licensed veterinarian regarding
this animal condition in order to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee
must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.11(b)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
(b) Sanitization of primary enclosures and food and water receptacles.
***In the sheltered building at least 10 self-feeders affecting approximately 28 dogs, had an accumulation of a brown
or black dirt and grime inside them. This dirt and grime comes in contact with the dogs food, which can contaminate
the food and harm the dogs. The licensee must ensure self-feeders are cleaned and sanitized at least every two
weeks or more often if necessary.
Within three outdoor enclosures housing nine dogs, there is big plastic water bowls that had a green discoloration
(algae like substance) along the inside surfaces and floating on the water. Water receptacles which are not properly
cleaned or sanitized can harbor disease-causing organisms. This could decrease the animals acceptability of the
water, as well as increase the risk of disease. The licensee must ensure that all water receptacles are sanitized at
least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste and
other disease hazards.
