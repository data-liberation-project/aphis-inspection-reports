Outdoor housing facilities.
There were three access gates on the perimeter fence that were of insufficient height for non-human primates. The lack of
an adequate perimeter fence presents a safety risk to the non-human primates within the facility in that there isn’t an
adequate secondary containment system to hold animals that may escape their primary enclosures or a sufficient barrier
to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. The perimeter fence must be constructed to prevent unauthorized humans
and other animals the size of dogs, skunks, and raccoons from going through or under it. The facility shall ensure the
primary enclosures for the non-human primates, are enclosed by an appropriate perimeter fence, or a variance, if
appropriate, needs to be obtained and can be requested from the Administrator. CORRECT BY: FEBRUARY 24, 2023

Primary enclosures.
The outdoor enclosure housing four ring-tailed lemurs has a heating lamp affixed to the outside of a barrel with a partially
protected electrical cord extending from inside the primary enclosure to the outside of the primary closure. The outdoor
enclosure housing two ring-tailed lemurs has a heating lamp affixed to the inside of a barrel with a partially protected
electrical extending from the inside of the primary enclosure to the outside of the primary enclosure. The unprotected
portions of the electrical cords were within reach of the animals. Electrical cords pose a significant health risk to animals


that may chew or pull on them. Unprotected powered electrical cords that are within an animal’s reach allows access to
an electrical hazard that can cause electrocution, injury, and/or death. The primary enclosure must be constructed and
maintained so that it protects non-human primate from injury including limiting access to electrical cords. CORRECT BY:

Facilities, general.
Numerous ants were observed crawling in and out of the receptacle used to store the feed for the Patagonian cavies. The
feed could not be scooped without picking up ants. The presence of vermin in the food storage receptacle can
contaminate the feed which can cause potential disease hazards for the animals. Supplies of bedding and food shall be
stored in facilities which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. The
facility must store animal feed in such a way to protect against insect infestation. CORRECT BY: FEBRUARY 18, 2023
