2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care was not available at the premises for review today to ensure that it has been
updated to include all required details (including details for vet care for all species maintained by the facility;
dosages and frequency of administration of drugs and vaccines; parasite control methods; capture methods and TB
testing of exotic species; emergency care and euthanasia of domestic species) and has been approved by the
attending veterinarian. The owner states that the form is currently at his attending veterinarian's office. The facility
shall document and maintain a written program of veterinary care approved by the attending veterinarian to ensure
the appropriate health care for the animals at the facility.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two of the four deer are in need of veterinary care.
*The older female deer is thin with a visible spine and prominent protruding hip bones.
*The young female has an irregularly shaped wound about 2 inches long and ½ inch wide at the widest part over
the front top part of the shoulder area adjacent to the back of her neck. Red tissue is visible in the center portion of
the wound. There is some thickened tissue starting to form along the edges of the wound. There is also hairloss
present in an area about 3inches by 2 inches wide adjacent to/in front of the wound. No drainage or discharge is
present.
The attending veterinarian has not been notified about or been out to examine the two deer. Appropriate veterinary
care is necessary to ensure that medical problems are addressed. The facility shall have a veterinarian evaluate the
two female deer in order to establish an appropriate treatment plan. Correct by 7/11/15.
3.75(e)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two bags of non-human primate feed were noted stored in the non-human primate building. The unopened bag was
stored on the floor in an unused enclosure. An open bag was stored on top of the closed bag. Food must be stored
appropriately to ensure its nutritive value and to prevent attracting pests. Food supplies/unopened bags of feed shall
be stored off the floor and away from the walls and opened bags of feed must be kept in leakproof containers with
tightly fitting lids. Correct by 7/16/15.
3.76(a)
INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The enclosure housing the two marmosets is located inside the non-human primate building. Upon entering the
inside of the building the inspector noticed that the air inside felt hot, humid and still. No fans or air-conditioning
were running upon entry. The facility owner turned the fan on as we entered the building. The temperature inside
the building was measured at 90.8 degrees F with a Kestrel at 3:30 pm CT. The temperature, with the fan running,
was rechecked an hour later but had only dropped to 89.7 degrees F. The marmosets appeared healthy at the time
of inspection. High ambient temperatures can be uncomfortable to the animals and can lead to health issues such
as dehydration and heat stroke. Temperatures must not rise above 85 degrees F for more than four hours when
non-human primates are present to ensure the health and well-being of the non-human primates. Correct by
7/11/15.
3.77(a)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
Upon entering the indoor portion of the sheltered housing for the snow macaques, the air inside the building felt hot,
humid and still. No fans or air-conditioning were running upon entry. The outside temperature was measured at 88
degrees F using a Kestrel at 3:30 pm. The temperature inside was 90.8 degrees F. The snow macaques were noted
active and to be spending their time outside. The temperature inside, with the fan running, was rechecked an hour
later but had only dropped to 90.5 degrees F. High ambient temperature can be uncomfortable to the animals and
can lead to health issues such as dehydration and heat stroke. Temperatures in the sheltered portion of the housing
for the snow macaques must not rise about 85 degrees F for more than four hours to ensure the health and
well-being of the non-human primates. Correct by 7/11/15.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There is no written, attending veterinarian approved environment enhancement program for non-human primates
available for review at the facility today. The owner states that the plan is at the attending veterinarian's office to be
reviewed to include the information documented as missing during the last inspection on May 4, 2015 (did notaddress all species, all special considerations, species specific recommendations for socialization and
environmental enrichment) and to be approved by the attending veterinarian. The facility shall develop, document
and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological well-being of
the non-human primates that has been approved by the attending veterinarian.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following enclosures are not structurally sound and are in need of maintenance:
*The fencing of the bison enclosure consists of several different types of materials and is not structurally sound.
One section is made of metal panels. The panels adjacent to the barn structure are leaning and loose. There is a
gap between the barn and the panel. Another section consists of wooden boards. One section of this portion of the
fencing is also leaning and loose with a gap present between two adjacent sections of board fencing.
*The deer enclosure fencing is sound but there are wires with sharp points protruding into the enclosure at deer
height where the wire has been used to attach the fencing to the posts.
*The two metal side by side doors at the front of the porcupine enclosure are not structurally sound. The bottom
corners of both doors where two metal pipes come together have rusted out with loss of structurally integrity. In
addition, the wire forming the bottom section of one of the doors has been damaged and replaced with some wire
material that has loose and sharp points and edges pointing into the enclosure.
Loss of structural integrity of fencing materials can lead to enclosures that are not sound and to injury to the
animals. Outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by 7/30/15.
3.130
WATERING.
The water receptacles in the following enclosures are in need of cleaning: deer enclosure, porcupine enclosure and
pasture enclosure housing camel, zebra and zebu. There is a build-up of algae and debris on the inside surfaces of
the receptacles. The water appears opaque with debris present/floating in the water. Lack of clean potable water
may lead to animals choosing not to drink and may lead to spread of disease. All water receptacles shall be kept
clean and sanitary. Correct by 7/11/15.
Inspection and exit conducted 7/6/15 with facility owner and animal caretaker.
