PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The outdoor portion of a sheltered building contains wire flooring and at least three puppies had legs and feet which
were observed passing through the flooring in one enclosure. The outdoor portion of the enclosure had coated wire
flooring with one inch by one inch openings. There were five Maltese puppies which were approximately seven
weeks old housed inside the enclosure. The puppies' legs and feet passing through the openings of the floor can
increase their risk of injury. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are constructed and maintained so
that they have floors that protect the dogs' feet and legs from injury and do not allow the dogs' feet to pass through
any openings in the floor. To be corrected by: April 20, 2019
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
