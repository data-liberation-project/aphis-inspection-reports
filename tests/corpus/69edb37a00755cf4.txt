2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During this inspection the male cynomolgus macaque was observed licking the tip of his tail which was bare of skin
with red tissue showing. Possible frost bite occurred sometime in the past, but the owner was not told by the
caretakers and the veterinarian was not consulted about treatment. This same macaque also exhibits the repeated
stereotypical behavior of biting at his limbs without inflicting wounds. He needs to be evaluated by the veterinarian
for treatment of the tail and the behaviors.
Two of the black bears continue to exhibit abnormal repetitive behaviors. During this inspection the two separately
housed male black bears paced 10-12 steps the length of their enclosure, turned and walked back repeatedly. This
was observed for over 10 minutes and only stopped when some visitors threw peanuts to them. The potential
additional space of the pool area was closed off for the bears. This abnormal behavior was cited on 5-9-17 as
behavior needing veterinary evaluation, and habitat and husbandry modifications. At this point the proposed new
enclosure for the bears has not been started. The enclosures have not been modified nor any husbandry changes
made to provide for normal activities and normal postural adjustments like foraging, climbing, and clawing.
The physical needs of the bears needs to be addressed by the veterinarian and caretakers, and changes made to
address these needs.
3.81(c)(2)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Several primates continue to exhibit several types of stereotypical behaviors, which were observed multiple times
for extended periods of time during this 5 hour inspection. Although the male baboon had access to the larger
cage, he repeatedly paced in circles and figure eights on an elevated area of boards. At the afternoon feeding
time, the female baboon in the smaller enclosure showed the swaying behavior she has previously exhibited
consistently. Another baboon, Handsome, is now repeatedly rocking back and forth sideways, head tossing,
standing up, circling in place, then resuming rocking. He is doing this both in his indoor and outdoor parts of the
enclosure. This behavior was repeated for over 5 minute periods several times throughout the inspection.
The cage furniture in the three baboon enclosures has not been substantially changed in at least a year. During thisinspection, no enrichment was given in terms of foraging devices, browse, or any other stimulating items. The
animals are fed twice a day and their food is placed in feeders and rapidly consumed. There is no time consuming
activity to engage them.
The male cynomolgus is still exhibiting abnormal behaviors. He has floating limb syndrome, where his left leg
slowly floats up, he sees it, and attacks it. He does not appear to be breaking skin during these attacks. He
exhibited frenzied self-attacking behaviors during the last inspection, but during this inspection, they seemed less
frequent or severe. Due to his aggression to his cage mate last month, they are now separated. Although a visual
barrier to get away from the public was built and more objects to manipulate (blankets and small loose toys) were
added to his enclosure, he still has psychological issues. He needs to be further evaluated and treated by the
veterinarian.
All of these animals are showing signs of psychological distress. Although they came to the zoo many years ago
with these behaviors, they need to be recognized as requiring special attention, and more needs to be done to try
and alleviate these behaviors.
For any primate exhibiting abnormal behaviors, an intensive program of enrichment needs to be implemented as
directed by the attending veterinarian. This includes devising a program with special considerations given to
primates showing abnormal behaviors and describing how their environment will be enhanced. Implementing the
program needs to include training employees in recognizing normal and abnormal behaviors and the importance of
an enrichment program. This facility needs to be able to show the enhanced program is being followed (ideally by
documentation). The program should include ongoing evaluations of the special consideration primates as to how
they are responding to the enhanced enrichment program.
To be corrected by 4-30-18.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
