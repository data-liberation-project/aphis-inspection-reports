ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One yak had overgrown hooves. One back hoof was severely overgrown and misshapen.
Excessively long and misshapen hooves are susceptible to breaking and cracking and also place abnormal stresses
on joints and tendons. The facility should ensure that routine hoof care is provided to all animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures holding hoof stock were in disrepair. Two broken boards and a section of crumpled wire fencing
were observed in an enclosure housing one bison and one zebu. Pieces of broken wire were protruding into the
enclosure. A section of heavy gauge welded wire fencing had approximately one inch tines protruding into an
enclosure housing two sheep.
Animals may become entangled in broken fencing and sharp points may cause lacerations or puncture wounds.
Enclosures should be routinely monitored for defects and repairs should be made in a timely manner.An exit briefing was conducted with a facility representative.
