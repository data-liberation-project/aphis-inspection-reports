FEEDING.
*** The diet for the bobcat, ocelot and lynx is beef or chicken with bones. In addition the diet states the animals will
receive Oasis supplement when fed beef at least three times a week and this is what is approved by the attending
vet. The facility did not have any supplement on hand and had been out for a week. This supplement needs to be
acquired and used as directed to meet their nutritive needs to maintain the animals in good health.
