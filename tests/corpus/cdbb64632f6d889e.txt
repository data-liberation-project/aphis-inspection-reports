INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The animal use protocol is not consistent with performed activities in several areas:
- Housing rooms are described in detail, but remodeling has taken place so they now don't match the description in
the protocol.
- The protocol states that personnel will wear leather gloves; they were wearing latex gloves while handling animals
at the time of inspection.
- The isolation chamber itself, and the procedure and handling activities employed to elicit and record vocalizations
inside and outside the chamber were not described at all in the protocol. A particular area of concern is whether or
not there is adequate ventilation/air exchange within the chamber.
A proposal for animal use must fully describe all activities in order for the IACUC to be able to evaluate their
appropriateness.
Correct by amending the animal use proposal to include full descriptions of all activities involving the use of animals
before continuing the studies. Do not continue this research until the amended proposal is approved by the IACUC.

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
A high school volunteer was handling animals for procedures as part of a research protocol. The student’s name is
not listed in the protocol as being involved in the research, and the student has not completed any of the animal use
training provided by the institution.
The research facility must ensure that all personnel involved in animal care and use are qualified to perform their
duties. Ensuring that training in appropriate handling of animals for all personnel involved with the animals will fulfill
the research facility’s responsibility in this regard.Correct by ensuring that any and all personnel have been properly trained before being involved with caring for and
handling the animals from this point forward.

SANITATION.
The anteroom of the smaller bat enclosure has a 3-tier cage that is fully covered in fecal matter. The cage housed
44 bats for 16 days while their larger enclosure/room was renovated. The temporary caging was not cleaned during
or since it was used. It has been vacant for over a week. The anteroom where the caging has been stored is the
area where research activities were in progress at the time of inspection.
Excess fecal matter accumulation on all surfaces in the bat rooms had not yet been cleaned by mid-afternoon.
Dirty surfaces pose a risk of soiling of the animals, and contamination and disease spread via the feed and water.
Correction plan: The manager said the cleaning would be completed by close of business on the day of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility manager.
