3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A wooden platform (step) that the goats use to access a wooden bridge within the enclosure has three holes in it.
All three holes are large enough where the goats can fall or get their legs stuck and potentially injure themselves. In
addition there is a wooden post within the enclosure that is broken near the bottom of it. The licensee stated that
one of the sheep broke it near the bottom. The post has jagged edges where any animal that is walking past it or
rubbing up against it could potentially injure themselves. The wooden platform and wooden post need to be
repaired or replaced so they are structurally sound. All housing facilities shall be maintained in good repair to
protect the animals from injury. Correct by 10/10/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
