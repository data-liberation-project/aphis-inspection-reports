***There is a male Sharpei (#45) in need of veterinary care - it appears to have a swollen digit on the right front foot.
On closer examination, the first digit or dewclaw has a toenail that is overgrown, curling around back into the soft
tissues of the toe. This is a painful condition and can lead to infection of the affected toe. This dog must be
examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated accordingly.
