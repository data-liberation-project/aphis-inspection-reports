2.36(b)(3)
ANNUAL REPORT.
Pigs on an IACUC approved protocol are restricted in farrowing crates for a period of approximately three weeks.
The restricted animals are exercised at least once daily during this time. For the period they are in the crates, the
pigs' normal postural adjustment are restricted, as they are unable to turn around. This exception to space
requirements is noted in the protocol, but has not been included in the Facility's annual report. A summary of all
exceptions to the standards and regulations under the Act must be attached to the facility's annual report. An
addendum to the annual report including all exceptions shall be submitted.
