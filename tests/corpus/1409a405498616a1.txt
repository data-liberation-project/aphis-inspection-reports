2.40(a)(1) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file is still inadequate, as it does not contain sufficient
provisions for emergency care. The current program, under the emergency care section, simply states “mobile
veterinarian”. The facility uses their attending veterinarian (AV) for emergency care but has no provision for
veterinary care when their AV is unavailable. From 9/10/16-9/14/16, while their AV was unavailable, one camel
requiring veterinary care/euthanasia (according to facility records & personnel) did not receive veterinary care and
died on 9/14/16. At the time of inspection, the licensee had not made an attempt to find another veterinarian to use.
Failure to have a complete PVC, including appropriate provisions for emergency care, could jeopardize the health
and well-being of the animals. The facility should establish and maintain a PVC to include all the regulated animals
at the facility and regularly scheduled visits to the premises.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***One female coati still has an abnormal left eye and has not been evaluated by a veterinarian. The facility/animal
manager stated to APHIS staff, "the eye looks better since it exploded". When asked to clarify, the manager
confirmed the eye had ruptured and was less swollen since the last inspection. At the time of inspection, the left eye
was still swollen, extremely reddened, had an abnormally uneven corneal surface and some clear discharge.
Although the facility has been treating this animal, the ocular condition remains unresolved (intermittent resolution)
since 5/5/16. The facility had contacted their veterinarian over the phone on 11/4/16. At that time, the veterinarian
prescribed a new ointment that the facility is currently using. The animal has not been evaluated by a veterinarian
since 8/25/16 and no additional diagnostic testing has been done.
Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems including infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical
conditions and can be painful and distressing. Furthermore, not having clear vision can cause discomfort affecting
the health and well-being of the animal and has the potential for further injury.The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian by no later than 5:00 p.m on November 18, 2016, to
obtain accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatment plans for the ocular issue cited above. The outcome of this
consultation must be provided, in writing, to the inspector upon request. This documentation should include the
veterinary diagnosis, all diagnostic tests and the outcome of those tests that were performed by the veterinarian,
any medications prescribed along with the dosing instructions, and entries on a log and/or calendar and/or animal
health record that list when the medication is administered to the animals.
There should also be an entry at the end of the treatment to document the health status and condition of each
animal at that point, to indicate a time frame to address current issues that require further veterinary treatment, and
the need for follow-up and any further veterinary care prescribed.
From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate
veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for
providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and
treat diseases and injuries.
***There are several animals at the facility that are in need of hoof trims (three pigs, housed in the indoor barn, 3
sheep and 3 goats) which were pointed out to the facility/animal manager during the inspection. The hooves on the
animals were excessively long, extending out approximately three to five inches. Failure to appropriately maintain
hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facilitys programs
of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a
timely manner.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The following enclosures are in need of repair or replacement:
Enclosure housing 11 sheep had protruding nails at the area the animals move between enclosures.
Enclosure housing 16 goats had chain link material that is turned up and in with several sharp points.
Enclosure housing 17 goats and 5 pigs had chain link material that is turned up and in with several sharp points.
The enclosures are not maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury or to contain the animals.
Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to the animals. The affected
structures must be repaired or replaced and all housing facilities should be maintained and kept structurally sound
to protect and contain the animals moving forward.3.130
WATERING.
***Two camels did not have access to potable water. At the time of inspection, the APHIS staff noticed the water
receptacle was empty for the two camels. Additionally, APHIS staff watched the male camel attempt to drink from
the empty receptacle. When asked, the facility/animal manager stated the water was probably turned off during the
morning cleaning and someone forgot to turn it back on. The manager turned the water back on, and the male
camel drank excessively for approximately eight minutes.
Failure to provide water to the animals can be detrimental to their health, can lead to dehydrated and other serious
medical problems. The facility must ensure that if potable water is not accessible to the animals at all times, it must
be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animal. Frequency of watering shall consider
age, species, condition, size, and type of the animal. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.
To be corrected by 11/17/16.
***The enclosure housing 3 pigs had dirty drinking water. There was a buildup of green debris on the interior
surface of the receptacles along with green debris floating on top of the water. Additionally, the water was a dark
brown liquid. Water receptacles must be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition in order to ensure that the
animals are provided with clean, potable water, to minimize disease hazards and to ensure that they maintain
adequate hydration. Water receptacles should be cleaned at a frequency that is adequate to maintain standard
husbandry practices.
To be corrected by 11/17/16.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee and facility/animal manager.
