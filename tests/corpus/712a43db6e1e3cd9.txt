2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
-Expired Ponazuril was in storage and had been used in the kennel since expiration of 6/6/2022. Expired
medications/dewormers might not be effective. Ensure that all medications are not expired prior to using them per the
attending veterinarian's instructions.
-A medication not labeled for dogs (Children's Acetaminophen) was stored in the kennel and per the licensee had been
used occasionally to help dogs that were mildly sick with fevers and after use the dogs got better. The facility did not get
instructions or ask the attending veterinarian prior to using this medication with dogs. The use of medications not labeled
for dogs without written veterinary instruction might not help the dog's condition and could hurt the dog if the medication is
not the correct type for dogs. Ensure that medications are given only per the attending veterinarian's
instructions/prescription and for conditions which the attending veterinarian has approved.

Correct from this day forward.
