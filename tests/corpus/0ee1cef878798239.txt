CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
The food and water certificate attached to the primary enclosure housing a miniature pincher puppy was not
complete ( see air waybill number 001TUL69811416). The food and water instructions were not filled out for the
next feeding(s) and watering(s) for a 24 hour period. Failure to complete the food and water instructions at the
airport origin may result in the animal not being feed and watered during transport. The food and water certificate
must be complete and attached to the primary enclosure with instructions for the next feeding(s) and watering(s) for
a 24-hour period.
3.16(c)
FOOD AND WATER REQUIREMENTS.
The food and water receptacles were detached and lying on floor in the back of the primary enclosure housing a
miniature pincher puppy (see air waybill number 001TUL69811416). There was no safe way for the carrier to offer
water or food without the receptacles being securely attached inside the front door of the enclosure. Food and
water receptacles must be securely attached inside the primary enclosure and placed so that the receptacles can
be filled from outside the primary enclosure without opening the door.
An exit briefing was conducted with the manager on duty.
