2.40(a)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A Patagonian cavy was observed with visible areas of crusting and scabbing on its lower back covering most of the hip
area during this inspection. This cavy also had open, ulcerated wounds on both hocks. The facility stated that a cat
attacked this Patagonian cavy, who was previously housed with another cavy and 2 wallabies. The facility reached out to
the AV via text on Saturday, 10Dec2022. A photograph of the animal was shared, and the facility employee asked if
chlorhexidine and doxycycline should be administered. The AV agreed to this weekend care. The facility utilized
doxycycline left over from another cavy's prescription through the weekend. The facility requested additional doxycycline
from the AV, who provided an additional prescription several days later. The animal was never presented to or examined
by the AV; however, these wounds (and the new wounds on the hocks) were visible during this inspection that occurred 8
weeks after the initial back injury report. In the inspector's conversation with the AV, the AV stated that they were not
aware of the ongoing medical concerns for the cavy, specifically that the reported injuries allegedly caused by a cat had
not healed appropriately and that active wounds were present on the hocks. The facility was aware of the ongoing and
new wounds on this animal but did not seek veterinary care or communicate the animal’s status with the AV during the 8-
week period between the reported injury and this inspection. Not communicating animal injury and wound concerns to the
AV in a timely manner and not seeking appropriate veterinary care leads to unnecessary discomfort for the animal, has


negative health impacts for the animals, and severely compromises the authority of the AV. Per the regulations, each
dealer and exhibitor shall assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of
adequate veterinary care and to oversee the adequacy of other aspects of animal care and use.
3.75(b)

Housing facilities, general.
A freezer storing fruits and food for the non-human primates contained the body of a deceased animal. Storing non-food
materials in the same area as food for the animals can result in contamination of the foodstuff. Per the regulations,
housing facilities and areas used for storing animal food or bedding must be free of any accumulation of trash, waste
material, junk, weeds, and other discarded materials. Correct by 10February2023.
3.84(d)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
Excessive amounts of rodent excreta were observed in the primate sheltered housing area (vervet and patas monkeys).
Rodent infestation can result in disease transmission and contamination of food. Per the regulations, an effective
program for control of insects, external parasites affecting nonhuman primates, and birds and mammals that are pests,
must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination
by pests in animal areas. Correct by 24February2023.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The facility stated that a cat entered the open-topped cavy enclosure and caused significant wounds to a Patagonian
cavy. The facility trapped and removed two cats but indicated that they do not intend to provide a cover over the cavy
enclosure to prevent future animal incursions. Not providing a secure enclosure for the cavy can lead to injury and death
to the animals contained therein. Per the regulations, the facility must be constructed of such material and of such


strength as appropriate for the animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and
shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct by
14February2023.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
Excessive amounts of rodent excreta were observed in the facility feed storage room. Rodent infestation can lead to
increased disease transmission and food contamination. Per the regulations, a safe and effective program for the control
of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and mammalian pests shall be established and maintained. Correct by
24February2023.
