CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
A plastic spray canister containing dilute soap had been left unattended near one of the outdoor sand bottom
cynomolgous monkey pens. At the time of inspection one of the macaques had managed to pull the hose of the
canister into its enclosure, create a hole in the hose, and spray a small pool of soapy water into the bottom of its
pen. It was explained that this soap is used for regular cleaning of the animals' enclosures and is nontoxic. The
soap cannister was immediately removed and husbandry staff notified.
Premises where housing facilities are located, including surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and clear of
extraneous materials in order to protect the nonhuman primates from injury or inadvertent exposure to hazardous
materials.
Corrected at time of inspection.
The inspection was conducted on 8/7/14 with the Staff Veterinarian, and the exit interview was conducted on 8/8/14
with the Staff Veterinarian.
