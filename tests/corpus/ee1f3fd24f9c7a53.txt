Facilities, outdoor.
The following problems were identified with the perimeter fence:

- There were two gates that had gaps underneath them measuring 5" to 6", and one junction between fencing and a shed
had a gap between the structures measuring around 5" - gaps under one gate were corrected during the inspection;

- Gaps under the chain-link fencing where it meets the soil were found measuring 4" to 7" - these gaps were corrected
during the inspection;

- A section of fencing near the hospital measuring about 10 feet wide was currently down, having been damaged by a
tree, and it was being replaced at the time of inspection by a work crew - this was corrected during the inspection;

- Also near the hospital a large dead tree branch had fallen over and was leaning against the fence, reducing its effective
height, as an animal could potentially use it to get over the fence - this tree was removed during the inspection;



- Just inside the walk-through part of the park where the dangerous animals are located and an 8 foot fence is required,
one section of fencing was found to measure only 7 feet in height.

The perimeter fence for facilities that house dangerous animals must be 8' in height on both sides of the fence. The
perimeter fence must keep people and animals from passing under or through the fence, and also act as secondary
containment for exhibit animals in the event that they were to escape their enclosures. Failure to maintain the perimeter
fence up to these standards could put the exhibit animals at risk of escape, and of exposure to unauthorized visitors,
including animals that could transmit disease or cause injury.

This is a 1st Relicense Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
Applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 4/8/22, or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply.

Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Relicense Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
