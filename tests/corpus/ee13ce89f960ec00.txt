Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
36 hard-sided plastic transport crates, containing 3-5 live domestic ferrets per container (166 ferrets in total), were
labelled with "live animal" signage on the top of the crate only. The letters in the words "live animal" were approximately
1/2 inch tall. There was no "live animal" signage on the sides of any of the containers. Waybill numbers included #7758-
4717-3061, 7758-4722-7878, 7757-9883-2871, 7758-4727-9511, and 7758-4726-8180. Live animal signage with
directional arrows is important because it alerts handlers that the container contains live animals, and signals the correct
upright position of the containers. Correct by 02/11/2022 by ensuring that travel crates for ferrets and other animals
covered by the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) are labelled with "live animal" signage and directional arrows as required by the
AWA regulations.

This inspection was conduced with a facility manager, and the exit interview was conducted with company
representatives.
