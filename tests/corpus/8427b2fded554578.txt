ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several prescription medications for the animals had not been given by the facility as directed by the attending
veterinarian.
- A prescription for the 4 yr old male coyote "Koda" for a leg injury was dated 8/15/16 for Clindamycin 75 mg (28
capsules). This antibiotic was to be administered until finished; however, all 28 capsules were present in the bottle.
- A prescription for the 9 yr old female lynx "Persia" for a leg injury dated 10/14/16 for Baytril 136mg (14 tablets) was
to be given until finished. All 14 tablets remained at the time of inspection.
- For the 24 yr old brown bear "Marsha", Meloxicam 15 mg was prescribed on 12/09/15 for the treatment of arthritis.
100 tablets were prescribed; however, 100 tablets were still present in the bottle.
Medications must be given as prescribed by the attending veterinarian, as they are important for controlling chronic
conditions, treating medical conditions, and to enhance the overall long-term health and well-being of the animals.
Correct from this time forward.
The 4 yr old male coyote "Koda" was observed pacing inside its shelter several times during the inspection.
Abnormal or repetitive behavior patterns can be indicative of physical or psychological issues that may require
medical treatment. The animal must be evaluated by the attending veterinarian to receive any appropriate
treatment or management.
