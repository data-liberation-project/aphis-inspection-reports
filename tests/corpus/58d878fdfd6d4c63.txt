ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female French Bulldog ID #30 has a quarter sized raised area on the right front leg. The quarter sized area was
on the front of the leg and was raised about 1/4 inch. The skin in this area was a purplish red, with some hair on
this spot. The licensee stated the dog had been in a fight and was treating a wound on the ear, but didn't notice the
spot on the leg. Wounds on the dogs can cause pain and discomfort. The licensee must consult with a veterinarian
about this dogs condition.
