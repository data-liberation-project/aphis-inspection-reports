2.40(b)(3) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At the Educational Center, there was a goat named "Benny" that was having some difficulty walking normally upon
first rising. Upon closer exam it was discovered that his hooves were over-grown, causing the feet to turn outward.
Failure to properly maintain hooves can result in discomfort, lameness, and could exacerbate underlying problems
such as arthritis. Failure to recognize and address problems with the health and well-being of the animals can result
in poor outcomes for the animals. All animals should be observed on a daily basis, problems should be recognized,
and communicated promptly to the attending veterinarian.
Steps should be taken to ensure that any problems with the animals are recognized in timely manner; addressed
with proper husbandry, and / or veterinary consultation when appropriate, and preferably documented so as to show
compliance.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
In the wooden shelters for the goats and the pig there was an accumulation of straw bedding measuring three to
five inches thick. Upon disturbing the bedding it was discovered that the straw was wet, decomposing, and full of
insects.
Enclosures should be maintained so that they provide clean and dry shelter for the animals. Failure to replace
bedding regularly can result in unsanitary conditions that could be detrimental to the animals, and cause
discomfort.
A plan should be implemented to ensue that bedding is changed out on a regular basis.
To be corrected from this time forward.This inspection was conducted with facility representatives, and the exit interview occurred by phone on 3/25/17
with the Animal Care Representative.
