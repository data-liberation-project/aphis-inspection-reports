Sanitation.
Enclosure housing approximately 46 weaned guinea pigs has accumulations of feces and soiled bedding. Facility
representative said the enclosures are cleaned at least weekly on Saturday, but this enclosure appears to have been
missed this week.

Ineffective cleaning and sanitation can expose the animals to disease hazards and health problems. Primary enclosures
must be cleaned often enough to prevent an accumulation of feces and soiled bedding. and must be sanitized at least
once every 2 weeks. Correct by ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean to prevent an accumulation of excreta
(feces), dirt, and soiled bedding and that enclosures are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks. Correct by October 19,
2020.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
