shoulder, hip and spine bones more prominently than during the inspection of February 10, 2015. The flanks were
sunken from the base of the where the ribs attach to the spine to the protruding hip bones. This dog was extremely
thin. This dog also had hair loss on the lateral sides of both front legs approximately two inches above the feet.
These areas were bright pink with a few small scabbed areas and other areas that were raised and pinkish/clear as
in the appearance of a blister. There was also hair loss (dime size) across the front paws, the back legs
approximately four inches above the feet, the tail, spine and hip bones. The hair loss had extended across the digits
of the front left foot. There was a crusty area of hair loss on the back area in between the shoulders, just at the base
of the white hair around the neck. He also had toenails that were long enough that they were beginning to turn the
digits. The eyes appeared to be sluggish and dull. The facility representative stated that this animal had been
dewormed recently due to being thin and that the hairloss was from digging. This dog was housed on cement. This
dog had not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian as instructed in the report for the February 10, 2015
inspection.. Bone protrusion and hair loss can be indications of a serious medical condition. Long toenails left
unattended can turn the digits and cause discomfort, pain or lameness.
