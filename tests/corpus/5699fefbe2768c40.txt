FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A 1 year old female ocelot, Rita, was placed on exhibit May 1, 2019. This enclosure was inspected on April 30, 2019
by a keeper and was reported to be in good condition and no gaps or openings were found. On May 12, 2019 in the
early morning it was discovered that Rita escaped from her enclosure. She was recaptured without incident at
7:30am that same day and appeared to be in good health. The attending veterinarian was notified and examined
Rita on May 14, 2019, no injuries or medical issues were found. Through investigation, it is speculated that Rita
jumped up onto a narrow ledge at the top of her enclosure and managed to tear a small 6 in X 4 in opening where
the net covering the enclosure is attached to a cable and this is how she escaped.
Rita has been removed from this enclosure and is in an off-exhibit holding enclosure until repairs are made to her
on-exhibit enclosure.
Enclosures for all animals must be constructed in a manner so that they contain the animals securely, in order to
protect the animals from injury. The facility should monitor all enclosures to ensure that they adequately contain the
animals housed within. A system of timely identification, maintenance, and repair of facilities must be in place to
ensure the health and well-being of all animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
