ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS.
Several puppies younger than 6 months old were imported from Colombia without documentation and/or justification
showing animals were intended for research or veterinary treatment. Under USDA rules, you cannot import a dog
younger than 6 months old into the United States for resale or adoption and must have a justification to import them
at that age for research or veterinary treatment. All dogs imported for any of those purposes must have a valid
vaccination against rabies, have certain other vaccinations, a veterinary health certificate and not show signs of
disease on import. The registrant must only import puppies of proper age by following USDA rules.
