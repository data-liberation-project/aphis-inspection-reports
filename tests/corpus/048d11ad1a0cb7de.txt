2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were 3 guinea pigs observed with health conditions requiring treatment in accordance with the Program of
Veterinary Care or consultation with the attending veterinarian. There was a black and white adult guinea pig in Pen 93
that was laying on its side. When it was lifted to sit upright it fell on its side again. There was a dark brown adult guinea
pig in Pen 72 with a right head tilt and yellow discharge in the right eye. There was a brown adult guinea pig in Pen 86
with a firm movable mass under the chin approximately 1 inch in size. The licensee had not observed the health
conditions in these animals and had not contacted the attending veterinarian. The animal with the mass was receiving
Vitamin C but no other treatments were being given. The Program of Veterinary Care on file specifies this condition
should be treated with an antibiotic.
Guinea pigs that are laying on their side and unable to remain upright are likely to worsen quickly if the condition is not
addressed. Head tilts with discharge from the eye and masses under the chin can can discomfort or distress.
The licensee must initiate treatment according to the Program of Veterinary Care or contact the attending veterinarian to
evaluate the animal and determine an appropriate plan for diagnosis and treatment.
