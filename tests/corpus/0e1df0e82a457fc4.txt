FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the alpaca enclosure, there were sections of wire in the fencing that were damaged or cut, leaving sharp ends
accessible to the animals. In the serval off-exhibit enclosure, the opening to the shelter box had been chewed,
creating a jagged edge. Sharp ends or jagged edges have the potential to injure the animals within the enclosures.
Enclosures for all animals should be constructed in a manner that is appropriate and safe for the animals involved
and should regularly be maintained so as to protect the animals from injury and to ensure their health and
well-being.
