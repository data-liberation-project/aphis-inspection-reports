2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of inspection on May 6, 2021., there were no camels on property. The facility representative stated that the
camels were taken to Florida. After a conversation with the licensee on May 14, 2021, it was determined that the camels
were transferred to a location in Florida and have been housed there for over a year.

There are no records of disposition that documents the transfer and that shows the address of the location. Disposition
records should be maintained and kept to facilitate the tracking of animals and to ensure their health and well-being. The
transfer must be documented in the disposition records . This will allow an inspection to be conducted to determine that
the the site and animal care program is in in compliance with the standards and regulations of the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct by June 5, 2021 and by notifying the office on the new site for housing animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
