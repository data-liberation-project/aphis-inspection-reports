3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The room containing the thirteen ferrets has excessive feces present along the floor trim boards. The ferrets are
housed in enclosures inside of a facility room, but are allowed access into the room to play. Feces can harbor
diseases that affect animals.
Thoroughly clean and sanitize the affected floor trim boards and repeat often enough to prevent build up.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Additional provisions must be made to control the wild mouse population at the facility. Three mice were observed
in different animal rooms during the time of inspection. Mouse feces and other evidence of the mice were also
present in some of the animal rooms. The facility is currently using live traps in an attempt to control the mouse
population, however, this method is not adequately controlling the population. Mice can carry disease that affect
other animals.
Implement and maintain provisions that effectively control the wild mouse population to provide for the health and
well-being of the animals.
Note: A thorough verbal exit briefing was conducted with the facility president on 6-17-15. The inspection report
was sent by email on 6-19-15.
