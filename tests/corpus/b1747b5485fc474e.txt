ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45 a.m. on
08/04/2015.
I arrived at the facility around 10:45 a.m. and made a phone call to the facility representative. There was no answer
and I left a voice mail message. Approximately 5 minutes later the facility representative returned my call and
informed me that she was not at the facility and that it would be several hours before she could return. Inspection
was not able to be conducted.
