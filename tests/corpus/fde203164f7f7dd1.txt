RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Although the store does not usually sell puppies or kittens, in the store are 3 puppies and 6 kittens up for adoption.
The required acquisition information is not available for inspection. If cats or dogs are in the store for sale or
adoption (and not through a shelter) then the required acquisition information needs to be obtained and recorded on
the APHIS form 7005. To be corrected with any future acquisitions.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
For all regulated mammals in the store, acquisition records need to be kept of where animals were obtained. Any
births that occur are to be recorded also. Acquisition records are to include the name, address, USDA number, or
driver's license and license plate number of the person who provided the animals. Acquisition records are not
available for 3 additional ferrets, 2 additional sugar gliders, and the births of numerous hamsters (33 regular and 26
dwarf hamsters, when during last inspection there were 10 regular and 17 dwarf hamsters). Births need to be
recorded and required acquisition information for all regulated mammals. To be corrected from this day forward.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
A litter of 6 kittens was brought to the store a couple of days ago, and the kittens were placed into the large (22
square feet) solid floor enclosure with glass walls. Each kitten is required to be provided 3 square feet of space, so
these six require 18 square feet. They are sharing this enclosure with 3 puppies and 5 rabbits, therefore the floor
space is inadequate for the number of puppies and kittens. This was corrected by removing the kittens from the
store during this inspection.
3.6(c)(1)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.Each of the three puppies in the large 22 square foot enclosure is approximately 14 inches in length and is required
to have at least 3 square feet of floor space each. Because these puppies are housed with 6 kittens and 5 rabbits,
there is not the required floor space for all. This was corrected by removing the puppies from the store during this
inspection.
3.9(a)
FEEDING.
Although the owner stated she tried the kittens on kitten food, the food now being fed is an adult cat food which is
not of sufficient nutritive value for growing kittens. Because the kittens were housed with the puppies, there was no
adequate way to assure each kitten would be able to eat a sufficient quantity of food, since they are not being free
choice fed with food available all the time. During this inspection there was no food in the enclosure besides rabbit
food. In the future if puppies and kittens are housed together, methods should be used to ensure the kittens have
adequate food. Corrected during this inspection by removal of the kittens and puppies from the store.
3.58(a)
CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
Five rabbits of varying sizes are housed with 3 puppies and 6 kittens. Rabbits are not to be housed with any other
species of animals in order to prevent possible disease hazards. During this inspection one kitten was observed
suckling on a dwarf rabbits ear to where the fur was gone. Corrected during this inspection by removing the kittens
and puppies from the store.
