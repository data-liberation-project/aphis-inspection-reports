FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Reindeer pen: There was a small stack of hay bales stored directly on the ground inside the reindeer’s shelter
structure. The ground inside this shelter is also presently wet due to recent precipitation over the past few days.
Additionally, the top hay bale had an accumulation of bird feces on it. Hay stored directly on the ground and not
covered within the animal shelter does not adequately protect it from deterioration, molding or contamination from
pests or animal waste.
All supplies of food must be stored in a manner which adequately protects such supplies against deterioration,
molding or sources of contamination to ensure the health and well-being of the animals. A system which adequately
protects all animal food supplies must be in place.
