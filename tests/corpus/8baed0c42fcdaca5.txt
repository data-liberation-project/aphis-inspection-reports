ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).

3.75(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The African green monkey/patas monkey enclosure wire mesh was broken which could lead to animals getting
through these openings and escape from their enclosure.
Housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound for
the species of nonhuman primates housed in them.
There was a cracked man made rock that had exposed yellow foam underneath and the animals may eat it.
Enclosures must be kept in good repair, must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely, and
restrict other animals from entering.
3.78(e)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The existing barrier located at the right side of the capuchin enclosure is 33 inches away. The public can reach
over the barrier and touch the enclosure.
The chimpanzee area had a small gate as part of the barrier which was unsecure on one side. The public had have
access through it to the enclosure mesh.
These areas are not constantly monitored by zoo employees.
These barriers do not prevent the public from having contact with these species of animals. It also does not protect
the animals or the public from potential injury.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The elevated platforms in the off exhibit dens had clawed/chewed wood which created splinters at the end of the
resting platforms.
These splinters could potentially injure the animals. Resting boards should be maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury.

3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Food was stored inside the freezer directly under areas where frozen condensate fell on top of boxes of meat and a
bucket of meat was covered with ice.
Several bags of dry pelleted feed were torn open in a manner which usually indicates rodents. This was further
evidenced by the observance of mice feces on and around the bags of pelleted feed.
Floors and racks were also covered with accumulations of feed which doesn't minimize the attraction of rodents and
the contamination of feed from their urine and feces.
3.127
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The sliding gate located near the elephant enclosure was open. This sliding gate serves as a portion of the zoo
perimeter fence.
There were several thick vines intertwined through the gate which prevents the gate from closing. The inspector
was unsuccessful in attempting to close this gate.
This is indicative that the gate remains permanently open.
The current condition of the fence doesn't protect the animals in the facility from animals or people going through it
and having contact with the animals.
It also doesn't function as a secondary containment system if an animal should get out of its enclosure.
The gate should remain close at all times unless it is in use.
To be corrected by 5-15-2015.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
The torn/open bags of feed may be contaminated by feces and urine of rodents as evidenced by mice droppings on
and around the bags of feed. There is no procedure that ensures that these bags of feed are discarded and not fedto the regulated animals
This doesn't insure that the food which is given to the regulated mammals is wholesome and free from
contamination by vermin and bacteria.
Disease (parasites, bacteria, etc.) may be carried in feces or urine of rodents that could negatively affect the health
of the animals.
To be corrected by 5-14-2015,
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Excessive dust was again observed on the top of one of the commissary cabinet and on top of the cooler. The two
metal racks where the food is placed had accumulation of a dark, sticky, greasy material indicating the lack of
frequent and proper cleaning and sanitation. This doesn't facilitate the prescribe husbandry practices.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this
subpart.
The exit interview was conducted with the facility representative.
