Contingency planning.
The transporter has not yet developed and documented a contingency plan that addresses emergencies or disasters that
could reasonably be anticipated and expected to be detrimental to the health and well-being of the animals being
transported. A contingency plan is required as a plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, and
care of the animals in the event of an emergency or disaster. The plan should identify the situations triggering the plan,
outline the tasks to be carried out, identify a chain of command, and address how the response and recovery will be
handled. The facility shall develop and document a contingency plan. Correct by 12/17/22.

Primary enclosures used to transport live dogs and cats.
During the transport of a six year old male retriever from Washington state to Maryland the dog was removed from its
crate and transported in the front seat of a mini-van. The dog became ill on the last day of the transport and the driver
moved the dog from the crate in the back of the vehicle to the front seat so she could observe the dog more closely for the
final projected 8.5 hours of the trip. Dogs should be contained in a secure and comfortable enclosure that can withstand
the normal rigors of transportation to protect them if the transport vehicle has any mechanical issues, needs to make any


sudden stops/changes in direction or is involved in an accident. Dogs must be contained in a primary enclosure such as a
compartment, transport cage, carton or crate during transport. Correct by 11/18/22.

Care in transit.
During a multi-day cross country transport trip from Seattle, Washington to Fredricksburg, Maryland one dog did not
receive veterinary care in a timely manner after being observed becoming ill. Two dogs were picked up from the same
consignor on the morning of August 29, 2022 in Seattle, Washington. Four other dogs from other consignors were also
present on this transport. The six year old male retriever picked up in Seattle did not eat on the evening of the first day or
at any time on the second day. The driver stated that he did drink water on both days. On the morning of day three the
driver observed that the dog was stumbling and shaking when he walked. Instead of contacting a veterinarian, the driver
contacted the consignor via text and phone message asking the consignor if she wanted the driver to take him to a vet
and telling her that they were about 8.5 hours from the consignee’s address. The inspector was told that due to time zone
differences no answer was obtained for a few hours. When the consignor and the driver did speak by phone several hours
after the observation of the dog’s abnormal behavior, the consignor asked the driver to offer dog canned food and then a
bit later a hamburger to see if the dog would eat. While purchasing the canned food, the driver asked the pet store
employee for a recommendation and purchased and used their recommendation of a ‘gastrointestinal synbiotic’ gel
product. The dog did not eat the new foods and during the delivery of another dog in Maryland, the driver noticed that the
retriever started panting and breathing heavily. The driver called the consignor back and stated that she was taking the
dog to a vet and the consignor agreed. After a few attempts, a clinic in Maryland was found that agreed to see the dog.
The driver stated that the retriever was noted to have a seizure on the way to the vet clinic. The dog was seriously ill upon
arrival at the vet clinic and was treated for three weeks with intensive care before being released for additional at home
treatment for secondary complications which are ongoing. The second dog did eat and drink during the transport and did


not exhibit any abnormal behaviors or symptoms during the trip. The driver reports that the other dogs on the same
transport all did well and were fine.
The drivers performed regular frequent observations of the dogs and during these observations determined that the male
dog was not eating and on the morning of the third day was starting to exhibit physical problems but veterinary care was
not obtained at that time at the closest veterinary facility. The transport continued and it was not until later in the day when
more severe symptoms were observed that veterinary care was obtained. If observation of dogs being transported shows
a dog to be obviously ill, injured or in physical distress, the dog must not be transported in commerce, except to receive
veterinary care for the condition to ensure the health and well-being of the dog.
Corrected for this dog. Correct in the future by ensuring that any dog obviously ill, injured or in physical distress is not
transported in commerce except to receive veterinary care.
