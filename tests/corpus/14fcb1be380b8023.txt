2.31(c)(6)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) did not review and vote to approve the protocol "Draft Training
Protocol for Live Specimen Labs Using Swine," prior to initiating animal activities. This included a failure to review whether
this activity included procedures that would cause more than momentary or slight pain and whether procedures would
avoid or minimize discomfort and pain to the animals. Ten pigs were utilized for this protocol during the timeframes of
March 29 through April 9, 2021 and October 4 through October 15, 2021.
The IACUC is mandated to ensure the humane use of animals utilized in research and teaching. Therefore, failure to
ensure a complete IACUC review and formal vote for approval/non-approval prior to initiating activities can result in
unnecessary use of animals and undue pain, discomfort, distress, illness, injury or death to animals. A thorough review of
proposed animal activities is central to the IACUC’s mission because it facilitates assessment of the potential effects of
proposed activities on the animals and consideration of any alternative procedures or potentially mitigating measures that
should be implemented to prevent undue pain and suffering.
The IACUC must thoroughly review and vote to approve/not approve or require modification to, all components of any
protocol proposing the care and use of animals (as specified in the “Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations,”
Part 2, Subpart C, Section 2.31(d)(1)) prior to actually performing the proposed animal work. This includes ensuring that


protocols contain a complete description of the procedures designed to assure that discomfort and pain to animals will be
limited to that which is unavoidable for the conduct of scientifically valuable research and teaching. The facility must also
ensure that IACUC activities, attendance, deliberations and voting outcomes are documented in the IACUC meeting
minutes.
