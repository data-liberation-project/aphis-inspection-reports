2.32(a) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
On December 13, 2016 the facility self-reported the following event to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare
(OLAW). On September 30, 2016, personnel connected an enteral nutrition bag to a piglet's jugular catheter, an
activity not reviewed and approved by the IACUC in the Principal Investigator’s animal study protocol. During an
IACUC review of the event, the PI indicated personnel had accidentally attached an enteral nutrition bag to the
jugular catheter rather than the intended IV fluid bag. At the time of the incident, the error was realized by the
laboratory personnel and immediately reported to the veterinary staff. The Attending Veterinarian reported that the
piglet died as a result of the incident. Although prior instruction had been provided to laboratory personnel for the
appropriate post procedural care and feeding methodology for the animals on this protocol, personnel failed to
follow the IACUC approved protocol and prior training. Properly trained personnel are vital to ensure that research
animals receive proper care and optimal welfare. The research facility needs to ensure that all personnel involved
in animal care and use are qualified and appropriately trained to perform their duties at all times. The research
facility acted promptly to address this incident by conducting an investigation, reporting the incident to OLAW and
swiftly implementing appropriate corrective actions, including but not limited to retraining of personnel and hiring a
new research assistant to oversee animal activities, to prevent future occurrences. This item has been corrected by
the facility.
The inspection was conducted with facility representatives on May 3 -4, 2017. An exit briefing was conducted with
the Attending Veterinarian on May 4, 2017.
