2.40(a)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee's Program of Veterinary Care has a procedure to clean the tools after a tail docking. It calls for the
tools to be cleaned immediately after the procedure is performed. The licensee informed me that they last
performed the procedure a few days ago. When inspecting the tools, it was obvious they had not been cleaned per
the procedure that was written up in the Program of Veterinary Care. Some of the tools still had blood present from
the last procedure that was performed. Not following the Program of Veterinary Care doesn't ensure that the tools
are being cleaned properly which can lead to possible contamination with the tools and the spread of disease. All
tools must be cleaned and disinfected per the instructions in the Program of Veterinary Care. Correct immediately.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was a buildup of grime on the doggy doors in approximately 15 of the primary enclosures. The licensee
informed me that the doggy doors had last been cleaned about a month ago. Grime on the doggy doors can lead to
the spread of disease. All doggy doors must be sanitized every two weeks and more often if necessary to prevent
the accumulation of dirt, debris, and other disease hazards. Correct by 5/10/17.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
