Housing facilities, general.
The door in the Golden Lion Tamarin area that leads to the outdoor keeper area needs to be addressed. The base of the
door is rusted through and deteriorating. As a main entry door into a primate area, this door needs to be maintained in
good repair to facilitate husbandry practices and containment of the animals.

Facilities, general.
*** There is paint flaking off the wood fences in the Jacob sheep enclosure. Flaking paint can be a potential ingestion
hazard and these sections of fence need to be maintained in good repair for the safety of the sheep.

*** The base of the door in the pig enclosure is rusted and deteriorating. This door needs to be addressed and maintained
in good repair for the safety of the pigs.

*** One of the main stall doors for the camel barn has a panel of wire mesh covering the door. The wire is bending
upwards and is not in good repair. This section of mesh should be replaced for the safety of the camels. In addition, there
is a section of wood along the shift to the outdoor portion of the enclosure that is chewed and has a few nails exposed into
the stall. This section of wood needs to be replaced to keep the enclosure in good repair and for the safety of the animals.


*** There is a very large hole/den that was dug by the hyenas in their exhibit that is next to some large rocks. The integrity
of the hole has not been checked by the keepers as they cannot safety lock the hyenas in holding together. Holding is
their only access point to the exhibit. Hyenas are active diggers and there is a potential for the hole to collapse on an
animal, or a large rock could fall on the animals due to the instability of the ground through digging. Monitoring the
enclosure requires regular access to the enclosure to check for these potential hazards. This needs to be addressed for
the safety of the animals.

Facilities, general.
The main trailer used to store food for the facility needs to be addressed. The main access door is rusted along the
bottom and temperature variations over the years has caused the door to swell in parts making it very difficult to open and
close. This door needs to be addressed to assure the door can function as intended for the food to be properly stored,
protecting supplies against deterioration and potential contamination by pests.

Facilities, general.
Management of waste disposal must be addressed at the at the facility. Currently the facility is dumping their animal
waste and bedding into “compost” piles just past the parking lot on a sloped hill that is accessible to local wildlife. The
compostable waste is not managed according to best practices and local guidance and the piles are not being turned to
provide oxygen or checked to maintain moisture so materials may effectively decompose. Because the piles are not
decomposing properly, this waste can pose a health hazard to the local wildlife and be a source for disease spread. The
AV has stated that the materials may not be used again at the facility for concerns of disease spread. Waste disposal

must be addressed and the facilities for animal waste must comply with applicable, Federal, State, and local laws and
regulations pertaining to pollution control and the protection of the environment.

Facilities, outdoor.
The female zebra outdoor pen does not have natural shade and portions of the day the only shade she has is in the barn.
Some method of artificial shade should be provided to allow her to be outside the barn and still have sufficient shade from
the sun.

Facilities, outdoor.
*** Sections of the perimeter fence need to be addressed. In a few places there are significant gaps at the base of the
fence that are large enough for animals from the outside to access the zoo. In several sections there are trees growing up
through the fence which if left over time can affect the structural integrity of the enclosure. In other areas, there are trees
growing on the inside of the fence or along the outside that allow the perimeter fence to be breeched easily wither via
human or animal. The trees potentially facilitate an animal escape from the zoo if their primary enclosure was
compromised. The perimeter fence must be constructed and maintained so it protects the animals by restricting animals
and unauthorized persons from going over it, or under it and can act as a secondary containment system for the animals
at the facility.
3.131(c)

Sanitation.
The housekeeping at the facility needs to be addressed. There are excess building materials just outside the cavy
enclosure that should be removed. There is also a dump site of old buckets, trash bags, used pallets and fencing outside

the new zebra barn. Premises must be kept clean and trash placed in designated areas and cleared often to reduce living
areas for pests and protect the health of the animals.
