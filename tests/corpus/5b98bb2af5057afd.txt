HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The cabin building used to house 5 capuchins during the summer months has windows behind panel fencing
trimmed with wood. The wood has not been sealed and is not impervious to moisture. The wood trim will absorb
water and other liquids, such as urine. Unsealed wood is not in a condition that can be readily sanitized since wood
will absorb liquids. Absorbtion of liquids creates a possible biological hazard that may affect the health of the
animals. Place the wood trim in a condition that can be readily sanitized. Correct by: 1 July 2014.
