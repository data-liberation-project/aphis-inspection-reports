REGISTRATION.
Upon the inspector’s arrival at the facility, the registrant stated in a loud tone of voice to the inspector that he
disliked the USDA coming on to his property unannounced. The registrant continued to use a loud tone and had a
tense body posture while the inspector was attempting to discuss cage size for rabbits. The licensee used an
expletive to describe the USDA and said the regulations were hard to understand. Other issues discussed during
the inspection such as the frequency of the IACUC meetings and a past citation resulted in the licensee being
verbally abusive to the inspector and at one point suddenly leaving the building slamming the door leaving the
USDA inspector in the building alone and unable to open the door. The USDA inspector stated to the licensee that
they could see he was upset and the inspection could be stopped and a supervisor would come to conduct the
inspection with the registrant. The registrant “stated that he did not want another government employee to come on
to his property that one from the government was enough and that no one else should come on the inspection.” The
registrant continued to act in an intimidating manner (making abrupt movements, storming away from the
inspection, and raising his voice) towards the inspector throughout the inspection despite numerous attempts by the
inspector to defuse the situation. He walked away during the animal inspection and repeatedly told the inspector
she was interrupting him when she was trying to ask him pertinent questions related to the inspection. The fact that
the registrant continued to appear so agitated and irritated with the inspector made it impossible for the inspector to
get answers from questions and complete the inspection process. Additionally, the threatening behavior (slamming
the building door , and maintaining a tense jaw and body posture and suddenly not talking to the inspector)
displayed by the registrant made me feel afraid and intimidated and I decided it best to leave the facility.
No research facility shall interfere with, threaten, abuse (including verbally abuse), or harass any APHIS official who
is in the course of carrying out his or her duties.
The inspection was not completed.
