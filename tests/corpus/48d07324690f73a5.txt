ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:00 PM on
26-Jul-17.The inspector parked across the street from front of the gate of the facility. The inspector then called both
phone numbers on file. The licensee called the inspector back at 1:20 pm. The licensee stated that he would not be
available. Hours of availability were updated after the inspection was attempted.
Lack of availability for inspection prevents any oversight by APHIS Officials in enforcement of the Animal Welfare
Act. Correct by ensuring that a responsible adult is available during those times for inspection. Correct from this
time forward.
