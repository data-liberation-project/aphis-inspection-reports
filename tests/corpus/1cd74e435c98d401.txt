ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:25am on
05-NOV-19.
I arrived at the facility, knocked on the door, called out, phoned the number provided and left a message. I waited
30 minutes and then left. The licensee called me later that afternoon to let me know that they would not be available
for an inspection that day.
