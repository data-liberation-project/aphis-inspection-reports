TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Twelve Beagle puppies, less than 16 weeks old, currently at the licensee's facility did not have any form of
identification. Appropriate identification of dogs is necessary to know the identity of the dogs with certainty and to
meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The licensee
must properly identify puppies with an acceptable form of identification, which include a microchip, tatoo, a collar
and tag, or a plastic-type collar with the required information legibly written.

HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
The licensee could not produce health certificates for twelve Beagle puppies currently in her facility, which were
acquired from a breeder in Arkansas. Health certificates are necessary to document that a veterinarian has
examined the puppies and verified that they appear to be free of any infectious disease or physical abnormality
which would endanger the animal(s) or other animals or endanger public health. The licensee must ensure that all
dogs she acquires are accompanied by a health certificate issued not more than 10 days prior to transportation.
