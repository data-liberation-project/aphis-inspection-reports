3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Animal equipment awaiting cleaning and other items were still present on the ground in front of the animal building.
The equipment is being kept in unsanitary conditions, and could potentially contribute to disease hazards and pests
within the facility. In addition, several of the tiles on the floor of the hedgehog room were loose, and could allow
fecal material and bedding to collect underneath and interfere with proper sanitation.
Loose flooring tiles in the hedgehog room must be removed or repaired. In addition, the licensee must ensure that
all unwanted items are properly discarded and removed from the property, and that the premises are kept clean in
order to minimize odor and pests. Additionally, useful items must be properly cleaned, organized and stored so that
all areas of the facility are kept clean and free of accumulation of materials in order to facilitate proper husbandry
practices.
The facility was previously cited under this regulation on 7/18/16, 9/11/17, and 12/11/17.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representative.
