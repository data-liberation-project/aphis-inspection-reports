INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Proposals to conduct activities involving animals.
1. Review of Protocol #2517: The IACUC approved protocol contained several inconsistencies and/or
contradictions in the text pertaining to number of animals to be used, procedures to be performed on the study
animals, and substances to be administered to the study animals.
Per this Section of the Regulations, a proposal to conduct an activity on animals must contain a complete
description of the proposed use of the animals in order to ensure that the proposed activities meet all of the
requirements of this subchapter.
The IACUC needs to address this issue that was identified for this protocol.

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Training of personnel.
1. Pertaining to Protocol #2462: Clinical veterinary staff informed the IACUC of adverse events that took place in
Fall 2014 that involved animals used under this protocol and a subcommittee was formed to investigate. Although
prior instruction had been provided to laboratory staff on the institution's standards for animal use in research and
for appropriate pre and post procedural care of research animals, it was determined that three doses of
non-steroidal analgesic prescribed by veterinary staff to alleviate secondary effects of experimental manipulation
were not administered to one pig and as a result, the animal experienced discomfort.
Per this Section of the Regulations, all personnel involved in animal care and use should be qualified andappropriately trained in research methods of animal use and the proper pre procedural and post procedural care of
the species of animals that the personnel will be working with.
The IACUC and Attending Veterinarian acted to address this item by conducting an investigation and swiftly
implementing corrective actions to prevent any future incidents. Corrective actions included but were not limited to
providing re-training of laboratory staff and implementing other measures to ensure that future incidents do not
occur.
This item has been appropriately addressed by the research facility and it has been corrected.
