3.129(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
***The feed within the food receptacle for the coatimundi appeared to be caked into clumps with portions of the food
having a fuzzy-like white discoloration on top of some of the food. This was currently the only feed available for the
animal. According to the licensee, the coatimundi was fed a dry kibble dog food and the feeder was cleaned every
couple of weeks. It appeared that the coatimundi would not be able to eat the food within the self-feeder without
eating the contaminated food. The animal was observed eating the food from the top of the self-feeder which is
where the abnormal appearing food was located. Contaminated food can decrease the animal's acceptance of the
food and can increase the risk of disease and health hazards. The licensee needs to remove the current caked and
moldy-like feed. The licensee needs to establish and maintain a program to ensure that food is wholesome,
palatable, free from contamination and that there is no molding, deterioration and/or caking of feed at all times. TO
BE CORRECTED BY: Close of business on the day of inspection.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with Dr. Erika Leisner (VMO), Stephanie Osborne (ACI) and the
licensee.
