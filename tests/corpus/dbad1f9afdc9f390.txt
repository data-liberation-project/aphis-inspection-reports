3.28(c)(1)(iii) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Four enclosures measuring 15-16 inches x 48 inches are housing 15 weanling guinea pigs. These enclosures have
720-768 square inches which provides enough space for 12 weanling guinea pigs that are under 350 grams.
Overcrowding enclosures can cause stress and discomfort to animals. Ensure that these enclosures do not have
more than 12 weanling guinea pigs under 350 grams in them (ensure that each weanling guinea pig under 350
grams has 60 square inches.)
3.30 REPEAT
WATERING.
The facility has a cleaning and sanitizing routine for water bottles, however some (about 9 water bottles have clean
clear water but the insides have a buildup of dark greenish material on them. Build-up of materials in water bottles
can cause sickness to the guinea pigs. Ensure that this buildup is cleaned out and then cleaned often enough to
prevent it from building up as observed in inspection.
3.31(a)(2) REPEAT
SANITATION.
-While the majority of the bedding in enclosures is dry, the corners under the the water bottle valves are soiled and
visibly wet and create an area that guinea pigs have to get their feet wet and soiled to drink water. Wet and soiled
areas that guinea pigs have to stand in increase their risk for getting sick and can cause discomfort. Ensure that
these corner areas are cleaned more often so that guinea pigs do not have to get their feet wet to drink.
-The facility has a cleaning and sanitizing routine established and guided by the attending veterinarian, however the
licensee said that recently they have been doing bedding changes without using the disinfectant in between the
cleaning. Sanitization of enlcosures decreases germs and risk of sickness and is required to be done at least once
every two weeks or more often if needed. To protect the health of the guinea pigs ensure that a routine method of
sanitizing guinea pigs is put in place and done at least every 2 weeks or more often if needed.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
