SANITATION.
At the beef cattle unit, there is one empty pen that has a moderate accumulation of dry fecal material. The facility
representative stated that there have not been any animals housed in this pen for at least 2 months. Two expired fly
bags were also noted in this area. This enclosure is adjacent to a pen that currently houses cattle. Accumulations of
fecal material may increase disease hazards to animal areas.
Excreta should be removed from animal enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals
contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors in animal areas.
