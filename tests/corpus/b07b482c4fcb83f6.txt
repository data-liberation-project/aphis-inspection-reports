2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One adult female King Charles Cavalier Spaniel ("Millie", id tag #44) was observed to have a thick buildup of
yellow/tan tartar covering the entire outside surface of upper cheek teeth on both right and left sides. Tartar build up
was observed to be impinging on the gums but the gums were not observed to be thickened nor reddened at this
time.
Additionally, one adult female King Charles Cavalier Spaniel identified as "Schotzie" (id tag #7), was observed to
have an accumulation of thick brown/black pasty debris with noticeable odor within the left ear canal and on the
inside of the left ear flap.
Excessive tartar buildup on teeth may lead to dental disease issues and may directly impact the health and comfort
level of animals.
Discharge and odor from ears may be an indication of an ongoing ear infection. Ear infections may lead to
discomfort and may progress to more serious issues impacting the overall health of the animal. Untreated, ear
infections may also lead to chronic long term conditions affecting the integrity of the ear and well-being of the
affected animal.
Examinations by a licensed veterinarian should be scheduled and appropriate treatments implemented to address
the ear issue (Schotzie) and dental tartar issues (Millie). Appropriate methods should be in place to prevent,
control, diagnose and treat diseases and/or injuries.

3.1(c)(1)(i)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Accumulation of rust/corrosion was observed along the lower half front panel of the middle enclosure located in the
male dog sheltered facility. Several areas were observed to have pitting corrosion, flaking surfaces and erosion thru
the metal tubular portion of the panel bottom.
Areas of rust/corrosion in enclosures are difficult to adequately clean and sanitize. Areas effected by rust/corrosion
need to be repaired or replaced. Interior surfaces in direct contact with dogs must be free of excessive rust that
prevents the required cleaning and sanitation or that effects the structural strength of the surface.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Accumulations of bird droppings were observed along the top, bottom and panel mesh of enclosure panels on
three enclosures in the male dog sheltered facility. Bird droppings on the panels were also in close proximity to food
and water bowls contained within the enclosures.
Bird droppings may be a source for disease in animal facilities. Affected enclosure areas need to be cleaned and
sanitized following removal of bird droppings. Implementation of an effective bird control/management plan is
advised to correct any potential on-going contamination issues in dog housing areas.
