2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The attending veterinarian completed a new written program of veterinary care August 2017. The attending
veterinarian added how often she is to visit the facility. The information regarding parasite treatments has been
updated but is still missing information for several species (African crested porcupines, sheep and cows). There are
no vaccination recommendations listed for any species. There is nothing written regarding any TB testing of
susceptible species to include some of the hoofstock and the non-human primates. The capture/restraint
information gives a set amount of Ketaset to be administered to "primates" but does not specify for which of the
primate species that amount is appropriate (facility houses multiple species of different sizes and one dose amount
is not appropriate for all the species).
The facility and the attending veterinarian need to jointly decide on all preventative veterinary procedures, drugs and
vaccines to be administered to the animals. The facility shall contact the attending veterinarian and obtain the
missing information that then needs to be added to the written program.
2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The acquisition/disposition/record of animals on hand and the non-human primate environmental enrichment plan
are not available for review today. They are in the owner's truck which is not at the facility. Records shall be
available for review during business hours. Correct from this day forward.
3.75(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The spider monkeys have damaged/pulled up about 40% of the vinyl flooring of their enclosure in the indoor portion
of their sheltered housing. The underlying wood is visible. One of the spider monkeys was sitting on the wood
during the inspection. The wood floor cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized as required and water and urine can
run underneath the remaining vinyl's edges leading to difficulty in cleaning and possible water damage to the vinyl
and wood underneath. All surfaces must be maintained or replaced to allow them to be regularly cleaned and
saniitized to prevent odors and spread of disease. Correct by 11/4/17.3.84(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The indoor portion of the non-human primate building is in need of housekeeping. Banana peels and produce waste
are scattered on the prep table, in uncovered cardboard boxes and on the floor. There is a ripe odor of decaying
produce present. There are multiple items stored in the building to include empty plastic containers, tubs and boxes
of stored materials that are dirty and covered in dust and cobwebs. The food prep table is made of wood whose
surface is not impervious to moisture/fluids. Fresh produce and a knife to cut it is present on top of the surface;
there is no cutting board present. It appears that the prep table itself is being used to prepare the food rather than a
cutting board. Items, such as the fan and refrigerator currently used for the animals, are dirty and covered with
dust. Regular housekeeping is necessary to facilitate husbandry practices, reduce pests (insects, rodents etc),
reduce odors and help prevent spread of disease. The facility shall provide regular housekeeping to include removal
of trash (appropriate trash cans), junk, waste and discarded materials and keep the building clean. The indoor
facility was tidied up with trash disposed of and extraneous materials removed during this inspection. Surfaces still
need to be cleaned/sanitized and the prep table/food cutting surface issue still needs to be addressed. Correct by
10/6/17.
3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
At approximately 11:30 am during this inspection, two enclosure pens (one housing two dromedary camels and one
housing three llamas) did not have any shade. By 2:30 pm the pens were in the shade. Due to the angle of the sun
there is no shade for part of the day. Temperatures today are forecast to be in the mid eighties. Adequate shade is
necessary to provide protection from sunlight and to help prevent overheating stress. Correct by ensuring that all
animals have sufficient shade to protect themselves from direct sunlight at all times. Correct by 10/6/17.
The pig cited for veterinary care at last inspection is no longer at the facility. The sheep has received foot care.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned facility representative. In addition, the
inspection report was reviewed with the owner.
