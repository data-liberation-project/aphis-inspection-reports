FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were several areas within the primary enclosures for goats which were not maintained in good repair. These
areas included sharp corners and edges of sheet metal used to wrap vertical support posts, broken metal anchors
for tubular fencing, a corroded metal lower tubular fencing member with resultant sharp edges, and several gaps in
the chain link fencing large enough to allow a goat'(cid:25)s head to pass. Additionally, there were areas of the chain-link
fence that were not securely fastened to the lower tubular member. Areas in disrepair may cause injury to the
animals such as cuts or entrapment of a body part such as a head, or escape of the animal from the primary
enclosure.
All housing facilities and primary enclosures must be structurally sound and be maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury and contain them. A system of timely maintenance and repair of the facilities must be in
place.
