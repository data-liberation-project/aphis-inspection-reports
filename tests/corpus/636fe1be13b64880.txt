ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Yorkshire terrier (ID #69) is observed rubbing both sides of her body against the enclosure wall and
chewing on her flanks. Closer examination of the dog revealed hair loss along the spine on both sides of the body
and between her shoulder blades. There are multiple areas of brown, scabby material on the skin within the
hairless areas and matted, crusty hair around the hairless areas.
A female Yorkshire terrier (ID #79) is observed to be non-weight bearing on her left hind leg. Closer examination of
the foot revealed that the entire foot is swollen to approximately twice its normal size. The excessive swelling of the
foot has caused the toes to be splayed apart.
A female Maltese puppy (DOB November 2016) is observed to have redness around the right eye. Closer
observation revealed that the upper and lower eyelid are swollen and a large amount of yellow discharge is caked in
the hair in front of the eye and extending onto the nose. Dark colored dried material was also caked within the hair
in front of the eye and the skin beneath the discharge is wet.
A female poodle (ID #189) has a thick buildup of dark colored tartar coating the entire surface of the cheek teeth on
the right side of the mouth and the majority of the surface of the right upper canine and front teeth. A yellow
discharge is found along the gum line of the cheek teeth. The gums are moderately reddened and receded from the
teeth.
A female Yorkshire terrier (ID #187) has overgrown toenails on the front left foot. The toenails have developed a
severe curve and are beginning to grow towards the bottom of the foot. This dog also has tan colored tartar buildup
on the teeth on both the left and right side of her mouth.
A female Bichon (ID #162) has an open wound on the underside of her neck. The open wound was moist and the
surrounding area is hairless and is thickened and scabby. This affected area of the neck is located under the dog’s
collar.
Open wounds, poor dental, eye, and skin conditions, as well as, swollen feet could cause pain and discomfort to theanimals and could lead to further health problems. The above listed dogs must be evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to develop an effective treatment plan. Diagnosis and treatment plan must
be documented in writing and available to the inspector upon request.
Overgrown toenails could cause pain and discomfort, as well as, affect the dog’s natural gait. Female Yorkshire
terrier (ID # 187) must also have her toenails trimmed to an acceptable length. The licensee trimmed this dog’s
toenails at the time of the inspection.
The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Licensee has a 100 ml bottle of (100 mg/ml) xylazine and a 10 ml bottle of (100 mg/ml) ketamine on the premise
that he uses to anesthetize the dogs to allow teeth scraping to remove tarter on difficult to handle dogs. He
purchased the drugs from attending veterinarian. A handwritten note with dosage of “1 ml/20# xylazine + 0.1
ml/10# ketamine- mix in same syringe” is the only instruction provided from the attending veterinarian. No
prescription labels are present on the bottles. Licensee sedated a dog after inspection prior to report delivery.
Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information in order to ensure appropriate dosage and
administration specific for the species of animal it is being used for (dose, route and frequency). Ketamine is a
controlled substance and if it is administered by an individual who is not a veterinarian or directly supervised by a
veterinarian, than the individual’s training should be documented and approved by the attending veterinarian as part
of the facility’s program of veterinary care. Sedatives/anesthetic and controlled substances must be used by a
trained and knowledgeable individual. If not used properly, the medication could cause harm to the animal.
The licensee must be adequately trained by the attending veterinarian on the use of controlled substances and
other sedative/anesthetic drugs to ensure proper dosing rates and administration to protect the health and welfare
of the animals at the facility. Written documentation of such training must be provided upon request. Additionally,
the licensee must also have written guidance from the attending veterinarian to appropriately monitor vital signs,
handle animals during and after administration, recognize when medical intervention is necessary and determine
what steps to take.

3.1(f)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The upper wash out on the east side of the building is draining into the last lower enclosure. There is a heavy
caking of wet feces, urine, food waste, and grime attached to the upper section of the inside wall of the enclosure
and running down the side of the wall and coating the wire. There is one dog housed in this enclosure. Buildup of
waste could increase the risk of disease towa rds the animals.
Housing facilities must be equipped with disposal facilities and drainage systems that are constructed and operated
so that animal waste and water are rapidly eliminated. The licensee must replace, repair or alter the wash out, in a
manner that allows for rapid elimination of the waste and ensures that the waste does not contaminate other
enclosures.
