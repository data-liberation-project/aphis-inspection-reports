2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three bottles of expired Baytril were found during this inspection. Since it cannot be determined if the use of
expired drugs will produce the desired effect they were intended to in a medical application, expired drugs are not
considered adequate veterinary care and should not be used. Expired drugs must be removed from current
medication and labeled as expired. A regular program of drug inventory and removal of expired drugs should be
started and maintained.
Several bottles of medication designed for goats and sheep were being used on other species. This is known as
extra label use and must be approved by the attending veterinarian. All extra label drug medication needs to be
approved in writing by the attending veterinarian before being used for animals other than the species it was
intended for.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At least two timbers forming the top rail of the black bear enclosure in the area off limits to the public were in need of
replacement. The integrity of the wood was no longer sufficient to maintain the holding density needed for stables
securing the game fence to the timbers. It was easy to pull on the game fence and stables would pop out along the
top rail. This could result in structural strength failure of the enclosure and provide a possible avenue of escape.
The enclosure has electric fencing on the inside, but the game fencing acts as containment as well and needs to be
kept in good repair. A regular program of inspection and maintenance needs to be in place for all enclosures at the
facility.

SANITATION.
The hospital was cluttered with equipment and cages and there were dirty towels as well as a tube of antibiotic
oinment on the floor. It was apparent that the facility was overwhelmed with young orphaned animals that have
been brought in by the public. This is in accordance with the facility mission of rehabilitation and release.
However, there still must be attention to order and sanitation for the animals and staff at the facility. Someone
should be assigned general housekeeping duties and a regular schedule of cleaning, picking up, and sanitation in
place.
