3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are trees that are too close to the fence that could still provide an opportunity for an animal to escape. The
enclosures with trees that are too close to the fences are #11, #15, #17, #18 and #19a. We are removing
enclosures #8 and #14 due to the age and health conditions of the cougars 'Leroy' and 'Monica'. However, the trees
must be addressed prior to different animals being placed in these enclosures (#8/#14)
The facility needs to remove any trees that are too close to the primary enclosure fences. If the trees are not going
to be removed, an adequate kick-in over the top of the tree and/or around it that prevents the animals from climbing
the tree to escape must be added or another method must be devised by the facility to effectively prevent the
animals from using these trees for the purpose of escape. Taking these preventative measures and maintaining the
enclosure fence according to AWA regulations and standards should decrease the risk of escape by the regulated
animals that can climb and decrease the potential for safety risks to the animal and general public.
