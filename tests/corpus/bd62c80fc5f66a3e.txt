SANITATION.
Housekeeping.
1. The following housekeeping items were identified at the time of the inspection. One approximately 6 foot long
section of cattle 4x4 panel fencing of the outdoor goat pen was leaning outwards and wobbly when minimal
pressure was applied by the inspector; some of the wire used to secure a few sections of the cattle 4x4 fencing
panels to the vertical fence posts of the outdoor goat pen had sharp points that were bent into the pen at animal
level; and there were several approximately 3 foot long pieces of baling twine located on the ground inside the
outdoor goat pen and shelter. This affected 9 goats.Per this Section of the Regulations, premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals
from injury, to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices, and any trash shall be cleared as necessary to protect
the health of the animals.
The Licensee needs to repair the leaning fence of the outdoor goat pen; check all fences for and trim back any
sharp points of wire; and monitor all of the animal pens for and promptly remove any trash found in the pens. These
corrections are important for the safety and health of the animals.
Correct all items by 12/1/16.
