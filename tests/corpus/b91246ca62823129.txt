2.1(b)(1)

Requirements and application
When the inspector arrived to perform a focused inspection as a follow up to the inspection conducted on 7/21/2022, the
licensee had sold the building, business and animals to a new owner. The transaction occurred the evening of the
inspection on 7/21/2022. The licensee told the inspector at that previous inspection that she was thinking about selling
the building, but not the business and the animals.
Notification of changes in ownership, location, activities or animals is required in order to ensure proper oversight under
the Animal Welfare Act. Failure to provide such notification in a timely manner could lead to unlicensed persons
conducting regulated activity and potentially compromise animal health and well-being. Following the inspection and
during the exit interview, the licensee submitted written notification that she is surrendering her license effective today.
TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS TIME FORWARD

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
