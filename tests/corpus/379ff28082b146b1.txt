FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The show ring consists of 11-foot high chain link panels, to be considered containment. A decorative arch tops
each panel, adding approximately 12 additional inches of height, but it is not meant to be a deterrent or containment
asset to the fencing. 3 of these panels have a series of ~1inch diameter prongs in an L-shaped kick-in on top of the
arches that adds an extra 18 inches of height and a 6-inch extension towards the center of the ring. These
additional extensions do not appear sturdy enough to serve as any additional deterrent or containment. During the
show, a total of ten tigers sit on pedestals ranging from five feet (below the additional L-shaped extensions), three
feet, and 1.5-2 feet tall; for part of the act, between two and three tigers are elevated up to 6 feet in the air while on
a show apparatus. The owner stated that they do not have any type of cover or top that they can place over the
show ring. Despite the fact that the tigers are never allowed into the ring unsupervised, the ring apparatus is
inadequate to contain the tigers from an escape. Correct by ensuring that the ring can properly contain the tigers at
all times, either by adding height, kick-ins deterrents, or a top covering.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
On the day of inspection, thirteen tigers were kept in pairs (and one group of three in a double enclosure) in
enclosures which measure 4 feet high by 8 feet square. The tigers are able to stand up, turn around, and lie down
without interfering with their cagemate(s); one male tiger was seen sitting in an erect position and had to hunch his
head to avoid hitting the ceiling of the cage. However, these enclosures do not allow the animals to perform normal
species-appropriate postural behaviors such as stretching to their full vertical height, climb, or perch. During the
inspection, the ten tigers performing in the act were seen in their enclosures from 10:30 AM until the 5:30 PM show
time. They were not taken out of their enclosures or allowed into the show ring for exercise or training at any time
during the day. The three additional tigers are juveniles in training, according to the owner, and they are brought out
into the ring for 20-25 minute training sessions 1-2 times each day. There is no other enclosure or pen of any type
available to allow any of the tigers to make normal postural adjustments. The cats were only outside of their
enclosures for the duration of the 20-minute performance scheduled to be held twice on the day of inspection. Theowner stated that they are on the road typically 8-9 months out of the year in total (breaks interspersed between
periods of travel). The owner also stated that while at their home site, pairs of tigers are let into a large enclosure
with a pool and toys and they are allowed "play" time for several hours per day. Given that the temporary housing
enclosures used while on travel do not allow the animals to perform their normal postural adjustments, including
stretching and perching, in a non-training environment, the animals may experience physical discomfort or
psychological stress. In addition to individual effects, the fact that the tigers are housed in groups can present
space concerns because this does not allow them the ability to escape into solitude or to be housed separately if
other major compatibility issues arise. Correct by ensuring that the animals have adequate space to perform
normal postural adjustments appropriate to their natural species behavior patterns.
