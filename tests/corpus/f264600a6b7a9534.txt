Facilities, general.
Item 3.125 a
At the time of inspection the indoor housing area for the bobcat was reviewed. It was noticed that there was an area of
rotted surface along the base of the wall about 2 inches wide and 6 to 8 inches long.
This creates a gap in the surface in which the bobcat could get a paw or nail stuck, this therefore does not maintain the
enclosure in good repair to protect the animal.
Licensee needs to insure indoor and outdoor facilities shall be maintained in good repair and to protect the animals from


injury.
