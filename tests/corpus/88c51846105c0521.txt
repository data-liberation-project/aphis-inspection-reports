3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In the main sheltered building, there are approximately 12 enclosures. Inside the building about half the enclosures are
short to the ground with wire tops. These specific enclosures have an excessive build up of dirt and hair in all four
corners. There were also cobwebs seen on the wire tops of the enclosures. When asked about how often they sanitize
the reply was about once a month. Enclosures that are not properly sanitized can harbor bacteria and viruses which can
lead to sickness and disease. Primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and more often if
necessary, to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. The licensee must
ensure efficient and timely sanitation of enclosures.
