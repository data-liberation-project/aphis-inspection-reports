2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier with number OAO1573921 has matted hair on her legs, back and rear end.
The matting appears to be close to the skin but the inspector was unable to feel the mats on this dog because the
enclosure gate was frozen closed. The licensee stated that she knew the dog was matted to the point that grooming
was required. Soiled, matted hair can cause skin infections and become painful. In addition, matted coats do not
provide complete protection against the elements. The licensee must remove the matted hair from this dog. As part
of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must develop and follow a program of hair coat maintenance
to ensure that animals are cleaned when their hair coats become soiled and that matted hair is removed on a
regular basis.
3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*There is a rip in the metal shade material in one enclosure in the east row of enclosures resulting in sharp jagged
edges. One dog was observed to be standing on top of this shade structure during the inspection.
*One large metal shade structure for two dogs in one enclosure in the "boxer area" is sagging into the enclosure
and was not securely fastened down.
*Surfaces with jagged edges and facilities that are not structurally sound may cause injury to the animals. The
licensee must maintain the housing facilities in good repair. Correct by 28 February 2014.
3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a mixture of dirt, grease and excreta on the walls and floors of at least 3 of the indoor portions of the large
breed whelping enclosures. Cleaning of hard surfaces in contact with dogs is necessary to prevent an accumulation
of excreta and reduce disease hazards. The licensee must ensure that all hard surfaces are spot cleaned on a daily
basis. Correct by 14 February 2014.3.4(b)(4) DIRECT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are at least 43 dogs housed in outdoor enclosures with insufficient bedding in the shelter structures.
The Kestrel thermometer measured 48.5 degrees F at the conclusion of the outdoor portion of the inspection.
According to the NOAA website (weather.gov) the low temperature for the facility's zip code in the last 24 hours
was 28 degrees F and the projected low for tonight is 31 degrees F. Insufficient bedding during cold weather can
lead to inability to regulate body temperature and cause stress in the animals. The licensee must ensure that
shelter structures in outdoor enclosures contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below
50 degrees F (10 degrees C). Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees F
(1.7 degrees C) or lower. Additional bedding must be added before close of business today.
3.6(a)(2)(3)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*There are at least 5 dividing walls between outdoor enclosures in the sheltered facilities that are detached from the
floor producing gaps between the floor and dividing walls.
*There is a hole in the divider fence between two outdoor enclosures. There are exposed wire points protruding into
this hole. A dog was observed using this hole to pass from one enclosure to the other enclosure during the
inspection.
*Gaps and holes in walls and fences can allow dogs to pass between enclosures and injure themselves as they
pass under the fence. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures securely contain the animals at all times.
Correct by 13 March 2014.
3.9(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
The licensee put food on the floor of the whelping boxes for the puppies to access in three enclosures in the large
breed whelping building. There are feces visibly mixed in with the food in at least one of the whelping boxes. A
puppy was seen urinating near the food in another whelping box. Contaminated feed is not healthy for the dog to
consume & could lead to health problems & weight loss issues for any dog consuming bad feed. Food provided for
dogs must be uncontaminated. Correct by 14 February 2014.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are at least 4 enclosures (elevated outdoor section of sheltered facility) with excessive accumulation of feces.
The licensee stated that she has been having trouble cleaning feces from these enclosures due to the feces being
frozen. There are also at least 6 outdoor enclosures with an excessive accumulation of feces. In the most cases thefeces cover 50 to 70 percent of the available floor space.The gates of some of the outdoor enclosures are blocked
closed with snow which supports that the surfaces have not been spot cleaned daily. (The last significant snow fall
was about 1 week ago.) Accumulations of feces in primary enclosures can lead to disease transmission, cause
odors, attract pests, and be uncomfortable for the animals. The licensee must remove excreta and food waste from
primary enclosures daily. To be corrected by end of business 14 February 2014.
The inpsection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
