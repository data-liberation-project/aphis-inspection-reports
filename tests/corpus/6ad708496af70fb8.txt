3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The perimeter fence surrounding the enclousure housing the male chimp Ricky and capuchin is leaning inward, less
less than 3' from the enclosure due to the tree branches leaning on the fence. The fence must be constructed so
that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons. It must be at least 3' from
the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals
or persons outside the perimeter fence.
