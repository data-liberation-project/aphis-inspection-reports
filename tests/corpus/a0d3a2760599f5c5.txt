FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The perimeter camel pen has one camel. The north fence has the ground washed out for about 80-100 feet. The
gap from the bottom of the fence to the ground is about 4-6 inches. For the health and wellbeing of the animal, the
fence needs to meet the ground. The facility is to create a monitoring system to insure that the all outdoor housing
facilities are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the
animals.
