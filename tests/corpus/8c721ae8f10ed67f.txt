FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A small section of wire panel at the end of the main lion exhibit next to the new dens has pulled away from the lower
board. This has created a space large enough for the lion to extend his leg out of the exhibit .The sharp edges of
the panel may cause injury to the animal. This area needs to be repaired and all enclosures maintained in good
repair to prevent injury.
