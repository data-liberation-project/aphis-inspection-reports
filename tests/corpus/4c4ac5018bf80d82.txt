2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
On 3/8/19, a rabbit was placed in a restraint device on top of a counter prior to the induction of anesthesia. During
induction, the rabbit escaped from the restraint device onto the counter and ended up in the sink that was set into
the counter. Research staff re-restrained the rabbit and proceeded with induction of anesthesia. During anesthetic
recovery, the animal vocalized and attempted to right itself from recumbency. Veterinary staff was immediately
contacted to assess the animal. On examination, a spinal fracture was identified and the animal was humanely
euthanized. Veterinary staff determined that the fracture occurred between pre-anesthetic assessment of the animal
and its recovery from anesthesia. Inspection of the restraint device by facility personnel revealed a damaged latch
that prevented secure closure of the device. The damaged restraint device did not allow for safe handling of the
animal. Per this section of the regulations, handling shall be done as carefully as possible in a manner that does not
cause trauma or physical harm.
This item has been corrected, as the facility has inspected all restraint devices and replaced them as necessary.
This event was self-reported to the USDA.
This inspection was conducted from 4/8/19 - 4/9/19. This exit briefing was conducted on site with facility personnel
on 4/9/19.
