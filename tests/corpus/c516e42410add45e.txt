2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A written program of veterinary care was still not available for review at the time of this inspection. A formal
relationship with a veterinarian is very important for the health and well being of the facility animals. The
veterinarian should be involved in all aspects of animal care including decisions on frequency of routine health visits
to the facility by the veterinarian, determining preventative health protocols for the animals, and consultations
concerning problems with the animals' health, behavior, husbandry and diet. A document generated by the
veterinarian outlining their plan to accomplish the above functions needs to be available for review during USDA
inspections.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Records of animals on hand and acquisitions and dispositions of animals purchased since last inspection were not
available for review. Records identifying current animals at the facility and records documenting movement of
animals into and out of the facility are necessary for tracking of covered species by USDA officials. Records of
current animals on hand and acquisitions and dispositions need to be available for review during USDA inspections.
An inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives and APHIS personnel, Dr. Simone
Tomlinson, VMO.
