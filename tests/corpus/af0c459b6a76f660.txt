Facilities, general.
Jagged wire was observed at the back side of the rabbit enclosure. This condition could cause harm since sharp jagged
edges could potentially injure the animal. Indoor housing facilities for rabbits shall be structurally sound and shall be
maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury,

3.75(c)(1)(i) Repeat

Housing facilities, general.
There was a build up of rust observed on the wire bars in multiple marmoset enclosures. Rust can impede cleaning and
sanitizing of the material as well as compromise the wire bar integrity and strength. Enclosures need to be properly
maintained or replaced when necessary in order to prevent an excessive rust buildup. The facility must correct this issue.
3.75(e)

Housing facilities, general.
The food storage area as well as food prep area and refrigerators containing marmoset diet was found in unsanitary
condition. The refrigerator had multiple areas of caked on debris and grime. The food prep area was observed with large
amounts of clutter and miscellaneous items in the area around the sink. Areas where food is stored must be maintain in a
manner which will prevent and minimize contamination of the primary diet. Food storage facilities must be free of clutter


and debris and maintain in a sanitary condition. Only the food and bedding currently being used may be kept in animal
areas, and when not in actual use, open food and bedding supplies must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting
lids to prevent spoilage and contamination.

Indoor housing facilities.
The area where the marmosets are being housed does not have sufficient ventilation. This area is a basement with no
functioning windows. Animals housed continuously in a space with poor air quality can develop health issues. These
conditions can have an overall negative impact of the health of the animals. Ideally the animals should be moved from the
basement space or measures should be taken in order to improve the air quality and allow for additional ventilation.
Indoor housing areas must be sufficiently ventilated at all times to provide for the health and well-being of nonhuman
primates and to minimize odors, drafts, ammonia levels, and moisture condensation.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There was an excessive buildup of grime and debris in multiple marmoset enclosures. The frequency which these
enclosures are being sanitized is not adequate to prevent an excessive buildup of debris. Excess debris on enclosure
surfaces can harbor bacteria and disease. Sanitization frequency must be performed at regular intervals as to prevent
excessive accumulation.

Facilities, indoor.


The area where the kinkajou, cavies and paca are being housed does not have sufficient ventilation. This area is a
basement with no functioning windows. Animals housed continuously in a space with poor air quality can develop health
issues since these conditions can cause a negative overall impact of the health of the animals. Ideally the animals should
be moved from the basement space or measures should be taken in order to improve the air quality and allow for
additional ventilation.
