2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee has bird sulfa antibiotics in the kennel and the Attending Veterinarian (AV) has not approved the use of the
bird sulfa antibiotics in dogs. Using medications labeled for use in other species is an off label use of the medication that
may be inappropriate and detrimental to the health of the dogs. The AV must approve the use of all off label medications
before using them on the dogs.
2.50(a)(2)

Time and method of identification.
Five weaned puppies all under sixteen weeks of age do not have identification numbers listed on the cage card. Lack of
identification does not allow for the proper tracking of the puppies. All puppies must be identified by official USDA
identification.
2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The Record of Animals on Hand does not disclose all required information. Lack of complete, accurate and up to date
records does not allow for the tracking of the animals. The Record of Animals on Hand must be maintained to fully and
correctly disclose all required information for every dog at the kennel.
3.8


Exercise for dogs.
The applicant does not have a documented and approved exercise plan. Lack of an approved exercise plan does not
ensure that the animals will receive adequate opportunity for exercise. The applicant must document and maintain a
written plan for exercise and the Attending Veterinarian must approve the plan.
3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) is not complete. The PVC must include measures for preventative care
and treatment to ensure clean and healthy ears. Lack of a complete and approved PVC doesn't ensure that proper
veterinary care is being provided. The PVC must address preventative care and treatment for healthy ears.
