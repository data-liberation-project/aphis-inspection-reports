SANITATION.
The raised rabbit hutch is constructed of wood and wire. The wooden support rails have a build-up of excreta, hair
and debris along the edges. Build-up of organic material may lead to an increase in disease hazard such as
bacterial growth, spread of parasites and attraction of insects and vermin. The enclosure shall be cleaned and
sanitized. It shall kept reasonably free of excreta, hair, debris, etc. to protect the rabbit(cid:25)s health and well-being.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The bear enclosures on the right side of the driveway when going up the hill are in disrepair. The enclosure is
divided into three sections by a chain link divider fence. The chain-link on the bottom of the divider between the
second and third enclosure has been pulled up. The wire is bent and separated from the bottom support rail leaving
sharp points that could injure the bears. The fence shall be repaired or replaced and all sharp points removed to
protect the bears from injury.
The plywood over the chain-link roof of the second bear enclosure on the hill has rotted leaving a large gaping hole.
The roof no longer affords full protection from the rain. Adequate shelter shall be provided to protect the bear from
inclement weather and prevent discomfort.
The den in the enclosure for the large singly housed male bear is very small. It is not tall enough to allow the bear to
make normal postural adjustments. It does not appear that it would be tall enough for him to be able to stand on all
four limbs while in the den. The bear has rubbed the majority of the hair off of his head. Prolonged inability to make
normal postural adjustments can lead to chronic physical injury.
The bottom of the frame for the entry gate in the second bear enclosure on the hill has rusted and corroded. The
wire fence panel attached to the frame has corroded and separated from the corroded rail. The structural
soundness of the gate is compromised which could allow the bear to escape. The gate shall be repaired or replaced
to securely contain the bear within the enclosure and protect him from injury.The cougar on the hill is in an enclosure that has a concrete floor. There is a tiered climbing structure constructed of
plywood in the enclosure. The cougar is older and arthritic and because of this she may not be able to easily climb
to these levels making her spend the majority of her time on the hard concrete. Although the cougar is currently
receiving medication for arthritis she appeared to have some discomfort or difficulty when walking. Remaining on
concrete without access to softer substrate or bedding can increase problems with arthritis and result in lameness.
The enclosure shall be re-evaluated and access to softer surface provided to prevent or minimize discomfort.
