RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Currently the Acquisition records are missing the ID numbers of the regulated animals, and the addition of one
huskie male that was acquired within the past month. At this time there are no 'puppy records' being kept by the
facility that account for what puppies are born on the premises and by which female.
It is important to keep complete records of all regulated animals and of those sold or euthanized for proper
management, care and traceability.
The licensee must update the 7005 Acquisition form with all ID numbers for all dogs at the facility and add any
additional dogs as soon as they bring them into their facility. Accurate and up to date puppy records must be kept
for all puppies born at the facility.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are four windows in the facility that have a wire mesh covering that the dogs have chewed on exposing some
of the pointed ends of the wires. There is a center divider in a puppy holding area that has a few wires that have
been broken that are pointing into the enclosure that the puppies could easily come in contact with.
Exposed broken wires can be a source of injury by the animals if they were to bite down on top of the
jagged/pointed ends, or if they were to poke their eyes or any body part into the pointed wires. These injuries could
be painful or become serious if they became infected or injured an area like the eye or mouth lining.
The licensee must keep all surfaces and structures in the primary enclosures free of jagged edges or exposed
pointed wire material.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was a large amount of clutter located on the South side of the facility within 15 feet of the runs of the primary
enclosure and directly behind a single enclosure housing one dog. The clutter consisted of scrap material of metal,
wood and cement and other various objects that were in a large pile up to 3 ft high in some areas.
The accumulation of clutter and debris near a kennel facility can be a breeding and living area for rodents and other
pests and vermin that can easily come in contact with the regulated animals and be a source of injury or disease.
The accumulation of debris could also be a source of injury if the animals came into contact with the area.
The licensee must clean up the materials and keep the area surrounding the facility free of clutter and debris.
