2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility has had a formal program of veterinary care in past inspections and a recent veterinary visit was
documented by a veterinary record; however the approved program of veterinary care (PVC) document could not be
located by the licensee during the inspection. A written and approved PVC is required to demonstrate to APHIS
officials that a veterinarian is overseeing the husbandry and care of the animals and is consulted on proper
medication use at the facility. The facility must find the approved PVC and/or work with their veterinarian to ensure
that a written and approved program of veterinary care is available for future inspections.
