SANITATION.
Two Cracks were present in the Bear enclosure concrete floor. The cracks have advanced so that they have lost
concrete and are wide enough to contain significant debris. These cracks need to be filled to assure that the
enclosure can be adequately cleaned and sanitized. That will minimize disease hazards to the animal from contact
with accumulated debris. Correct by: 21 November 2014
