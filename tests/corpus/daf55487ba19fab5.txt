2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 6:00 PM on
18-Jul-19.
I was at the facility at 6:00pm. I texted Mr. Whitmore asking him to meet me at the facility. He texted back that he
was not available to conduct an inspection. Nor did he have any other adults available to accompany me on an
inspection.
Each exhibitor shall allow APHIS officials to enter their business, inspect the facilities and the records for
compliance.
