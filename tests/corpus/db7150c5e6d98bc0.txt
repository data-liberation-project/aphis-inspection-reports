Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:30am on 06-
APR-22.
I arrived at 10:30am and knocked on the door of the home and there was no response. At 10:34am I called the licensee's
phone and left a message. I encountered a kennel employee who said that the licensee was traveling and would not be
home until late afternoon. The employee could not assist a complete inspection process.
