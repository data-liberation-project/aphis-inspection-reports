MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
1. A rabbit was found dead in its cage by facility personnel in December 2015. No abnormal behavior in the animal
had been noted in the days prior to death. The research facility conducted an investigation and determined that
there had been a failure of the watering equipment due to employee error and as a result, the animal had gone
without water for several days that resulted in its death.
Per this Section of the Regulations, handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible
in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
The research facility acted promptly to address this item by conducting an investigation and implementing
appropriate corrective actions including re-training husbandry staff to prevent any future incidents. No additional
incidents have occurred.
This item has been appropriately addressed by the research facility and it has been corrected.
NOTE - Inspection conducted 7/26/16 and 7/28/16. Exit interview held 7/28/16 on-site with facility representative.
