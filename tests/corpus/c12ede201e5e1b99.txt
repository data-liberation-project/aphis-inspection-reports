One camel is housed with a donkey and several horses in multiple rotated pastures. There are no shelters in any of
the pastures to protect the camel from inclement weather such as rain. There are no trees or any other natural
shelter to protect the animals from heavy rains. Although the camel can be brought into barns if needed, it still
needs the opportunity to seek shelter at any time it wishes.

Although this facility has a perimeter fence in some areas, it is only 4 feet tall. Also this fence does not enclose all
of the pasture enclosures where the one camel is housed with a donkey and some horses. The licensee is in the
process of requesting a perimeter fence variance for this camel at this location.
This is a pre-use site inspection for a second site where one camel is housed.
No regulated activity from this site is allowed until all items are corrected and no other items are found to be out of
compliance.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the site's receptionist and by telephone with the owner.
