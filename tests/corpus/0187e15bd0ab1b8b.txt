Health certification and identification.
On May 11, 2021 the registrant picked up two, approximately 12-week-old puppies in Minnesota and delivered them on
May 12th, to an individual in Wisconsin. The registrant stated that he knew the puppies weren’t to be transported across
state lines without a health certificate, however he still transported them. Transporting live dogs in commerce who haven’t
seen a licensed veterinarian and received a health certificate that they are fit for travel, could result in illness or death to
the animals. It’s also important to make sure that the animal(s) are free from infectious diseases which could endanger
other animals and/or the public. All live dogs transported in commerce must be accompanied by a health certificate
issued by a licensed veterinarian not more than 10 days prior to transport.
Correction Date: With any further shipments of dogs

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
