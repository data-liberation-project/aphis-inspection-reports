Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:40 a.m. on
January 18, 2022.

Attempts to make contact with the licensee were done by knocking on the door and calling the licensee's contact number
and leaving a voicemail. During that time it was relayed by an individual at the facility that no one would be available to
walk the inspector through the inspection process.
