Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Four tri-colored female Bernese Mountain dogs, Zoey (ID #56), Roxy (ID #57), Piper (ID #58), and Zena (ID #59), had
overgrown rear dewclaws. The dewclaws on Zoey and Roxy were significantly curled. Overgrown and curled nails can
lead to unnecessary animal injury and pain. The overgrown and curling nails can get caught and tear off or start growing
into the paw pad. Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries.
The licensee must trim nails often enough to prevent overgrowth and curling.

2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An 8-year-old chocolate and white female poodle, name Ragen (ID #170), had a moderate amount of dark brown debris
in her right ear. The pinna had slight irregular thickening. Approximately 3 weeks ago, the licensee identified the issue.
The licensee began cleaning the ear every other day and applying a drop of ivomec. The program of veterinary care
(PVC) states “treat with flush daily or treat with an ear treatment from your veterinarian. If no improvement in 5-7 days
consult a veterinarian.” Thus, the licensee did not follow the PVC. Failure to communicate timely and accurate information
on problems of animal health to the attending veterinarian will result in unnecessary animal pain and suffering. A


mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems of
animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian. The licensee must inform the attending
veterinarian of Ragen’s unresolved ear issue.
To be corrected by close of business 9/2/2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
