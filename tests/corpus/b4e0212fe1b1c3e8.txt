HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Within the Discovery Center there is an enclosure containing two tamarins and one porcupine. The enclosure is
made out of wire mesh and is immediately adjacent to a public walkway. There is no barrier to prevent the public on
the walkway from touching and/or sticking their fingers through the wire mesh and having direct contact with the
animals in the enclosure. There is no attendant present in this portion of the facility to monitor this enclosure. This
poses a hazard to both the public and the animals within the exhibit. During public exhibition, there must be
sufficient distance and/or effective barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to ensure the
safety of the animals and the public.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
In the outdoor section of the enclosure containing two lions, there is a large area of mud in front of the access door.
There are multiple puddles of standing water within this muddy area. The lions must cross this muddy area in order
to enter or exit the indoor section of the enclosure.
In the outdoor section of the enclosure containing three elands, the water source is located on concrete. The
ground where the animals approach the water source is extremely muddy and has a large puddle of standing water.
The animals must walk through this puddle of water to reach the water source.
In the outdoor enclosure containing one tiger, there is a large area of muddy ground located along the public
viewing side. This muddy area also contains multiple large puddles of water. The ball used as enrichment for the
tiger was sitting in one of the puddles of water.
Improper drainage can cause animals to become wet and soiled which could negatively impact their health andwell-being. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. The licensee must establish a
method for quickly eliminating all standing water puddles from the lion, tiger and eland enclosures in order to
promote their health and well-being.
