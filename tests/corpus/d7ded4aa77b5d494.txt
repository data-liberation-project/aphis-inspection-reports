FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The plastic hutch in the chinchilla enclosure is chewed with several sharp edges and needs to be replaced. The
plastic tube in the prairie dog enclosure is also chewed with sharp edges and needs to be replaced for their safety.
These furniture items in the enclosures must be maintained in good condition for the safety of the animals.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
*** The mammals are housed in a building that has temperature and humidity set for reptiles. The hand held kestrel
thermometer read between 75.6 deg F and 76.7 deg F with a 62% humidity level. These ambient temperatures are
above what would be compatible for the health and comfort of the fox and chinchilla's. The fox housed inside was
blowing out his winter coat as seen from the fur throughout the enclosure. Chinchilla's lack the ability to sweat, and
for their health, temperatures should not get above 70 °F. The mammal species need to be separated from the
reptiles so the temperatures can be maintained for their comfort and well being.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
*** The fox that was housed outside last year has been moved inside into an enclosure that does not provide the
animal space for normal postural movements and adequate freedom of movement. The fox was racing around the
enclosure and jumping high onto a window ledge throughout the inspection and this repetitive movement is an
abnormal behavior pattern. This fox needs to be moved to an enclosure that meets his normal postural needs of
digging, creating a den, and climbing.
Correct by: Feb 15, 2017*** There was no evidence of dust bath in the chinchilla enclosure, these animals instinctively clean their fur by
taking dust baths and should have the ability to do this multiple times a week which is a normal postural movement
and behavior for them.

SANITATION.
*** Currently the licensee is out of the country and interns are assisting in the care of the animals. The ferret,
chinchilla and fox enclosure all need to be cleaned. There is an accumulation of feces in all the enclosures that
needs to be removed. These enclosures need to be cleaned on a frequent basis for the health of the animals.
*** The fox enclosure needs to be addressed. There is no way to access the enclosure and clean without the fox
being able to get out of the enclosure. It is apparent that the animal is not being cleaned with the excess fur
throughout the enclosure and the 7 food/ water bowls in the enclosure that are not being removed. This animal
needs to be moved to an enclosure that has an area where the animal can be separated safely so as to be cleaned
and fed in a safe manner, or this enclosure needs to be modified to allow for this level of cleaning and care.

EMPLOYEES.
*** When asked about the interns caring for the animals, there was no system in place to determine if interns were
actually coming to the facility to care for the animals with the absence of the licensee. Additionally it does not
appear the interns can access the fox enclosure to adequately clean and care for the animal. Multiple enclosures
need to be cleaned and it seems that the current staff is not adequately trained to maintain the professionally
acceptable level of husbandry practices. This needs to be addressed for the health and wellbeing of the animals at
the facility.
