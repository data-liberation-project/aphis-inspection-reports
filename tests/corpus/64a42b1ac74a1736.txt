ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 10 year old female pig (Piglet) appears to be thin and has hair loss. This pig appears to have a loss of muscle
along the dorsal lumbar region. This pig has been recently moved into an enclosure that also houses avians. The
licensee has administered dewormer(s) for this thinness, but has not consulted with her veterinarian on what
dewormers to use or the suitability to use them. The veterinarian also has not examined this animal recently.
The licensee has stated that this pig has always been thin, but does not maintain any weight records on this animal
to determine if her deworming medications are effective. These records are necessary to determine if this animal is
continuing to lose weight, maintaining the current weight, or is gaining weight in response to the deworming. All
administered medications shall be under the direction of your attending veterinarian.
This pig shall be examined by your veterinarian and treated based upon the results of that examination

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is soil erosion inside the fox enclosure adjacent to the entrance into the exhibit. This has now exposed the
wire mesh which has created holes underneath. These holes now pose a risk of injury to these animals .
The lower portion of the fence in the goat/pig enclosure is not secured and is pliable & pushed inwards. This poses
a risk of entrapment to these animals if they should get their feet or heads/snouts entrapped. This portion of the
fence shall be secured along the bottom to prevent movement and entrapment.
This inspection was conducted with the licensee & the Assistant Director. The exit interview was conducted with the
Assistant Director.
