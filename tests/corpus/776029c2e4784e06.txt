ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:30 pm on
08-Aug-19.
** I arrived at 1:30 pm and called the owner. There was no answer and no way to leave a message so I went to
knock on the door. Someone came to the door and stated that the owner was unavailable. I asked the person if they
were able to get in touch with the owners or if they were an authorized person to conduct an inspection. He stated
that he could not contact him and was not authorized. I asked the guest to inform the owners that I came and that
the visit would be an attempted inspection. I left the premises at 2:00 pm.
