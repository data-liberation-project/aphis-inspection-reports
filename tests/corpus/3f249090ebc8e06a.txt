3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
On the morning of August 1, 2021, a sheep that was kept in a large outdoor paddock with two other sheep was found
dead. The sheep had a large open wound over it’s ribs. The two other sheep seemed normal and all three had been very
healthy until this incident. On October 14, 2020, another sheep in an adjacent paddock had also been found dead. Both
incidents had been promptly reported to USDA. It is the opinion of staff and wildlife experts that both sheep died from an
attack by a predator, probably a coyote. The facility installed security cameras and did record a coyote on the grounds in
the time between the two attacks. After the October 2020 attack, the sheep were moved to different paddock that was felt
to be more secure with better fencing. It was assumed the predator came in through the livestock gates. The gates are
typical farm gates made of steel tubing with 8-to-10-inch horizontal spaces between the tubing. The gates were covered
with cattle panels to prevent entry of predators.
After the August 1 attack, it was discovered by University staff that the predator had likely entered under the fence on the
east side of the paddock. A small furrow, about 6 inches wide and deep, had been dug under the fence by the predator to
gain entry to the paddock. Upon inspection of the paddock fencing on September 2, 2021, the place where the predator
had entered could still be plainly seen. The fence on that side of the paddock had a space 6 to 8 inches wide between
the fence and the ground all along the length of the east side. There are currently no sheep being housed at the facility


and detailed plans have been made to make more secure pens before more sheep are brought in.
Animal enclosures must be constructed and maintained to prevent the animals from escaping and to keep dangerous
predators out. Careful investigation and appropriate repairs need to be made after injuries or predator attacks to ensure
the safety of other animals. New sheep enclosures need to be carefully redesigned and constructed of such material and
strength to ensure that the animals are protected from injury and attack.
To be corrected by: Before introducing new sheep to the facility.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian.
