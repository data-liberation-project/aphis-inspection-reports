Handling of animals.
**An incident occurred that was recorded on video with one of the servals in which the animal appears to be thrown
across the room while individuals are heard laughing in the background. Ms. Machnik indicated at the time this incident
occurred the animals were being cared for by friends while she was out of town. It is the responsibility of the licensee to
ensure that individuals taking care of the animals have the proper knowledge and experience of the species being
maintained by the licensee so that the animal doesn't experience any unnecessary harm or injury while under their care.

2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
**Several incidents of improper handling occurred with animals under Ms. Machnik's care. On June 7, 2022, an incident
occurred while "Zuri", was under Ms. Machnik's care that resulted in serious injury to the animal. "Zuri" was handled in a
rough manner causing a broken leg. Although "Zuri" was initially seen by the veterinarian, subsequent follow-up
appointments were not kept. The lack of proper veterinary care eventually resulted in the death of the animal.
**On or about 11/09/2021, Ms. Machnik released a bobcat under her care into the woods of Northern Wisconsin. Ms.
Machnik indicated the bobcat was aggressive and could not be given proper care. Animals should be handled in a


manner at all times that does not cause trauma, injury or unnecessary discomfort to the animals.

2.131(b)(2)(i) Critical

Handling of animals.
**An incident occurred with Ms. Machnik and one of the servals that was recorded in which the animal appeared to be
slapped and slammed down hard on a bed. According to Ms. Machnik, she had been in the process of working with the
animal and became frustrated at which time the animal was "placed" on the bed with a soft cushion. At no time should
any type of physical abuse be used while interacting with the animals to either train, work with or handle the animals
under their care.
