OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
During the inspection, in the outdoor enclosures there were at least five of the outdoor shelters that needed more
bedding in them. Some had bedding but needed more shavings so they can make a nest to sleep in. Each outside
shelter must have dry, clean bedding to protect the dogs from cold damp conditions, when the temperature drops
below 35 degrees more bedding must be added. Dogs tend to nest in the bedding material, so having an adequate
amount of bedding helps to keep the dogs comfortable and warm during the cold weather events. Letting the dogs
sleep on cold damp surfaces can adversely affect the health and well-being of the dogs. Owner must ensure that all
dogs have adequate bedding to protect them from cold damp weather. To be corrected by 01-21-2016.
