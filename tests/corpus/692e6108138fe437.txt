Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One brown female rabbit was observed to have hair loss associated with her right ear and top right neck. The underlying
skin was reddened and had a moist appearance. There was also a significant amount of cream/light brown crusts. The
crusting associated with the ear was dry and flaky. The inner part/pinna of the right ear had the thickest amount of
crusting. The rabbit received veterinary care by the completion of the inspection.

A portion of the white-tailed deer herd and fallow deer herd and one blackbuck antelope were observed to have
overgrown hooves.

One white-tailed deer, ear tag #69, was observed to be thin with fecal staining over the hocks/back legs. A brownish liquid
could also be seen rolling down the front aspect of the right rear leg, below the hock.

Two white-tail deer were observed to have a thin body condition.

A large portion of adult white-tail deer were observed to have hair loss. The hair loss ranged from patchy spots over the


neck, chest, and abdomen to generalized hair loss over those areas. The facility administered medications for internal and
external parasites on several different occasions over the last month. However, the condition did not improve, and the
unresolved condition was not communicated to a veterinarian.

One white goat was observed to be holding up its right front leg. The carpus joint appeared swollen. The facility identified
the animal Monday evening and administered antibiotics without notifying the veterinarian of the issue.

Medical problems must be identified and communicated to the attending veterinarian so that a diagnosis can be
determined, and treatment implemented. Failure to observe medical problems and/or communicate those problems to a
veterinarian can result in prolonged pain, suffering, and even death. The facility representative must observe all animals
daily and then ensure a mechanism of direct and frequent communication with a veterinarian so that timely and accurate
information on problems of health, behavior, and well-being are conveyed.
