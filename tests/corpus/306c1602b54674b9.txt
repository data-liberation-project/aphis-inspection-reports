FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the three metal shelters located within the cattle pasture was in significant disrepair. On the front left side of
the shelter part of the frame had broken away from the sheet metal walls. This particular piece of frame contained a
sharp jagged edge which was protruding approximately ½ to 1 inch into the shelter. On the top right portion of the
same structure, a second portion of frame was rusted and broken away from the sheet metal walls. The portion of
frame was approximately 2 feet long and was also protruding into the shelter preventing cattle from being able
exhibit natural standing postures. At this same location, approximately two feet of sheet metal edge was also
exposed containing jagged edges. Two other similarly constructed shelters, one in the cattle pen and the other in a
goat pen, were observed to have large areas of rust, approximately 5in x 5in, on the sheet metal in the bottom
corner. Each shelter was observed to have one corner affected. Keeping shelters in good repair and maintaining
structural integrity is crucial to preventing animal injury. All outdoor housing facilities must be structurally sound and
shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
