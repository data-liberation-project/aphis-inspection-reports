Facilities, outdoor.
Recently the facility added some new attractions, and the relocated perimeter fence has not been shored up and
reinforced to bring it up to the same standard as the rest of the facility fencing. The following problems were noted:

- A collection of large items in a parking lot are stored up against the fence, reducing its effective height;
- Gaps up to five inches were found under fencing;
- Vertical metal bar fencing has openings measuring four inches in width, and a gap under the fencing, creating an
opening of ten inches by four inches.

Additionally in one area of the park a tree branch has compressed the fence so that it no longer measures eight feet in
height, as required for facilities housing dangerous animals.

The perimeter fence should be maintained so that it keeps people and animals from passing under or through the fence,
and also so that it can act as secondary containment in the event that an animal should escape its enclosure. For facilities
that house dangerous animals the fence must be eight feet in height.



The facility should ensure that the fence is maintained so that it meets these requirements. To be corrected by 5/19/2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
