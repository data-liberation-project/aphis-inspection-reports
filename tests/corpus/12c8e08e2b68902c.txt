Contingency planning.

Employees.
The facility currently has only 5 out of 10 animal keepers who are working. The other 5 positions are functionally vacant
due to personnel issues or true vacancies. As a result of the staffing shortage, employees are spending all day doing
basic feeding and husbandry tasks while proactive maintenance programs, vegetation removal, and preventive pest
control are not completed. Additionally, upper level zoo management, including the Deputy Director and Senior Animal
Care Supervisor, as well as the Veterinary Technician, are currently spending a large amount of time doing basic animal
feeding and husbandry tasks, which are not normally part of their job, and to the detriment of their regular job duties.
Adequate staffing is essential for animal health and safety, public safety, emergency response, pest control, and
sanitization of animal and food prep areas. Staff who are exhausted or overworked may be injured or may make mistakes


that can affect animal- or public safety. Correct by Feb 1, 2023 by maintaining staffing at a level that permits the facility to
maintain animal and employee safety, as well as adequate and professionally acceptable levels of animal husbandry.

This inspection was conducted with the Veterinary Technician and the Deputy Director, and the exit interview was
conducted with the Deputy Director.
