No non-compliant items identified during this inspection.
A focused inspection was conducted regarding the direct nci involving the 15 year old female reindeer named
Striker. The licensee stated that the attending veterinarian (AV) had been at the facility on 8/13/14 to look at the
reindeer. The AV confirmed that the animal was limping and showing signs of lameness. The AV also confirmed
that the hooves were long and needed to be trimmed. The AV went on to state that the animal had a history of
lameness and classified Striker as a chronic lame cow.
The AV evaluated the animal and determined that she is moving well with the herd, was in good body condition with
good coat color and thickness. The AV determined that the animal was not showing signs of pain.
The AV recommended monitoring the animal for any changes in her condition. The AV stated to the licensee if any
changes are noted, the AV should be contacted for further evaluation. The AV recommended to the licensee to
have the hooves trimmed as soon as the animal was finished rubbing the velvet off of her antlers (to avoid any
damage to the velvet during the trimming process).
Exit interview was conducted with the owner.
