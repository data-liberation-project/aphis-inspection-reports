ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Angora rabbit had matted fur on the neck, back, sides, and abdomen. On the right side of the animal, a mat
was adhered to both the leg and body, restricting full motion of the animal. Matted fur can prevent normal mobility,
become a site of infection and skin disease, and be uncomfortable or painful to the animal. The facility is required
to use appropriate methods of grooming to prevent this level of matting of fur in the future.
The pig had several small scabbed skin wounds on both sides. The facility stated that they had been treating these
for at least 30 days with 1% silver sulfadiazene cream lot 27718 expiration date 08/ 2015. Medications that are
expired may not work effectively or have harmful effects when they deteriorate. Appropriate methods of treatment
must be used. The facility should contact the attending veterinarian and follow direction for further care of the
animal.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An 8 year old male ferret has lost a large amount of hair and is bald from the level of the shoulder blades all the way
to the tip of the tail. The ribs, pelvic bones, and spine are prominent, indicating lower than normal muscle mass is
present. Hair and weight loss can be signs of significant disease; resulting in discomfort and distress to the animal.
This animal was last seen over a month ago and its body condition has not improved. Timely and accurate
communication to the veterinarian on issues of animal health is required to ensure animal welfare is maintained.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The lemur enclosure has chain link sides separating from the beams, creating gaps the lemur could potentially exit
through, and multiple sections of wire protruded into the enclosure. The wire was very thin gauge, and the lemur is
able to extend his entire head through the sections in the fence. The chain holding up the hammock has a broken
link with a protruding end at the top where it is attached to the enclosure. The animal is at risk for escape or injury.
Housing facilities must be in good repair and protect animals from injury and contain them securely. The facility
must ensure the safety and welfare of the lemur.3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The fox enclosure has multiple layers of wire on the sides. On the interior of the enclosure, there are two sections
of small gauge wire fencing (chicken wire) with sharp protruding wires, approximately 6 inches and 10 inches in
length, that is not securely fastened to the wall. The enclosure must be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury. The facility must ensure that the animals cannot be injured on the enclosure wall.
3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Two opossums are each housed in small wire dog crates. The animals cannot climb, use their tails for locomotion,
or engage in normal social adjustments. Enclosures must permit the animal to make normal postural and social
adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Continued lack of sufficient space can cause adverse physical
effects such as obesity and stress. The facility must ensure that animals have adequate space of shape and size for
the animals to engage in normal social and physical behavior.
