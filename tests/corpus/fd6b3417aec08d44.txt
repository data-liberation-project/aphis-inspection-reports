PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Space requirements - hamsters.
Two enclosures housing one dwarf hamster in each and another enclosure housing two dwarf hamsters have an
interior height of only 5 inches and therefore, do not meet enclosure height requirements of at least 6 inches.
Inadequate space may limit the animals' ability to make normal postural adjustments, which could be detrimental to
the health and well-being of the animals. These hamsters must be moved to enclosures that provide an interior
height of at least 6 inches. Correct by 15 April 2015.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
