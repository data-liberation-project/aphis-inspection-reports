area could be a sign of disease and/or infection and needs to be examined by a veterinarian.
* " Missy" a female Boxer (#153) has a dangling mass on the left side of her abdomen. This mass could be a sign of
disease and needs to be examined by a veterinarian.

***********
* Three dogs were noted with hair coat maintenance problems. "Champi"- a white Maltese with no identification had
matted hair on the hindquarters, " # 138- black Shih Tzu had matted hair on the face that dangled and pulled on the
skin, also obscurring the dog's vision, and "Sage" (# 125) - a red male Pomeranian that had black organic material
matted into the fur along the hind legs and feet. Matting of the hair coat can be painful, can lead to the development
of skin infections, and reduces the ability of the coat to insulate the animal. The licensee must remove the matted
hair from the above stated dogs. The licensee must develop an effective program of hair coat maintenance.

************
* A Chihuahua (#176) has long nails on the right front foot that bend to the side when the animal is standing.
Overgrown nails do not allow the animal to stand properly, and can cause pain or injury due to improper body
posturing. Licensee must establish and adhere to a grooming maintenance program to include trimming of the nails
as often as needed to prevent improper posturing and/or injury to the dog.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
* "Champi", a white Maltese and "Joey" a male Pekingese did not have any individual identification on them. All
dogs on the premise must have a unique individual identification tag on them to allow for identification. Licensee
must ensure that all lost tags are replaced to allow for individual identification.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
* An enclosure in the "Boxer" building (containing three dogs) had a portion of floor that was separated from the
subflooring. This created a gap that could allow a foot to become caught and injure the dog. Licensee must replace
or repair this flooring to keep the enclosure in good repair and prevent injury to the dogs within.
