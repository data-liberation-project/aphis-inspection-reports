ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A red and white male Cavalier TS21605402 and a white female Bichon BFf1004 were noted to have dental disease
during the inspection.
The male Cavalier had swelling and pronounced recession of the gums, moderate tartar build up and root exposure.
The premolars on the left side moved to the touch. The dog allowed his head to be petted but was continuously
pulled away when his mouth was touched. Showing discomfort, he pawed at my hand when I was taking
photographs.
The female Bichon had moderate tartar build up and had upper incisors with pronounced root exposure. Several
incisors moved when touched. The gum around the incisors bled when touched. The dog allowed herself to be
petted but continuously ducked her head in discomfort and tried to pull away while examining her mouth.
Both dogs had been examined over a year on 12/2/16 by the attending veterinarian. No dental disease was noted at
that time. The licensee had scaled the dog’s teeth on 8/25/2017.
Appropriate methods must be used to treat, control and diagnose dental disease in your dogs as the condition can
be painful and cause further systemic illness.
The veterinarian arrived at the end of the inspection for reasons unrelated to the inspection. He was able to
examine the dogs. The veterinarian agreed the dogs needed treatment. The animals are scheduled for treatment
with the veterinarian for next week.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee's wife
