HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the outdoor kennels containing a mature male standard poodle and a smaller mature male mixed breed had
a kennel wall section with the chain link pulled away and down off of the galvanized steel frame. The standard
poodle could potentially escape or become entangled in the kennel through this defect.

The licensee will correct this deficiency by 02/14/2020.
