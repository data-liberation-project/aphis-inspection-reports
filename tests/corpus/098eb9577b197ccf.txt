.*** The licensee is using a different vaccination schedule than what is identified on the consultant arrangement with
the attending veterinarian. In addition the licensee is giving half dosage of vaccines two times instead of the
recommended whole dosage one time. The vaccine schedule needs to be discussed with the attending veterinarian
to assure that the dogs are protected from diseases and so the vet can provide guidance and has authority in this
area.
*** The licensee has also been breeding and wholesaling rabbits and these animals need to be listed on the vet
care arrangements to assure their health care needs are being met.

EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
*** A beagle that was 28 inches in length was housed in a 11.25 square foot enclosure. This enclosure is also the
exercise area for the dog but does not meet the 2x space required to meet the exercise requirement which needs to
be 16 square feet.
*** A male poodle that was 24 inches long was housed in a 7.5 square foot enclosure and needs 12.5 square feet to
meet the exercise requirement.
There was no exercise plan available for review at the time of the inspection. An exercise plan for the dogs at the
facility needs to be developed and documented and the plan for these dogs should encourage exercise through play
or other similar activities. This needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs.
3.54(a)
FEEDING.
*** The facility was currently out of rabbit food and was feeding horse feed to the rabbits. It cannot be determined
that this feed is palatable and of sufficient nutritive value to meet the normal daily requirements for the condition and
size of the rabbits. This needs to be addressed for the health of the rabbits.
