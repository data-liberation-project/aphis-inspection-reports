ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Adult, female Shih Tzu with chip number 026 277 114 was in a fight with another dog. The licensee states that this
happened a few days ago and that she has started to treat the dog with antibiotics. The coat is wet and matted on
the outside surface of the right rear leg preventing good visualization of the area. What can be seen of the skin on
the right rear leg is moist with a discharge and red. The dog tried to pull away when the leg was palpated. The
licensee has not consulted the veterinarian about this dog's treatment. The wet matted coat prevents full
assessment of the degree of injury in this dog. Fight wounds can become infected and be painful. The licensee
must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained
and that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. The licensee must document the outcome of this
consultation and make it available to the inspector upon request.
******
There is a bottle of oxytocin being stored in the medication refrigerator of the whelping building. This medication is
expired (14 June) and does not have directions and approval for use on dogs from a licensed veterinarian.
Inappropriate use can result in illness or injury. The licensee must ensure that all medications must not be expired
and be labeled and administered properly as part of the facility's program of adequate veterinary care.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are two enclosures that had a sharp wire point turned inward into the enclosure. One was in the outdoor
portion of an enclosure in the sheltered building. The other was in an outdoor enclosure on east side of the facility.
Sharp metal points can cause injury to the dogs.
******
There is one heating pad in an enclosure in the whelping building where the protective metal spring that encases
the electric cord has become bent and distorted such that there are gaps between the coils. These gaps are large
enough to potentially allow chewing of the cord. Chewing of electrical cords can cause injury to the dogs.
******
The licensee must ensure that housing facilities are kept in good repair and protect the animals from injury3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are 5 shelter structures in outdoor enclosures that do not have adequate wind and rain break at the entrance.
Dogs that have inadequate wind and rain break are not protected from the elements. In cold weather, wind and rain
breaks also help to maintain a safe body temperature. The licensee must provide a wind break and rain break at the
entrance of shelter structures in outdoor enclosures. To be corrected by 4 March 2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Margaret A Shaver, VMO and Kendall Lundy,
ACI in attendance.
