Contingency planning.
The facility has not documented a contingency plan in full. A plan is important to be in place in preparation for unexpected
disasters or events, as well a detailed strategy to address the needed handling, treatment, transportation, housing, and
care of the animals in the event of an emergency or disaster. The facility shall develop and document an appropriate
contingency plan available for review upon USDA inspections.

Outdoor housing facilities.
Two outdoor enclosures housing adult dogs had housing structures constructed of wooden surfaces where certain areas
are no longer impervious to moisture. While the licensee treated all building structures in the enclosure with a waterproof
sealant, the ramp leading to the platform in the first enclosure, and the housing structures in both enclosures, are no
longer resistant to water absorption.
Building structures made of unsealed wood cannot be properly cleaned or sanitized when permeable to moisture. The
licensee must ensure that all structures the animals come in contact with are impervious to moisture and able to be


readily cleaned and sanitized or removed/replaced once they become worn or soiled.

Veterinary care for dogs.
Medical records were not complete for one dog at the facility. “Lexi”, a four-year-old intact female West Highland White
Terrier (Animal ID #07) was seen by the veterinarian for an exam with wound repairs. While the facility maintained
receipts showing the vet visits and diagnostics performed, there were no medical records documenting the date the
problem occurred, or examination findings to describe the extent of the injury, test results, and next steps moving forward
for treatment and care.
Complete records identify medical problems as they arise; ensure adequate care is provided; and enables close
monitoring of conditions as they progress. Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make them
available during inspection. If a problem is identified (such as a disease, injury, or illness) the date and a description of the
problem, examination findings, test results, plan for treatment and care, and treatment procedure performed must be
included in these medical records.
