*** 3 animals were found in need of veterinary care during the inspection. This included:
~ Animal 1: In the Hut, in the top bin, the fifth row from the door, a white textile guinea pig with brown /grey
markings was observed closing the right eye, with a crusty discharge between the upper and lower lid.
~ Animal 2: One long haired male Syrian Hamster, tan with white markings, was being housed in an enclosure
with a female in Room 18, third rack from the back of the room, fourth row from the top, the 11th cage from the end.
This animal was observed with significant hair loss and numerous scabs along the back half of its body. There was
a bloody open wound involving the end of the tail to the upper margin of the anal opening. The facility representative
stated that this was likely bites from the other hamster and separated them when identified by APHIS Officials.

in Room 18, ninth rack from back of the room, fourth row from the top, 13th cage from the end. This animal was
observed with thinning hair on the back half of its body, and a wound below the tail to the upper margin on the anal
area. There was scabbing on the wound margins which is evidence of healing. The facility representative stated
that this was likely bites from the other hamster and separated them when identified by APHIS Officials.
