CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
One male Persian cat (DOB 9/12/14) was accepted for transport at 4:25 am on January 13, 2015 (Air Waybill # 016
DSM 4919 3911). The scheduled departure time was approximately 1:45 pm on the same day. The time the animal
was accepted for transport was greater than 4 hours before the scheduled departure time. Accepting an animal for
transport greater than four hours before departure time does not ensure that the animal received proper care prior
to departure.
From this day forward, animals must not be accepted for transport more than 4 hours before the scheduled
departure time.
3.13(c)(3)
CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
One male Persian cat (DOB 9/12/14) was accepted for transport on January 13, 2015 (Air Waybill # 016 DSM 4919
3911). There is a feeding and watering certification attached to the enclosure. This certification is a pre-printed,
typed label which states "In the next 24 hour period the animal should be offered water and food at ____ (time) on
_____ (date)." The date is filled out but the "time" is illegible to the inspectors. The supervisor states this is a
signature. There are no specific instructions for feeding and watering this animal within the next 24 hours. This does
not ensure the proper feeding and watering of the animal during transit.
From this day forward, animals must not be accepted for transport unless feeding and watering certifications have
specific instructions for feeding and watering for a 24 hour period.
