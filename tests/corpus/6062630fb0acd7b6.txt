2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
* There was no record of inventory observed on 34 unweaned puppies born at the facility. The licensee stated that they
had not had time to complete the cage card requirement on all unweaned puppies at their facility. Complete and accurate
records are needed to ensure each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace all
puppies. The licensee shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the following
information concerning each dog or cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her
possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer
or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her
control. Correct by 11/29/22.
3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on the interior fiberglass wall of two enclosures. Two
dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in outdoor housing. The affected area covers approximately 30 to
40 percent of the interior wall area. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and other
disease hazards. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or health risks.
Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly increase the risk of disease hazards for the dogs. Cleanliness is

important to the health and well-being of the animals. All surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized
when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. The licensee must ensure that hard
surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (B) of this
sub part to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards. Correct by 11/17/22.
3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
* One outdoor enclosure housing five Siberian Husky puppies under eight weeks of age, have no sheltered housing for
the puppies to have access to. Shelter appropriate for the size and number of animals in the pens need to be provided to
protect these animals during inclement weather conditions. Not having access to size appropriate housing that will provide
protection from direct effects of wind, rain or snow can be stressful causing discomfort and could affect the ability of the
dog to conserve body heat. The licensee shall provide adequate and sufficient shelter structures that are accessible to
each animal in the enclosures and provide enough room to allow each animal to sit, stand, and lie about in a normal
manner, and to turn about freely. Correct by 11/22/22.
3.6(a)(2)

Primary enclosures.
* The ground surface area in one outdoor enclosure housing four dogs was starting to turn into mud. Mud was observed
on the feet and hair coat of the four dogs. The dogs have access to little dry ground surface area to walk or rest on. Mud
is covering an estimated 90 percent of the ground surface area in this enclosure. Dogs not able to remain dry and clean
could cause discomfort and lead to potential health issues. In addition, dogs walking on muddy surfaces where animal
waste is deposited can lead to unsanitary living conditions. The licensee must ensure that all outside enclosures be
provided with surface material that will allow all dogs to remain dry and clean. Correct by 11/22/22.
