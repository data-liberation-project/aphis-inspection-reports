2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An 8 year-old female Dachshund (# 0A01366660) was found to have reddened gums along some of her teeth and a
heavy deposit of dark brown/tan material mostly on both sides of the upper teeth as well as some on the lower teeth.
There were also areas where the gums had receded along the teeth. In addition, there was a heavy amount of brown/tan
sponge-like material, that appeared to be food, covering the lower back teeth on both sides of her mouth; this material
was able to be removed with a gloved hand from the teeth. The licensee had not contacted a veterinarian regarding the
dog’s dental condition. The abnormal build-up of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth
structures. This condition could be painful, may decrease the dog's ability to eat normally and negatively impact the
overall health of the animal. The licensee must communicate with a veterinarian regarding treatment for the dog’s dental
condition in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The licensee must ensure that the
treatment plan is followed and that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. To be corrected by:

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.


While reviewing the APHIS Forms 7005, “Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand”, a total of 10 dogs that were
in the possession of the licensee were not accounted for on the form. In addition, the date and method of disposition of 12
dogs were missing from the record. Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's
identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate tracking and tracing of animals. The licensee must maintain records
which fully and correctly disclose all the information required on an APHIS Form 7005. To be corrected by: December 15,

3.1(c)(1)(ii)

Housing facilities, general.
There were surfaces within some of the dog enclosures which had jagged edges and/or sharp points. For example, there
were several plastic whelping boxes that had varying amounts of chewed and roughened edges. At least one of the boxes
was chewed completely around the entire top rim. There was also a plastic-type panel that was broken with sharp edges
located against the back wall near the access door of the outdoor portion of a dog’s enclosure. A small exposed sharp
wire point from a previously cut section of coated wire fencing was also observed at the level of the dogs’ heads as they
walked through the opening/passageway in which it was located. The jagged edges and/or sharp points can increase the
risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that surfaces of housing facilities for dogs are constructed in a manner
and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn or soiled,
as well as be kept free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animals at all times. To be corrected by:

3.11(b)(2)

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There were multiple surfaces at the facility with a build-up of dirt, hair and/or grime. For example, within one of the
sheltered buildings at least five enclosures housing adult dogs had in/out doors with a heavy build-up of dirt and grime.


This build-up of grime covered the entire central portion of the doors. According to the licensee, it had been longer than
two weeks since the doors had been cleaned. There was also a large accumulation of hair located directly in front of at
least four enclosures with adult dogs. Some of the hair appeared to be entwined within the coated wire of enclosure walls
and the horizontal wooden support structure connected at the front of the enclosures. The build-up of dirt, hair and/or
grime can increase the risk of disease hazards in the dogs. The licensee must ensure that the primary enclosures are
sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more
often if necessary, to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards. To be
corrected by: December 10, 2021.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
