2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
During the inspection the inspector noticed that none of the adult dogs had proper identification on. The only means of ID
was the name of the dog the licensee had given them hanging on a clipboard outside of their enclosure. Dogs having
official identification on them help aid USDA in tracking them and ensure correct record keeping. The licensee needs to
ensure that all dogs are properly identified with collar and tags, tattoos, or microchips.
