PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
Construction of primary enclosures.
The Intermediate Handler does not have primary enclosures to transport dogs and cats in commerce that meet the
Animal Welfare Act (AWA) standards.
--Two automobiles (Honda Odyssey van and Honda Pilot) are used for transporting dogs and cats from airline cargo
facilities to the boarding and day care facility at this site and from/to a Denver veterinary clinic. There are no
permanently affixed enclosures in these vehicles and no transport crates or cartons being used to securely contain
the animals during transport. The Honda Odyssey has been used to transport at least 2 large breed dogs loose in
the back of the van from the veterinary clinic to this facility which does not adequately protect them or allow the
dogs to securely withstand the normal rigors of vehicle transportation.
Primary enclosures that meet the AWA standards are required during ground transportation of dogs and cats since
they could become injured if the vehicle stops abruptly, the animals experience distress from being in an unfamiliar
moving vehicle, and if there is an accident during transport.
The dog or cat must be contained in a primary enclosure such as a compartment, transport cage, carton, or crate.
Primary enclosures used to transport dogs and cats must be constructed so that they are strong enough to contain
the dogs and cats securely and comfortably and to withstand the normal rigors of transportation.
To be corrected prior to the next transportation of dogs and/or cats.
3.14(a)(9)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
A Honda Odyssey van being used to transport dogs between a Denver veterinary clinic and the boarding/daycare
facility has a fully carpeted floor. At least 2 large breed dogs have been transported loose in the van's compartment
and this carpeted flooring is not a solid, leak-proof bottom that can prevent seepage of waste into the carpet.
The bottom surface of the transport enclosure must be able to contain excreta and/or other body fluids to minimizecontamination of the surface since it cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. This poses a risk to the health of the
animals due to potential contact with infectious materials.
Primary enclosures used to transport dogs and cats must be constructed so that they have a solid, leak-proof
bottom or a removable, leak-proof collection tray under a slatted or mesh floor that prevents seepage of waste
products, such as excreta and body fluids, outside of the enclosure.
To be corrected prior to the next transport of dogs and cats.
