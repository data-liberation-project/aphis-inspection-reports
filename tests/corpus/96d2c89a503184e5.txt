2.75(a)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There were no records consisting of APHIS forms 7005 and 7006s available for review at the inspection site 001 at the
time of the inspection. The facility representative was granted an additional 48 hours to send copies of these records to
the VMO but the VMO did not receive any.

Complete and accurate records must be kept in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty
and to facilitate the tracking and tracing of animals.

Each dealer, and each exhibitor shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the
following information concerning each dog or cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her
possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer
or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her
control. See page 81 of the Animal Welfare Act and AW Regulations for additional specific recordkeeping requirements.

Correct from this day forward.


3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
In a side room containing cats in cages was an open bin of cat food. The help had not yet started the daily cleaning of
enclosures. It appeared that the bin was left open at least overnight.

Leaving cat food open to the air and flying insects can lead to the contamination of the food with microorganisms that can
cause sickness and spread disease(s) when it is then fed to other cats.

Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination, and
vermin infestation. The supplies must be stored off the floor and away from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and
around the supplies. Foods requiring refrigeration must be stored accordingly, and all food must be stored in a manner
that prevents contamination and deterioration of its nutritive value. All open supplies of food and bedding must be kept in
leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage. Only food and bedding that is currently
being used may be kept in the animal areas. Substances that are toxic to the dogs or cats but are required for normal
husbandry practices must not be stored in food storage and preparation areas, but may be stored in cabinets in the
animal areas.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
