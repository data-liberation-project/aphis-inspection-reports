3.75(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The floor on the primate enclosures had algae and dirt due to high humidity and rain which brings dirt into the
enclosure when rain water runs over the edge of the floor. It has been raining in the area and more frequent
cleaning may be required.
Surfaces containing algae/dirt may be slippery causing the primates to fall and get injured.
Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in
accordance with Sec. 3.84 of this subpart.
