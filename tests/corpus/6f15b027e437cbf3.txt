2.33(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
- A male beagle named "Julio" (Microchip# 2576) was extremely thin. Ribs, spine, and pelvis were clearly visible
and the dog had considerable muscle wasting throughout his body. The dog is currently under no treatment. He
was part of a facility assessment conducted by the attending veterinarian approximately one month ago, but Julio
was not noted as having any problems. Excessively thin animals may have underlying health problems which are
preventing normal weight gain or normal body maintenance. This animal must be evaluated and appropriately
treated by a licensed veterinarian.
- A female beagle named "Lilly" (Microchip #0A02413257) had a large, red swelling located in the inner corner of
the right eye, on the inner surface of the lower eyelid. This swelling needs to be evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian to determine the cause and risk. In addition, the size and location of this swelling could cause it to rub
against and irritate the eye. This animal must be evaluated and appropriately treated by a licensed veterinarian.
- A female beagle named "Ida Mae" (Microchip #0A02412566) was extremely wobbly and ataxic. She also seemed
disoriented, responding slowly to verbal cues from facility representative. She had great difficulty walking and
seemed to have little control over her hind legs. This animal was one of a group treated earlier in the week with oral
ivermectin at the advice of the attending veterinarian. An animal in this condition is at extreme risk of injury and will
have great difficulty eating and drinking normally. This animal must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian as soon
as possible, and appropriate treatment instituted.
All affected animals must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian within 3 days of this inspection date. All animals
must have appropriate diagnostics and treatment initiated. Facility must maintain records of all procedures,
diagnostics, and treatment for these three animals.
To be corrected: As soon as possible

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- In the outdoor housing area, two sections of enclosure fencing are damaged and bent in enclosure #16 on Row 1. Damaged fence lines pose a risk of injury to the enclosed animals, and may also fail to properly contain animals.
Facility must repair these sections of fencing, and must properly maintain physical structures throughout the facility.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
- In the indoor building, two beagles are housed in individual runs containing resting platforms composed of slatted
wire. The openings of these resting platforms are large enough to allow the enclosed dog's feet to pass through.
This is a potential risk of injury or entrapment to the animals. Facility must cover these platforms with some type of
solid material that will prevent feet slipping through the openings.
