2.31(c)(3)

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The reports summarizing the semiannual facility and program review were not being submitted to the Institutional Official
every six months. In addition, the reports noted deficiencies but did not contain a reasonable and specific plan and
schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency. These aspects of the report ensure that the committee informs the
Institutional Official of any program deficiencies, identifies facility needs, and, if present, animal welfare issues, as well as
establishing a plan for correction of deficiencies. Animal welfare may be negatively impacted if a plan for correction of
deficiencies is not developed and followed. All semiannual reports must be reviewed and signed by a majority of the
IACUC members, include any minority views, and be submitted to the Institutional Official at least every six months.
These reports must identify and describe departures from the regulations or standards, distinguish significant from minor
deficiencies, and provide a reasonable and specific plan and schedule with dates for correcting each deficiency.

TO BE CORRECTED ON THE NEXT SEMIANNUAL REPORT.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
