FACILITIES, INDOOR.
The temperature inside the guinea pig housing building as measured with a kestrel was 56.8 degrees F. Although
there was a wall heater, there were several windows open.
Guinea pigs kept in ambient temperatures that are too low may be subject to cold stress that may predispose them
to developing other health issues.
The ambient temperature in indoor housing facilities for guinea pigs must not fall below 60 degrees F.

FEEDING.
Approximately 50% of the self-feeders had fecal pellets contained within the feeders and mixed in the feed. The
fecal material appeared dry and not fresh and there were a few feeders with only fecal material present in the
feeder.
Feeders and food receptacles need to be clean and free of fecal material. Failure to do so can lead to disease or
can lead to the avoidance of feeding, both of which can have negative impacts on animal health. Correct by
keeping the feeders clean and sanitizing at a minimum of once every two weeks.
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Approximately 75% of the guinea pig enclosures contained a large amount of soiled wet bedding with an
accumulation of excess fecal material, debris, and discarded feed mixed in with the bedding and the pens were in
need of more frequent cleaning. The facility reported the majority of pens had last been cleaned 6 days ago.
The accumulation of feces and unclean enclosures can cause unpleasant odors, lead to contamination of the
enclosure, and attract pests and vermin that carry diseases that result in risks to the health of the animals.
Primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized as often as necessary to prevent the accumulation of excreta or
debris.
