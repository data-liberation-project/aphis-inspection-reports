2.50(a)(2)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are two un-weaned and one weaned set of puppies that do not have cage cards. The licensee stated that
the weaned puppies had a cage card, but she doesn't know what happened to it.
A class "A" dealer shall identify all live puppies on the premises.
Ensure that all puppies on the premises have appropriate identification.
To be corrected from now on.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
- The APHIS form 7005 has N/A in both the sold and died columns. The APHIS form 7005 is not up to date with
animals sold.
- Several puppy id's on the APHIS form 7006 do not match the puppy card the number came from. One specifically
was on an APHIS 7006 form and when I checked the puppy card it said it had died.
Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose each dog acquired,
owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized,
sold, or otherwise disposed of by that dealer. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his
or her possession or under his or her control.
All records must be made, kept and maintained accurately. All dogs and puppies must be able to be tracked and
traced back for the health of the animal in case of disease outbreak.
To be corrected from now on.
3.1(c)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
All wood surfaces in the outdoor, indoor and sheltered housing have been scratched and chewed so that they are
no longer impervious to moisture and therefore cannot be sanitized.
The surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the
facility--must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized,
or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.
All surfaces that come in contact with the dogs and puppies must be maintained so that they can be cleaned and
sanitized. Wood that has been chewed or scratched and no longer has paint or sealer on it cannot be cleaned and
sanitized. All wood in the facility must be painted, sealed or replaced with a product that can be cleaned and
sanitized.
To be corrected by April 5, 2017.
3.1(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The sheltered kennel with three whelping kennels has an open bag of wood shavings, used for bedding, in the
hallway.
All open supplies of food and bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent
contamination and spoilage.
Keep all open supplies of bedding in a container with a lid to prevent contamination by water, urine, or pests.
To be corrected by March 9, 2017.
3.4(b)(4) DIRECT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
All of the shelters for the outdoor housing enclosures have no bedding in them. There are approximately 12 adult
dogs and two 9 week old puppies in separate enclosures. The licensee stated they added bedding, wood shavings,
one month ago. Temperatures today were in the 40's and 50's. Overnight temperatures have been in the teens
and highs are predicted to be in the twenties this weekend and next week.
Shelters in outdoor facilities for dogs must contain a roof, four sides, and a floor, and must contain clean, dry,bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees F. Additional clean, dry bedding is required when
the temperature is 35 degrees F or lower.
Bedding must be provided for dogs and puppies in outdoor kennels when the temperature falls below 50 degrees F,
and additional bedding must be added if the temperature falls below 35 degrees F. This must be done for the
comfort and health of the dogs and puppies.
To be corrected by end of business today and from now on.
3.6(a)(2)(i)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There are numerous areas where 2" by 4" fence is put over agriculture fence panels. The 2" by 4" fence is pulled
away, mangled with sharp points and curled up at the bottom.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points that could injure a dog.
Remove or repair all fencing that is not affixed to the fencing panels and that may cause injury or entanglement.
To be corrected by March 11, 2017.
3.6(a)(2)(iii)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The licensee informed me that the night before the juvenile standard poodle, golden retriever and 2 goldendoodles
that are housed together escaped their enclosure. She is unsure how they escaped, but thinks they got the inside
gate open.
Primary enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so that they contain the dogs securely.
Use a lock on the gate if necessary to ensure that the dogs do not escape their enclosure for their safety.
To be corrected from now on.
3.10 DIRECTWATERING.
The majority of dogs and puppies had no water and when offered water drank readily and for an extended period of
time. Multiply housed dogs all tried to get their heads in the bucket at the same time. While conducting the
inspection one of the kennel workers showed up and the licensee instructed her to go ahead of me to water all
animals, including the puppies in the weaning kennel. When I walked in the worker was finishing the watering. All
of the puppies had wet muzzles, and some were still drinking.
If potable water is not continually available to the dogs and cats, it must be offered to the dogs and cats as often as
necessary to ensure their health and well-being.
It is abnormal for a dog or puppy to drink that vigorously or for an extended period of time unless they are not being
offered enough water. All dogs and puppies must have an appropriate amount of water for their health and well
being.
To be corrected from now on.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- The inside of the sheltered kennels are made of metal sheets and have a large accumulation of dirt on them.
- The 5 indoor housing kennels for the weaned puppies have a painted board in the back that has a large
accumulation of dirt on them.
Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs and cats must be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks using one of the methods prescribed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and more often if necessary to
prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
Clean and sanitize the all surfaces of the primary enclosures a minimum of once every two weeks, and more often if
necessary to prevent accumulation of dirt on surfaces and prevent disease hazards.
To be corrected by March 11, 2017.
3.12
EMPLOYEES.
The licensee and employees are not maintaining these dogs and puppies at even our minimum standards in the
areas of basic animal needs. This includes water, shelter, maintaining the facility and cleaning. Each person subject to the Animal Welfare regulations (9 CFR parts 1, 2, and 3) maintaining dogs and cats must
have enough employees to carry out the level of husbandry practices and care required in this subpart. The
employees who provide for husbandry and care, or handle animals, must be supervised by an individual who has
the knowledge, background, and experience in proper husbandry and care of dogs and cats to supervise others.
The employer must be certain that the supervisor and other employees can perform to these
standards.
If the licensee and employees cannot meet the basic needs of the dogs and puppies on hand additional employees
must be hired, or the number of dogs must be reduced so that these needs can be met.
