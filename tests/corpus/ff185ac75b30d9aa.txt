Veterinary care for dogs.
The program of veterinary care does not address heartworm testing or preventive care and treatment to ensure healthy
hair, nails, eyes, ears, and teeth. The program of veterinary care is a required document that APHIS inspectors use to
determine the quality of veterinary care for the animals at a facility. This document must address all the information
required in section 3.13(a) and be followed by the licensee to ensure adequate care and treatment of the animals. All
required information listed in section 3.13(a) must be included in the program of veterinary care.
