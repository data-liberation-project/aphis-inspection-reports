SANITATION.
Section 3.56(c) Housekeeping: The two rooms housing the rabbits have food and debris on the floor. An air
conditioner is stored on the floor and miscellaneous items are on the widow sills and flat surfaces. Rabbit hair is
accumulating on the ceiling and other surfaces. Pest may be attracted to the spilled food and the clutter may
provide living areas for the pests. The clutter also makes cleaning more difficult. Pests may carry diseases and
dust/debris may adversely affect the rabbits. The clutter must be removed and the rooms kept cleaned to facilitate
the prescribed husbandry practices and to maintain the health of the rabbits.
