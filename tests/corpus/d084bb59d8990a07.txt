2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) was not available for review during this inspection. Licensees' with
part time attending veterinarians must have a formal written arrangement with a veterinarian (PVC). This is required
so that USDA personnel can confirm that the licensee is working with a veterinarian and is following the
recommendations from that veterinarian.
A program of veterinary care needs to be developed for this facility by the attending veterinarian that includes
recommendations for all regulated species at the facility. Examples of some of the topics to be covered in the PVC
are:
*The veterinarian's schedule for visits to the facility.
*Parasite control program if appropriate for the species.
*Vaccination recommendations if appropriate for the species.
*Routine medical testing if appropriate for the species.
*Instructions on necropsies for unexpected deaths.
*Any other recommendations the veterinarian feels necessary for this facility.
*Emergency contact information.
*Veterinarian's signature and date.
This document must indicate to USDA that you and your veterinarian have an active working relationship.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several camels need to be evaluated by a veterinarian.
One young female camel was unable to stand and according to the licensee has been that way for a while. Although the camel was in good body condition and continues to eat and drink there are no records indicating the
animal has been evaluated by a veterinarian. There can be multiple reasons why an animal is unable to stand and
multiple health problems caused by being unable to stand. For example during the inspection it was noted that both
of the animal’s hocks were swollen.
Three other camels, one male and two females, appeared thin. Thin animals can indicate some type of health or
husbandry problem.
The licensee is responsible for providing the animals with adequate veterinary care. These animals need to be
evaluated by the attending veterinarian and a written plan on treatment/husbandry changes needs to be provided.
This plan needs to be available to USDA inspectors at the next inspection.
