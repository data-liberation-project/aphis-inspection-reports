ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Multiple animal were in need of veterinary attention:
* A Maltese in enclosure T3 was holding its ear strangely. When the ear was looked at it appeared to have some
type of infection/inflammation.
* The right eye of a Yorkie in enclosure T2 appeared irritated. The animal consistently squinted with that eye.
* A Lhasa in enclosure 27 had an extremely cloudy right cornea and severe discharge around the right eye.
* A couple of young Italian Greyhounds appeared extremely thin.
* At least 10 animals had extensive matting of their hair. The licensee explained the groomer would not clip the
animals if they were wet. The licensee had an empty kennel building the animals could have been housed in to get
them out of the mud and allow them to dry. This had not been done as of our visit.
This facility has failed to adequately observe the health and well-being of its animals. Someone needs to check
these animals daily and communicate any health concerns to the attending veterinarian immediately. The
veterinarian needs to visit this facility and assess all dogs for health concerns.

3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The dogs in the Italian Greyhound house have eaten away large portions of the walls. The owner has attempted to
repair these areas with multiple different types of material: welded wire, plastic grate, rusty metal sheeting. None of
these fixes have adequately repaired the house. Housing facilities must be constructed so that they are structurally
sound. They must be maintained in good repair to contain the animals and to protect them from injury. These dogs
could get a foot or leg trapped in the holes or chew their way out of the enclosures. The Italian Greyhound house
needs to be adequately repaired or replaced. To be corrected by: July 1, 2015
3.1(f)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several of the dog enclosures were muddy swamps. Two enclosures were so muddy the only dry area was in the
small dog house. There was no outside area for the animals to stand, lie down, or urinate and defecate without
getting in the mud. Therefore the area these animals are living in is a mix of mud, feces, and urine. Housing
facilities must be equipped with drainage and disposal systems that rapidly eliminate waste and water and allow the
animals to stay dry. Standing puddles of water in animal enclosures must be drained or mopped up so the animals
stay dry. Several animals had this mud/feces/urine mixture caked over half of their bodies. Housing the dogs in the
current manner makes them susceptible to chilling and to all types of illnesses: pneumonia, skin infections,
gastrointestinal problems, etc. This situation also attracts mosquitos, flies, and other insects that could cause health
problems for the dogs. These animals must be moved to a dry, clean area or some type of system for rapidly drying
their current enclosure needs to be instituted immediately.
To be corrected immediately.
