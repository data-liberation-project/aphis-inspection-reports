ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:45am on
05-NOV-19.
I arrived at the facility and was informed by a family member that the licensee was not available for an inspection
that day. I left the facility. I later spoke with the licensee and they confirmed that they were not available for an
inspection that day.
