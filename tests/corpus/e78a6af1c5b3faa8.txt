3.6(c)(1)(iii) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two Thai ridgeback dogs are housed in individual enclosures previously used for the red foxes. This is intended to
be temporary housing for the next couple of weeks. The dogs are too big for these enclosures. They have
insufficient space to stand in a comfortable normal position, nor are they able to walk in a normal manner. Their
heads are in contact with the tops of the enclosures causing the dogs to crouch. When crouched, their backs are
also very close to the tops of the enclosures. Unless lying down, their movement is restricted to a crouched circle.
The facility states that they are removed from the enclosures three times daily for exercise and walks (at minimum
for 15 minutes each time, sometimes longer). Being housed in small, tight enclosures is stressful for the dogs,
which negatively impacts their health and well being. The interior height of a primary enclosure for dogs must be at
least 6 inches higher than the head of the tallest dog in the enclosure when it is in a normal standing position.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Two red foxes have been moved to smaller enclosures for an expected time period of approximately 2 weeks.
The enclosures are too small to allow the foxes the ability to stand erect without crouching, as their ears contact the
enclosure tops. According to facility representatives, these foxes reportedly are placed in the outdoor exercise
enclosure daily. Inadequate space may contribute to malnutrition, poor condition, debility, stress, or abnormal
behavior patterns. Enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow each
animal to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.

3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Many stored items, such as donated food and supplies, personal items, and other equipment crowd the indoor
facility. Items have been moved and re-organized since the last inspection (April 29, 2019) reflecting animprovement, though animal areas remain too cluttered. The clutter makes it difficult to sweep and adequately
clean the animal rooms. Spilled feed, dust, dander, and animal hair attract rodent pests and/or harbor disease
hazards. Accumulations shall be cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
