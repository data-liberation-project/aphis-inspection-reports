ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The licensee still has not found the written program of veterinary care for 2016 from his attending veterinarian. A
complete species appropriate and up to date program of veterinary care is essential for maintaining the health of the
animals.The facility must have an appropriate written program of veterinary care for all species housed at the facility
to ensure that all animals receive the appropriate care. Correct by having the attending veterinarian complete a new
written program of veterinary care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The pot bellied pig has overgrown hooves that are curling up on the ends of its front feet. Overgrown hooves
may cause problems such as lameness and foot rot. The hooves must be trimmed and a schedule instituted to
keep the hooves from becoming overgrown.
***The larger brown nosed coatimundi cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for lethargic behavior, slightly
labored breathing, and poorly responsive to stimuli has still not been evaluated by a veterinarian. While the animal
appeared alert and responsive during this inspection, episodes as described above may be indicative of disease.
This brown nosed coatimundi must be assessed by a veterinarian experienced with the species and the
recommendations followed as soon as possible.
***The larger arctic fox cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for being thinner than its cage mate, fecal
staining on the fur of its hind quarters, and not having grown in its new winter coat has still not been evaluated by a
veterinarian. While the animal appeared to have a normal body condition and its new winter coat with no fecal
staining during this inspection, slower winter coat development and problems maintaining a normal weight as
described above may be indicative of disease. This arctic fox must be assessed by a veterinarian experienced with
the species and the recommendations followed as soon as possible.
***The bobcat cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for abnormal pacing in its enclosure and for spending
the majority of its time in the rafters has still not been evaluated by a veterinarian. The bobcat remained in therafters watching us during this inspection. Abnormal behavior patterns may be indicative of physical or
psychological issues that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modifications, and must be evaluated
by the attending veterinarian as soon as possible to receive appropriate treatment and management.
***The smaller of the brown nosed coatimundi cited on the October 12, 2016 inspection report for abnormal pacing
behavior in its enclosure has still not been evaluated by a veterinarian. While this coatimundi was not observed
pacing during this inspection, episodes of abnormal behavior patterns may be indicative of physical or psychological
issues that may require medical treatment or habitat/husbandry modifications, and must be evaluated by the
attending veterinarian as soon as possible to receive appropriate treatment and management.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
General
The floor of the rabbit enclosure has 1 inch by 1 inch openings. The feet of the chocolate satin rabbits housed in this
cage can pass through the opening easily. Particle boards have been placed in the enclsoure, however it does not
cover the entire cage floor and may cause addition problems (See Section 3.50(a)). Primary enclosures must be
constructed in a manner that protects the feet and legs from injury. The floor of the rabbit enclosure must be
modified to safely prevent the feet of the rabbit from passing through.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***The licensee could not produce a written plan for environmental enhancement. Such plans are necessary to
ensure that non-human primates receive enrichment that is effective and address their species specific and
individual needs. A written environmental enrichment plan helps ensure that the psychological needs of the lemurs
are met. The facility must develop a comprehensive written enrichment plan with the attending veterinarian for the
two lemurs.

Structural Strength
***The prairie dog enclosure has a mesh floor with approximately 1 inch by 1 inch diamond shaped openings. While
there is straw bedding on part of the flooring. Some areas are bare and the animals’ feet could become entrapped in
the openings. Modifications must be employed to prevent entrapment hazards and foot injuries to the prairie dogs.
***The gate for the goat enclosure is loosely attached with twine and metal clips. The gate must be secured and
repaired for the safety of the animals.
***The squirrel cage has sharp points and gaps between the mesh sides and top. The licensee stated that on
occasion he has found wild squirrels sharing the enclosure with the regulated animals. These issues may result in
escape, injury or disease transmission. The squirrel cage must be repaired to prevent escape or access by wild
animals.
***The Fallow deer enclosure has large gaps at the bottom of the fencing that may predispose to entanglement,
injury or escape. An interior fence has chain link detached and pulled away from the upper portion of a wood fence
post. The enclosure must be repaired for the safety of the animals. There is also a large gap between the gate and
a fence support pole that does not allow the latch to close properly around the pole. To prevent the escape of
animals, the entry of unauthorized persons, and to reduce the risk of injury to the deer; the fencing must to berepaired and the gate properly aligned in manner that will allow the latch to be secured properly to the pole.
***The zebu and highland cow enclosure has large gaps at the bottom of the fencing that may predispose to
entanglement, injury or escape. The enclosure must be repaired for the safety of the animals.
***A Jacob’s sheep enclosure containing seven sheep has loose fencing held together by twine. This may
predispose to entanglement, injury or escape. The enclosure must be repaired for the safety of the animals.
***The bobcat enclosure has two areas of wood that attach to the rafters. The wood has sharp jagged edges. The
bobcat at the time of this inspection was resting on a ledge near one of the jagged pieces of wood. There was also
a piece of wood hanging downward from the rafters that may fall into the enclosure and injure the bobcat. The
pieces of wood must be removed to prevent injury to the animal.
***The brown nosed coatimundi enclosure floor was constructed of multiple pieces of wood placed in a manner that
left an uneven surface and created spaces for food and debris to collect. A 4 inch nail was present within the
enclosure.The coatimundi could get their feet caught in the spaces between the boards. The presence of the nail
could cause an injury to the animals in the enclosure. The floor must be constructed in a manner that levels the
surface of the floor and the nail removed to prevent injury to the animal and facilitate husbandry practices..

Storage
***One open forty pound bag of dry dog food was stored on the ground in the storage area next to the coatimundi
enclosure.
***Two fox carcasses were not bagged and were being stored in the meat freezer with packaged meet to be fed to
the animals.
Improper storage can result in unwholesome food being fed to the animals which can lead to dietary deficiencies
and food borne illnesses. Bagged food for the animals must be appropriately stored to protect against deterioration,
molding, and contamination by vermin to ensure that the food is wholesome. All meat/food carcasses stored in the
freezer must be bagged or in containers to protect from contamination and freezer burn. The non-food carcasses
must be removed from the food freezer and stored separately to prevent contamination of the food.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste DisposalThe squirrel cage has an excessive amount of sunflower seed and peanut hulls, and other food wastes in the feed
trough and at the bottom of the cage. The waste also extends outside of the squirrel cage.
Excess waste can become an attractant to pests and must be cleaned on a frequent basis. Animal and food wastes
must be removed from cages and disposed of away from animal enclosures. Wastes should be removed and
disposed of in a designated area immediately and in accordance with county and state laws.

Shelter from Inclement Weather
***The arctic fox enclosure now has two shelters, but one is too small for either of the fox to stand, sit or lay in a
normal manner and the larger shelter is too small to house both fox in a comfortable manner (allow both to stand, sit
and lay down in a normal manner at the same time). Lack of adequate access to shelter can cause adverse effects
from exposure to detrimental weather conditions. An appropriately sized shelter must be provided to ensure both
animals have adequate protection from the elements.
***The fallow deer enclosure has only two-sided shelters (the third side is only partially completed) that cannot
adequately protect the animals from wind or precipitation. Failure to protect animals from detrimental weather
conditions can negatively impact their health and ability to fight disease. Animals must be provided with a shelter
that provide adequate protection from the elements.
***The raccoon has a large barrel as shelter with a small amount of bedding. The barrel is not insulated and has a
wide opening that does not provide adequate protection from the wind. Failure to protect animals from detrimental
weather conditions can negatively impact their health and ability to fight disease. The raccoon must be provide an
appropriate shelter from the cold, adequate bedding and a shelter entrance that would better protect the raccoon
from inclement weather.
***The enclosure housing five Patagonian cavies has only one shelter from cold weather with a large entrance.
Only about two of the animals would be able to fit comfortably in the shelter away from the entrance. Lack of
adequate access to shelter can cause adverse effects from exposure to detrimental weather conditions. An
appropriately sized shelter(s) must be provided to ensure all five animals have adequate protection from the cold
weather.
**The alpaca enclosure has a covered shelter with no solid walls. Shelters should be constructed in a manner that
provides protection from at least three sides for the weather condition in this locale. Failure to protect animals from
detrimental weather conditions can negatively impact their health and ability to fight disease. The shelter needs to
be modified to provide solid sides to protect the animals from inclement weather, such as wind and precipitation.***The pot bellied pig is housed in a covered enclosure with no shelter from the cold. At the time of inspection, the
pig was laying on top of a thin layer of straw. Failure to protect animals from detrimental weather conditions can
negatively impact their health and ability to fight disease. The pig must be provided an appropriate shelter from the
cold and adequate bedding to protect the pig from inclement weather.

SANITATION.
Cleaning of Enclosures
***The Patagonian cavy enclosure contained numerous fecal pellets.
Exposure to excessive amounts of feces and urine, soiled bedding and dirty water my pose a disease hazard to the
animals. Enclosures must be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals with excreta,
minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Housekeeping
***The empty portion of the brown nose coatimundi enclosure is in disrepair and has not been cleaned of old
bedding and empty bags. Empty dirty enclosures can become living areas for pests and need to be cleaned in a
timely manner to promote the health and well being of the animals.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Pest Control
Old rats holes had been filled in, however numerous new rat holes were observed around the lemur, prairie dog,
cavy, cape porcupine, and pheasant enclosures. Additionally, rat feces were seen in the the building for for storage
and housing housing of the guinea pig. Rats are known to carry various disease hazards and a safe and effective
pest control program is required for animal health. Additional measures to prevent harborage and recolonization
must be implemented to ensure there is an effective means of controlling the rodent population.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
***The facility houses approximately 50 animals and numerous non-regulated species. Based upon the numberanimals and non-complaint items related to cleaning, sanitation, waste disposal, maintenance, and veterinary care
there is an insufficient number of employees to adequately perform all of the husbandry responsibilities of the facility
on a daily basis. There must be a sufficient number of trained employees to carry out the day to day husbandry
duties and maintenance or the property and enclosures. Additional personnel is needed to ensure that cleaning,
animal observations, maintenance tasks, and pest control duties are performed at professionally acceptable level
for the current number of animals housed at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owners.
The incident involving the gunshot of a doe are under review.
