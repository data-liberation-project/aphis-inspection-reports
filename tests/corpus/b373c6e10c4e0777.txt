HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
1. In the outdoor macaque enclosure, the primate building has a section of jagged, sharp sheet metal within reach
of the animals. This area is located below the wire tunnel connecting the indoor and outdoor portions of the
enclosure. The sharp metal could potentially injure the animals.
Repair or replace this area of the building.

2. In the enclosure containing the single baboon, several 4x4 posts along the two solid walls are damaged or
broken near the ground. Additionally, a board is broken on the bottom of one wall creating a gap beneath it. This
wall is shared with the adjoining macaque enclosure. A large stone is in place to block part of the gap but the
potential for animals from either side to reach through exists and could lead to injury.
Ensure these areas are structurally sound to prevent contact between the animals.
