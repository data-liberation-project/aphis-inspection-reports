HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Inside the first and third building, there is an accumulation of materials stored on top of the dog enclosures. These
enclosures contain at least thirty adult dogs and fifteen puppies. The material consists of mouse poison, unused
bowls and feeders, tools, chemical sprays and sealants, light bulbs, metal cans, paint buckets and plastic tubs,
paper bags, a metal fan, a vacuum and other items. The facility representative said that he did have them in a
cabinet but the cabinet broke. These items could be dangerous to the dogs if they should leak or spill, they could
cause damage if they become too heavy to be supported by the wire tops of the enclosures and they collect dust,
dirt and cobwebs.
Animal areas inside housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter including, equipment, furniture, and
stored material. Substances that are toxic to the dogs but are required for normal husbandry practices can be
stored in cabinets in animal areas. The licensee must remove all the items from the top of all the enclosures and
store them in an appropriate area. The licensee must ensure that all animal areas are kept neat, clean and free of
clutter.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the second building there is one enclosure, containing four dogs, that has wooden support posts around the
enclosure door. The dogs have excessively chewed the bottom half of these posts exposing the sharp end of a
screw. In the third building there is one enclosure, containing one dog, which has vinyl plastic covering the walls. A
dog has excessively chewed the vinyl plastic above the access door and a large screw is hanging from the torn
ends of the vinyl at the level of the dog. The sharp ends of the screws could cause injury to the dogs.
All used primary enclosures must be free of sharp points and jagged edges that could injure the dogs. The licensee
must repair, remove, or alter the sharp ends of the screws in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are free of sharp points and remain safe for the dogs at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the third building there is one enclosure, containing one dog, which has a clear, plastic tub that is used as a
whelping box. The edges of this plastic tub have been excessively chewed by the dogs that have used it. The
chewed portions of the whelping box have a slight brown color to them. In another enclosure, containing one dog,
the wall is covered in vinyl plastic and the dog has torn and chewed on this plastic. The damage caused by the
dogs does not allow for adequate cleaning and sanitization of the whelping box or the vinyl plastic on the wall.
All surfaces of housing facilities must be maintained on a regular basis. All surfaces within the housing facilities that
cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must repair, replace
or alter this whelping box and plastic wall in a manner that allows for cleaning and sanitization to occur. The
licensee must ensure that all surfaces remain in good repair at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the first building there are at least five enclosures, containing at least five dogs, which have a buildup of feces in
them. Throughout one enclosure there are multiple piles of feces. Around the edges of at least four other
enclosures there is a large amount of light colored, dried feces. The facility representative said the enclosures are
not spot-cleaned daily. The buildup of feces could increase disease hazards towards the dogs.
All hard surfaces of primary enclosures that are in contact with dogs must be spot-cleaned daily. The licensee must
remove all the feces from these enclosures and ensure that each used primary enclosure is spot-cleaned daily to
eliminate the buildup of feces and reduce disease hazards.

posts are not impervious to moisture.
All surfaces inside sheltered housing facilities that are in contact with the dogs must be impervious to moisture. The
licensee must alter the damaged wooden posts and plywood in a manner that makes them impervious to moisture.

FEEDING.
In the first and the third building there are at least ten plastic self-feeders that have cobwebs, caked feed and dirt
buildup on the inside of them. Inside of one self-feeder there is old food that has white mold growing on it. There
are at least ten adult dogs and six puppies that have access to these self-feeders. Cobwebs, dirt, caked feed and
mold can contaminate the dog food which could have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.
Self-feeders must be kept clean and sanitized at least once every two weeks or as often as necessary, to reduce
the buildup of cobwebs and dirt. Measures must be taken to ensure that there is no molding, deterioration or caking
of the feed. The licensee must clean and sanitize these self-feeders and ensure that all feeders remain clean and
free of potential food contaminates at all times.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the first building there are at least seven enclosures, containing at least eight dogs, which have a thick, brown
buildup of dirt and grime where the dogs have been touching the access doors. This buildup of dirt and grime could
increase the disease risk towards the dogs.
Used primary enclosures must be sanitized once every two weeks or more often if necessary, to reduce the buildup
of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and any other disease hazard. The licensee must clean and sanitize these
access doors and ensure that all primary enclosures are sanitized every two weeks or as often as necessary to
eliminate the buildup of any disease hazards.Correction date: December 23, 2015
