2.31(d)(1)(iv)(A)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The medical records for three Cynomolgus monkeys on one study documented that they experienced tremors
during the study, but no treatment was given for the tremors. The Attending Veterinarian stated that she had
discussed the clinical signs with the principal investigator; however, there was no written justification in the study
protocol or from the principal investigator stating that treatment should be withheld for scientific reasons. Treatment
is required for procedures that cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals unless the
principal investigator documents in writing that withholding treatment is justified for scientific reasons. The IACUC
must ensure that activities involving animals are documented in writing for review and approval purposes.
TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS POINT FORWARD.
This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on February 22 and 23, 2017. The exit interview was
conducted on February 23 with facility representatives.
