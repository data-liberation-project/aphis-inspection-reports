Feeding.
There is excessive dirt buildup in the goat trough, as well as the sides of the trough. When discussing the cleaning
protocol with the facility representative and licensee, neither individual could recall when this trough was last cleaned.
Failure to appropriately clean food receptacles promotes unsanitary surfaces that can harm the animals’ health upon
ingestion. Food receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary at all times. If self-feeders are used, adequate measures
shall be taken to prevent molding, contamination, and deterioration or caking of food.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by January 1, 2022 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
