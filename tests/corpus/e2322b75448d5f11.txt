SANITATION.
The food preparation shed has a plywood floor. This plywood has now deteriorated to the point where it is
extremely dirty & soiled. This plywood has a black color covering a majority of the wood floor surface which can no
longer be cleaned &/or sanitized, and does not facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. This present condition
of the floor also puts the food at an increased risk of contamination.
Additionally, the plywood is unstable in some areas due to the long term absorption of water and possibly other
liquids. This wetness may also serve as an attraction for vermin &/or insects.
This floor shall be made so that it is readily cleanable & sanitizable to protect the food being stored and prepared in
this area, and to reduce the risk of attraction of vermin/or insects.
