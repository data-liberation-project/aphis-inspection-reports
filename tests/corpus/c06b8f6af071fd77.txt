2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The vaccines for the dogs are not stored at an appropriate temperature. The vaccines are kept in a refrigerator, but the
temperature inside the refrigerator is only 53 degrees F according to the inspector's Kestrel. The label on the vaccines
states they should be stored between 35-46 degrees F. Failure to store vaccines at the proper temperature may interfere
with their effectiveness which could leave animals at risk of contracting dangerous and deadly diseases.

Each dealer shall use appropriate methods to prevent and control diseases. The licensee must store the vaccines at the
appropriate temperatures at all times. The licensee must ensure that all medical products are properly stored in order to
support the health and well-being of the animals.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At least seven adult dogs are missing from the Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand (APHIS form 7005).
Failure to document dogs on APHIS form 7005 can interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to trace the movement of
animals, to identify animals, and to acquire acquisition information for specific animals.


Each dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the required information
concerning each dog purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or
her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of. The licensee must add the information for
the seven dogs to APHIS form 7005. The licensee must also ensure that all required documentation is accurately
maintained at all times.

Housing facilities, general.
One adult female dog and five puppies are housed on raised plastic flooring. Nearly the entire surface of the flooring is
coated in dried feces. The dogs cannot move about the enclosure without coming into contact with the feces. The
licensee stated the enclosure had last been cleaned a few days ago. Buildup of feces could cause the animals to become
soiled and increase the risk of disease.

Hard surfaces in contact with dogs must be spot-cleaned daily. The licensee must remove the coating of feces from the
enclosure floor. The licensee must ensure that all waste is removed from each enclosure daily in order to support the
health and well-being of the animals.

To be corrected by: At the time of the inspection the licensee was instructed to clean the feces from the enclosure by the
end of the day (12-Jan-2023).


A buildup of rodent feces is located on surfaces throughout the interior of the large breed sheltered building. The
inspector observed rodent feces on top of the dog enclosures, in slide out trays under empty enclosures, on the flooring of
empty enclosure, and on the top of feeders in empty enclosures. A dead mouse and rodent feces were observed next to
the access door inside an empty enclosure. Seven dogs are housed in this building. A buildup of rodent feces could
increase the risk of disease towards the dogs.

All surfaces of housing facilities not in contact with dogs must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary. The licensee
must clean and sanitize the surfaces affected by mouse droppings. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing
facilities are maintained in a clean and sanitized state in order to support the health of the animals.

Sheltered housing facilities.
Two German shepherds are kept in sheltered housing. The sheltered portion is not tall enough to allow the dogs to stand
and sit in a normal position. When the dogs are standing or sitting their heads touch the top of the enclosure and their
ears cannot be held in the normal upright position but must be flattened out to the side or folded back against the head.
The inspector observed the dogs moving about the enclosure with their heads slightly ducked down. The inability to stand
and sit in a normal position may cause pain and discomfort to the animal.

The shelter structures must be large enough to allow each animal to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner and to turn
about freely. The licensee must provide the German shepherds with an enclosure that allows them to stand and sit in a
normal position at all times. The licensee must ensure that each animal is housed in a compliant enclosure in order to

support their health and well-being.

Compatible grouping.
A pug puppy that is approximately 2.5 months old is being housed with an adult dog that is not its dam or foster dam.
Housing puppies with adults that are not their mother could result in injury to the puppy should the adult become
aggressive and/or dominant.

Puppies 4 months of age or less may not be housed in the same primary enclosure with adult dogs other than their dams
or foster dams. The licensee must not house the pug puppy with an adult that is not the dam or foster dam. The licensee
must ensure that any dogs housed together are compatible to ensure their safety and well-being.

3.13(b)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee had each adult dog examined by the attending veterinarian in April 2022, but there is no written
documentation of the exam or the results of the exam.

The licensee had several adult dogs tested for heartworm in April 2022, but there is no documentation that clearly
indicates which dogs were tested and the results of the tests.


Failure to document examinations, tests, and the results may interfere with the ability of APHIS officials to determine if the
animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. These
records must include the dates and findings/results of all screening, routine, or other required or recommended tests or
examinations. The licensee must ensure that all examinations, tests, and the results are fully documented with all
required information in a medical record.
