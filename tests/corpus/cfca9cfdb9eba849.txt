2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female blackbuck antelope was found in the drive thru section of the facility limping and not bearing weight on its
left rear leg. This animal was observed to be walking holding the left rear leg off of the ground and only placing the
leg onto the ground once it stopped walking. The farm manager was not aware of this condition in the animal when
asked. The facility has not started any treatment for this animal. Non-weight bearing is a sign of pain. This animal
requires veterinary attention. Correct this by contacting your attending veterinarian and following recommended
treatment.
*** This animal was examined and treated by the attending veterinarian on March 26th, 2018.
The program of veterinary (PVC) has been updated since the last inspection. It states the current primary method
for tranquilization will be the drug mixture known as BAM and that the previous protocol will be used in the case that
BAM is not effective. The previous protocol is the use of succinylcholine as the primary drug for (cid:28)tranquilization(cid:29)
(without any drugs for anesthesia or analgesia or equipment for respiratory support). The farm manager stated
during this inspection that they intend to continue using succinylcholine on elk, fallow deer, sika deer, and zebra.
Succinylcholine is a paralytic agent that has no analgesic (pain relieving) or tranquilizing properties. The use of this
drug for routine non-painful procedures in the absence of anesthesia to alter conscious awareness is considered
distressful to the animal. In addition to the distress of paralysis while maintaining consciousness, this type of drug
can also paralyze respiratory muscles causing animals to stop breathing, and if animals are not properly ventilated
they can die of suffocation. This facility does not have adequate equipment, facilities, or training to intubate or
mechanically ventilate animals in this event. Because of their distressing effects, narrow safety margin, and
associated risk of mortality, the use of paralytic or neuromuscular-blocking drugs without direct veterinary
administration, oversight and care (including the use of general anesthesia and respiratory support) is not consistent
with providing adequate veterinary care.
Correct by working with your attending veterinarian to identify and implement a more appropriate chemical
immobilization protocol that provides adequate care for all species being handled. 2.131(c)(1) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** The public continues to be permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures containing several species of
animals. This includes sheep, kangaroo, muntjac deer, and goats. These animals are housed in walk through area
of the zoo is open to the public. There are no barriers or signs present to discourage public contact and the guests
are encouraged to feed food sold at the entry gate. There are no attendants present during public contact and
guests may walk directly up to enclosures and pet the animals. Primary enclosure fences are made of material with
spaces large enough for the guests to reach through and touch the animals. Licensees must ensure that during
periods of public exhibition animals are handled with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the
general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct by placing barriers to prevent
public contact with these animals or by ensuring that an adequate number of attendants are present at each of
these locations to ensure the safety of both the public and the animals.
2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Guests are allowed to drive through a section of the facility in their cars. No attendant is present in the drive
through area when these unaccompanied visits are taking place. This facility also has horse drawn wagons that
takes guests thru and allows public feeding with an attendant present. Allowing guests to feed from vehicles without
attendants present does not protect the animals and the public nor does it provide a barrier or distance from the
animals and the public. Correct this by providing an attendant at all times during public contact.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with farm manager.
