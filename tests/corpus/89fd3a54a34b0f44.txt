RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
2.75 (b) (1) Records.
No records available at the time of inspection listing the current inventory of animals on hand. Licensee had intake
(acquisition) and out-take (disposition) records available, but could not match the acquisition and disposition forms
to get a complete inventory. There was one hedgehog in the back area of the store that the facility representative
stated they did not have an intake (acquisition) record. Maintaining current records of animals on hand, including
those acquired and disposed of, is required in order to be able to accurately track the animals.
Make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the required information regarding acquisition
and disposition of animals other than dogs and cats.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.125 (a) Structural Strength.
On the left lower shelf at the front of the entrance to the back animal room is a cage housing 2 adult chinchillas.
The cage is up against the wall where the chinchillas are chewing the paint, drywall and have access to an electrical
outlet which can cause medical issues and injuries to the animals.
Located in the back inside the feeder room is a young goat sitting in the corner in a large metal container. Facility
representative stated this is where the goat is housed at night. The container is not large enough and does not
properly contain the animal. The animal can jump out of the container and become injured. During the inspection
the facility representative moved the goat to the front of the store where the animal is held during the day to a large
wood enclosure holding a turtle. The goat jumped out of the enclosure and ran around on the slick tiles of the store
where the animal could have escaped out the door or become injured on the slick floor.Maintain all facilities so that are constructed of such materials and strength appropriate for animals involved and are
structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injuries and to contain them.
