ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1600 on
13-Sep-17. I went to the licensee's house. The person that answered the door said the licensee was not home and
that there was no one available to conduct the inspection. I informed him I would try back another time.
End of report.
