Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There were at least five adult rabbits that had long toenails. This included a beige Netherland Dwarf buck (#35), a dark
brown and white Mini Rex buck (#30), a black and white Mini Rex doe (#45), a white with black around the eyes Mini Rex
doe (#43), and a white and brown Netherland Dwarf doe (#37). Some of these animals' toenails were approximately an
inch long and some were observed going through the openings in the wire mesh flooring. The long nails could get caught
in the wire flooring of the enclosures. The licensee must trim the toenails of these animals to ensure that the animals can
move normally and prevent the potential for injury. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the licensee must
establish and follow a program of regular toenail maintenance for all the animals to prevent the overgrowth of toenails.
3.56(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
Within the indoor building housing rabbits there was a buildup of hair, debris, and grime. Some of the rabbit enclosures
had an accumulation of hair along the tops, fronts and/or sides of their enclosures. A buildup of hair, debris and grime was
also present on and around some of the automatic water lines as well as a couple of the self-feeders on the front of the
rabbit enclosures. The buildup of hair, debris and grime increases the risk of disease hazards. The licensee must ensure


that the premises remain clean in order to protect the health of the animals and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry
practices set forth in this subpart.

This inspection and a preliminary exit interview were conducted with the licensee on June 16, 2022. A final exit interview
was completed on June 17, 2022 with the licensee.
