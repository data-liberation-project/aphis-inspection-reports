(3) Cleaning.
****There were 6 plastic shelters in 3 enclosures that had a large amount of mud and dirt over at least one-half of
the outer surface. Cleaning of hard surfaces is essential for a healthy environment and reduces disease hazards by
eliminating harboring places for diseases and pests. The owner needs to remove the dirt and mud from these areas
and assure that all hard surfaces are cleaned and sanitized as required at all times.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
****There were at least 5 self feeders in the outdoor enclosures that had dirt, cobwebs, dead insects and other
debris along the top inside surface, especially just under the lid. Dirt and insect debris can contaminate the food
and decrease the nutritional value. The owner must ensure that feeders are kept clean and must be sanitized in
accordance with Sec. 3.11(b) of this subpart to prevent the contamination and deterioration of the feed.
