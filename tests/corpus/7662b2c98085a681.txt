PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The bottom horizontal support tubing of seven dividing panels separating eight exterior runs on the south side of the
kennel building are heavily corroded with broken areas of tubing and exposed sharp edges. There is also one panel
where wire has broken from tubing and is protruding into the kennel. Additionally, there is tin immediately to the left
of one dog egress/entry door that is corroded with roughened areas. The protruding wire, corroded tin and broken
tubing pose an injury risk to dogs occupying the affected kennels.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges which could
injure the dogs.
The protruding wire into occupied kennels needs to be corrected by August 16, 2019.
The broken tubing on panels in occupied kennels needs to be repaired, replaced or covered by August 20. 2019.
The corroded tin in the occupied kennel needs to be repaired, replaced or covered by August 20, 2019.
