2.1(a)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This pet store is offering hedgehogs and degus for sale without a valid USDA license. The owner of the pet store
filed a pre-license application in May, 2014. On 5-30-14, the inspector contacted the owner of the store by phone
and was told that the owner would contact him when they were ready for a pre-license inspection. On 7-25-14, the
inspector contacted the owner of the store by phone and was told by the owner that they changed their mind about
becoming licensed as it was too much of a hassle. A USDA license is needed to sell the hedgehogs and degus.
NO COVERED ACTIVITY IS PERMITTED WITHOUT A VALID USDA LICENSE.
The facility must stop offering these animals for sale without a proper license.
