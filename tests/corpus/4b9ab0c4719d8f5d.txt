3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** The den walls for the tigers, Magoo and Special and the lion Rainbow were made of wood landscape timbers.
Some of the timbers were rotten and could easily be broken. The weakness of the walls could break posing the risk
of injury or escape. The housing facilities must be repaired and/or replaced and should be maintained and kept
structurally sound to protect and contain the animals.
** The primary enclosure fence for the tiger, Tigger, had a loose wire that was hanging into the pen. The loose wire
could pose the risk of entanglement and injury. The housing facilities should be maintained and kept structurally
sound to protect the animals from injury.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** The perimeter fence for the black leopard Jack had a gap at the bottom that was about 4 inches high and 12
inches long. The second containment would not effectively hold the animal if it escaped. The perimeter fence must
be constructed so that it serves as a secondary containment system for the animal in the facility for the animal and
the public's safety. It was corrected by the exit interview.
The inspection was conducted with Bart Sutherland and the Zoo Director.
