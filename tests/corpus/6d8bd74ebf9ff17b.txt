2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A 2-year-old female Nubian goat was observed on inspection with a left-forelimb, weight-bearing lameness. Though no
swelling was visualized, the animal’s gait was noticeably affected. The licensee stated they first observed the lameness
two-three days ago, electing to closely monitor the goat’s progress. While the lameness had improved, the licensee did
not contact the veterinarian for oversight. Upon communication during the inspection, the attending veterinarian stated
they would have preferred to start pain medications along with the monitoring instead of observations alone.

Lameness is suggestive of pain and/or underlying disease. Injuries and diseases that are not treated properly (as directed
by a veterinarian or detailed in the program of veterinary care) may be painful and can lead to other veterinary care
problems. The licensee must use appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.

Correct by having the licensee follow all treatment recommendations (including re-check examinations of the goat as
needed) provided by the veterinarian no later than close of business September 14, 2020.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
