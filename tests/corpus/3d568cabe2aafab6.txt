2.33(b)(3) CRITICAL REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
A dog brought into the facility from a shelter was noted to be ill with a cough. Later, it was noted to have some blood
in the cage. A parvo test was negative at that time. Later, it was noted to have a significant amount blood in the
cage. The attendant left a message for veterinary staff at the CVM, then left for the evening. The dog was found
moribund early the next morning and passed away before a veterinarian could be located.
An unclear process for reporting problems in the teaching hospital resulted in the unnecessary suffering of this dog.
This was corrected prior to inspection by development of a contact list and contact procedures with several layers of
backup.
2.33(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
In the deer area, two unlabeled syringes were found in the refrigerator in a plastic bag labeled "Phoebe." Any
medications that are drawn up, but not immediately used, must be labeled with complete information.
Unlabeled medications pose a danger to the animals in that they could be used incorrectly.
Correct immediately by discarding the syringes and labeling all medications appropriately from this point forward.
3.129(a) CRITICAL
FEEDING.
A deer mouse feeding study resulted in the deaths of some group-housed animals, partly due to competition.
All animals need to have access to adequate amounts of food to ensure their health.
This was corrected prior to inspection by amending the study design to individually house the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility and IACUC personnel.
