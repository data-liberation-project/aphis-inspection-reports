3.8(c)(3)(iii)

Exercise for dogs.
Dogs housed individually in buildings TH 2 and TH 9 are not being provided the opportunity for appropriate exercise.
These dogs are housed in enclosures which provide less than two times the required floor space. According to facility
documentation, the dogs are allotted time to exercise during enclosure cleaning. However, multiple dogs were observed
exhibiting behaviors such as cowering in enclosure corners, continuous shivering, and stereotypical behaviors such as
spinning or circling. In addition, at least three dogs had chewed and shredded their plastic pan liners, which could result in
ingestion of a foreign material and thus negatively impact the health of the animal. Additional opportunity for exercise
must be offered when enclosure size does not offer twice the required floor space for individually housed dogs as
prescribed by the attending veterinarian.

Watering
There were multiple dogs in buildings TH 2 and TH9 that did not have access to water. The dogs were offered water at
the time of inspection, and some were observed drinking continuously, which would indicate thirst. Water not being
available can cause adverse health issues and can negatively affect the animals' well being. Water must be available to


the dogs at all times.
****Corrected at the time of inspection

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
