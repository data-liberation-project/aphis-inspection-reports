2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**** In the sheltered facility a nine year old female Yorkshire Terrier named Molly (microchip #45292A5C12) had a
heavy coating of greenish-dark brown matter on the cheek teeth and canines on both sides of her mouth extending
up into the gum line. This accumulation was covering what few teeth she had left. The buildup of abnormal material
on teeth can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of the animal. Dental
disease can be painful and eventually lead to a decrease in appetite. It can also lead to infection in the mouth as
well as the potential spread of infection to other organs in the body. The licensee must have this dog evaluated by a
veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. The licensee must document the follow
up care as directed by the veterinarian and ensure that all animals receive veterinary care when needed at all times.
