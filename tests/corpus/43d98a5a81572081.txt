2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Acquisition records (including where and when the animal was acquired) was missing for 7 rabbits, 4 sheep, 1 cow, 3
alpacas, 2 llamas, 1 Patagonian Cavy, and 2 Black-Tailed Prairie Dogs. Lack of acquisition information doesn't allow for
proper tracking by APHIS officials. All acquisition information must be documented for all regulated animals.
3.53(a)(2)

Primary enclosures.
At least 6 rabbits had an excessive amount of feces buildup in their enclosures. Feces buildup in the enclosures can
contribute to the spread of disease not only amongst the rabbits, but also to any person that comes into contact with the
rabbits. The enclosure needs to be cleaned out on a more regular basis to prevent an excessive buildup on feces
material.
3.131(d)

Sanitation.
There is an accumulation of various types of materials and clutter surrounding the prairie dogs' enclosure. Keeping the
area surrounding the prairie dogs' enclosure helps ensure that the enclosure can be properly maintained and cleaned.
The clutter surrounding the enclosure must either be cleaned up or the prairie dogs must be moved to another enclousre.
