Facilities, general.
Fox enclosures: There was 2in. X 4in. wire mesh material which was exposed above the ground and covering the
majority of the ground area in one fox enclosure and approximately half the ground area in another enclosure. The
presence of exposed or inadequately buried wire material may lead to the animals’ limbs being entrapped within the
wiring or injured. Housing facilities must be kept in good repair and maintained to protect the animals and prevent injury. A
system of facility repair and maintenance must be in place.
