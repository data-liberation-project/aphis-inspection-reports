WATERING.
There are three fenced pastures containing 2-4 adult capybaras with one of these also having 5 baby capybaras.
Two of these pastures also house large numbers of black swans which share the small man made ponds which are
in each of the pastures. Two of these pasture areas do not have any other water source besides the ponds for
drinking purposes. One of the ponds is very green as it has not rained here in several weeks. The white plastic
water bucket in one of the capybara/swan enclosures was filled with water, but the sides of the barrel have a thick
layer of algae.
Potable water is to be provided as often as necessary for the health and comfort of the animals, and all water
receptacles are to be kept clean and sanitary. Even if the capybaras choose to drink the pond water, they still must
be provided clean potable water in clean receptacles. To be corrected by 11-2-16.
Exit briefing conducted with owner.
