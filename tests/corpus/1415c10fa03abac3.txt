HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The facility representative/owner of the property has not demonstrated adequate experience, knowledge and
training to maintain one adult cougar and four bears. The licensee lives about one hour away from the site and will
visit a minimum of once per week. When the licensee is not there, the owner of the property is the only individual
responsible for the daily husbandry of these animals and is the facility representative. When the facility
representative was asked about what to do if the co-housed bears were to ever get into a fight, he did not know
what to do nor did he have any equipment to properly handle the situation. Additionally, the facility representative
does not appear to understand proper safety procedures around potentially dangerous animals. The facility
representative stood within a few inches multiple times with his back facing the bear enclosure. On one occasion
when the facility representative had his back facing the enclosure, a grizzly bear was facing him with its claws
sticking through the enclosure a few inches from the facility representative. The facility representative seemed
unconcerned. Furthermore, the office in Raleigh, NC has not approved the facility representative’s training. Failure
to have adequate experience, knowledge and training in maintaining large carnivores increases the risk of harm to
the animal husbandry staff, animals and to the public, if an escape occurs. The licensee must demonstrate the
facility representative has adequate experience and knowledge by submitting documentation detailing the
experience, knowledge, and training of the facility representative to the office located in Raleigh, NC for final
approval.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On inspection, the metal water receptacle for a 10 month old female grizzly bear was empty. The licensee was
asked to fill the receptacle with water. Afterwards, it was noticed there was a hole in the receptacle on the side
which only allowed the water receptacle to be filled approximately 25% (approximately 1 gallon). The licensee and
facility representative were not aware of the defective water receptacle and informed us they would replace the
water receptacle that day. This water receptacle was the only source of water for this animal. Although the bear did
not appear to be dehydrated and only drank water for 15 seconds when offered, failure to maintain the water
receptacle in good repair puts the animal in risk of dehydration or death. Correct by ensuring all water receptacles
and all other aspects of housing facilities are in good repair to protect the animal from injury.3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The outdoor enclosure for a 10 month old female grizzly bear has no shelter from sunlight. There are no natural or
artificial means to provide sufficient shade for the animal. The den box is made of a translucent plastic that does not
adequately provide protection from direct sunlight. Without adequate shade animals can easily overheat, suffer from
sunburns on exposed skin, and experience severe discomfort. Correct by providing either a natural or artificial
means to protect all animals from direct sunlight.
3.127(b)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are three adult bears (2 black bears and 1 grizzly bear) in an enclosure with 2 metal containers attached to
the primary enclosure to act as den boxes. The two metal containers are approximately 5 x 3ft, large enough to
house one adult bear. The primary enclosure’s sides are made of 2x4” wire fencing and cannot block the wind, rain,
or snow; therefore, there is not a sufficient amount of shelter space to provide all animals protection from inclement
weather. A lack of shelter directly exposes animals to any and all weather extremes and conditions. Not having
adequate shelter space can cause significant suffering by impeding the animal’s ability to maintain normal body
temperature. The licensee must ensure that all animals have an adequate shelter space that is large enough for all
the animals in the enclosure to fit comfortably while being protected from the weather.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The 4 bears and one cougar have insufficient space and no climbing structures which prevents expression of
natural behaviors. The three adult bears are housed together in a divided cage, the small side measuring about 8’ x
12’ and the larger side measuring about 16’ x 12’. During the inspection, the adult bears were seen predominantly
laying down (approximately 80-90% during the inspection) without much movement and appeared only motivated by
food. This is an aberrant behavior for bears. The juvenile female grizzly bear was singly housed in an enclosure
approximately 9’ x 9’ square. When the water receptacle used for providing drinking water was filled, the juvenile
bear immediately began to splash around with its two front feet. Black bears are biologically designed to be smaller
and slimmer to have the mobility to climb trees, so excess weight on this species of bear can cause additional
health and behavioral issues. The bear enclosures has insufficient space and furnishings (such as climbing
structures, and a water feature suitable for swimming) to promote exercise. Additionally, there are no visual barriers
for bears to remove themselves from unwanted social contact. The cougar is housed in a round pen at one level
that is approximately 20’ in diameter with no climbing structures. The cougar stayed in its den box for the majority of
the inspection. The lack of climbing structures and elevated platform prevents the cougar from jumping and
climbing, which is a normal natural behavior. Inadequate space may lead to stress, poor condition and abnormal
behavior patterns. Ensure all enclosures permit normal social and postural adjustments for the species in question.3.129(a)
FEEDING.
The diets for the 4 bears and 1 cougar are not sufficient in nutritive value. According to the facility representative,
about 5 to 6 pounds of either chicken or meat scraps are provided each day. No nutritional supplements or vitamins
are given. Diets must be species-specific, appropriate in content and amount fed, include appropriate nutritional
supplements, and be approved by the attending veterinarian. From the description of the diet, there is little to no
produce offered, other than the occasional clump of grass. Bears are omnivores and require a large variety of
foods, and in the fall they should have a seasonally appropriate diets and be allowed to feed to satiety, as per their
normal seasonal metabolic requirements. The older adult female grizzly bear appears to be underweight for this
time of year, while the black bears seem to be of adequate body weight. The male cougar appears to be of
adequate body weight. Consult with a knowledgeable veterinarian on an appropriate nutrition program that takes
into account the bears’ seasonal nutritional needs and the cougar’s need for nutritional supplements or vitamins.
NO REGULATED ACTIVITY MAY BE CONDUCTED FROM THIS SITE UNTIL THE SITE IS APPROVED.
The site inspection was conducted by VMO Cody Yager, BCMMS Laurie Gage, and CS Patrick Keith with the
licensee and facility representative/property owner on 11/1/2016.
The exit interview was conducted by VMO Cody Yager with the licensee over the phone on 11/4/2016.
