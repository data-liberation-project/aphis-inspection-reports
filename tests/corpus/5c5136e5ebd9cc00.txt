SANITATION.
Upon entering the sugar glider room, a distinct strong ammonia odor was detected. Excess ammonia can be
harmful to the animals and needs to be minimized. The trays under the cages were cleaned a week ago, and even
though there is not a large build up of food and waste, something in the room is contributing to excessive odor.
Cages and items in the room need to be cleaned more often to prevent build up of odors. To be corrected by
7-3-19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
