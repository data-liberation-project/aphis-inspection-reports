ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Licensee has not followed veterinary recommendations for dental care. In May 2016, the dogs in the kennel had
their teeth evaluated and scored by the attending veterinarian. At that time, several dogs had a dental score of 3. It
was recommended these dogs have their teeth cleaned and that all dogs be evaluated again in November 2016. At
the time of inspection, none of the dogs have had dental cleanings nor were they evaluated last November. Dental
disease is painful and can adversely impact the heart, kidneys, liver, and reproductive systems. Licensee shall
assure that the attending veterinarian has appropriate authority to ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care
by following all veterinary directives and recommendations exactly.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The female Akita, which has lost her USDA tag, has a large wound on her left shoulder. It occurred about three
weeks ago when she tried to jump the fence. She has not been examined by a veterinarian. Licensee has an
appointment for her to be seen by a veterinarian tomorrow, August 24, 2017. Though Licensee has been keeping
the wound clean, this dog has experienced prolonged suffering due to lack of veterinary care. With prompt
adequate care, the wound may have been healed by now. Licensee must utilize appropriate methods to prevent,
control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. This dog must be examined by a licensed veterinarian tomorrow
for diagnosis and treatment. Licensee must assure all veterinary recommendations are followed exactly.
Documentation of the veterinary assessment, treatment, and plan shall be maintained for examination by APHIS
officials

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The female Akita, without an official form of ID, was injured about three weeks ago. A veterinarian was notconsulted to assess or treat her injury. She still has a large wound on her left shoulder. Licensee has an
appointment for her to be seen by a veterinarian tomorrow, August 24, 2017. With prompt and adequate care, her
injury may have been healed by now. Though Licensee has been keeping the wound clean, this dog has
experienced prolonged suffering due to lack of veterinary care. Licensee must establish a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and
well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Several of the adult dogs have lost or are missing their identification tag. It is difficult to determine who's who
among the dogs. None of the puppies are tagged, collared, or have a cage card. It is nearly impossible to correlate
the puppy ID numbers recorded on the APHIS forms 7006 to the puppies and their records. Accurate and reliable
identification helps assure dogs will be maintained and treated in accordance with their individual needs. All dogs
held on the premises shall be identified by an official form of ID.

2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The records are confusing and incomplete. License does not maintain cage cards or puppy records which include
all of the required information. Therefore, it is difficult to correlate puppies born to the disposition records on hand.
Of the twenty APHIS forms 7006 available since June 2016, the disposition date is missing from one, the receiver
name/address is missing from one, and the date of birth is missing from six. Without accurate and reliable records it
is difficult to account for all the dogs and assure only inspected animals are being used for regulated activity.
Licensee must make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the required
information.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures don't contain the dogs. In the exercise yard, the dogs have dug holes under the fence that allow
them to escape. During inspection, one Shiba Inu mix and three Husky mixes escaped out of the yard. A few
weeks ago, the Akita female climbed one of the fences and became entangled at the top, injuring her shoulder.
Loose dogs are more likely to encounter disease hazards or sustain injury. Housing facilities for dogs must bedesigned and constructed so that they are structurally sound, kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury,
contain the animals securely, and restrict other animals from entering.

3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The puppies in the outdoor enclosure do not have adequate shelter. Nine large breed puppies have been in this
enclosure for the past month. One portable kennel is present. All of the puppies cannot fit into it, nor is it sufficient
to provide protection from wind/rain, as the holes in the sides and open front door would not adequately protect the
puppies from inclement weather. It is not uncommon for rain and thunderstorms to move through this area in the
summertime. Puppies may suffer undue stress when exposed to the elements. Outdoor facilities for dogs must
include one or more shelter structures that are accessible to each animal and that are large enough to allow each
animal in the shelter structure to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner, and to turn about freely.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Urine and feces accumulates in the area under the elevated outdoor pens and needs to be cleaned. A strong odor
is apparent when near this area. Small areas of moist, dark ground is evident in some spots seeping from
underneath the pens. It is unknown when this area was last cleaned. Accumulations of organic material promote
growth of disease hazards which may be harmful to the dogs. Excreta and food waste must be removed from
under primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation, therefore reducing disease
hazards, insects, pests and odors.
