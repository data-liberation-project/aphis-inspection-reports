2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:32p on
15-Sep-16.
The facility does not have a door to knock on without entering the bio-security grounds so ACI Bartels honked the
horn of the government vehicle, and phoned the licensee and left message. ACI Bartels received a return call from
the licensee at 2:09p. The licensee state he was out on a delivery and would not be able to return to the facility.
