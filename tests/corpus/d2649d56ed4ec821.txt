2.40(a)(1)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
At the time of inspection, there is no written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC). A written Program of Veterinary Care
(PVC) is required to ensure that there is an expectation about the care provided to all animals. Failure to establish and
maintain a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) can decrease the ability to ensure optimal care of the animals.
A written PVC must be established and maintained so that the licensee has a plan for providing adequate preventative
care and treatments as necessary.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MARCH 30, 2022.
2.40(b)(2) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two adult longhorn cattle have hooves that are overgrown; the hooves are curving upward and affecting the angles of the
feet due to a lack of regular hoof trimming. Failure to properly maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can
be painful or cause injuries.
The licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the
attending veterinarian and the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC), to include timely and appropriate hoof care as needed.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MARCH 8, 2022.


2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There are two adult rabbits (sex unknown) with medical conditions:
One dark gray rabbit occasionally squints its right eye, which is white/opaque in color. One tan and gray rabbit has a
mass on its back, measuring ~3-4" wide and ~2.5" tall, with a red, hairless area measuring ~1"X0.5" in size on the right
side of the mass. When asked, the facility representative said he had neither noticed nor been notified of these issues by
husbandry staff.
Failure to note illness or injuries delays reporting to the veterinarian and delays veterinary attention. This can lead to
worsening of a condition and prolong the animals’ discomfort and suffering. Daily observation of all animals to assess
their health and well being must be done to ensure animals are in good health, and a mechanism of direct and frequent
communication must be utilized so that timely and accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior and well-
being are conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MARCH 4, 2022.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
At the time of inspection, there is no written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for Dogs to address the veterinary care for
one adult male dog named "Jack." A written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs is required to ensure that there is
an expectation about the care provided to any dogs at the facility. Failure to establish and maintain a written Program of
Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs can decrease the ability to ensure optimal care of the dog.
A written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for Dogs must be established and maintained so that the licensee has a plan
for providing adequate preventative care and treatments as necessary. The plan must include all of the required


components as listed in the Animal Welfare Act and Animal Welfare Regulations, Part 3, Subpart A, Section 3.13.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MARCH 30, 2022.
3.125(a) Critical

Facilities, general.
During the month of September, 2019 (the licensee does not remember the exact date), all of the facility's 15 prairie dogs
escaped their enclosure and were not seen again. The definitive location of a breach was not identified, although the
facility manager suspected a small, irregular hole in a wooden access panel near the back of the enclosure.
The licensee must ensure that housing facilities are constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for
the animals involved; they must be sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain
the animals.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MARCH 3, 2022.
3.125(c)

Facilities, general.
There are vending machines containing pelleted feed for use by the public to feed seven deer, six llamas, seven buffalo
and two longhorn cattle. The clear, plastic receptacles have ~1-3" of accumulated "fines" / food dust at the bottom, and
some of the units have cracks in the plastic. Some of the food dust appears wet, and there is a whitish material in some
places.
In the outbuilding used to store feed for the animals, there is a fully opened bag of sweet feed sitting directly on the floor.
Storing food in a manner that does not sufficiently protect it from deterioration, molding or contamination by vermin can
cause the food to be unpalatable or cause illness in the animals. Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in facilities
which adequately protect such supplies against deterioration, molding or contamination by vermin.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MARCH 15, 2022.
