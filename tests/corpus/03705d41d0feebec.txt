ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In one outdoor enclosure there is a female beagle (no ID found) that has excessively long toenails on both of her
front feet. The toenails have become curved and lay sideways from the toes when the dog is standing on the
flooring. The licensee stated that they had been trimming toenails the day before, but must have missed this dog.
Overgrown toenails could cause pain and discomfort to the dog, as well as affect the dog's natural gait.
The licensee must trim the toenails on both front feet of this dog. The licensee must also establish and maintain a
plan for trimming the toenails of all regulated dogs in order to ensure that all toenails remain at an acceptable length
at all times.
A verbal correction date of March 04, 2016 was given at the time of inspection.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In at least four outdoor enclosures, housing at least six adult dogs, the igloo-style dog houses have been
excessively chewed and scratched by the dogs. The dog houses are constructed of a hard plastic material and the
damage is located around the sides, top and bottom of the entrance. The chewed areas does not allow for proper
cleaning and sanitization of the surface of the dog houses, which could increase the disease risk towards the dogs.
All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized must
be replaced when worn or soiled. The licensee must replace, repair, or alter the damaged areas in a manner that
allows for proper cleaning and sanitization of the dog houses to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces
of housing facilities remain in good repair and are capable of being cleaned and sanitized.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.The facility has five whelping buildings. The interior of the whelping buildings is framed with wood boards and the
sides and floor are constructed of plywood. In the second whelping building the wood framing the dog's access
door and the large walk through door has been chewed and shredded by the dogs. The licensee stated that none
of the wood or plywood has been sealed and is not impervious to moisture. Wood that is not impervious to moisture
can absorb liquids, which could soften the wood and increase the disease risk towards the dogs.
All surfaces in contact with the dogs including floors, walls, boxes, and dens must be impervious to moisture. The
licensee must repair, replace or alter the damaged wood and seal all the wood and plywood with an appropriate
sealant. The licensee must ensure that all wooden surfaces in contact with the dogs is sealed and impervious to
moisture at all times.
