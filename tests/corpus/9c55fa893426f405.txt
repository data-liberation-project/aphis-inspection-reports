CONSIGNMENTS TO CARRIERS AND INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS.
Upon inspection of the crate of a ten week old puppy arriving on a KLM flight to SFO from Amsterdam, and handled
by Menzies, it was discovered that no feeding and watering instructions were attached to the crate. There was a
sticker applied in Amsterdam stating that the animal had been fed and watered after arriving there from Hungary,
but it said the animal was last offered food and water on 3/20 at 8:15. Assuming that was 8:15 AM, with the 8 hour
time difference, that would have been 12 AM SFO time, fourteen hours previous to the time of inspection at SFO.
But this is uncertain, as the information was unclear, and no feeding and watering instructions were provided from
the shipper, as required.

Carriers must ensure that a certification is signed by the consignor that includes written instructions for feeding and
watering, and that this information is clearly visible on the primary enclosure so that the animal can be properly
cared for during transit.
To be corrected immediately.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.

inspection it was observed that the crates were not marked with the words "LIVE ANIMAL" in letters at least one
inch high, as required.
Waybill #s 074-23354111 (2 pieces) and 074-24677273
Unless the enclosure is permanently affixed to the conveyance, it should be clearly marked on top and on one or
more sides with the words ``Live Animals,'' in letters at least 1 inch (2.5 cm.) high to help ensure proper handling bytransportation personnel.
To be corrected immediately.
An exit briefing was conducted wit a facility representative.
