ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was a male English Bulldog (#0A01651705) with a raised, reddened, nodule-like lesion between two of the
toes on the left front paw. The lesion was approximately 3/4 inch by 1/4 inch in size. While trying to more closely
observe the paw, the dog would frequently pull its leg back towards his body. According to the licensee, she was
not aware of the lesion until the inspector pointed it out. The lesion between the toes could be the result of an injury,
infection, illness or other veterinary medical condition which may cause discomfort. The licensee must consult with a
licensed veterinarian regarding this animal's condition no later than April 21, 2014 in order to obtain an accurate
diagnosis and to ensure that an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed.
***There was an approximately 7 1/2 year old male Yorkshire Terrier, "Harley", (#095*097*779) with a dental
condition. Many of the dog's teeth appeared to be missing. On the remaining teeth, there was a very heavy
build-up of yellowish-brown to green material covering their surface. The gums had receded along some of the
teeth and the root of the upper left canine tooth was visible.
***There was an approximately 9 year old male Maltese, "Cracker Box", (#093010823) that was rubbing the right
side of its face along the front door of its enclosure. On closer observation, there was a yellowish-brown material
covering the surface of most of the teeth that were present. Some of the dog's teeth were missing. The gums had
receded along some of the cheek teeth and both upper canine teeth; the roots of these teeth were visible. The
inside flap of the dog(cid:25)s left ear also appeared thickened near the canal which was difficult to visualize. The
thickened skin in the ear flap could indicate an infection, allergy or other veterinary condition which may cause
discomfort.
***There was an approximately 4 year old female Yorkshire Terrier (#0A01317168) that was standing but not as
active or walking around as much as the other two dogs that shared its enclosure. The dog would also frequently
lick. When the dog walked it appeared to have a stiff gait in the back legs. The dog also had a pronounced curved
appearance to its middle to lower back. On observation of the dog(cid:25)s mouth, there was a heavy build-up of yellowish
brown material on the majority of the teeth. There was a whitish gray creamy material observed at the gum line of
the upper cheek teeth. This dog(cid:25)s abnormal gait and stance could indicate an injury, illness, or other veterinary
medical condition which could be painful.***There was an approximately 7 year old female Shih Tzu (#145532122A) that had its tongue hanging out and wet
fur around its mouth. Also, there were two areas of hair loss noted along the dog(cid:25)s back right side. Most of the
teeth had a heavy build-up of yellowish brown material on their surface. This abnormal build-up of material covered
the majority of the cheek teeth and extended into the gum line. The gums appeared reddened, swollen and had
receded along some of these teeth. An upper right cheek tooth was observed to move very easily upon lifting the
dog's upper lip. According to the licensee, she thought the areas of hair loss were due to grooming the dog
recently. On closer observation of one of the areas of hair loss, the surrounding fur was wet and an approximately
1/2 inch open skin lesion was noted. A thick, yellowish-green, mucoid-like material was noted within the lesion.
Also a pinpoint sized hole through the tissue was noted centrally within the lesion. The skin lesion could be the
result of injury, infection or other veterinary medical condition which could negatively affect the health of the animal.
The abnormal build-up of material on the dogs' teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and tooth structures.
These dogs' dental conditions could be painful, may decrease the dogs' ability to eat normally and negatively impact
the overall health of the animals.
None of the animals mentioned above had been examined by a veterinarian for their current conditions nor were
they under any type of treatment at the time of inspection. The licensee must have the male Yorkshire Terrier
(#095*097*779), male Maltese (#093010823), female Yorkshire Terrier (#0A01317168) and female Shih Tzu
(#145532122A) examined by a licensed veterinarian no later than April 21, 2014 in order to ensure that accurate
diagnoses are made and appropriate treatment plans are developed and followed. The licensee must develop and
follow an effective dental care program as part of the overall program of veterinary care for the animals in the
facility.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces--(3) Cleaning.
Inside of the indoor whelping building there were 2 enclosures, housing a total of 2 dogs and 6 puppies that had an
accumulation of fecal material smashed and smeared on the solid resting surface, and wire flooring. The amount of
fecal material in these two enclosures made it difficult for the puppies or dogs to avoid stepping in it. The walls of
one of these enclosures, housing one dog and 4 puppies, had fecal material smeared on them. Sheltered building
four had 3 inside enclosures that had excessive fecal matter inside the enclosure. One of these enclosures had
fecal material smeared on the flooring covering about 50-70%. The outdoor portion of one of the enclosures had
fecal material smeared and covering about 60-80% of the tile resting surfaces and also on the wall.
Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly or often enough, increase the risk of disease hazards for the
dogs or puppies. The licensee must ensure all surfaces in contact with the dogs and puppies are spot cleaned dailyand sanitized at least once every two weeks. The licensee must ensure all other surfaces of housing facilities are
cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards.
Veterinary care for male Chihuahua (#087*102*517), male Maltese (#0A01761551), and 3 week old female English
Bulldog (#137-13) from the October 23, 2013 report have been addressed.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
