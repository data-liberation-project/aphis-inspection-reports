Housing facilities, general.
In one of the enclosures, with 3 dogs, there was a hole in the back wall of the enclosure above the dog entry door. The
hole was approximately 6 inches wide and 12 inches long. The dogs had chewed the wall material and most of the 2x4
inside the wall. Having a hole in the wall can cause harm to the dogs and does not allow for proper cleaning and
disinfection. The licensee must repair the hole in this enclosure.
To be corrected by 16 July 2021.

Feeding
At least two self feeders had a mold like substance on the inside wall of the feeder that was hanging outside of the
enclosure. The mold like substance was in contact with the feed that would be presented to the dogs. Contaminated food
can decrease the dog's acceptance of the food and can increase the risk of disease and health hazards. The licensee
needs to remove the current moldy feeders to protect the health and well-being of the dogs. The licensee needs to
establish and maintain a program to ensure that feeders are cleaned and food is protected from contamination.
To be corrected by: Corrected during inspection.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
