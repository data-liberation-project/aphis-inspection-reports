2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 25 week old tiger at the facility named Daisy is being fed KMR, goats' milk and chicken. The chicken is being
dusted with an unknown vitamin supplement mixed with calcium carbonate in an unknown ratio and placed on the
chicken in an unknown amount. Daisy has a dull coat lacking the normal sheen that you would expect in a healthy,
actively growing tiger. There could be several causes for this dull coat appearance including: indoor housing,
internal parasite infestation and poor nutrition. This tiger has never had a fecal according to the CEO and the CEO
has no idea if the nutritional supplementation that he is giving her is adequate. The facility must determine what
supplementation is being given to the tiger and what amount. The attending veterinarian should be consulted to
determine if this is adequate and fecal testing should be done if the attending veterinarian determines that this is
indicated. Records of this consultation should be made and should be available for APHIS review. This should be
completed by 3-3-16.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The meat cooler had an overwhelming odor of rotten and decaying meat. This stench was noticeable from the
alleyway 20 to 30 feet away from the cooler. This odor makes it very hard to determine if the meat items stored in
this cooler are fit for animal consumption. Clean the cooler, identify the source of the odor and eliminate it.
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A wheel barrow full of fecal material was located in an alleyway next to the alpaca enclosures. Food and fecal
waste needs to be removed promptly in order to minimize odors, vermin infestation and disease hazards. Remove
this and all other waste materials in a prompt manner.
3.128
SPACE REQUIREMENTS. A 25 week old tiger is currently being housed in the basement of the residence located on the property. The
enclosure this tiger is housed in is too small for a six month old juvenile tiger. Tigers at this age are active. They
require space for exercise and play to promote proper development of bones, joints and muscles. This tiger needs
to be in a larger enclosure.
Correct by: 3-17-16.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The majority of the premises are filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash, buckets, tires and fence.
Several other buildings on the property are also filled with old equipment and debris and trash. Tall weeds are
located throughout the facility. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests and numerous
rodent holes were located throughout the facility. A mouse nest with live mice was noted on a shelf in the warm
room. All this material must be removed to help control pests.
The sink in the butcher area is dirty and contained blood and tissue covered utensils and cleaning supplies. The
band saw in the butcher area is covered with blood and needs to be cleaned. The floor and wall next to the meat
cooler is covered in blood and animal tissue. These things need to be cleaned in order to ensure that processed
meat does not become contaminated. Contaminated meat fed to the animals can make them ill and lead to
unnecessary suffering.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Rodent holes were located outside the Syrian brown
bear enclosure. Rodent holes were located next to the Asian black bear's food box. Rodent holes were located in
the alleyway for the leopard row cat enclosures and in the service area for the tigers Lenny and Squigy. Rodent
holes were located next to the tiger Mohan's enclosure. A mouse nest containing live fully haired baby mice was
located on a shelf in the warm room. Rodents can be carriers of disease which may be harmful to the animals
housed in these areas. A more effective means of rodent control must be established for the facility.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the amount of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of adequately
trained employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. A lack of properly trained employees can result in
facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. The unnoticed mouse nest in plain site on
a shelf in the warm room or the fact that staff continues to fail to clean equipment after butchering or to dispose
properly of animal waste removed from enclosures are examples of conditions that could be corrected with anadequate number of properly trained workers. Animal numbers must be reduced or more properly trained workers
must be added.
An exit interview was conducted at the conclusion of the inspection with the facility CEO and APHIS personnel Kurt
Hammel and Carrie Bongard. A formal exit interview was conducted with the facility CEO and Kurt Hammel on
2-25-16.
