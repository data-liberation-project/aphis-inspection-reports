3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The metal door frame at the front of the bear enclosure is excessively rusted at the bottom. The frame is flaking
and eroding in the rusted area. Structural integrity of the door and enclosure and animal containment may
eventually be impacted if the deterioration continues.
*One of the resting surfaces/shelters in the bear enclosure is constructed of wood panels attached to a metal
surface at the bottom. Some of the panels have been removed by the bears and pieces of broken metal and nails
used to secure the wood are now visible, potentially accessible to the animals and could cause injury.
Housing facilities must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain the animals. The described compromised areas should be repaired or replaced.
