INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***The research staff administered a drug by intramuscular injection rather than orally as described in the approved
protocol. This type of significant change to a research protocol must be reviewed by the IACUC. The facility
identified this issue, self-reported it to OLAW, and took corrective actions by the time of the inspection.
This was a focused inspection of records.
The inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the Associate VP of the ARP and Attending Veterinarians.
