3.81(e)(2)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Exemptions.
1. All of the protocols having an IACUC approved exemption to the social housing of non-human primates were
reviewed during the inspection. Four protocols were identified that did not include scientific reason(s) for the single
housing of the non-human primates in those research protocols. The protocols identified were #1320; #1452;
#1475; and #1527.
Per this Section of the Regulations, the IACUC may exempt non-human primates from participation in some or all of
the otherwise required environment enhancement plans for the scientific reasons as set forth by the principal
investigator and documented in the research protocol.
The IACUC needs to address this issue that was identified for these 4 protocols.
Correct by 8/10/15.
NOTE - Inspection conducted 6/15/15 and 6/16/15. Exit interview held 6/16/15 on-site with facility representatives.
