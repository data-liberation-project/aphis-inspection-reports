PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The primary enclosure housing five lemurs (3 ring-tailed and 2 brown lemurs), had shade material draped over a
portion of the cage. There were loops of tie-down strings along the edge of this material and portions of that string
were hanging down into the cage. The hanging string formed multiple loops which were large enough for a lemur to
get their hands or heads through. These dangling loops pose a risk of entanglement for the animal and there is
concern that one or more of them could get their head caught and strangle itself if it became entangled. Primary
enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the nonhuman primates from injury. The shade
material should be affixed in a manner that will not create a danger to the animals, or it should be replaced,
repaired, or otherwise adjusted so as to correct the hazard.

FEEDING.
A food storage area adjacent to the main kitchen and food preparation area was in disrepair. There were several
covered cans with stored animal food present. This portion of the building had damage to the ceiling with large
areas of exposed and torn insulation hanging down directly over the food storage bins. The room was also being
used as a general storage area, was cluttered, and contained cleaning supplies and many gallon-sized containers
of bleach just a few feet from the food bins. The deteriorated state of the storage room, exposed and hanging
insulation, and the presence of cleaning chemicals in close proximity creates a risk of contamination of the stored
food. Food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free of contamination. The food storage bins should be moved to a
different location that is compliant, or this storage room should be repaired and exposed insulation removed or
covered and potentially hazardous chemicals removed.
