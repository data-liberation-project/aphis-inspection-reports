Veterinary care for dogs.
The program of veterinary care did not specify how often the applicant was to evaluate all dogs in the kennel for healthy
and unmated hair coats, properly trimmed nails, clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin and teeth. The program of veterinary
care must specify and interval at which these evaluations be done in order to ensure the dogs remain healthy. Include
this information in the program of veterinary care.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by March 18, 2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Your next relicense inspection is scheduled for January 23, 2023 at 12:00 pm.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
