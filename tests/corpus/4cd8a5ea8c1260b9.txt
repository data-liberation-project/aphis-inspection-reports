2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A brown and white weanling guinea pig was observed to have hair loss with numerous scabs on the bridge of its nose
approximately 3/4 of an inch in diameter. This guinea pig was housed with 17 other weanlings. There were no observation
or treatment records present prior to this inspection noting this condition. The written program of veterinary care on file
says that guinea pigs with ringworm should be separated and treated with a fungal cream. At time of inspection owner's
wife treated this guinea pig with a fungal cream and recorded the treatment in a vet log book.

Failure to observe animals daily can result in guinea pigs not receiving appropriate treatment which could lead to
worsening and spreading of the condition. Licensee must observe animals daily, treat animals according to the program of
veterinary care on file, and communicate with the attending veterinarian when there are problems with animal health .
