3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was an excessive amount of feces in about 25% of the enclosures, and excessive build-up of feces on the
wash downs under the enclosures. The fecal build-up in the enclosures was enough where the dogs could not
move around freely without stepping in it. The wash downs were full of fecal material covering most of the wash
down with a several inch thick layer. Licensee said they haven't been able to clean because the drain pipes have
been frozen for about a month. Accumulations of waste products increase the risk of disease hazards and create an
unhealthy environment for the animals. The licensee must ensure that all waste material is removed from the
primary enclosures daily as required and from under the enclosure as often as necessary to satisfy husbandry
standards, but at least every two weeks.
