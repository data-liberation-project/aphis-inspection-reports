3.6(a)(2)(iii) CRITICAL
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** The current outside runs are gravel floor with wire mesh along the sides. The wire mesh is not buried and the
dogs are able to dig underneath into adjacent enclosures. A few of the dogs have the ability to jump out of the
enclosures and then jump into another dogs enclosure. On May 20, 2018 a Yorkie # 4023 was able to dig
underneath into another enclosure and was subsequently killed by a Labrador retriever. At the time of the
inspection, several Boston terrier puppies had dug underneath the wire and were in multiple adjacent enclosures
housing adult breeding males and females. This is dangerous for these puppies as they could be injured by the
adult dogs. In addition, a jack russel terrier had jumped out of its enclosure, killed a chicken and then jumped into
the boston terrier enclosure and deposited parts of the chicken in with the puppies. There was a large amount of
chicken feathers throughout the out door run.
These outdoor enclosures must be constructed to contain the dogs securely and keep other animals from entering
their enclosures. This needs to be addressed for the safety of the dogs.

FEEDING.
*** For several of the smaller breeds of dogs, the feeders are several feet off the ground making it necessary for the
dogs to continually jump up to access food or potentially jump into the feeder. It was requested by the inspector
that a thin Yorki with the feeder high up, was given a bowl of food on the ground, and when given easy access food,
the dog began to eat continually for an extended period of time. These food receptacles must be readily accessible
for the various sizes of dogs for their comfort and well being.

3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.*** Housekeeping needs to be addressed at the facility. There were discarded items around the outdoor runs
including, plastic bags, empty cleaning bottles, syringe caps etc. Since these dogs have the ability to dig under or
jump out of the enclosures, these discarded items could be a potential ingestion hazard. There were also weeds
growing up into the outdoor runs bringing up the black mesh fabric meant to block grass growth. This fabric is in the
dogs outdoor enclosure with easy access to the dogs and can be a hazard if the dogs chew and ingest the fabric.
Additionally, the outdoor runs are not having fecal waste removed daily which is a requirement of 3.11 (a).
Housekeeping needs to be addressed for the health of the dogs and to keep the area clean and in good repair.
