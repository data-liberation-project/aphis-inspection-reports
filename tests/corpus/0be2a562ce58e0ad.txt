ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has a written program of veterinary care however, it is incomplete. A young domestic cat is currently
living in the store, roaming free and interacting with other regulated animals on the premises. The owner provided
information that she administered two vaccinations to the kitten in the month of January. The program of veterinary
care does not list vaccinations, parasite treatment or control, euthanasia method or any other provisions for
veterinary care for cats.
The program of veterinary care should be completed by the attending veterinarian to accurately reflect the practices
at this facility for domestic cats. The written program will ensure that there is accurate communication between the
licensee and the attending veterinarian and ensure that all routine medications and vaccines provided to the animal
by the licensee are done with the direction and knowledge of the attending veterinarian. Correct by: February 22,
