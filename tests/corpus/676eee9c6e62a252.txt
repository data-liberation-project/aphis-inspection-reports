2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A white female Shih Tzu (#105) had a loose tooth on the right side of the mouth. Many of the dog's teeth had a good
amount of tartar build up. In addition the right front leg had a digit with an excessively long nail. This nail was significantly
longer than rest of the nails and was curving off to the right.

A white and tan female (#069) Teddy Bear had a left eye that was clouded over.

Dental issues can lead to systemic disease and even death. Long nails can be uncomfortable and even painful. A
clouded eye may be painful and indicates there is something wrong with that eye. It may also interfere with the dog's
vision.

The Attending Veterinarian must examine and treat both of these dogs.

Correct by 9/8/21.
