2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC has completed semi-annual facility inspections and program of humane care and use reviews based on
checklists and IACUC meeting minutes reviewed today. However, the IACUC did not prepare any evaluation reports
of their findings nor submit any to the Institutional Official for either the Sept. 2016 or the April 2017
inspections/reviews. In order to apprise the Institutional Official of the status and regulatory compliance of the
facility, the IACUC must prepare and submit reports of its evaluations of the facility's program for humane care and
use of animals and animal facilities at least once every six months to the IO. These reports must be reviewed and
signed by a majority of the IACUC members and must contain a description and nature and extent of the research
facility's adherence to the Animal Welfare Act Standards and Regulations and must identify specifically any
departures. Correct by Sept. 30, 2017.
2.31(d)(1)(ii)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The currently active protocols containing potentially painful/distressful procedures such as surgery, dental
extractions and GI endoscopy procedures do not contain a written narrative description of the methods and sources
used to determine that alternatives were not available. A thorough alternative search and narrative are necessary to
allow the IACUC to determine that the principal investigator has considered all alternatives to procedures that may
cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress to the animals during the IACUC's review of the protocol. All
protocols with procedures that may cause more than momentary pain or distress must contain an alternative
search. Correct by Sept. 30, 2017.
2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There is no documentation in the IACUC meeting minutes, semi-annual evaluations or in the protocols themselves
that the IACUC has performed an annual review of any of the protocols except the 'Surgical Procedures-Dog'
protocol that was modified and approved on 9/21/16. Regular continuing reviews of protocols by the IACUC are anessential IACUC function to ensure the humane care and use of the animals and compliance with regulations. The
IACUC shall conduct continuing reviews of all protocol activities at intervals determined by the IACUC but not less
than annually. Correct by Sept. 30, 2017.

SANITATION.
The pastures housing the horses and goats are overgrown with weeds. In some areas the weeds are five feet high.
The weeds along the fences are tall enough to make inspection of the fence difficult. Weeds can harbor pests and
unwanted animals such as ticks, rodents and snakes. Pasture maintenance shall include control of weeds. Correct
by July 14, 2017.
