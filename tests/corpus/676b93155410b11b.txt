Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
During the review of paperwork and records it was noted that the acquisition records were incomplete. The acquisition
records for the dogs did not fully identify where the animals were acquired, it listed no addresses, USDA license,
registration number, or driver’s license number and state for the individuals the animals were acquired from. Appropriate
documentation of acquired regulated animals is essential for proper identification, tracing forward and trace back of the
animals. The applicant must correctly document records of acquisition for all regulated animals, including animals born on
the premises, and assure that all records are kept as required. To be corrected by next re-license inspection.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “C” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by March 28, 2023, or the applicant will forfeit the license fee
and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
