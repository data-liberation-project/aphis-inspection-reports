2.33(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Two bottles of Heparin (one partially used, one unopened) and one partially used tube of Puralube eye lubrication
ointment were found in room 140 at ATRC building that were expired (06/2017 and 05/2016 respectively). In the
refrigerator in the Stallion Barn lab area, a syringe containing a white liquid was unlabeled and undated. Liquids in
unlabeled syringes are not identifiable and may be incorrectly administrated or improperly used. Expired
medications may have compromised efficacy and potency. Use of unlabeled medication or expired drugs may be
harmful or lead to untowards effects or inadequate treatment. The facility needs to ensure that medications are
stored and labeled properly and are not being used past their expiration date. Corrected at time of inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
