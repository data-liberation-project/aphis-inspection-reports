2.132(d)

Procurement of dogs, cats, and other animals; dealers.
Records obtained from the October 2021 exotic animal auction identified the following animals were accepted for sale
from unlicensed customers: one skunk and three kangaroos. Accepting animals from unlicensed individuals does not
allow USDA officials to ensure that the animals’ health and welfare are upheld to the requirements of the AWA. No dealer
shall obtain any wild or exotic animals from any individual who is required to be licensed but who does not hold a current,
valid license. Correct prior to the next auction (Feb 2022).
3.130 Direct Repeat

Watering.
At the time of inspection, USDA Inspectors identified a male capybara with an empty water receptacle. The licensee
offered to refill the animal’s water receptacle and filled it approximately ¾ of the way full. The animal spent approximately
2.5 minutes drinking from the receptacle, and it was approximately ¼ full. Animals with no access to water can have
negative health and welfare consequences. Potable water must be provided as often as necessary for the health and
comfort of the animal and to prevent excessive thirst and dehydration.
3.36(a)(1)

Primary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters.


During the inspection of the warm room, USDA Inspectors identified two guinea pig transport cages that were not
constructed in a manner to withstand the normal rigors of transportation. A blue plastic transport cage containing three
guinea pigs had been accepted by the auction without some sort of covering/lid to the cage. Additionally, a clear plastic
transport cage containing one guinea pig had a cracked portion that had been duct taped together. The lid also had a
cracked section that was partially covered by duct tape. Animals in transport may be injured or killed if cages or carriers
are not of adequate construction and strength to endure the rigors of transport. Animal cages or carriers shall be of
adequate construction and strength to endure the rigors of transport. Correct prior to next auction (Feb 2022).
3.36(a)(5)

Primary enclosures used to transport live guinea pigs and hamsters.
During the inspection of the warm room, USDA Inspectors identified two clear plastic tub transport cages (approximately
33in L X 21in W X 18in H) containing two guinea pigs each. These containers were not manufactured for animal transport
or holding, and someone had drilled approximately 2-3 round holes about 0.5cm in diameter on each of the four sides of
the tub. Lack of adequate ventilation can lead to condensation, heat buildup and over time, air quality issues that may
affect the health and wellbeing of the animals. The licensee shall ensure that an adequate amount of ventilation openings
is present as required per the transportation regulations. Correct prior to next auction (Feb 2022).

Review of records from the previous auction took place on Dec. 1st. Facility inspection took place on Dec. 3rd & 4th with
the auction manager and attending veterinarian. The exit interview was conducted on Dec. 4th with the auction manager.
