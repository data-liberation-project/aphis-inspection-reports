Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
The IACUC is not performing reviews of the facility's program for humane care and use of animals and the animal facilities
every six months. According to the meeting minutes, the last two reviews were dated December 29, 2020 and August 6,
2021. The registrant stated that this delay was due to scheduling conflicts.
Inspection of the animal facilities by the IACUC and review of the program for the humane care and use of animals by the
IACUC are required at least every six months to ensure that any activities involving animals at this facility are being
conducted in a manner to reduce pain and/or distress and they meet the current standards for the species involved.
The IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research facility's
animal facilities, including animal study areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A- Animal Welfare, as a basis for
evaluation. The IACUC must also review the research facility's program for humane care and use of animals, at least
once every six months, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the registrant.
