2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was no program of veterinary care available for review at the time of the inspection. The written program of
veterinary care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the attending veterinarian in
regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. It outlines preventive veterinary care practices, such as
deworming and vaccinations. The facility should ensure that the written program of veterinary care is available for
review during USDA inspections.
This issue was cited previously on July 29, 2014, to be corrected prior to the next inspection.
3.80(a)(2) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On a previous inspection a mongoose was present in the spider monkey enclosure, escaping the enclosure through
a gap between the cement flooring and the section of chain link fencing at the far end of the enclosure. Repairs
have not been made to prevent the entrance of other animals, such as mongoose, to the enclosure. Gaps are still
present around the bottom of the enclosure fencing.
Additionally, the only water for the geriatric spider monkey continues to be a lixit near the floor of the enclosure. The
monkey is geriatric, with a significant tremor, and is recovering from a recent significant illness where he was
moribund for many days, according to staff. The monkey was observed climbing to the bottom of the enclosure with
some difficulty. The plywood den for the monkey is near the top of the enclosure, thus the animal has to descend to
the floor to access water.
Metal structures and the chain link fencing that comprised the enclosure sides were covered in rust and the plywood
den box does not appear to have been sealed, and appears quite soiled. There was a rag attached to the den which
was also soiled and discolored. There was no bedding in the den.
There was a hole in the chainlink fencing above the monkey's nest box, measuring approximately ten inches in
diameter, that provides potential access to the lock-out / entrance area. This hole could be dangerous to themonkey, as he could get caught, or access the exit area of the enclosure.
Primate housing should be constructed and maintained to protect the health and well-being of the animal. Rusted
metal and unsealed wood cannot be adequately cleaned and my pose a health threat to the animal. Water should
be easy to access for the animal to ensure that it can maintain adequate hydration. Failure to drink because the
water source is difficult to access may exacerbate other health problems in addition to causing primary dehydration.
Wildlife entering the enclosure may injure the animal directly or contaminate the enclosure. The facility should
ensure that the primate housing receives regular and timely maintenance, and that this geriatric animal receives
appropriate care to ensure his comfort, and minimize stress.

3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Wire fencing in one corner of the goat enclosure was in disrepair. There was an opening in the fencing large enough
for a goat to stick its head through, where there were sharp wire ends protruding, and posing a risk of injury.
Animals may injure themselves in holes or gaps in fencing and on exposed wire ends. The fencing should be
maintained in good repair in order to protect and contain the animals.

3.127(b) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There was insufficient shelter from rain for one llama in a pasture. The only shelter was from trees, which may
provide shade, but not sufficient shelter form rain.
Heavy and prolonged periods of rain can be expected in the Hawaiian islands. The inability to take shelter from the
rain may adversely affect the health and comfort of animals. The facility should ensure that sufficient shelter is
provided to the animals in order to protect them from rain.

A thorough exit interview was conducted with animal care facility representatives on 1/28/15.
