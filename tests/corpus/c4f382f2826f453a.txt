2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During today'(cid:25)s inspection, a tube of Dia Gel was found in a medicinal cabinet located in the whelping building. The
Licensee stated that the Veterinarian had given him the tube for an animal that had loose stool. However; the bottle
is labeled for the use in equine with no additional guidance on the tube from the veterinarian. The Licensee does
not currently have any additional documentation to reflect the appropriate use of this medication on Dogs. Improper
use of medications can cause the medication to be ineffective or could potentially cause death to the animal if given
an improper over dose. Although this tube of medication was disposed of during the inspection, the Licensee must
ensure that he has all appropriate documentation from a veterinarian for the use of all medications that are not
labeled for the specific use on dogs. In addition, he must have guidance on proper administration; dosage,
frequency, routine of administration, etc.
