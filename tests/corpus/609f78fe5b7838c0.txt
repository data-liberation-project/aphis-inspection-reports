FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the primary enclosure containing 6 llamas there was a shed with a tin roof that was pitting and lifting in some
areas which allows leaking and is in disrepair. Adjacent to that there was another shed with a tin roof with sharp
edges that could potentially harm an animal if it were to run into it. Midway on the west side of the llama's primary
enclosure there was an extension of the fence made of cow panel that had pointy ends that an animal could also
run into it and potentially harm themselves. The outdoor facilities must be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals that are contained within. Correct by 7/13/2017
