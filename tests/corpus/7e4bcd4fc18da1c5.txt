Facilities, outdoor.
The new back gate, which is a section of the property perimeter fence, is only 5 feet in height. The space between the
rungs in the gate range between 7-9 inches and a 9 inch gap exists between the ground and the bottom of the left panel
of the gate. The gap and the spacing between rungs are wide enough for unwanted animals to easily pass through or
under the gate. The height of the fence is insufficient to keep the public from entering the property during times when the
zoo is closed. The perimeter fences must be at least six feet and designed in a manner that prevents people and animals
from going under it or through it and having contact with the animals during non-exhibition times. Modifications must be
made to the gate that would increase the height to six (6) feet and reduce the size of the spacing between rungs and the
gap to restrict the entry of unwanted animals and unauthorized persons. Correct by January 22, 2021

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
An appropriate environmental enhancement plan is being followed as directed by a former attending veterinarian.
However, the current plan has not been reviewed and directed by the new attending veterinarian. The facility attending
veterinarian must be a part of the development of the plan to ensure all social and psychological needs of the squirrel
monkey and the capuchin are met. An environment enhancement plan, to include the environmental enrichment and


special considerations for the single housed non-human primates, must be directed by the current attending veterinarian
and documented. Correct by January 29, 2021.
