3.81(a)(1)
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There is a singly housed capuchin ("Woody") at the facility. Due to advanced age and aggression towards other
non-human primates, there have been failed attempts to pair house "Woody" with other non-human primates at the
facility. The written environmental enrichment plan had not been updated and approved by the attending
veterinarian to address the need of housing "Woody" singly due to advanced age and aggressive behavior. The
written environmental enrichment plan should be updated and reviewed by the attending veterinarian to address the
specific needs of this animal.
