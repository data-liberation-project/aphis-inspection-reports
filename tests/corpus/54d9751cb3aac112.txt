MISCELLANEOUS.
There was no one available during business hours to allow APHIS Officials to enter and inspect the facilities,
property, records, and animals on18-JUL-17 at 10:30.The former department chair stated that both of the faculty
members for the program were not available for inspection. These two are the representatives with the most
knowledge of as well as access to the records needed for inspection. Without at least one of them, the inspection
will be incomplete. No animals are currently being housed at the facility and no animal use activities are currently
being conducted.
Without access to conduct the inspection, regulatory oversight is impossible. Correct by ensuring a facility
representative is available during normal business hours, and alert your site inspector as to any scheduling conflicts
where inspection will not be possible.
Correct from this time forward.
