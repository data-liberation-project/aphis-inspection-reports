Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
There was an excessive congregation of bees on and around the fruit for the lemur. The presence of these insects on the
food may affect the wholesomeness of the food and pose a health risk directly to the animal (bee stings). Licensees must
establish and maintain an effective pest control program so as to promote the health and wellbeing of the animals and
reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.

The wooden platform in the red fox enclosure was well-worn and showed evidence of deterioration at the center of the
resting spot. The weakened area can give way and pose an entrapment risk to the animal contained in the enclosure. The
outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury.
