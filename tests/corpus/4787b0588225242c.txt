Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The attending veterinarian (AV) employed under formal arrangements had not been scheduled for quarterly visits as
written in the program of veterinary care. The last documented facility review occurred July 2, 2020 as seen on the
Veterinary Checklist to be Performed Quarterly document that is a written component of the program of veterinary care.
The AV was contacted by the inspector on April 28, 2021 and confirmed that July 2, 2020 was the last time she completed
a facility review which was over nine months ago. The visit before July 2020, the AV confirmed was on January 30, 2020.

Regularly scheduled quarterly visits and facility reviews by the AV help ensure that the facility is addressing parasite
control, emergency care, proper euthanasia methods, diet requirements, handling of biologics and drugs, pest control and
product safety, quarantine procedures, air quality, facility conditions, animal husbandry practices and other observations
made by the AV where professional consultation is needed.

Each dealer shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal arrangements. In the case of a part-time attending
veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care and
regularly scheduled visits to the premises of the dealer.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
