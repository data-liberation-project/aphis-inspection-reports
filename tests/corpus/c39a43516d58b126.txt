ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:10 PM on
06-Sep-17.
After arriving at the facility, the inspector knocked on the front door of the residence. The inspector spoke to an
occupant who stated that the licensees were not home. The licensee told the inspector on the phone that they were
not in the area and unable to accompany us for the inspection process. The inspectors waited at the property for 30
minutes.
