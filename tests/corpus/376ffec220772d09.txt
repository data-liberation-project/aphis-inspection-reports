2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Since the previous inspection report records of animal births and deaths were not maintained for the guinea pigs. In
addition, there were no sale records present for animals recently sold. Records need to be maintained on guinea pig
births, deaths, and animals purchased and sold. Sale records must include the name and address of the buyer, the
date of sale, and the number of guinea pigs in the shipment. Records must be maintained to document changes in
ownership, keep track of animals, and to help assess the animal care program.
Remains uncorrected.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner's wife.
