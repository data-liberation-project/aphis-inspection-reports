ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Section 3.81 Environment enhancement: The two owl monkeys acquired in 2014 are not included on the facility's
plan for environment enhancement. The environment enhancement plan is to promote psychological well-being of
the nonhuman primates and to help prevent stereotypic behavior from developing. The facility must develop,
document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to promote the psychological
well-being of owl monkeys. The plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted professional standards as
cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending veterinarian. This
plan must be made available to APHIS upon request.
