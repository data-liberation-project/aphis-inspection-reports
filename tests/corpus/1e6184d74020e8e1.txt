3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Carpet squares in four enclosures in the small dog sheltered building (including whelping cages with puppies) were
worn and unraveling along the edges with long strings dangling from carpet edges. Strings hanging from rugs can
become wrapped around the legs of puppies causing pain, injury or even amputation. This licensee must ensure
that housing facilities for dogs be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. They must be kept
in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, This includes safe enclosure spaces including carpet
squares.
3.3(d)
SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
One enclosure in the small dog sheltered building is currently housing seven small breed dogs. By the inspectors'
observation, there was not enough room for all seven dogs to occupy the indoor area at the same time and have the
ability to make normal postural adjustments. Inability to access the indoor portion of the sheltered building can result
in discomfort as some of the dogs will be exposed to the elements. Dogs and cats must be provided with adequate
shelter from the elements at all times to protect their health and well-being. The shelter structures must be large
enough to allow each animal to sit, stand, and lie in a normal manner and to turn about freely. Corrected at time of
inspection.
3.4(b)(4) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
Two outdoor enclosures housing a total of four dogs do not have bedding in the shelter structures. These dogs were
in these enclosures last night. At the time of inspection (approximately 10 am), the inspector's Kestrel thermometer
registered the ambient temperature at 51.6 degrees F. However, when searching for the licensee's zip code in
noaa.gov, the recorded low temperature last night was 35 degrees F. Lack of bedding in cold weather can result in
dogs that cannot maintain a safe body temperature and is uncomfortable. The licensee must ensure that outdoor
shelter structures contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees F. Additional
clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees F or lower.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
