3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the upper enclosure housing 2 adult coyotes named "Luna" and "Chewy, along the bottom left side of wall is
multiple areas of broken stucco with exposed chicken wire. The inner fence along the left side of the enclosure is
rolled inward with multiple broken wires protruding towards the animals. These areas are not in good repair and the
animals could potentially become injured.
Along the backside of the outdoor enclosure housing 2 adult mountain lions named "True" and "Zia" the upper fence
extension is no longer securely attached to the primary fence. This is creating multiple gaps at the junction of the
two fences. These gaps are large enough that if an animal climbs or jumps on the fence, it could reach through the
gap and injure itself or potentially escape.
Construct and maintain all facilities so that they are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from
injuries.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with a facility representative.
