***Inspection and Exit interview was conducted with the Applicant, Applicant’s Husband, Applicant’s Son and Animal
Care Inspector Shannon Sebera.
The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on 9/6/2016.
