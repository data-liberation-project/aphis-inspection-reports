3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
Several enclosures had areas where there was an accumulation of feces greater than the surrounding substrate.
The licensee stated that the enclosures were cleaned weekly but were not being sanitized every two weeks as
required. Cleaning and sanitation of the enclosures and associated receptacles are important to prevent disease
and discomfort in the animals. Correct by ensuring primary enclosures are cleaned and sanitized often enough to
prevent an accumulation of excreta or debris and that such enclosures are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks by
washing all soiled surfaces with a detergent solution followed by a safe and effective disinfectant. To be corrected
by: 21 December 2015 and from that point forward.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
