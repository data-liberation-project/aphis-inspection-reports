2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
This is a search inspection.
The facility was previously licensed but the license was cancelled on Nov. 4, 2013. The store's website currently
lists several exotics including monkeys, exotic felines, kinkajous and exotic pocket pets for sale. Today there are
marmosets, a kinkajou and short-tail oppossums housed in enclosures in the store. An Animal Welfare Act license
is required to conduct regulated activities such as selling or exhibiting exotic animals. The facility needs to obtain a
USDA Animal Welfare Act license to conduct regulated activity or needs to discontinue regulated activity. Correct
from this day forward.
Facility has an application packet on hand.

Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
