ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee has had continual tooth issues and a ringworm problem in the facility since 2013 that was documented
by the attending veterinarian in the treatment log. The veterinarian had requested multiple times that dental care be
provided to the dogs, however the licensee failed to comply. There were 2 dogs with severe ringworm (#564 and
#563) both F, Yorkie, blk/bro that had multiple patches of hair loss, resulting in thick skinned areas on the back and
top of the head. The licensee failed to comply with the veterinarians treatment program by not treating the animals
with the medicine as directed. The directions were to treat at least 2 time per week for several weeks until the
condition was clear, however the licensee was inconsistent with the treatments of only 1 per week and it was not
done for the full term to clear the fungus, so the condition kept returning.
It is important that all licensees follow their program of veterinary care as it is written by their attending veterinarian.
The licensee must comply with the veterinarians directions on what treatments to provide, medicines, dosages and
treatment regime in order to be in compliance with this regulation. The attending veterinarian can only assure proper
treatment of the regulated animals if their guidelines and treatment program are followed exactly as they are given.
Failure to follow the veterinarians treatment program can lead to additional pain and discomfort for the animal,
spreading of a contagious condition and the possibility of a treatable condition becoming chronic or even fatal
depending on the issue.
The licensee must follow the attending veterinarians treatment program as it is discussed and written at the time.
Full dosages and treatment times must be adhered to and the primary veterinarian should be consulted if there are
any problems or concerns during that time.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were multiple dogs with serious tooth issues in the facility that had not been treated by the veterinarian or
owner. Throughout the inspection several dogs were identified with grade 3-4 (1-4 scale) of tarter buildup to thepoint of being in a solid row or where the teeth were unable to be seen at all, red/irritated gums with some drooling
or loose and missing. teeth. There were two dogs that had eye issues that need to be treated.
The dogs considered under a ***DIRECT*** are:
...#365, F, Yorkie, blk/bro, (9-10) with heavy drooling, 2 deformed molars, very loose almost fell out after examining
mouth, heavy dark brown tarter on 2 canines, rest of the teeth are missing, red irritated gums.
...#375, M, Maltese white, (9-10) with large buildup of brown tarter, resulting in thick plates on all teeth where the
tooth could not be seen on some.

***INDIRECT****
...#496, F, Yorkie, blk/bro with bulbs of brown tarter buildup on all molars,
....#275, F, Chihuahua, bro/wht had buildup of tarter on canines and molars with some red on gums, and very long
nails on front and back feet, some over 1 inch in length.
...#71, F, Maltese, white had heavy buildup of brown tarter on canines and all molars
...#482, F, Yorkie, blk/bro, had both eyes surrounded by a thick crust of eye discharge and matter, resulting in red
irritated eyes with some green mucus in the corners. Nails were long up to 1 inch.
The licensee has been aware of the teeth issues since at least October of 2013, however there has not been any
veterinary care provided to work on any dental care issues in this facility. It was documented in the treatment log by
the attending veterinarian since October 2013 that there were teeth issues that needed to be corrected, however the
owner had not attended to this issue for any of the dogs. The nails had not been trimmed and are very long on the
majority of dogs in the kennel with some up to 1 inch in length.
It is imperative that all regulated animals are checked daily for any injuries or health issues, and that regular
monitoring of dental status is being conducted in order to prevent gum disease and heavy tarter buildup which can
cause tooth problems, irritation and health issues. Any loose or broken teeth need to be treated according to theveterinarians direction as soon as possible in order to decrease the amount of pain and discomfort to the animal.
The licensee must maintain a program of dental care for all regulated animals under the direction of the
veterinarian. If the veterinarian advises that dental care should be performed on the animals, the licensee must work
with the veterinarian to provide that care.
During the inspection the licensee had the primary veterinarian treat 3 animals (#315, #32 and #365) that resulted in
multiple teeth being pulled and scraping off of any tarter on the remaining teeth. #275 was looked at and the
veterinarian wanted to give some time for a chlorhexodine treatment, before scraping the heavy tarter due to the
damage it may cause at this time. The licensee is now starting a water/chlorhexodine program to assist with dental
care.
The licensee must go through the entire facility and record the dental rating for all dogs and work with the
veterinarian on a dental care program and show continual progress over time that the dogs teeth are being
monitored and treated as needed.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The majority of the back walls, door flaps, and walk ways surrounding the doors of the 'Dry building' have an
accumulation of brown grime and dirt that has not been cleaned from those surfaces. While the licensee does
sanitize(once/2weeks) and clean the primary enclosures according to regulation on a daily basis, there is not proper
scrubbing and cleaning of hard surfaces including the walls, door flaps and water pipes to rid them of the built up
brown grime that accumulates over time.
The accumulation of grime and dirt on the hard surfaces of the primary enclosures can provide an area for disease,
fungus and other health issues to survive and possibly infect or continue to infect the animals in the facility.
All surfaces that come in contact with the regulated animals must be kept clean and free of excess dirt and grime,
as only those surfaces can be properly sanitized.
