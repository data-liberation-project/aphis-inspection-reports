2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:45pm to
1:15pm on 09/17/2014.
I knocked on the door and no one answered so I called the number on file and left a message to notify I was there
to do an inspection and requested that the registrant call me once the message is received.
