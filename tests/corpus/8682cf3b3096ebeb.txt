*** The refrigerator storing non human primate diet as well as other animal diets needs to be replaced. The shelf on
the inside is cracked, the freezer is not working properly with ice accumulating on the freezer. The fridge is rusted

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
*** The facility has recently acquired a 6 month old ring tail lemur. The animal is housed alone with no access to
another non human primate. The animal was engaging in abnormal behavior of sucking its paw repeatedly. While
this could be a self soothing behavior if not addressed it could lead to self damaging behaviors and become
stereotypic in nature. The facility has a written enrichment plan that mentions additional training time with caretakers
but the plan does not address the abnormal behavior the animal is already engaging in. This needs to be addressed
for the long term psychological welfare of the animal.
