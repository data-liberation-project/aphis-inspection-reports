3.14(e)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
At time of inspection two transport enclosures, one housing four Great Dane puppies and the second two
Dobermans and two Great Dane puppies, did not provide adequate space to turn about normally while standing, to
stand sit erect, and to lie in a natural position. The puppies could not move in the enclosure without stepping on
each other or lie down. Licensee shall ensure that all primary enclosures used to transport live dogs are large
enough to ensure that each animal contained in the primary enclosure has enough space to turn about normally
while standing, to stand and sit erect, and lie in a natural position.
