2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
*** Currently there is no barrier around the beaver exhibit to prevent access to the beaver in the children's zoo.At
the time of the inspection, the beaver was on land next to the fence and the inspector could have reached over and
had access to the animal. A barrier of sufficient distance should be on the public side of the exhibit to prevent public
contact and for the safety of the animal.

WATER QUALITY.
*** The water quality for the sea lion pool needs to be addressed. For over a month, the coliform count has
exceeded 1,000 MPN. The facility is doing a backwash weekly to try and address the issue but even with the
backwash the counts are still over 1,000 MPN. In addition due to the lab being off site to test the water, the facility
has not been doing subsequent samples. The facility needs to take more aggressive steps to determine why the
water quality is poor and not being corrected through the current filtration system. This needs to be addressed for
the health of the animals.
