3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One of the whelping boxes in the sheltered housing structure had been chewed previously and there was worn,
ragged edges present with chipped paint. Exposed and irregular wood surfaces cannot be adequately sanitized and
need to be maintained so that they can be properly sanitized since bacteria can stick to and grow on these surfaces
and increase the chance of exposure and transmission of disease. These must be replaced or repaired when
worn. All surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis. Surfaces of housing facilities--including houses, dens,
and other furniture-type fixtures and objects within the facility--that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be
replaced when worn or soiled.

3.1(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was an opened and folded over bag of puppy food on the floor of the whelping building. Open bags of food
can become contaminated and can attract pests if not stored properly. All opened supplies of food must be stored
in leak-proof containers with tightly fitted lids.
3.4(b)(4)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In two of the dog shelters in the outdoor enclosures located on west side, there were minimal wood chips present
and much of the surface was bare. The temperature at time of inspection was 38.0 degrees F as read from
inspector's Kestrel and the temperature last night was researched in licensee's zip code to have been 24 degrees F
on NOAA.gov.
Not enough bedding to keep sufficiently warm can lead to stress that causes a weakened immune system,
hypothermia, possible frost bite and even death.
Licensee must ensure that outdoor shelter structures contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambienttemperature is below 50 degrees F. Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 degrees F
or lower.

3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
There is still at least one metal "self-feeder" that has a buildup of old food residue and grime on the interior in
contact with the fresh food. Dirty food receptacles can contaminate the food and affect the nutritive value of the
food . If self-feeders are used, the licensee must keep them clean and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 b.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Excreta covered approximately one-third of the outdoor section of the sheltered whelping enclosure. According to
the facility representative this was last cleaned two day ago. Accumulation of excreta can soil the dogs, increase
disease transmission, and attract flies and other pests. Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary
enclosures on a daily basis or more often to prevent the soiling of the dogs in the enclosure.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representative.
