3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Rust was observed in three outdoor enclosures. In all three enclosures, the pipes running along the bottom of the
front of the enclosures have rust that is eating through parts of these pipes. Rust doesn't allow for the enclosures to
be properly sanitized. In addition if the rust eats through the bottoms pipes on those three enclosures any further, it
may weaken the fencing or provide a gap for the dogs in those enclosures to be able to escape. The rusted
surfaces on these outdoor enclosures needs to be repaired or replaced so the surfaces can be easily cleaned and
sanitized and to ensure that no dogs escape from their enclosures.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
