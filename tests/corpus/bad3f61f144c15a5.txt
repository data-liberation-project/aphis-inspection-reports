2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male Yorkshire terrier (ID #168) was observed to have difficulty trying to sit on a piece of carpet in his enclosure.
Physical inspection of the dog revealed that he has a very thin body condition. The dog's shoulder blades, ribs, hip
bones, and spinal column were easily felt with little body fat covering them. The dog's front teeth and the canine
teeth have a brown/tan colored material covering the majority of their surface. There is a grey, creamy substance
along the gum line of all the teeth. The front teeth and the canine teeth on both sides of the mouth are loose. A
front tooth on the right side of the mouth was easily moved when touched by the inspector. The licensee stated
that he had been giving the dog medicine, but it has not been evaluated by a veterinarian recently.
A female Yorkshire terrier (ID #069) was observed scratching the right side of her body. Physical inspection of the
dog revealed red abrasions/wounds along her side behind her right shoulder. The area containing the abrasions is
mostly hairless and there is some dried blood stuck in the remaining hair. Some of the abrasions appear moist and
reddened and those closer to the shoulder have a dark crust across them. The skin in the area is slightly reddened.
The licensee said that he had not noticed this dog's condition. The dog's cheek teeth on both sides of the mouth
are almost completely covered in a thick dark grey/brown material. There is a grey creamy substance along the
gum line.

Difficulty sitting and poor body condition can be an indication of an underlying health issue and also a sign of pain or
discomfort in the animal. Scratching, hair loss and abrasions can also be an indication of pain and discomfort as
well as an underlying health problem. Poor dental health can also cause pain and discomfort to the dog and lead to
further health complications. The licensee must have the above mentioned dogs evaluated by a licensed
veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented and
available to the inspectors upon request. The licensee must ensure that all dogs receive adequate veterinary care
at all times.
3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.There are several enclosures throughout the facility that are not structurally sound.
The outdoor portion of the enclosures is constructed of wire. One upper enclosure, containing one dog, has gate
that is slightly open and lacks any way to latch it shut. The licensee managed to wedge the gate closed but there is
a large gap in the wire that the dog could stick its snout or leg through. Inside the building there is one enclosure,
containing two young adult dogs, which has an opening cut into the wire gate and contains a feeder. The feeder is
much smaller than the opening resulting in a large gap that the dogs were seen sticking their snouts and faces
through. Gaps in the wire could cause a dog to become entrapped and can result in injury to the dog. Gates that
are not securely latched may allow the dog to escape or fall from the enclosure.
Another upper enclosure, containing one dog, has no gate at all. Lack of a gate does not allow for the enclosure to
securely and safely contain the animal. The dog could escape or fall from the enclosure.
Inside the building there is a partition between two enclosures that has become loose at one end and is leaning into
one of the enclosures. The partition could collapse resulting in injury to the dogs. There are two dogs housed in the
affected enclosures.
Failure to maintain structurally sound enclosures can lead to animal injury or escape. Housing facilities for dogs
must be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound. The licensee must repair or alter the affected
enclosures in a manner that keeps them safe for the dogs and structurally sound. The licensee must ensure that all
enclosures are kept in good repair, protect the animals from injury, contain the animals securely and restrict other
animals from entering.
3.1(b) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Within the kennel room of the building there is a buildup of hair, dust, and debris under the enclosures, on the rack
holding the hose, and along the lower portion of the enclosures. At the far end of the kennel room the last
enclosure on the right side has a buildup of hair, dust and debris on one side of it.
Failure to keep the housing area neat and clean can be a health hazard to the dogs. The licensee must remove the
buildup of dirt, debris and hair in the housing area in order to promote the health and well-being of the animals.
3.6(a)(2)(1) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The sharp ends of screws are sticking through the partitions at the level of the dogs in at least four enclosurescontaining four adult dogs and nine puppies. There are two enclosures, containing two adult dogs and three
puppies, which have a metal feeder. The front edge of the metal feeders has broken resulting in sharp points and
edges. In the outdoor portion of one enclosure, containing one dog, there is a broken wire that has bent inward at
the level of the dog. Sharp points and edges can cause injury to the dogs.
Primary enclosures must be free of sharp points and edges that could injure the dogs. The licensee must remove
all the sharp points/edges or alter them in a manner that eliminates the injury risk to the dogs. The licensee must
ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
In the last enclosure on the left side there is a self-feeder containing moldy food. The mold has encased a section
of food that covers over half the cup space along the front of the cup. Fresh food is surrounding the mold and sitting
on top of it. There is one adult dog with access to this feeder. Moldy food can negatively affect the health of the
dog as well as contaminate any fresh food put in the feeder.
All food receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks, or more often if necessary, to
prevent the buildup of dirt, debris and disease hazards. Measures must be taken to ensure that there is no molding,
deterioration, or caking of the feed. The licensee must provide this dog with a clean self-feeder containing fresh
food that is free of mold or any other contaminates. The licensee must ensure that all food is wholesome and
uncontaminated at all times.
Correction date: The licensee removed and replaced the self-feeder containing the moldy food at the time of the
inspection.
