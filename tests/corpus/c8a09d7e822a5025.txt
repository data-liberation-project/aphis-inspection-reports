2.126(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility had a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection at 12:30p.m. on 12/19/2016.
Upon arrival, we knocked on the door and received no answer. We then called Ms. Leo and made contact, she
agreed to come outside of the house and meet with us. Immediately after stepping outside Ms. Leo indicated that
should would not allow for an inspection because of the police officers that were accompanying the inspection team.
We explained to Ms. Leo that the officers were present for all parties involved and not just our safety. She indicated
that they were there for only us. She then refused inspection again when asked. At that time she turned away from
us, walked into the house and shut the door.
Repeated refusal to allow APHIS officials to enter a facility in order to inspect regulated species and other
potentially regulated animals is a serious violation of the Animal Welfare Act. Access must be granted to any
facilities as deemed necessary by APHIS officials in order to enforce the provisions of the AWA regulations and
standards, including but not limited to animal housing areas, procedure areas, transportation conveyances, holding
areas, or other auxiliary areas related to the care or use of regulated species. In addition records may be examined
and copied as needed and photographs taken of the facilities and animals as APHIS officials consider necessary.
Veterinary Medical Officer, Michael Neafsey and Investigator from Investigative Enforcement Services, Kevin
Isenhart were present at the time of this refused inspection.
