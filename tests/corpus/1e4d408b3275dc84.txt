2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
**The teeth of three dogs were examined during this inspection as well as the previous inspection. No treatment had
been provided since the last inspection. A male Yorkshire terrier (m/c#494-151-7460) had few teeth remaining, but
there was a buildup of a hard, brown substance on the teeth he did have. A female Maltese (m/c# 095 627 602)
had a buildup of a hard, greenish-brown substance on her teeth that was so thick that all the individual teeth could
not be seen. A female Yorkshire terrier (m/c# 091 312 883) had a severe buildup of hard brown material on her
teeth; her gums were reddened along her teeth. Teeth and gum problems can be painful, can affect the animal's
ability to eat, and can result in tooth loss. The licensee stated that none of the dogs had received dental care in
two years even though the Attending Veterinarian had noted that 42 dogs needed dental cleaning on his last visit to
the facility. The licensee must establish an effective program of dental maintenance and care. The licensee shall
provide adequate veterinary care and by having these animals evaluated and treated accordingly by a licensed
veterinarian.

***Several dogs were noted during the last inspection for excessively long toenails. While it appeared that a portion
of the long nails had been removed, each of the dogs still had excessively long nails on a portion of their digits: a
female Beagle (m/c# 4812710C39), a female Beagle named Biscuit (no other ID), a female Maltese (m/c# 095 627
602), and a female Maltese (m/c# 050304787). Excessively long toenails can become entrapped and torn or can
result in abnormally positioned toes, which is painful. The licensee must establish an effective program of toenail
maintenance.
A focused inspection and exit briefing was conducted with the licensee and VMO Konnie Plumlee on August 25,
2015. This inspection was limited to both direct and indirect non-compliant items 2.40(b)(2), 3.3 (c) , and 3.11 (c)
found during a routine inspection on August 3,2015. The adult female Beagle (m/c# 4812710C39) had been seen
by a veterinarian, treated and her condition was improving. Both lights in the sheltered building were working and
the licensee had removed the tall grass and weeds in the outdoor enclosures.Additional Inspectors
