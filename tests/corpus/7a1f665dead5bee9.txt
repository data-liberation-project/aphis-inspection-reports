2.31(d)(1)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC approved Protocol # 1-13 has conflicting language that a procedure used is no more than momentary
distress but also describes using 2 ferrets in a distressful procedure that is alleviated by appropriate anesthetics. A
review of the 2013 annual report by the facility shows that these animals were reported in column D. The principle
investigator did not provide a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that
alternatives were not available for the distressful procedure in the protocol submitted to the IACUC for approval.
This does not allow for adequate oversight by the IACUC. Update protocol #1-13 to include a written narrative
description of the methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available to the distressful
procedure or clarify that these procedures cause no more than momentary pain or distress. Correct by: 9 April 2014.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
End of report.
