RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
The records of sales/donation/exchange or transfer need to be made out fully. Four records need to be completed
in full as they are lacking required information. The full address of the buyer is needed for one and the USDA
numbers or Driver's License numbers are needed for the others.
All the above need to be completed and provided on the next inspection.
Correct by: 08-31-17.
