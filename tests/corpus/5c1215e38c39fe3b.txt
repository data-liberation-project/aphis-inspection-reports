SEPARATION.
On September 1st, 2019, an incident occurred that resulted in 3 goats and 11 sheep being housed in the same
enclosure as 3 black bears. The facility did not confirm that the bears had shifted to a new enclosure before putting
the sheep and goats into the bear enclosure. The facility did not identify that the sheep and goats were in the same
enclosure as the bears for approximately 7 hours until a concerned guest called the facility office. Upon receipt of
the call, the facility immediately removed the sheep and goats from the bear enclosure. While no sheep nor goats
were harmed in this incident, the potential for distress, injury, or death is high when large omnivorous predators,
such as bears are co-housed with small prey hoofstock, such as goats and sheep. The facility maintains
responsibility for ensuring all animals housed together are compatible and that health and comfort are not negatively
impacted by nearby animals. To be corrected from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
