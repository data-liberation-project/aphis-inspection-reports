2.40(b)(2)
***An adult female Bulldog named Bonnie Sue (m/c# 4A25001D79) had died since the previous inspection.
According to the veterinarian(cid:25)s records, the licensee noticed a discharge from the vulva on August 7, 2014 that
worsened over time. The licensee stated that she administered a single shot of penicillin on August 18. The dog
was taken to the veterinarian on August 19 and he noted a bloody purulent discharge from the vulva. His diagnosis
was pyometra and he sent antibiotics home with the licensee for the dog. The dog died on August 23, 2014 without
the licensee seeking any further consultation with the veterinarian. Delayed treatment for a medical condition can
result in worsening of the condition. The licensee must seek timely veterinary care for sick or injured animals and
must notify the veterinarian when the prescribed treatment is not improving the condition.
***An adult, female Bulldog named Diamond T (m/c# 9410609) had areas of hair loss scattered over her back.
Also, there was an area of dry, crusty skin on her abdomen with streaks of reddened, swollen skin. A kennel
caretaker stated that they had treated the dog previously for the condition and it had improved, but began getting
worse after the treatment had been stopped. The dog was not currently on medication and the licensee had not
consulted a veterinarian when the condition began to worsen. Skin conditions can be painful and hair loss can
indicate an underlying medical condition. The licensee was verbally instructed to have this dog examined by a
veterinarian by close of business on August 29, 2014.
***An adult, female Bulldog named J.D. (m/c# 94100013318463) had two quarter-sized areas on her head in front
of her left ear that were missing hair. The skin was reddened and oozing a clear substance. The licensee stated
that she was not aware of the lesions and no treatment was being provided. Skin conditions can be painful, can
progress rapidly, and can be an indication of an underlying medical problem. The licensee was verbally instructed
to have this dog examined by a veterinarian by close of business on August 29, 2014.
***Four adult Bulldogs (Robbie #OAO1889607, Thumper #4B1F5D4310, Joanie #941000133854, and Diamond T
#9410609) had excessively long toenails. The toenails were curved backward, causing the outer toes to be placed
in an abnormal position when the dog stood. Excessively long toenails can be painful by forcing the toes into an
unnatural position and can result in injury. The licensee must trim the nails on these dogs and must establish a
maintenance program for all dogs in the kennel. 3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.1 (c) Surfaces(3) Cleaning
There was a thick, brown grime on at least 5 of the metal dog doors of the sheltered facility housing adult dogs.
Sufficient cleaning and sanitization reduces disease risks and is an important aspect of animal husbandry. The
licensee shall spot clean all hard surfaces that come into contact with the animals, daily and sanitize accordingly to
prevent a build-up of grime.
3.1(e) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.1 (e) Storage
There were roaches living inside the gray plastic tote used to store adult dog food. The licensee had a lid on the tote
however, roaches were able to fit through the space in between the lid and tote. Roaches can spread disease and
have contaminated the food intended for the adult dogs at the facility. The licensee shall ensure all open supplies of
food are kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and spoilage.
3.9(b)
FEEDING.
3.9 (b)
The outdoor housing area for adult dogs had at least 8 metal food pans containing dry food mixed with standing
water. The wet food was attracting flies. The mister system used to cool the environment for the dogs was spraying
directly into some of the pans. Additionally, it had rained prior to the inspection which added additional water to the
pans containing dog food. The licensee feeds once a day and the dog food provided each morning is intended for
consumption through out the day. Eighteen of the metal pans used as food receptacles are rusted and have a rough
surface. Food that is not protected from the elements can become contaminated and may become undesirable to
the dogs. Wet dog food attracts pests such as flies. Rusted food receptacles do not allow proper cleaning and
santization. The licensee shall provide food receptacles that are located so as to minimize contamination by pests,
and be protected from the mist water and rain. Feeding pans must either be made of a durable material that can be
easily cleaned and sanitized or be disposable. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 9/4/2014

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
3.11 (d) Pest control
* There were still roaches crawling along the walls of the indoor portion of the whelping facility.There were also
roaches inside the plastic tote containing adult dog food. ** There was also an abundance of flies both inside the adult sheltered building and in the outdoor housing areas.
Pests such as roaches and flies can contaminate food and spread disease. The licensee shall incorporate an
effective pest control method to remove the roaches and the flies from the facility.
This inspection was conducted with the licensee. An exit briefing was conducted at the close of the inspection on
8/27/2014 and during the report delivery on 8/28/2014.
* The adult, white, female Chihuahua identified during the last inspection was seen by the attending veterinarian
and has been removed from the facility. Additionally, the two dogs identified with matted hair coats had received
grooming and were no longer matted.
