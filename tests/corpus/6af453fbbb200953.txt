Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
***At approximately 12:00pm USDA observed a ringtail lemur crossing a tree limb in the lemur enclosure. The lemur was
walking on three limbs and not bearing any weight on his right hindlimb. The lemur traveled the entire distance without
extending the limb or bearing weight on it. The licensee stated that he did not know the lemur was limping and that the
keepers had not yet notified him of the lemurs condition. He could not say if the staff had already been to that enclosure
for the day but he does not require them to communicate this type of observation until they are through with their work at
the end of the day. Untimely communication of issues of animal health and wellbeing delays treatment that may be
required and can lead to unnecessary suffering or worsening of conditions. An Adequate program of veterinary care
requires that there is a mechanism of direct and frequent communication so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian; A means of timely
communication of problems concerning animal health and well being including the timely communication with the
attending veterinarian shall be put in place to ensure the animals are provided veterinary care in a timely manner.

Contingency planning.


***There is no written contingency plan. A plan to provide for the humane handling, treatment, transportation, housing,
and care of their animals in the event of an emergency or disaster (one which could reasonably be anticipated and
expected to be detrimental to the good health and well-being of the animals in their possession), must be developed and
maintained. The plan shall be made available to USDA Officials for review during inspection.

Facilities, general.
The dig barrier around the enclosure for the fossa is approximately 30 inches wide and runs the length of the enclosure
walls. On the front and right side of the enclosure the dirt beneath the dig barrier has washed out or eroded leaving the
chain-link dig barrier exposed and raised with gaps between the barrier and the dirt. These gaps create a safety hazard
that may allow the fossa to become injured when running or crosses over it. The dirt or substrate shall be filled in or other
means of correction provided to sufficiently bury the wire and/or prevent the fossa from exposure, thereby reducing the
safety hazard and protecting the fossa from possible injury.
