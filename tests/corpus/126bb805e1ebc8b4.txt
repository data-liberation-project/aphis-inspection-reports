ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The facility has a written program of veterinary care however, it is incomplete. A young domestic cat is currently
living in the store, roaming free and interacting with other regulated animals on the premises. Staff provided proof of
some vaccinations, however the program of veterinary care does not list vaccinations, parasite treatment or control,
euthanasia method or any other provisions for veterinary care for cats.
The program of veterinary care should be completed by the attending veterinarian to accurately reflect the practices
at this facility for domestic cats. The written program will ensure that there is communication between the licensee
and the attending veterinarian and ensure that all routine medications and vaccines provided to the animal by the
licensee are done with the direction and knowledge of the attending veterinarian.
2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown and white lop eared rabbit housed in a primary enclosure with other rabbits is very thin, with prominent and
easily palpable spinal vertebrae. The rabbit exhibited very little movement in the enclosure during this inspection
and was not observed eating or drinking. The skin in the neck area tented and did not return to normal position
indicating possible clinical dehydration. The rabbit appears lethargic, dehydrated and underweight with poor body
condition.
The rabbit has not been examined or treated by a veterinarian. Poor body condition, lethargy and dehydration can
indicate a serious medical condition. The rabbit must be examined and treated as directed by a veterinarian. This
non-compliance was corrected prior to the completion of this inspection by the rabbit receiving veterinary care.
3.25(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During this inspection the cat living in the store "Harambe" jumped into an open top enclosure containing guineapigs and was seen defecating in the bedding. Contamination of the guinea pig enclosure with cat feces could pose
a health risk to the animals. Housing facilities for guinea pigs should restrict the entrance of other animals. The cat
should be prevented from entering regulated animal enclosures. Correct by: July 3, 2017.
3.55 DIRECT
WATERING.
A primary enclosure housing multiple lionhead rabbits had no available water for the animals. Three water bottles
were attached to the inside walls of the enclosure but all three were empty. Store personnel filled the bottles with
water and replaced them in the enclosure. Two rabbits drank immediately, greedily and consistently upon
presentation of the water. A fawn colored rabbit drank for 1 minute 15 seconds and a black rabbit drank for just
under 3 minutes.
Water must be provided as often as necessary to ensure the health and comfort of the animals. Animals
demonstrating extended drinking times when offered water can indicate the amount, accessibility or frequency of
watering is not sufficient for the animals contained in the enclosure. This non-compliance was corrected during the
inspection by providing adequate water for the animals in this enclosure.
3.82(d)
FEEDING.
The stainless steel feeding bowl for the ring tail lemur was located on top of a litter box covered with a wire grate
located on the enclosure floor. The food bowl contained a small amount of fresh moist food and fresh excreta. Food
contaminated with animal excreta can present disease hazards and compromise the health of the animal.
Food receptacles must be located so as to minimize any risk of contamination by excreta. This food bowl should be
re-located and secured in position to lessen any chance for contamination by excreta. Correct by: June 28, 2017.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The coati mundi is housed in an enclosure against a wall. The baseboard behind the enclosure is damaged and
pulled away from the wall. A hole is visible under the baseboard where the plastic coated wall covering ends and a
significant amount of dried glue is visible on the wall. The baseboard and wall are accessible to the animal by
reaching through the enclosure.
The coati could accidentally ingest damaged baseboard, dried glue or wall material. Ingestion of foreign material
could cause injury or compromise the health of the animal. The baseboard should be repaired or replaced. Facilitiesmust be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by: July 10, 2017.
The inspection and exit interview was conducted with the store manager and facility representatives.
