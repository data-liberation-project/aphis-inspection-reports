FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There are two raccoons housed separately that do not have a six foot perimeter fence in place as required. The
perimeter fence must be at least 6 feet high and a minimum of 3 feet away from the primary enclosure. The fence
must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons
from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a
secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.

FEEDING.
In the feed trough for the sheep, pig and goat in the far back right corner of the property there was a nylon mesh
bag and a thick rubber band from the produce that was fed today. These foreign items can be accidentally ingested
and cause potential harm if the animals were to become impacted. In this same enclosure there was a nylon piece
of black rope that was laying on the ground. All of these items need to be removed and kept out of the animals
feed, feed receptacles, and their enclosure for their health and well being.
