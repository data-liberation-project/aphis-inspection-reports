FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were two adult rabbits that had escaped their enclosure and were observed hopping through an enclosure on
the opposite side of the petting zoo which housed an adult goat. Rabbits which aren't contained securely in their
enclosure could get injured by the public or the other animals on the premises. The licensee must ensure that all
housing facilities for rabbits are structurally sound and maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury,
to contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals.
