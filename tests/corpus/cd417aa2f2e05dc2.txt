HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Floors made of gravel/dirt must be raked and spot cleaned of feces daily. When raking and spot cleaning is not
sufficient to ensure all animals the freedom to avoid contact with excreta the contaminated material must be
replace. Two enclosures of the Lab kennel need the feces cleaned more often to help prevent accumulation of
excreta and reduce disease hazards. The owner did state feces was being picked up daily. The gravel surface has
become stained with numerous patches of dark gravel and worked in feces. The owner must replace the floor
surface of these two kennel runs. Rake and clean floors daily and more clean often if needed to help prevent odors,
insects, and maintain a contaminated free floor surface for dogs to walk on. This will help in the good health and
well-being of animals. The owner must clean daily and replace the floor surface by 09-07-2017.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the owner and Karl Thornton, ACI.
