OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There were three newly added outdoor enclosures containing 4 adult dogs, that did not have wind and rain breaks
at the entrance of the dog houses or separate areas of shade. Wind and rain breaks protect the dogs from the
weather elements while in their dog houses and shade offers protection from the direct rays of the sun. The licensee
shall provide wind and rain breaks at the entrance of all outdoor shelter structures as well as one or more separate
outside areas of shade, large enough to contain all the animals at one time and protect them from the direct rays of
the sun. TO BE CORRECTED BY: 1/6/2016

OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There was a lack of sufficient bedding in the dog houses of both outdoor facilities. Several of the doghouses had
only a small amount of bedding, skirting the outer edge of the doghouse. There were small breed, adult dogs
housed in this facility; many of them had short hair coats. The National Weather Service recorded the low
temperature at 29 degrees F the previous night. Sufficient bedding in the shelter structures is needed to help keep
these animals warm during cold weather. The licensee shall provide clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient
temperature is below 50 degrees F and additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35
degrees or lower.TO BE CORRECTED BY: 12/31/2015
