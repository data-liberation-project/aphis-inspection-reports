ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:20 am on
08-AUG-19.
Upon arrival at the facility there was no one there. I was able to make contact by phone. The owner stated there
was no one available to accompany me on inspection but he would make arrangements to have some one
available. Please send notification of your availability for unannounced inspection. Thank you.
