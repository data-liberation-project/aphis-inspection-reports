NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF OPERATION.
Animal Care inspectors went to the address listed for the facility and pulled into the driveway of the residence (the
address was for a residential home). Upon exiting the vehicle, the inspectors were greeted by the new occupants of
the residence, who stated they had recently moved into the home and did not know the registrant. A registrant shall
notify the AC Regional Director by certified mail of any change in the name, address, or ownership, or other change
in operations affecting its status as an exhibitor, carrier, or intermediate handler, within 10 days after making such
change. These notifications are important so that the Animal Care inspectors can conduct their routine inspections.
