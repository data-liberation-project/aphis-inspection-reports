SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
Five animals are housed in enclosures with inadequate space. A juvenile red kangaroo, a red-necked wallaby, an
agile wallaby, and a fox are each housed in large, black collapsible dog crates. A skunk is housed is a medium wire
enclosure similar in construction to the dog crates. None of these animals have enough space to make normal
postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement. Inadequate enclosure space can cause
stress, abnormal behavior patterns, and depression in animals.
Animals must be housed in enclosures that allow normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of
movement to provide for their well-being.

SANITATION.
A large number of flies were present throughout the building containing the wallabies, kangaroo, hedgehog,
groundhog, the skunks, the juvenile Patagonian cavy, the foxes, the African crested porcupine, and the juvenile pigs
during the time of inspection. The flies were prominent on the window, on the window sill, and on the foodpreparation counter. They were also observed inside of the animal enclosures and on the animals. The license
holder had two sticky fly traps in the building; however, the two traps are not effectively controlling the fly population.
Flies carry and spread disease.
Implement and maintain an effective program to control the flies
