PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE DOGS AND CATS.
An adult female German Shepherd, damaged the transport crate door trying to escape during transport. The
transporter stated to the USDA inspector that the dog destroyed the crate door during a thunderstorm on or about
7/11/19. This dog was dropped off at a boarding kennel by the transporter two days later and the kennel employees
stated to the USDA inspector that the dog was limping when it arrived. The dog was treated by a veterinarian for a
wound on her left rear leg and for tongue lacerations on 7/15/19. The treating veterinarian stated to the USDA
inspector that these injuries most likely occurred during recent transport.
The collapsible wire crate used to transport this dog was not strong enough to contain her . This resulted in injury
to the dog. The primary enclosure used in transport must be constructed so that it is strong enough to contain the
animal. Correct BY : 8/14/19
