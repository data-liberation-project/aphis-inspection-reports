Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
In the primate building east side that housed 4 lemurs and 2 Olive baboons, the area (aprox. 1 ft x 3 ft) under the cages
around the floor drain had a thick layer of black muck including fecal material, hair, and food waste occluding the drain
and preventing drainage. Excreta and other waste materials must be cleaned from underneath the cages as often as
necessary to prevent excessive accumulation of waste materials which could lead to disease hazards, pests, and odors.

A pallet of donated items wrapped in plastic was placed too close to the leopard enclosure. Strands of plastic wrap hung
within inches of the front of the cage within easy reach of the leopard. Thes plastic strands could lead to entrapement or
be ingested causing harm or illness to the leopard. Premises must be kept clean and tidy to protect the animals from
injury.
