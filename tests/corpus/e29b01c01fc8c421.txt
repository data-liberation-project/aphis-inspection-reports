Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Two nursing puppies were acquired from a neighbor and placed in an enclosure with a nursing female dog. The name
and address of where the puppies came from was not documented. Not providing complete and accurate information
does not allow for proper tracking of the animals by an APHIS official. All acquisition information must be documented for
all regulated animals. Correct by 10/3/22.
3.13(a)(3)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care the licensee has does not cover a sampling of his dog population for heartworm and
fecal parasites. He, therefore, has not been sampling his dogs for heartworm or fecal parasites. In addition, the licensee
has not gotten his adult dogs vaccinated for Rabies. Not testing a sample of the dogs for heartworm and fecal parasites
and not vaccinating against Rabies doesn't ensure the dogs are adequately protected from various diseases and
parasites. The licensee must have the Program of Veterinary Care updated to include testing for heartworm and fecal
parasites for a sample of the dog population. He must have all adult dogs vaccinated against rabies and start sampling
for heartworm and fecal parasites. Correct by 10/24/22.


This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
