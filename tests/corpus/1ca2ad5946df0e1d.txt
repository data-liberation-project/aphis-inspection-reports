3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** The facility is in the process of renovating the kennel and primary enclosures. One section of the enclosures
housing several dogs moves side to side when the dogs jump and move around the enclosures. This section needs
to have additional support to reduce this movement for the comfort of the dogs.

3.11(b)(2) CRITICAL REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The facility is still not sanitizing the primary enclosures on a regular basis. The primary enclosures have not been
sanitized in the past month according to the licensee. There is a build up of grime along the enclosures and there is
food debris between the plastic edge and bottom mesh. These enclosures need to be sanitized at least once every
two weeks to prevent this accumulation for the health of the dogs.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with licensee.
