FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During this inspection it was noted that the primary, exhibit pool for the 6 harbor seals, was in need of attention.
There were areas, both inside and outside, where the blue paint has begun to chip away. The quarantine pool also
has peeling paint. The dry resting area of this particular pool also had some cracks in the cement. To ensure that
the peeling paint is not ingested, or hinders the sanitation of the pool, these areas will need to be addressed.
