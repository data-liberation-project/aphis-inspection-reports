ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* The right eye of an adult male gold and white Shih Tzu (microchip number 0A01593445) has an abnormal
thickish, cloudy looking film covering the entire right eye. In addition, the white of this eye is red in color. A
yellowish appearing discharge coming from the eye and was observed. In addition, dry foreign matter attached to
the hair follicles surrounding the eye area was observed. Eye disease can be caused by a variety of problems
including infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions and can be painful. The potential for injury
exists if the dog does not have clear vision. The eye is an extremely sensitive organ and can cause discomfort when
inflamed or injured. The appearance of the eye suggests that an infection or inflammation is present. The attending
veterinarian had not been consulted prior to the time of inspection. The licensee stated that they first noticed the
eye condition a week ago. Currently the licensee is treating the affected eye with clear eye drops. The licensee
stated they had been treating the eye with an ointment that was prescribed by the attending veterinarian for another
dog at the licensee’s facility. The licensee stated the last of the ointment was used the prior day and that they had
disposed of the empty tube. The licensee was unable to find the tube so the name of the ointment used on this dog
could be verified and documented. The licensee must have this animal examined by a licensed veterinarian in
order to ensure an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate and effective treatment plan is developed and
followed. The outcome of this consultation including the diagnosis, treatment plan and how the condition will be
resolved must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. If the recommended veterinary care
treatment plan is delayed, not followed or provided, it could worsen the current condition. Delaying the healing
process can cause unnecessary pain, discomfort, or suffering to exist, creating a negative impact on the animal’s
health and well-being. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times. Correct
by 2/8/17.
