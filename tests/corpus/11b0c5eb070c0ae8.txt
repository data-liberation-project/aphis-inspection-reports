The last written Program of Veterinary Care was dated April 9, 2013. There was no documentation of any scheduled
visits from the attending veterinarian. To provide adequate veterinary care to all animals in the premises, an
updated written Program of Veterinary Care should be available at least annually; including regularly scheduled
visits to the premises. The licensee needs a new written Program of Veterinary Care from their attending
veterinarian that includes regularly scheduled visits (at least annually).
