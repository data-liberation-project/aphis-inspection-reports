No non-compliant items identified during this inspection.
This was a focused inspection to ensure the non-compliant veterinary care items (2.40b2) and the direct
non-compliant items (3.1 and 3.7) identified on the previous inspection (24 June 2015) were corrected. The
Chihuahua (#190) was examined and treated by a veterinarian. The licensee consulted the veterinarian about the
Shih Tzu (#187), the white Pomeranian (#84), and the Silky Terrier (#162) and provided all three with appropriate
treatments. Construction repairs were made to the dividers between enclosures and dogs were moved to different
enclosures so there were no more compatability issues.

This focused inspection and an exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
