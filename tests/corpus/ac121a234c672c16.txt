CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The exterior runs of the kennel enclosures contained multiple deposits of fecal waste. At least three enclosures
were observed with the feet of the dogs as well as the flooring surface contaminated with fecal waste. Per the
owner the enclosures had not been spot cleaned within the last two days. All enclosures must be spot cleaned to
have the excreta removed from the enclosures at least once per day to reduce disease, odor and pest hazards to
the dogs and kennel area. To be corrected by: 03/16/17
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the designated person by Curt McGruder-ACI.
