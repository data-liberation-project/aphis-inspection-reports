ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:25PM on
31-MAY-17.
I called and left a voice message with the licensee and knocked on the licensee's door. The licensee returned my
phone call and informed me that they were out of town for the afternoon and provided me with updated optimal
hours.
