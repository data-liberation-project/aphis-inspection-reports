ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee stated he was currently traveling out of state with the animals for a show, when the ACI attempted to
conduct an inspection at the home site. A current itinerary has not been submitted to the Regional Office, despite
the fact that an itinerary was requested via email on August 21, 2014. Any person who exhibits any animal at any
location other than the person's approved site shall submit a written itinerary to the AC Regional Director to facilitate
the inspection process and protect the welfare of the animals. The licensee must ensure that an itinerary is received
by the AC Regional Director no fewer than 2 days in advance of any travel.
To be corrected within two days of receiving this report.
