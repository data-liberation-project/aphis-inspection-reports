FACILITIES, INDOOR.
In the rabbit barn, the majority of rabbit enclosures are moderately covered in rust. There was a section of new
cages and feeders which had replaced older ones. The presence of rust may prevent the required cleaning and
sanitizing of the enclosures, which may adversely affect the health and well-being of the animals.
The interior building surfaces of indoor housing facilities shall be constructed and maintained so that they are
substantially impervious to moisture and may be readily sanitized.

SANITATION.
-Several empty rabbit enclosures had not been cleaned since last occupied by the animals. A large section of
enclosures were heavily covered with dust and cobwebs while others were soiled and contained what appeared to
be
dried fecal matter and other mixed food/waste material. These enclosures were located in the same area and
directly
adjacent to other rabbits. According to the facility representative, the cages are not cleaned until rabbits are placed
in
them.
-Several overhead and ceiling areas of the barn had a moderate buildup of cobwebs with some being located
directly
over rabbit cages.
-There was a heavy buildup of fecal matter and other waste material along the walkways between rows of cages,
underneath several of the rabbit cages, and in areas on the ground near the base of large building support beams.
Decomposing organic/waste material may create noxious odors, attract vermin, and potentially create disease
hazards thus adversely impacting the health and well-being of the animals housed nearby. Premises (buildings andgrounds) shall be kept clean in order to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
A system should be in place to ensure areas surrounding animal housing areas are cleaned as required to protect
the
health and well-being of the animals.

SANITATION.
Several flies were observed in the rabbit barn at time of inspection. No functional flytraps or other fly control
products/methods are presently being used. Control of insects and other pests is needed to reduce contamination
and potential disease hazards and to promote the health and well-being of the animals. An effective program of pest
control must be established and maintained.
