ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1:40 pm on
13-Sep-18.
In addition to waiting 30 minutes, I knocked on the door, honked the vehicle horn and called the phone numbers
provided for a responsible adult.
