Item IACUC 2.31 e 3
At the time of inspection the teaching protocols for the both the feline and canine studies were reviewed. The
medical records for these protocols showed both dentals and radiology studies were done, however the protocols
failed to incorporate the aspects of radiology and dentals on both species as part of the study
The principal investigator needs to amend the protocol to include both dental and radiology studies as part of the
study so it can be reviewed and approved by the IACUC.
