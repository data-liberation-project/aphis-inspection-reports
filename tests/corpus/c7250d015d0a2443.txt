The plastic coating on the wire shelves in the gorilla/bonobo refrigerator is chipping/flaking away. This has now
exposed the metal underneath which has become rusty. This rust can easily be rubbed off by hand and poses a
risk of contamination of the food by either the rust or the flaking plastic coating.
Food must be stored in a manner that protects it from contamination.

The gorilla/bonobo night house building has a noticeable ammonia odor. The concentration of this odor was
sufficient enough to cause an irritation & a burning sensation to this inspector's respiratory tract for the few minutes
inspecting inside this area.
The keepers postulates that this odor may be caused by (but may not be limited to) a malfunction of the drainage
trough system within this building.
Increased levels of ammonia can, and do, cause irritations of the nasal, ocular and respiratory membranes of the
primates housed within; which can lead to illnesses, stress, and discomfort of the primates.
Drainage systems must be designed and maintained to minimize odors and disease hazards.

The bobcat got out of her enclosure as the keeper was entering. It was subsequently captured and place back intothe exhibit. The design of this enclosure does not include a "keeper/lockout" area to contain the animal if it should
get past the keeper as he/she is entering or leaving to service the exhibit, There have been no corrections to this
exhibit since this incident, and the current design does not minimize or assure the containment of the bobcat.
This exhibit shall have some type of lockout area to contain this animal secondarily if it should get past the keeper.
The vertical metal on the sides of the first lion holding area door has flaking deteriorated rust. The wood along the
sides of the kangaroo door in the holding area is splintered. A metal panel in the jaguar holding area that may be
used as an attachment of the counter weights for the shift doors is completely deteriorated in some areas with
advanced flaking rust. The horizontal bars on the top of the first shift door in the giraffe barn have large spaces
between them which may allow entrapment of the ossi cones between these spaces.
These surfaces are no longer structurally sound nor in good repair, and/or do not protect the animals from possibly
injury.
