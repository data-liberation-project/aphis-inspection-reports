RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
There were no records of the current number of guinea pigs on hand at the facility. Records containing the required
information for animals which fully and correctly disclose the number of animals held, owned, acquired including
births or disposed of are necessary in order to accurately track animals being used for regulated activities to ensure
their humane care and use. Failure to maintain these records can make it difficult to identify animal births versus
animal deaths or if there is disease in the facility that affects the number of offspring born. Correct by January 25,

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were at least 3 loose guinea pigs observed that had escaped from enclosures and were free on the floor of
the facility. Licensee stated that sometimes the guinea pigs escaped their enclosures during cleaning and feeding.
Housing facilities need to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Failure to do so can lead to
injury or death from falls to the ground, escape from the building, or becoming trapped outside the enclosure. The
facility must be structurally sound and must be maintained in good repair, to protect the animals from injury, to
contain the animals, and to restrict the entrance of other animals. Correct by January 31, 2020.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
There is a build-up of dirt, dust, grime on the floor, racks, and cobwebs on the walls, ceiling, and floor of the room
housing the guinea pigs. There was an accumulation of the hay, bedding, and debris on the floor of the room. The
lack of sanitation and presence of dust and debris may attract pests into the room and may contribute to the spread
of disease.
The facility must keep premises clean and in good repair and free from accumulation of trash in order to protect the
animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. Correct by January 31, 2020.This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
