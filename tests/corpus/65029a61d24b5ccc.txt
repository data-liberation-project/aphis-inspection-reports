Facilities, general.
SEA LIONS
The following areas are still in need of repair:

• Holding pools 1 & 2 have numerous areas of peeling paint on the interior walls as well as the vertical gate posts. Mortar
is missing in several areas of both holding pool walls.

• Dry areas 3 & 4 have peeling paint present and part of the mortar is missing in several areas of the walls.

• In Dry area 4, there is a large metal support post that has rusted at the base.

• On the “beach” side of the outdoor exhibit, there is crumbling cement near one of the drains. The sea lions could injure
themselves on the jagged edges of the crumbling edges of cement on this “beach” floor.

• The exterior wall has rust present beneath the rock facade, adjacent to the door leading out to the haul out deck.


Peeling paint and rusted surfaces leave the facility in disrepair. Peeling paint, missing mortar and rusted surfaces cannot
be adequately cleaned and sanitized for the health of the sea lions housed therein.
All surfaces must be constructed of durable, nontoxic materials that facilitate cleaning and disinfection as appropriate,
sufficient to maintain water quality parameters as designated in Section 3.106.

All surfaces must be maintained in good repair as part of a regular, ongoing maintenance program. All facilities must
implement a written protocol on cleaning so that surfaces do not constitute a health hazard to animals.

Wolf building

Three of the six severely rusted metal doors have been replaced. However, two the
interior doors and one exterior door have not been replaced and still have severely rusted bases on each side of the
jambs. These jambs are completely rusted through, leaving the doors in disrepair. The licensee must ensure that housing
facilities are structurally sound and kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representatives.
