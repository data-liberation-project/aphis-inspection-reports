3.130 Repeat

Watering.
One water receptacle used by 3 goats, 2 alpacas, and 1 sheep was in need of cleaning and sanitizing. The water
receptacle contained brown murky water and the bottom of the receptacle could not be seen. Numerous avian feathers
and other debris were also appreciated floating in the water. At the time of inspection, the other water bowls were emptied
and being cleaned. The water in receptacles that are not being adequately cleaned and sanitized may be contaminated
and cause harm to the animals. Access to potable water is important to the health and welfare of the animals. All water
receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
