At the time of inspection, the facility did not have a written program of veterinary care. Facilities must have a written
program of veterinary care to ensure that there is an understanding about expectations for the care of the animals. Failure
to maintain a written program of veterinary care could result in failure to ensure optimal care for the animals. The facility
should create a new written program of veterinary care in collaboration with their attending veterinarian.
