ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The black and white rabbit, in an area restricted to the public, was being treated for an eye condition with
terramycin. The rabbit had some dried matter, yellow grey in color, below each eye. The eyes were not swollen or
red. An employee was asked to roll out the lower eyelid. The conjunctiva and third eye lid were examined and
found to be somewhat swollen, red and irritated. The owner stated they had been treating the eye condition for
about a week and it had greatly improved. Although improved the treatment plan has not cured the condition.
Treatment was being administered by the owner without written instructions and without examination by the
attending veterinarian. Eye aliments can be very painful and problematic. This rabbit needs to be evaluated by the
attending veterinarian.
Correct by: within 24 to 48 hours.
Two guinea pigs had been treated with lotrimin, by the owner, for a suspected fungal skin problem. The guinea pigs
looked well and the skin condition had responded well to the treatment. The owner stated their attending
veterinarian had prescribed this treatment for this problem in the past. However, there was no written prescription
or protocol for its use by the attending veterinarian. All off-label drug use must be approved by the attending
veterinarian and must have written instructions in place to ensure proper medical treatment is being administered.
Correct by: Ensure all medical treatment is approved in writing by the Attending Veterinarian from this point
forward.
3.29(a) DIRECT
FEEDING.
One enclosure housing a single guinea pig had no food or water receptacles, and had no food or water in the
enclosure. The owner stated the guinea pig had been placed in this new enclosure the day before this inspection,about 24 hours ago. Guinea pigs must be fed each day; this animal had gone a full day without food or water.
The licensee put food and water in the enclosure immediately upon discovering it during the inspection.
Corrected during inspection.
3.30 DIRECT
WATERING.
One enclosure housing a single guinea pig had no food or water receptacles, and had no food or water in the
enclosure. The owner stated the guinea pig had been placed in this new enclosure the day before this inspection.
Unless food supplements consumed by guinea pigs supply their water requirements, water must be provided daily.
Water is essential for all animals and daily monitoring of water in all guinea pig enclosure is necessary.
Dehydration and deteriorating health conditions can happen quickly if water is not available. Monitoring of water
levels needs to be increased to insure all animals have adequate water supplies. Water was provided during this
inspection.
Corrected during inspection.
3.56(a)
SANITATION.
The top cage containing two rabbits, next to the porcupine cage, has an accumulation of old bedding, food, fur, and
cobwebs between the cage and the wall. The back panel of the cage has an accumulation of cobwebs. This
needs to be cleaned to comply with USDA sanitation regulations and to prevent the possible growth of mold and
bacteria or attraction of pest such as flies, roaches, or mice. A regular schedule of cleaning around and behind
cages needs to be in place and followed.

3.58(a)
CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
One rabbit was housed in the same enclosure with two guinea pigs. A second rabbit was housed with one guinea
pig in another enclosure. USDA regulations state that rabbits shall not be housed with any other species of animal. Rabbits are a prey species and housing with other animals can produce physical stress on the rabbits which may
affect overall health. Also, rabbits are severely affected by some types of bacteria that are carried unnoticed by
other species.
The rabbits were separated from other species by moving them to other cages at the time of the inspection.
Corrected during inspection.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the food storage area several food bags were opened and taped shut. While this may help keep the food fresh it
does not protect the food from vermin such as mice from chewing into the bag. All open bags of food need to be
stored in such a manner to protect them from mold, deterioration, and vermin contamination. Containers for open
bags of food material need to be used and maintained in good condition to protect food quality.

3.130 DIRECT
WATERING.
One enclosure housing five degus had a empty water bottle. Water must be provided at all times or as frequently
as necessary depending on the age, size, condition, and species of animal. Water was provided during the
inspection and the degus mobbed the water bottle and drank for several minutes indicating they were very thirsty.
Water is essential for life and all animals must have access to it. Monitoring of water levels needs to be increased
and employees need to make sure all water bottles have adequate levels of water for each enclosure containing
animals.
Corrected during inspection.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The floor beside and behind the Kinkajou cage has an accumulation of old bedding, dry food biscuits, and foodmaterials. Also the floor in the food storage area under the food bin racks has an accumulation of spilled dry food
materials on the floor. This needs to be cleaned up to prevent the attraction of pest and possible growth of molds
and bacteria. A regular schedule of cleaning around and behind the cages and food storage bins needs to be in
place and followed.
