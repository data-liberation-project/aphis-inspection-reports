2.126(a)(2)

Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
There were no acquisition and disposition records, health records, or program of veterinary care present at the time of this
inspection. Proper record keeping is essential for identifying and tracking movement of animals and to evaluate the
medical care of the animals. Review of records required by the Animal Welfare Act facilitates the inspection process by
allowing the inspector to determine compliance of documents and evaluate animal welfare. The licensee must, during
business hours, allow APHIS officials to examine records required to be kept by the Animal Welfare Act and the
regulations.

3.1(c)(1)(ii)

Housing facilities, general.
***In two outdoor exercise enclosures where eight dogs routinely play, there were two wood climbing structures that were
in disrepair. The edges of the wood climbing structures had jagged, splintered edges and one had many exposed nails
that were protruding out of the wood where the animals could come into contact with them. Also, there were broken wood
pieces in the yard of one enclosure. The licensee stated the dogs routinely chew the wood slats of these climbing
structures.



***In one of the outdoor exercise enclosures, the bottom of the chain linked fence in two areas were curled up and created
sharp points that were pointing into the enclosure. Sharp points present a physical hazard that could result in injury to the
animals.

Housing facilities must be free of sharp points and jagged sharp edges. The licensee must alter the sharp points in a
manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at
all times.
