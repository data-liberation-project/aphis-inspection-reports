Access and inspection of records and property.
1. The inspector arrived at 11:00 AM on 7/24/14 to conduct an inspection but there was no one on the premises.
The inspector contacted the Licensee by phone and learned that she was at work and would not be available until
after 7 PM.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no other facility representative available
to accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility
and animals.
Correct from this date forward.
