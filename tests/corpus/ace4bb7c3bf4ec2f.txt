INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC originally approved the use of 20 hamsters for protocol 156 on 13 Oct 2011 and reviewed this protocol
least annually. The IACUC reviewed and approved an amendment to this protocol on 1 May 2014 to increase the
numbers of hamster used from 20 to 24. According to the animal use log, however, a total of 28 animals were used
for activities approved under protocol 156 while it was active. Inadequate review by the IACUC of activities involving
animals can result in unapproved use of animals. The IACUC must conduct continuing reviews of animal activities
at appropriate intervals or at least annually to ensure animals are being used in a manner approved by the
committee. To be corrected from this point forward.
No covered species were present during this inspection.The inspection and exit interview were conducted with
Facility Representatives and Margaret A Shaver, VMO in attendance.
