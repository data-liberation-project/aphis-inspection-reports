WATERING.
Two water receptacles in the raccoon enclosure contained murky brown water. It was not possible to visualize the
bottom of either receptacle. An additional water receptacle in the enclosure was overturned.
Failure to maintain the drinking water receptacles in clean and sanitary conditions could result in water quality that is
harmful to animals.
Licensees shall keep all water receptacles clean and sanitary.

SANITATION.
The primary enclosure housing the raccoon is in need of cleaning. The concrete floor of the raccoon enclosure was
covered in a black and brown mixture of dirt, mud and excreta. Additionally, there were pieces of palm fronds
scattered on the ground. The licensee stated that she gives the raccoon palm fronds to tear up as a form of
enrichment. She mentioned that she had not cleaned the enclosures yet that morning. The licensee also stated that
the raccoon enjoys playing in her water receptacles and often overturns them. This contributes to the muddy
conditions in the enclosure.
Adequate and frequent cleaning is necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and to minimize disease
hazards. Excreta shall be removed from the primary enclosure as often as necessary to prevent the contamination
of the animal housed within.
