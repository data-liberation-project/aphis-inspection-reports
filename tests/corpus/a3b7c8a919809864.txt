2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The inspectors first arrived at the facility at approximately 10:00 am to attempt an inspection. From the driveway, the
inspectors observed a female Saint Bernard laying on the ground within an outdoor enclosure ((cid:28)Georgia(cid:29), microchip
# 0A01787808, approximately 6 years old). The animal appeared extremely lethargic and barely lifted her head
when the inspectors got out of and stood by their vehicle. The inspectors observed this animal for about 10 minutes
while attempting to make contact with the licensee. During that time, the animal trembled at least three times. The
other dogs were jumping, running and barking while this dog did not react to our presence. The inspectors left the
facility at approximately 10:30 am after failing to make contact with the licensee. The inspectors returned to the
facility around 12:35 pm and successfully made contact with the licensee to begin an inspection at approximately
12:45 pm. Upon arrival at the facility this time, the inspectors noted that the animal had gotten up and moved
around the enclosure. The inspectors shared their prior observations regarding this animal with the licensee during
the inspection process.
During the inspection, the same female appeared more active when we approached the enclosure. The animal had
an approximately two inch swelling on the right side of her neck just under her chin. The hair around the swelling
was wet with a pink to red tinged fluid. When the licensee touched the affected area a creamy red substance came
out of the swelling. The dog was observed repeatedly rubbing the affected area on the fence. The licensee stated
he had not previously noticed this swelling.
Untreated wounds can lead to further medical complications and can cause unnecessary pain and distress for the
animal.
This animal was taken to the veterinarian for a medical evaluation during the inspection process.
*****
One, approximately two year old, female apricot mastiff (microchip # 0A02024725) has an area on the end of her
tail that is severely bloody. The end of the tail has patchy hair-loss, appears enlarged and gray in color. The area of
the tail that is bleeding has an uneven surface. The affected area is approximately two by four inches in size. Thereis a significant amount of blood on the tip of the tail and smeared on the sides of her body from the dog wagging her
tail. The licensee confirms that the tail has been bleeding off and on for an extended period of time and the animal
has not been evaluated by a veterinarian. A tail wound such as this could be a sign of a serious medical condition
and can cause unnecessary pain and discomfort.
The animal listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian by 5:00 pm on February 19, 2015 in order to
ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This
information, including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made
available to the inspector upon request.
*****
Two, approximately two year old, male standard poodles (microchip # 941000015382921 and microchip
#941000015389541) have severely matted hair-coats. There are small to moderate sized mats on their lower sides,
chest, abdomen and legs. Some of the mats on the legs, abdomen and chest are tightly adhered to the skin. The
entire hair-coat is starting to become rope-like and twisted. The hair-coat and matted areas on the legs and feet
have brown to black dirt and/or other material embedded in them and appear wet. Matted hair-coats can be painful
and can lead to skin disease and other medical conditions. All dogs need to have their hair coats routinely
maintained in order to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases associated with excessive matting.
*****
The facility must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries in all animals at the facility.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the non-whelping area of the Tool Shed Building there are two enclosures housing at least six dogs with access
doors that have a buildup of dirt and grime on them. Throughout the Hunte Building, nearly all of the access doors
have a build-up of dirt and grime on them. There are at least thirty dogs in these enclosures.
In the whelping area of the Tool Shed Building, there is an excessive buildup of feces in three enclosures. The feces
is scattered in piles throughout the middle of each of the enclosures. The feces is stacked several inches high in
some areas and some of the feces is covered with a small amount of snow. The licensee states it is difficult to clean
these enclosures in the winter time. There are three adult dogs in this area of the tool shed. In the non-whelping
area of the Tool Shed Building there is one enclosure with an excessive buildup of feces in it. The feces is covering
nearly the entire floor of the outdoor portion of the enclosure with old piles of feces covered in snow and fresh feces
on top. There are at least three dogs in this enclosure. In the Dalmatian Building there is one enclosure with an
excessive buildup of feces in it. The piles of feces are scattered throughout the outdoor portion of the enclosure to
the extent that the dogs are having difficulty avoiding stepping in them. This enclosure contains three adult dogs.
The buildup of dirt, grime and feces can increase health risks towards the dogs. Used primary enclosures must be
spot cleaned daily and sanitized once every two weeks or more often as necessary to prevent an accumulation of
dirt, grime, feces and disease hazards.
