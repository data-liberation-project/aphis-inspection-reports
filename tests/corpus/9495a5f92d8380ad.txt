2.4(d)
NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
The licensee in the course of this inspection knowingly gave false information regarding the cat declaw procedures,
as well as declined to answer direct questions regarding the declaws. She stated that the caracal's paws had been
badly injured in transit due to the wire floor in the crate, which necessitated the declaw procedure. The
veterinarian's records indicated no injury to the cat's paws prior to the declaw. She also answered "no" when asked
if the bobcat housed adjacent to the caracal and serval was also declawed. The veterinarian's records show that the
bobcat was indeed declawed.
Interference with an inspection by withholding information or giving false information prevents the inspector from
carrying out official duties as required.
Correction date: from this point forward, the licensee must cooperate with the inspection procedure.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two young cats, a caracal and a serval have been declawed -- all four paws on each animal. The caracal is named
Jericho, DOB ~2/2015, and was declawed on 6/22/2015. The serval is Mondo, DOB ~4/2015, and was also
declawed on 6/22/2015. The serval's paws look relatively normal, but the caracal has the misshapen toes and the
floppy-footed gait common in declawed animals. Conversation with the attending veterinarian indicated that not only
were these two cats declawed, the licensee also had a Geoffroy's Cat, Aziza, DOB 5/7/2015, and a bobcat,
Meernah, DOB 5/25/2015, declawed on 7/27/2015. The Geoffroy's Cat is no longer at the facility. The bobcat is
housed next to the serval and caracal on the back porch.
Declawing can cause ongoing pain, discomfort, and other pathological conditions such as arthritis in the animals. In
addition, it does not prevent predatory behaviors such as biting. The declawing of any wild or exotic carnivore does
not constitute appropriate veterinary care. A copy of the Declaw-Defang fact sheet and a copy of Policy 3, Vet Care,
were provided to the licensee at the first prelicense inspection for her original license on November 5, 2007. Another
hard copy of that document was provided at this inspection, and the updated Policy 3 is being provided with thisinspection report.
Correction date: immediately - licensees must not declaw animals for handling purposes.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are five wolf-dog crosses in the outdoor enclosures, but there are only four dogloo-type shelters for them.
There is not sufficient shelter to accomodate all of the animals at the same time.
Shelter must be provided that will accomodate all of the animals, and meet all of the requirements of this section.
Going into the cold, wet, and muddy season, adequate shelter for these animals is very important for their health
and comfort.
This was being corrected on the day of inspection by placing an additional doghouse in the enclosure that needed it.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee and other facility personnel, and was
accompanied by Sue Orham, IES Investigator.
An addendum to the exit briefing was conducted via telephone after consultation with the attending veterinarian.
