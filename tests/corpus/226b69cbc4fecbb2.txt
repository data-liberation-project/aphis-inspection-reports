2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two goats and three sheep were observed to have overgrown hooves. The hooves on the animals were beginning to curl
and were cracked, due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait
abnormalities and lameness issues which could be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s program of
preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely
manner.

2.131(d)(2)

Handling of animals.
The public is permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures and feed the animals. There are no barriers or signs
present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food that is sold on the premises. During the
inspection the attendant that oversees the public feedings with the fallow deer and goats was inside the main building
greeting members of the public. At that time, many visitors were seen petting and feeding the fallow deer and goats
without an attendant present. The attendant failed to supervise the visitors’ interaction with the animals.
Unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals. The licensee must ensure that


during periods of public exhibition, a responsible, knowledgeable employee or attendant is present at all times during
periods of public contact.

Facilities, general.
***There was a decaying juvenile wild rabbit carcass inside the goat enclosure that contains ten goats. Diseases can be
transmitted by dead animals to the regulated animals and can impact their health and well-being. In addition, animal
carcasses can attract other pests to the area, which can carry disease and can contaminate feed and water.
The rabbit carcass was removed at the time of inspection.

***In a two-level feeding enclosure with ten holes containing ten goats known as the “Hole in the Wall Gang,” there was
excessive accumulations of excreta and food waste on the floor and caked on along the sides and in the corners. During
open hours these goats poke their heads out of ten holes to get fed by the public. According to the facility representative
this feeding enclosure is supposed to be cleaned every morning before the animals are moved in.

Accumulations of excreta and food waste, as well as dead animals, can impact the health and well-being of the animals
due to increased odors, disease risks and vermin infestation. The licensee must remove the excessive accumulations of
excreta and food waste in the enclosures throughout the facility, as well as the dead rabbit, to protect the health and well-
being of the animals. The licensee must establish and maintain a program of routine cleaning to ensure that removal of
animal and food waste, bedding, dead animals, trash and debris is done as often as necessary to protect the animals.

3.130 Repeat

Watering.
In the fallow deer enclosure containing 30 deer, one of the plastic drinking receptacles was dirty with debris on the bottom
and feces floating on the top. Dirty water that contains fecal material may reduce the potability of the water and can
present a health risk to the animals. It is the responsibility of the licensee to make sure all water receptacles be kept clean
and sanitary for the overall health and well-being of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
