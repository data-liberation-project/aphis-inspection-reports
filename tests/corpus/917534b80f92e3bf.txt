3.6(a)(2)(ix) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the main kennel building, four kennels were found to have worn and exposed wood surfaces on walls and dog
doorways.
Exposed and unprotected wood surfaces absorb moisture and can make it more difficult to adequately clean and
sanitize those surfaces. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained in a manner that enables all
surfaces in contact with dogs to be readily sanitized in accordance with 3.11(b) or replaceable when worn or soiled.
Non-compliance under 3.6(a)(2)(ix) was previously documented during USDA inspection on 24-APRIL-2019
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the main corridor of the whelping building there was an accumulation of paint cans, battery charger, battery, car
floor jack, tools, window, wood, debris and trash. Bird droppings were also present on top of some of the tools and
containers in the area. In the south main corridor of the main kennel building, there was an accumulation of
construction materials, tarps, and metal debris on the floor. On the west side of the main kennel building an
overgrowth of weeds and grass was observed inside one unoccupied kennel and in areas immediately adjacent to
kennel fencing.
Accumulations of trash and debris in and around animal areas may attract rodents and insect pests which can
introduce diseases into the housing environment. Accumulations of trash and debris also makes it difficult to
adequately clean and sanitize equipment being kept in these areas.
Premises where housing facilities are located, including buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and
free of accumulations of trash, junk, waste material and discarded matter. Weeds, grasses and bushes must be
controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control, and to protect the health and well-being of
the animals.Non-compliance under 3.11 (c) was previously documented during USDA inspection on 24-APRIL-2019..
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
