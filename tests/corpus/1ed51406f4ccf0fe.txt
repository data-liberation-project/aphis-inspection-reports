ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A yellow and white male Cocker Spaniel has excessively long toenails on all four feet. A few of the toenails have
become so long they are beginning to curve under the foot. Overgrown toenails could cause pain and discomfort to
the dog, as well as, affect the dog's natural gait.
The licensee must have this dog's toenails trimmed to an acceptable length and ensure that the toenails of all the
dogs remain at an appropriate length at all times.
Female Cocker spaniel (#91) cited on the previous inspection report dated September 27, 2016 has been evaluated
by a licensed veterinarian and received treatment.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
