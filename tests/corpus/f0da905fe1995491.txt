ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There are two boxer females that were in a fight on 10/4/16 that sustained multiple lacerations and punctures over
both front legs, head and chest area. 'Stewert 1' (F) boxer has a 2-3 inch open laceration on her left front forelimb
running parallel to the ground. This wound is open 1/4 to 1/2 inch the length of the laceration, with muscle tissue
showing and a red oozing liquid in the wound. There were multiple small flies in the wound. There is an open
circular wound, exposing the muscle/flesh beneath the surface approximately 1 inch in diameter on the left front
chest area. There are 2 horizontal lacerations approximately 1-2 inches long on the right forelimb, exposing the
muscle tissue beneath the separated skin (approximately 1/8-1/4 inch wide).
The other female boxer in the fight was "Dance Little Jean" who has a very swollen left ear that appears to be full of
fluid, and is painful to the touch. This female was tilting her head and carefully trying to shake her head, however
would stop and squint as it appeared painful. There is a 2-3 inch laceration running horizontal on her left forelimb,
exposing the muscle beneath in a 1/4 inch open incision. There are multiple puncture wounds on her right front leg
and top of her head between the eyes. Her right leg appears swollen and sore, and her right front chest area
appears swollen above the leg. She also had a broken upper right front canine tooth, broken down the length of the
tooth to the gumline.
Both dogs appear to be swollen and sore from their injuries. The licensee did separate the dogs and houses them in
different enclosures. While the licensee did try to provide a herbal topical treatment for the wounds, the severity of
the wounds requires a veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment of the multiple injuries and wounds which
may require medication for pain and infection as well as possible sutures, which should all be determined by the
attending veterinarian. Until the inspection the veterinarian had not been contacted or advised of the injuries.
There is a white boxer "Lucky Charm' that has some swelling on her face with irritated skin that is red and hairless
on her face, ears, neck, chest and other sporadic areas on her body. The issue has been a problem since 8/30/16,
with inconsistent treatments provided, with no documentation provided of all treatments and medicines given. There
has not been any contact with the veterinarian or vet visit for this animal, and the home treatments are not working.
There are 9 boxer puppies under 8 weeks of age that are very thin in appearance, with their ribs showing. 8 of the 9pups were showing signs of runny noses and sniffling during the inspection. There were 2 pups that had liquid
yellow diarrhea during the inspection. While the licensee was trying to treat the animals for the past few
weeks/days, there has been no contact with the veterinarian for proper diagnosis or treatment. There is no record of
how these pups have been treated during their illness or with what medicine/dosages.
It is imperative that all injuries and illnesses are properly diagnosed and treated as soon as they are observed, in
order to prevent a treatable condition from becoming chronic or fatal and to decrease the discomfort for the
regulated animal. A veterinarian must be consulted in a timely manner to determine what medical treatment should
be given and to consult the Program of Veterinary Care(PVC) for additional information.
The attending veterinarian must be contacted immediately for proper diagnosis and care of the regulated animals.
The PVC should be followed and the veterinarian should be contacted for any issues not resolving with any
treatments provided in a timely manner. All treatments and health issues should be kept on record for proper care
and management of the animals.
The licensee did make an appointment with the attending veterinarian for the next morning during the inspection.
