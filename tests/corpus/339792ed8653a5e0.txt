3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Section 3.131(c) Housekeeping: Wood, old enclosures and miscellaneous items are still stored around the animal
enclosures and buildings. The clutter around the animal areas provides good hiding places for mammalian pests
and prevents vegetation from being cut/trimmed around enclosure fencing. Animals may be injured when walking
through these areas to move to other enclosures or into the transport trailer. Animal areas must be free of clutter
and debris to deter pests and for the safety of the animals.
This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
