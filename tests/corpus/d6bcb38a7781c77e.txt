3.1(a) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Gaps from dug holes were observed under the cattle panel enclosure fencing. Four dogs are in contact with the
affected areas located in outdoor housing. The gaps created between the enclosure fencing and the ground was
estimated to be two foot wide by six inches deep. This affects the ability of enclosure fencing to contain the dog
securely and protect the animals from potential injury. In addition, dug holes undermine the enclosure fencing.
The licensee must keep housing facilities in good repair, to protect the animals from injury and contain the animals
securely.



3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* Excessive rust with a sharp, jagged edge was observed along the bottom of one sheet of tin. Three dogs are in
contact with the affected tin which is located in outdoor housing. Excessive rust can erode and deteriorate all metal
surfaces to the point the affected metal surface can no longer be readily cleaned and sanitized. Excessive rust
affects the structural integrity of all metal surfaces. The licensee must ensure all surfaces are made of materials
that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized or be removed or replaced when worn. In addition, all surfaces
must be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animals. Correct by 2/18/16.
3.4(b)(3)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
* There were no wind or rain breaks on two outdoor sheltered structures housing four dogs. Wind and rain breakshelp to reduce the effects of and provide protection from the wind, rain or snow. In addition, the dogs could
experience difficulty conserving body heat and maintaining a normal body temperature. The licensee must provide
a wind and rain break to all outdoor sheltered structures. Correct by 2/11/16.
* The facility inspection done on 2/4/16 and exit briefing done on 2/5/16 were conducted with the licensee.
