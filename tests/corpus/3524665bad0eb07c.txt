2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** During the inspection, the Asiatic Black bear had observed hair loss along his sides and hindquarters and he
was rubbing along the metal support beam in the enclosure for several minutes. The caretaker mentioned that he
appeared to have hair loss seasonally but the facility has not contacted the vet notifying him of the condition nor has
the facility used appropriate methods to prevent or treat the hair loss and skin condition. The facility needs to
contact the attending veterinarian for guidance on appropriate methods for preventative care since this is a noted
reoccurring condition.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the animal caretaker.
