2.131(b)(1)

Handling of animals.
During an animal encounter public exhibition at Tiger Safari on March 28, 2021 in the afternoon, a river otter was
vocalizing excessively prior to and during its handling for the event. The handler tried to soothe it by bouncing it in her
arms, blowing air into its face, placing her hand over and around its head, and even moving it to another part of the room
to hold it up into the air. The otter continued to vocalize while being taken around the room where public could pet it while
the handler restrained it against her body. The handler stated the otter was only 6-7 months old and was a baby.

Shortly afterwards, the handler brought out a Fennec fox. Its tail and free left foreleg hung limp and did not move. Its
eyes looked as they were fixed in a stare, it appeared catatonic. The handler was holding the fox very close to her body
with her right wrist and forearm tight over and on top of its neck. There was no harness or leash on the fox. The fox was
circulated around the room so that people could touch or pet its exposed fur/tail. It did not appear to react to stimuli.

Animals may exhibit behavioral stress or discomfort in different ways and should be handled so there is minimal risk of
harm to the animal. The river otter and Fennec fox exhibited signs of behavioral stress and unnecessary discomfort.



Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.

Correct from this day forward.
