3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are 3 original enclosures that are still in violation due to fencing being less than 12 feet high. These include:
(cid:9)Tiger Pen 4: contains one tiger known as Nahandi
(cid:9)Tiger Pen 5: contains one tiger known as Glacier and one lion known as Ungowwa
(cid:9)Lion Pen 1: contains one lion known as Chief and one dog known as Bandit
None of these enclosures have any angled top fencing (kick-in), or any additional means to ensure adequate
containment. There are 4 new enclosures under construction, which have 16(cid:25) vertical fencing, but they are not
completed yet. All lion and tiger enclosures must be built according to standards and regulation as these animals
have the potential to escape from these enclosures if motivated to do so. An escape places the animal(cid:25)s life in
jeopardy and may endanger the safety of the public.
Also, there were broken wire ends protruding into the Hyena enclosure housing 2 hyenas. These are in an area
next to the gate. This was corrected on the day of inspection.
Also, there were several sheets of metal siding that were laying next to the shelter for the lion, Chief, and the dog,
Bandit. This was corrected on the day of inspection.
The facility must be maintained in good repair so that the animals cannot become injured.

FEEDING.
The four 10 week old tiger cubs are still on a diet which is 100% formula, utilizing Fox Valley 32/40. They are not
being offered any ground meat at this time. By the time they are 10-12 weeks old they should be getting a diet very
close to that of an adult in order to provide for adequate nutritive value. Licensee shall start adding meat to the
bottles by 2-3 weeks of age, with the majority of the diet being meat by 8 weeks of age. Bottles can still be provided
as enrichment by the age of these cubs, but should only be a minimal part of their full diet. Failure to provide for
adequate nutrition for these growing cubs can lead to dietary deficiencies. Correct by transitioning to a meat diet.
Correct from this time forward.3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
There was a dirty water receptacle for the 3 African Crested Porcupines. There was green water in the enclosure
for the lion, Chief, and the dog, Bandit. There was green water in the enclosure for Hemmi, the tiger. There was
dirty water in the enclosure for the tiger named Glacier, and the lion named Ungowwa. These animals do not have
an additional source for potable water.
