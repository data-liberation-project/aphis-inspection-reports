3.1(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-There are broken floor supports under a couple enclosures in the "farrowing building". The floor in these enclosures
appears to be sagging and not completely stable, especially at the seams in the floor. This could result in a limb
slipping through and causing injury.
-There is a gap between the wall and floor in an enclosure in the first section of the "G House". The rings securing
the wall at its base to the floor have come undone resulting in a gap that appears large enough to allow a foot or
limb to slip though. This could cause injury to the dog.
The licensee must ensure that all housing facilities be designed and constructed so that they are structurally sound
and kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury.

3.1(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-There are multiple enclosures with coated flooring where the plastic has worn away in places, revealing the rusted
metal underneath.
-There are multiple metal egress doors in the "main run" with a rough, rusted surface on the interior side.
-There are multiple enclosures with metal strips along the base of the wall under the water dispenser that are
showing deterioration and rough surface from rust.
-There are multiple enclosures in the large dog section of the "G House" and multiple enclosures in the farrowing
building with support bars at the base of the enclosure divider walls that have a rusted, flaky surface.
Rough and flaking rusted surfaces cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized and can therefore play a role in
disease transmission. Flaking rusted surfaces and can also cause instability of the metal structure or surface.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities be free of excessive rust that interferes with or
prevents the required cleaning and sanitization, or affects the structural strength of the surface. TO BE CORRECTED BY: NOVEMBER 24, 2015
3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
-There are multiple enclosures with wires ends, and broken or corroded wires protruding into the enclosures.
-There are some enclosures with sharp bent metal pieces protruding into the enclosures along the base of the wall
under the water dispenser.
-There is an enclosure that the metal edge along the trough of the feeder has been chewed on which created a
sharp point on the corner.
Jagged edges and sharp points can cause injury to the dogs.
The licensee must ensure that all surfaces of housing facilities be free of jagged edges and sharp points.

buildup, on the outdoor divider walls of the enclosures.

Buildup of organic material and debris can cause disease hazard and attract pests.
The licensee must sanitize used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles at least every two weeks or
more often if necessary with methods in 3.11(b)(3) to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta,
and other disease hazards.
