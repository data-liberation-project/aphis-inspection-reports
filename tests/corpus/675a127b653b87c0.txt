HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Five areas of damaged and deteriorating roof tin/metal components were identified at the primary enclosure of two
nonhuman primates (NHP’s); gibbons named Santoshi and Saiuka. All roof damaged areas exhibit sharp
points/edges which the gibbons could easily reach and/or grab. Also, several metal hose clamps attached to
primary enclosures have exposed sharp ends that are in need of repair/adjustment. Damaged metal components
with sharp points/edges identified on primary enclosures might injure regulated animals. Housing facilities for
NHP's must be kept in good repair, and must be free of jagged edges; protecting regulated animals from injury, and
containing the animals securely. All damaged and deteriorating metal components at primary enclosures must be
repaired and/or replaced to prevent/eliminate the potential of an injury to regulated animals.
