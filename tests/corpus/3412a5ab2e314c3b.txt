3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
There is not sufficient shade provided for the 4 camels housed together. Although there is some natural shade
provided by a tree, it is not enough to comfortably protect all the animals. A system should be in place to ensure
animal enclosures have sufficient shade by natural or artificial means to protect animals when sunlight is likely to
cause overheating or discomfort to them.

3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A portion of the perimeter fence, which serves as the entry way into the facility, does not have a gate that can be
closed. As a result, entry into the animal compound is open and its function as a secondary containment is reduced.

There are at least two areas along the perimeter fence that are less than 6 feet high and does not meet our
minimum height requirement for the perimeter fence.
All outdoor housing facilities must be enclosed by a perimeter fence that is of sufficient height to keep animals and
unauthorized persons out. Fences less than 6 feet high must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence
must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting unauthorized persons or animals from
having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the facility.
To be corrected by October 1, 2015The inspection was conducted at the new site.
An exit brieifing was conducted with the Owner.
