2.38(g)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
(g)(1) Identification. The three adult dogs housed in cage numbers 80, 81, and 82 are not properly identified. The
dogs currently held in these runs have not been micro-chipped because the micro-chipping process will be utilized
as a teaching tool for the students when the semester begins. In the meantime these dogs require an alternate
method of identification that will meet the standards set forth in Section 2.38 (g) of the regulations. Correct by
August 14, 2015.
3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3.1 (c)(2) Maintenance and Replacement. The stainless steel sink in the room housing the dogs in the Center has
severe rust on the surfaces. The sink cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Inadequate cleaning and
sanitization may allow bacterial growth and other disease hazards that can contaminate the feed and other items
used for the dogs. The sink shall be repaired or replaced to allow proper husbandry practice and prevent
contamination. Correct by September 30, 2015.
3.6(c)(1)(3) DIRECT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The female black lab #051*516*824, the grey and white collie mix, and the boxer are in enclosures that do not
provide the minimum of 6 inches of clearance between the head and ceiling of the enclosure while they are standing
in a normal position. The grey and white collie mix is not able to fully raise his head while standing, and the black
lab and boxer have a clearance of approximately 1 - 2 inches. Although the dogs have been moved to these
enclosures temporarily while the main housing is being renovated, the inability of the dogs to express normal
postures in their primary enclosures for an extended length of time may lead to abnormal conformations, stress,
and/or discomfort. These dogs shall be placed in enclosures that provide at least the minimum amount of height as
required in Section 3.6 (c) of the regulations.
