FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The pasture still has potential hazards that could cause injury to the animals housed there. Primarily this incudes
a large amount of broken glass that has been exposed due to bulldozer activity, but also loose wire and discarded
baling twine that could cause entanglement.
The hazards must be removed from the pasture or the animals precluded from entering the hazardous area.
An exit interview was conducted with the owner by phone.
