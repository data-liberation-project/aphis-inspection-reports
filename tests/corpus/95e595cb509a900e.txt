The ring tail lemurs had a baby 3 months ago and when the traveling unit came back home, these three animals
were moved into a different enclosure because the baby could potentially leave their original home enclosure. This
enclosure is only separated from the stockade perimeter fence by a few inches. Primate enclosures need to be
surrounded by a 6 foot perimeter fence that is at least 3 feet away from the enclosure fence. This enclosure or the
lemurs need to be moved so that they have the additional protection of a perimeter fence.
To be corrected by 6-26-15.
Exit briefing conducted with licensees.
