Facilities, general.
Hoofstock Enclosure (zebra, z-donk, camels, nilgai, eland, water buffalo, bison, zebu, and domestic cattle): Along the
driveway, there is damage to some of the fencing. The top of some areas of the wire fence are bent downward toward
the driveway. One area is detached from the support post at the top of the fence.
Kangaroo Enclosure: One section (front right side) of the wire fence has damaged wire that created larger opening in the
fence due to broken or missing wire. Along the same side of the enclosure, a section of the perimeter fence is detached
from the support pole and leaning outward

The structure of the fencing is compromised and could lead to the injury and/or escape of animals. Fencing must be
maintained in a manner that ensures structural strength. The fencing must be repaired to prevent injury and the escape of
the animals.

Sanitation.
Pest Control
Flies were observed coming into the "Kangaroo" shelter to congregate in and around the food receptacle within the


shelter. An excessive amount of flies are on the food in the bowl. The food is attracting the flies into the shelter. No fly
control measures were in place at the time of inspection.

A pest control program must prevent the attraction and harborage of pests such as flies. An effective means of controlling
the flies must be implemented to minimize the attraction and harborage of the flies to prevent contamination of food and to
protect the animals from disease or illness.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
