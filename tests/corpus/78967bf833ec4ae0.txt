HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility has acquired sixteen additional marmosets in May 2015. The existing animal room did not have space
for any additional NHP cages so the new monkey cages are housed in the adjacent room which is a bedroom and
includes typical bedroom furniture such as a bed, dressers, chest of drawers and a TV. The marmoset cages are
situated directly adjacent to the furniture items. The marmoset scent odor in the room is fairly strong in spite of all
cages and items within the cages being clean. Animal areas must be kept neat and free of any furniture or
equipment not actually used and necessary for proper husbandry practices relating to the animals. This is
necessary to allow proper cleaning and sanitization as required by the regulations and standards in order to
minimize odors and eliminate disease spread and pests. Animal areas inside housing facilities must be kept neat
and free of any equipment, furniture and stored materials not actually used and necessary for proper husbandry
practices. Correct by Jan. 20, 2016.
The marmoset cited for vet care on the April 28, 2015 inspection report has been seen by a veterinarian.

Exit conducted by Kate Campbell, ACI, Susanne Brunkhorst, VMO and facility representative.
