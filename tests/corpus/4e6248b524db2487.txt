3.31(a)(4)
SANITATION.
Guinea pig enclosures are being cleaned weekly, but the licensee is not currently using a sanitation method. Guinea
pig enclosures shall be sanitized at least once every two weeks by one of the following methods: 180 degree water
with soap or detergent, cleaning all soiled surfaces with live steam, or washing all surfaces with a detergent solution
and followed by an effective disinfectant. The lack of a sanitation program can expose the guinea pigs to potential
disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. Licensee must establish and maintain a safe and
effective sanitation program to prevent health risks to the guinea pigs. Correct by April 11, 2019.
