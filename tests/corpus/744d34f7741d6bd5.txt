Veterinary care for dogs.
In the fawn barn there were two Havanese, two Shih Tzu and one poodle that were examined and had excessive mats
that covered them from head to toe.

An adult Havanese female dog in cage #5 had a blanket of tightly wound mats on the entire aspect of its back. The skin
that could be observed under the mats appeared flaky with debris and had balded where the mats were pulling.

In cage #7 there was an adult Havanese female and an adult Shih Tzu male that were observed to have excessively
matted hair. The adult male Shih Tzu had long knotted mats, one of which was visualized to be attached to it's anus
entrapping feces. The facility stated that this particular dog was difficult to catch, in which only the facility representative
could handle him.

The facility stated that the dogs had not been shaved due to the drop in temperature and cold snaps occurring at night.
Measures should be put in place to ensure the dogs could be groomed without shaving, preventing matting and ensuring
that they weren't subjected to the cold temperatures. Matting can be a painful condition that can lead to other health


concerns such as skin irritations and infections and the dogs must be groomed to prevent them. It can also make an
examination of the animals eyes, ears, skin and teeth difficult to perform. The facility must provide preventative care and
treatment to ensure healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin, and
teeth. Correct by May 24, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative.
