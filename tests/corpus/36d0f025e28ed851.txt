Handling of animals.

-The licensee obtained two Timber wolf puppies. These wolf pups were born April 16, 2022, and acquired by the facility
on June 9, 2022. The licensee allows public contact with the two wolf pups. The wolf pups are tethered to two different
trees with approximately 20-25' of plastic coated wire affixed to a harness around the wolf pup. An attendant was present
that was identified in jeans and blue t-shirt with a white facility logo. At no time did the attendant have control of the wolf
pups. The attendant observed the interactions with the public, but never held the wolf pup, or the leash to have control of
the wolf pups.

approximately 50 yards away. Additionally, the attendant’s view of the cavy enclosure was obstructed by the baboon
enclosure. Thus, preventing observation of any interactions between the public and the cavies.

During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with
