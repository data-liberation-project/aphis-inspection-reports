2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1600 on
27-Jun-17. I went to the facility. I spoke to a facility representative and was informed that no one was available to
take me through for inspection. I received the optimal hours for the facility and told the representative that I would
try again another day.
End of report.
