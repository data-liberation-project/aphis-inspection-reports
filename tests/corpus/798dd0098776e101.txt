2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Two animals have required veterinary care since the previous inspection but no documentation of the problems or
the veterinary evaluations, with diagnosis, treatment, or follow-up plans, were available for review during this
inspection.
--One female hedgehog, Paulie, had sustained injuries to both eyes in the Fall of 2014 leaving her blind. The
licensee stated this animal was taken to the Attending Veterinarian (AV) for examination at the time of the injuries
but no record of the incident, the examination, or the AV's assessment of the animal was made or obtained from the
AV by the licensee.
--One female hedgehog, Almond, was separated in an "isolation" cage for treatment for either a vaginal prolapse or
injury to the urogenital area, per the licensee. No documentation was made or obtained from the AV by the licensee
regarding when the condition was identified, the AV's diagnosis of the condition, treatment prescribed,
administration of the treatment by the licensee, and plan to follow-up to determine resolution or if further treatment is
needed.
Documentation of problems with animal health and behavior is an important component of the program for adequate
veterinary care in that it functions as a mechanism of communication between the AV and the licensee.
Documentation acts as a reference for the AV to ensure treatment was given as prescribed and was effective. It
also aids the AV during the annual visit to identify trends or areas of concerns for the overall program as well as
provides APHIS with a means to evaluate the compliance of the licensee with the veterinary care regulations.
A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on problems
of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending veterinarian.
To be corrected by 4/21/2015.
2.75(b)(1) REPEAT
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.The licensee had acquired 10 hedgehogs from three different sources since the previous inspection on 5/8/2014 but
no records of acquisition had been made that contained the date of acquisition, description of animal, or the seller's
information.
Another 13 animals were either unnamed at the time of the previous inspection or born to female hedgehogs on
premise since 5/8/2014 and were kept by the licensee. Records for animals that are born on premise are not being
consistently kept so that those that are weaned and sold versus those that are kept for either future breeding or sale
can be readily identified.
Records of acquisiton for animals acquired for use in regulated activities are required so that APHIS can determine
that animals are acquired legally and so that they can be identified and tracked throughout the inspection process.
Every dealer shall make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the required
information under the AWA concerning animals other than dogs and cats, purchased or otherwise acquired, owned,
held, leased, or otherwise in his or her possession or under his or her control. The records shall include any
offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession or under his or her control.
Accompanied on the inspection by the licensee and AC VMO, Tracy Thompson, DVM. Exit interview conducted on
4/8/2015 with the licensee.
