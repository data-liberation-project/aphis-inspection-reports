2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 145pm on
08/26/2014.
This is the sixth attempted inspection with negative results. There was a car in the driveway, however no one would
come to the door. The house phone is disconnected and the cell phone would not take messages. I stayed in the
driveway for 30 minutes, honking the horn every 5 minutes with no response. The licensee has never made any
attempts to call or contact this inspector in regards to the previous messages left on his phone, or to the personal
contact made with his son, or by the multiple attempted inspection reports he has been sent with my contact
information. This licensee continues to purposefully avoid inspections by refusing to communicate with the inspector
or for anyone to answer the door when they are home.
Please contact this inspector at 618-315-3649 ASAP in order to sort out optimal times for inspection.
