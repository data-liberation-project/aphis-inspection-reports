***** At time of inspection the pen which had housed the cow and three donkeys on the previous inspection was
now the pen housing a pig. The pen had large areas of standing water and mud. A means to rapidly eliminate
excess water needs to be put into place which will prevent this from being an on going problem. This will help to
keep the health and well-being of the animal from being compromised.
This inspection and exit interview conducted by APHIS, USDA, Animal Care Inspector and the designated person
for this inspection.
