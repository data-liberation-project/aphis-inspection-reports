On April 1st, 2014, a female cat named Lockett was found hanging by her front feet from a wall platform in building
4 that ultimately resulted in the animal being euthanized on April 3rd, 2014. The facility uses platforms that have a
metal framework with a plastic surface that are anchored to the wall by a hinge mechanism in the indoor cat rooms.
The platforms can be raised up during times of cleaning and then be lowered down to act as an elevated platform
for the cats. According to staff and documents from the Attending Veterinarian, the animal was discovered in the
morning of April 1st, 2014 unresponsive with its front paws caught in-between the hinge mechanism of the platform.
There was blood and urine on the nearby wall. According to medical records, the right front digit 1, 4, and 5 had
avulsed the toe nail. The left front digit 2 had a palpable fracture with an open wound on the palmar aspect adjacent
to the pad. Medical records also stated the animal was able to touch the platform below so the animal was not
hanging from all its weight. The animal received extensive care for its injuries but was euthanized on April 3rd for
unresponsiveness to treatment and a poor prognosis. The facility believes the animal was caught in the hinge
because the platform was not fully closed and the hinge mechanism poses no risk if the platforms are in its fully
open or closed position. Since the accident, the facility has incorporated two changes. First, all wall platforms will be
checked daily to make sure the platforms are securely in either the down or up position. Second, a staff member
will immediately check in on the cats in the morning to address any significant concerns. According to staff, there
has never been an injury associated with any of the wall platforms. The platforms were first used in 2006. Failure to
adequately train all personnel to close the platform resulted in significant injury and subsequent death to an animal.
Correct by ensuring all personnel are trained and qualified to properly use the wall platforms in a manner that
protects the cats from injury. Corrected following this incident.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the IACUC Chair.
