2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC approved guinea pig protocol did not provide a complete description of blood collection and the number
of times blood can be collected from a guinea pig. The description of blood collection is by "syringe via anterior
vena cava or lateral saphenous", but does not adequately describe the methods. The number of times that blood is
collected from the Guinea Pigs is "Study dependent". The approved Standard Operating Procedure for blood
collection does not include descriptions of blood collection from guinea pigs.
Inadequate descriptions of activities using animals may prevent the IACUC from identifying deficiencies in activities
and ensuring that animal activities are in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act. The procedures for blood
collection should be adequately described in the protocol or the approved facility SOP. It is the responsibility of the
IACUC to ensure that the investigator provides a complete description of proposed activities that involve the use of
animals in order that those activities may be adequately reviewed and determined to be in accordance with the
Animal Welfare Act.

PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Training records for facility animal caretakers and Contract Research Organization personnel directly involved in
research were not available at the time of inspection. In conjunction with the incomplete description of blood
collection and frequency in the Guinea Pig protocol, training records are important to ensure that the personnel
have a working understanding of the procedures since they are not sufficiently documented in the protocol or SOP.
It is the responsibility of the research facility to ensure that all scientists, research technicians, animal technicians,
and other personnel involved in animal care, treatment, and use are qualified to perform their duties. Training and instruction must be made available, and the qualifications of personnel reviewed, with sufficient
frequency to fulfill the research facilities responsibilities.
