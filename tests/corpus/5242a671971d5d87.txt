2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1800 on
28-Dec-16. I went to the licensee's house. A family member answered the door and informed me the licensee was
not home. They called him up and gave me the phone. He informed me he had to work overtime and was not
available to conduct the inspection. I informed him he would need to send me his optimal hours for the month of
January so we could complete his inspection. He stated he would he would email me his hours.
End of report.
