Section 3.9 Feeding
**** There are twelve feeders that have an excessive build up of grime inside the trough and has jagged edges. The
jagged edges can injure the dogs while eating. The excessive build up prevents proper cleaning and sanitization of
feeders along with contaminating feed. All feeders must be cleaned and sanitized to protect the feed from mold,
deterioration and caking. The jagged edges must be removed to protect the dogs from injuring themselves.
