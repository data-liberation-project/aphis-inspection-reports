2.1(a) Repeat

Requirements and application
The named individual has been operating as a dealer without a valid USDA license. He confirmed the number of animals
in his facility exceeds the threshold of four or fewer breeding females, and he has used commercial ground transportation
services to deliver puppies to customers. This type of business operation does not constitute a direct retail sale and
therefore, given the number of dogs maintained at the facility, requires a USDA license.

Unlicensed facilities are not subject to federal regulations or inspections, and so cannot be held accountable for the care
and well-being of their animals by APHIS officials.

Activities which require a license, including but not limited to hiring a commercial shipping company to deliver puppies,
must not continue unless a USDA license is obtained.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility owner.
