OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The outdoor shelters for nine adult Samoyed dogs do not have bedding provided. The ambient temperature was
approximately 6 degrees F at the time of inspection. While Samoyed dogs are cold tolerant dogs, lack of bedding
does not ensure for their health and comfort and can cause the dogs to become cold and stressed, making them
more susceptible to health problems. Provide bedding to outdoor shelters when ambient temperatures fall below 50
degrees F. Also, provide additional bedding to all outdoor shelters when the ambient temperatures are 35 degrees
F or lower. Correct by December 16, 2016.
