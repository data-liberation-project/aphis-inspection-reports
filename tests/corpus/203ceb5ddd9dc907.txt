3.4(b)

Outdoor housing facilities.
*** The outdoor runs in the back of the kennel have a singular large shelter for all the dogs in the enclosure. These runs
also need to have additional area of shade that is large enough to allow all the dogs to be out of the shelter and still have
protection from direct rays of the sun. This needs to be addressed for their well being.
