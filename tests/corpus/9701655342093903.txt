ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****
A female Shih Tzu, microchip #0A01262125, was observed by the inspectors scratching and shaking her head
repeatedly. Upon closer observation the inspectors noted that both of her inside ear flaps had thickened leather like
appearance. The right ear also had a yellowish discharge coming from the canal area. The neck and chest area of
this dog has a thickened and leather like appearance. When the inspector exposed the folded skin on the neck and
chest, the skin had patches of yellowish dried crusted material. The inspector also noted this dog had a very
prominent yeast like odor emitting from her. This excessive scratching, thickening of the skin, discharge from the
ears and crusted dried material on the skin could be a medical condition, could cause discomfort, and may be
painful. The licensee stated that "This dogs condition has been going on for years but gets worse when it gets a
haircut." When the inspector asked when the dog had a haircut the licensee replied that it was about a month ago.
When asked if this dog was currently receiving any treatment he replied "No, the dog is better than it usually is".
The licensee did say that he did have this dog treated in the past but the only documentation that was found was a
statement written by the licensee dated 7/3 which said he had talked to his attending veterinarian about hair growth
and was told it would take time. The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian for an appropriate
diagnosis and treatment plan. The licensee must document this information and make it available to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate care at all times.
