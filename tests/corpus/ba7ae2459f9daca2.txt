2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
During the 7/29/2014 evening performance, the licensee was seen allowing a member of the general public to hold
a horn in front of an elephant and feed an elephant. This member of the public was allowed behind the barricade
fence to have direct contact with the elephant during these events. While elephant handlers were present, they were
too far away to step in and interfere if required to prevent potential harm to this member of public. Ensure animals
are handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the public. Corrected at the time of inspection.
Elephants Inspected: Shannon - African, 33 years and Cora - Asian, 54 years
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with licensees.
End of report.
