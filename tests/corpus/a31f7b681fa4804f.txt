Handling of animals.
When I first arrived on the premise, I noticed that an employee was with a family as they entered the outdoor rabbit
enclosure. However, after a few minutes this employee left the family and returned to the building. The mother and 2
small children were left unattended in the rabbit enclosure. A responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable
employee or attendant must be present at all times during periods of public contact. If the public is allowed direct access
to any of the mammals, a staff member needs to be present to ensure the safety of the animals and the public. This
situation will need to be addressed.

Facilities, outdoor.
A new raccoon enclosure was recently built. However, it was not built within the already existing perimeter fenced area. In
order to keep unwanted animals and unauthorized people from gaining access to this raccoon, and to function as a
secondary containment system for this animal, a 6’ tall perimeter fence needs to be constructed around this enclosure.

Facilities, general.
1. The north American porcupine enclosure has a wooden den/box present in the back right corner. Inside this box there
is an additional shelf present ~ 2’ up from the base. However, the left side of this box has begun to detach from the back
wall. The portion of the wall that is detaching is at the level of the shelf. There is now a gap, that starts small, but ends
with an ~5” gap present between two sections of the wall. To ensure that the porcupine does not get injured on this gap,
the wall will need to be repaired.

2. The bennet wallaby enclosure is also in need of attention. The right side of the wood wall, that is adjacent to the
kangaroo enclosure, has holes and damage present. The damage varies in size from small chewed areas to a hole that is
~ 2” x 5”. To ensure that the wallaby is not injured in any way, this wall will need to be addressed.

Facilities, general.
The extra bags of food and bedding are being stored in a trailer to the left of the building. The doors to this trailer are not
secure. Therefore, rodents have been able to gain access. This is evident by the chewed bags in the back, left corner and
in the area when you walk into the trailer. These contaminated bags of food and bedding cannot be used for the regulated
animals on the premise. A storage system needs to be in place to ensure that the food and bedding are stored properly.

Housing facilities, general.
The squirrel monkey enclosure is in need of repair. The back wall has areas of chewed wallboard present. This area is
~3” x 5” on the upper section of the back wall. This does not allow for the proper cleaning or sanitation of the enclosure.
Therefore, this wall and any other areas of damaged wallboard will need to be addressed.
