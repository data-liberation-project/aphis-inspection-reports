ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***In the pig enclosure, there were at least eleven pigs that had varying degrees of hair loss. The hair loss revealed
scaly and crusty skin. One small black pig had two small scabbed over areas on its left side and one small scabbed
over area on its left center hip. One medium black pig had a dark brown, roughened, raised area on its right upper
hip. One spotted pig had a black raised area approximately the size of a quarter on its left flank area. The licensee
stated that the pigs had been treated yesterday for the hair loss with dewormer and that they were going to see if
this treatment would help. The licensee also stated that that the attending veterinarian had not been contacted
concerning this issue. Hair loss is an abnormal situation that could indicate a serious medical condition. The
licensee must contact a licensed veterinarian for appropriate treatment instructions for this condition and follow the
treatment plan. The license must also ensure that accurate information concerning medical issues for all of the
animals is relayed to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner as required.
