ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***APHIS inspector discovered a Syrian hamster with a large mass on the left side of the head. The mass was
hairless, with most of it covered by a scab. There were two areas that contained beads of pus. The left eye was not
visible due to the size of the mass. To the right side of the large mass was a smaller bump of tissue. The hair
surrounding the right eye was patch and missing in spots. The hamster’s overall hair coat was unthrifty and patchy.
The facility representative stated that they had not noticed this condition prior to the inspection.
A mass is an indication of disease and can often be painful for the animal. It can result from numerous causes
including both infectious and non-infectious. Failure to contact the attending veterinarian regarding the diagnosis
and treatment can result in delays of appropriate care and prolong suffering of the animal. The facility representative
was informed verbally that this hamster must be examined by a veterinarian no later than 6:00pm on April 16, 2018.

* **In an enclosure containing four Syrian hamsters, APHIS inspector discovered the remains of a hamster. In an
enclosure containing 5 Syrian hamsters and another enclosure containing 6 Syrian hamsters, APHIS inspector
discovered the remains of a hamster. The carcasses and skin were dried out, indicating that the remains had been
in the enclosure for more than a day. The facility representative stated that the employee in charge of the hamsters
is supposed to perform daily observations of the animals.
Failure to properly observe the animals and their enclosures can lead to the facility missing medical conditions and
for animal carcasses to stay in the enclosure for extended periods of time. Failure to remove animal bodies in a
timely manner can increase the risk of disease for other animals in the enclosure.
To be corrected from this date forward.
Failure to observe and properly communicate animal health issues to the attending veterinarian in a timely manner
can result in prolonged pain and suffering for the animal and potentially worsen a current medical condition. Daily
observation of all animals is critical to ensuring that conditions that can adversely affect health and well-being are
recognized in a timely manner. Additionally, when observed, problems relating to animal health or behavior must be
conveyed to the attending veterinarian so that appropriate methods can be employed to ensure adequate care. Thefacility must conduct daily observations of all animals to ensure that all health and behavioral concerns are found in
a timely manner and appropriately communicated with the attending veterinarian.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals
at the facility.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with two facility representatives.
