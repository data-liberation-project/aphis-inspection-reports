HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Rabbits & guinea pigs are being housed in large uncovered rectangular wooden boxes inside the small animal
building. The public is only allowed access into this area if they are escorted by the facility tour guides. On today's
inspection, when we arrived, there was an adult & a child alone in this building unescorted.
These animals are easily within reach of the public and can be picked up or touched easily. These species of
animals can be easily injured with improper handling by a member of the public who is inexperienced in the proper
handling of these animals.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.

SANITATION.
There were many flies on the faces and bodies of Elmer (water buffalo), alpacas, & zebu. These flies were in
sufficient numbers to cause ear flicking, muscle twitching, and tail swishing which all indicate that these flies are
causing discomfort & stress to these animals.
At some of these exhibits, there were accumulations of fecal matter that were cleaned out of the enclosures and
were being temporarily placed in adjacent areas in close proximity to the animal enclosures. These accumulations
serve as a source of attraction for flies.animals.regardless of the time that they are present in these areas.
Accumulations of flies on animals cause stress, discomfort, irritations,& possible wounds if they are biting flies.
Establish a safe & effective fly control program in consultation with the veterinarian to minimize the numbers of flieson and around the animal enclosures. Quickly removing or covering the fecal matter from the animal areas may
help to facilitate fly control.
