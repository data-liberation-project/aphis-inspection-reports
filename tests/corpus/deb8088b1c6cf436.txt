SANITATION.
An aquarium housing dwarf hamsters has an infestation of insects present on the inside glass, and a spider has
built a web in one of the corners probably due to the presence of the insects. There is also a build up of bedding
dust on the lid and inside the container. These are all indicators that the enclosure is not being thoroughly cleaned.
For the animals health and well being, the enclosure needs to be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized and completely
fresh bedding used. If possible, the source of the insects should be determined. Complete by 6/17/14
An exit interview was conducted with the staff.
