2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
The new cotton top tamarin exhibit has a barrier fence which has one horizontal structure attached to several
vertical posts. The height of the horizontal structure can easily allow the public(especially small children) to pass
underneath and through to gain access to the exhibit. The foliage that is planted around the exhibit is not a
deterrent & would not prevent the public from gaining direct access to the exhibit either.
At the time of the inspection there was a uniformed employee present at the exhibit. This inspector was informed
that there would be an employee present at all times when the park is open. Later in the day, the inspection took us
past this exhibit again. At that time there was no employee present anywhere in the general area.
The present barrier fence &/or employee supervision does not assure that there is a minimum risk of harm to the
animals and the public.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The opening to the den in the patagonian cavy's enclosure measures 13 inches high. This height is insufficient for
this animal to gain access into the den while maintaining a normal postural adjustment. The cavy must bend down
to gain access. The den also contains the water receptacle for this exhibit.
All enclosures shall be constructed so that the animals contained within can make normal postural adjustments to
areas where they are fed, watered & sheltered.Correct by October 15, 2015
