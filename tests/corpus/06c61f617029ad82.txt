ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00 pm on
31-Oct-17.
I arrived at the site and the gates were closed. I attempted to make contact by phone using the two numbers on
record for the facility. The messaging systems were not set up so I was unable to leave a message at either
number. Please contact me to update your information.
