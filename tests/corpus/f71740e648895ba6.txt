Access and inspection of records and property; submission of itineraries.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:00-2:15pm on 27-
JAN-22. I knocked on the east facing doors of the home, but there was no answer. I called Dennis Van Wyk and he
informed me that he was in Iowa City and could not return for the the inspection.
