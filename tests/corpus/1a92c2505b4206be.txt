FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The shade structure in the enclosure housing 2 pot-bellied pigs had several screws protruding down on the
underside. The screws pose a risk of injury to the animals. A system should be in place and maintained to ensure all
animal facilities are structurally sound, in good repair and protect the animals from injury.
Corrected during the inspection.
Exit interview was conducted on-site with facility representatives.
