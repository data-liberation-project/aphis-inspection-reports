2.131(d)(2) Repeat

Handling of animals.
The inspector could not locate an attendant during public interactions at the deer exhibit. During this inspection, a group of
thirteen patrons were observed feeding the deer without an attendant present. While the facility has restructured their
staffing personnel and made the attendants easily identifiable at the zoo, no attendants could be visualized in this area of
the facility.

Oversight of public contact is necessary to safeguard animal encounters and prevent injuries to the public. The facility
must ensure that a responsible, knowledgeable and readily identifiable employee or attendant is present at all times
during periods of public contact.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and licensee.
