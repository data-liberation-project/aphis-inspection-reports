3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** A large amount of flies was present in buildings 24, 36, 45, 47, and 74. Several of these building were older and
had puppies with wet food present which was an additional attractant to the flies. Although there was evidence of fly
strips the current method is not effective enough to reduce contamination of pests in these buildings. This needs to
be addressed and additional methods implemented to reduce pests in the area.
