2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
Handling.
1.(cid:9)In July 2016, two non-compatible non-human primates (NHPs) were accidentally placed into the same cage by
facility personnel. The monkeys fought and both underwent surgery to repair serious wounds. Both animals
required multiple weeks of veterinary care but made full recoveries. Improper pairing of animals can lead to serious
injury to animals.
2.(cid:9)During routine pen cleaning in December 2016, doors between two outdoor enclosures were left open at the
same time. A monkey had been inadvertently left in the outdoor pen while the rest of the group were locked in the
inside portion of their enclosure. This monkey moved from its pen into the other pen through the open doors during
the cleaning process and was unnoticed by staff. When the monkeys were allowed access to their outdoor
enclosures following completion of the cleaning, the unfamiliar monkey was injured by the residents of that
enclosure. The injured monkey underwent surgery to repair the wounds and made a full recovery. Improper
handling of animals can lead to serious injury to animals.
The facility promptly acted to address both of these incidents by conducting investigations, reporting the incidents to
OLAW, and immediately implementing appropriate corrective actions to prevent similar incidents in the future.
3.(cid:9)In May 2016, a rabbit being removed from its enclosure struggled while being handled. The staff member noted
that the right rear leg was positioned at an unusual angle. The veterinary staff was promptly contacted and it was
determined via radiography that the rabbit had sustained a fracture of the distal limb. The animal was humanely
euthanized. Improper handling of animals can lead to serious injury to animals.
The facility promptly acted to address this incident by conducting an investigation and immediately implementing
appropriate corrective actions to avoid similar incidents in the future.
Per this section of the regulations, handling of animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a
manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort. These 3 items have been corrected. (cid:9)
This inspection was conducted on March 13-15, 2017. The exit interview was conducted on March 15, 2017, with
facility representatives.
