FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A big horned sheep (BHS) escaped from her exhibit by jumping over an approximately 7 to 8 foot exhibit wall and
an additional barrier fence surrounding the exhibit. A facility representative stated that the incident occurred while
the animal was out on exhibit with a keeper who was performing routine cleaning of this area. The facility
representative stated that the keeper made attempts to lock out the BHS from the exhibit prior to cleaning, but the
BHS would not go into the back holding area with the 4 other animals for feeding.
Although immediate assistance from zoo personnel, including keepers and the veterinary staff, was utilized, they
were unable to capture the BHS on the premises. The facility representative stated that the BHS made its way over
to a second floor walkway/ balcony that overlooks the perimeter fence, and jumped over it. After leaving the zoo
grounds, the BHS was hit by a car but was able to travel to an adjoining neighborhood where it was darted and
captured by zoo veterinarians and staff members. The animal died shortly after.

Further evaluation of the construction and layout of the exhibit and the walkway/balcony that overlooks the
perimeter fence is needed. According to a facility representative, measures, in addition to those already in place,
are being taken to minimize the risk of animals escaping from this enclosure and over a section of the perimeter
fence.
Animal housing facilities should be structurally sound and maintained in a manner that protects the animals from
injury and to contain the animals.
