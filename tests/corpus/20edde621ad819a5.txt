INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
At time of inspection, current appointment letters for the IACUC were not available. The appointment letters on file
expired in February of 2014. According to a facility representative, there has not been any covered animals or
activities conducted at the facility in the past year.
Without current appointment letters, we cannot verify the facility has an IACUC in place.
It is the resposibility of the Chief Executive Officer of the research facility to appoint an IACUC to assess the
research facility's animal program, facilites, and procedures. A system shoudl be in place to ensure appointment
letters are updated as needed to reflect the current IACUC membership.
To be corrected by September 15, 2014
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
