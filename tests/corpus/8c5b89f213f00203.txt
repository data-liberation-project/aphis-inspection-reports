2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The program of veterinary care states that the arctic foxes are to be treated monthly for external parasites using
NexGard. The last dose of NexGard was administered to the arctic foxes on 30 November 2016. No doses were
given in December 2016 or January 2017 according to the licensee’s records. Failure to follow the program of
veterinary care or other directions from the attending veterinarian can result in a variety of medical and husbandry
problems with the animals. The licensee must use appropriate methods to control, diagnose and treat diseases and
injuries as directed by the attending veterinarian.
3.75(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were chunks of concrete broken away from the flooring patch present on the floor of one black and white
ruffed lemur enclosure.
One wooden support for the divider fence of one ring-tailed lemur enclosure has come loose from it's upper point.
Surfaces that are not kept in good repair could result in injury to the animals. Housing facilities must be designed
and constructed so that they are structurally sound and kept in good repair. Correct by 15 Feb. 2017.
3.81(c)(4) REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The special considerations in the Environmental Enhancement plan for the individually housed colobus states “If
housed alone then they have mirrors to reflect the impression of the other primates near them and/or recorded
vocalizations of additional species. In addition they are provided additional foraging items to challenge them.”
During the inspection, the one individually housed black and white colobus at the facility was confined to the indoor
portion of this sheltered enclosure and while he had a mirror reflecting back at himself, it was not allowing him to
view other primates and he was not provided with recorded vocalizations. There was food in the enclosure but no
evidence or documentation of additional foraging beyond what is provided to all other non-human primates at the
facility. The licensee reports that this animal is visually impaired but can see shadows. The licensee must follow the
written environment enhancement plan that outlines the special attention to be given to any individually housed
nonhuman primate that is not able to see or hear nonhuman primates of their own or compatible species. Thesespecial considerations must be based on the needs of the individual species and be in accordance to the
instructions of the attending veterinarian.
3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an exposed metal edge in the feed bunk located in the indoor portion of the camel barn.
There is a jagged metal edge near the upper side of a round bale feeder, last used as a tree ring in the deer
enclosure.
The zebras had access through an opened gate to a storage area that had used metal cages, metal panels, barrels,
branches and other debris. In addition, there were numerous strands of baling twine and sections of hoses
scattered throughout the vicinity immediately in front of and inside the zebra shelter.
Jagged metal edges and discarded material could pose an injury threat to the animals. All facilities must be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. Correct by 15 Feb. 2017.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
There is an excessive accumulation of feces in the chinchilla enclosures. The licensee states these are cleaned on
a weekly basis. Feces and food residue were observed scattered across the floor. This waste covered the majority
of the floor surfaces. Excessive feces can contaminate the animals and increase disease transmission. Feces
must be removed from enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals and minimize
disease hazards. Correct by 9 February 2017.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
