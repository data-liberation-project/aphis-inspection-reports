HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(f) Drainage and waste disposal
***There was an accumulation of hair, grime and organic material on the drainage pipes and the wire fencing walls
of two enclosures housing a total of 3 adult dogs in the outdoor portion of the sheltered building. The drainage
pipes present in the two enclosures had a buildup of hair, grime and organic material around the upper
circumference of the pipes where they meet the drainage pipes from the upper wash downs. There were small
spaces visible between where these two drainage pipes met in each enclosure. An accumulation of hair, grime and
organic debris was also present on the walls of the enclosures adjacent to the drainage pipes and wash downs.
The accumulation of hair, grime and organic debris can increase the risk of odors, pests and disease hazards. The
spaces between the drainage pipe connections increase the risk of waste leakage into the enclosures where the
dogs are housed. The licensee must ensure that the drainage pipes are properly constructed, installed and
maintained. The licensee washed down most of the hair, grime and organic material at the time of inspection. To
be corrected by: February 18, 2016.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee, Josh Moore (CS) and Dr. Erika Leisner (VMO).
