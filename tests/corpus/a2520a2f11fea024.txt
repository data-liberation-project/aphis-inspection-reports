ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1458 on
18-Sep-17. I went to the registrant's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I left my business card on
the door. I attempted to call the registrant, but the phone number had been disconnected. I waited 30 minutes and
then left.
End of report.
