REGISTRATION.
The researchers began a study involving activities with animals when they had not yet registered with USDA.
Using animals for medical research without a USDA registration does not enable USDA to conduct routine
inspections so as to verify that the activities are compliant with the Animal Welfare Act regulations. These
regulations and the inspection process were designed to help ensure the well-being of the animals. The researchers
must immediately register with USDA prior to conducting any further activities.
2.33(b)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The researchers have conducted nineteen surgical procedures in a room that does not meet minimum standards for
surgery. The surgery table and shelves are made of a porous material (wood), there are cardboard boxes stored in
the surgery room, and there is not an adequate non-porous door to separate the surgery room from the rest of the
facility.
Invasive surgical procedures should be performed in a designated surgery room that provides an aseptic
environment and meets minimum standards. Failure to utilize an appropriate surgical facility could result in
post-procedure infections.
To be corrected immediately, and prior to conducting any further procedures.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The sheep for the research project were being housed in an enclosure with an overhanging roof that had faulty
supports. At the base of the supporting 4x4 wood posts, where they attached to the cement, there was significant
wood rot and separation from bent metal connectors, so that their structural strength was seriously compromised.
All structures housing animals should be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair in order toprotect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
To be corrected immediately.

WATERING.
The water for the sheep on study was in two large tanks, and both had a significant accumulation of greenish-brown
material on the inside surfaces under the water, as well as plant material floating on top that had fallen in from a tree
above. The larger tank also contained orange fish.
Water should be kept clean and sanitary. The presence of contaminants could result in bacterial or algal growth
that could be harmful to the animals.
To be corrected immediately.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
