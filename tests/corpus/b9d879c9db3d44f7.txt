2.38(f)(1)

Miscellaneous.
During the review of IACUC meeting minutes for January 2022, February 2022, and April 2022, three separate incidents
of non-human primate escapes were identified. The incident in the January 2022 IACUC meeting minutes occurred on
January 5, 2022. A macaque escaped during a cage change due to the animal care technician not returning the lock that
secured the guillotine door. The incident from the February 2022 minutes occurred on January 17, 2022. Two macaques
escaped during a cage change. An investigation was conducted by the facility personnel. It was undetermined if the lock
was checked by the animal care technicians or if the lock was faulty. The facility did determine that the incident was due
to human error. The incident in the April 2022 IACUC minutes occurred on March 29, 2022. A marmoset escaped from its
enclosure when an animal care technician attempted to weigh it with a weighing cage. All the primates in the three
incidents sustained minor injuries. All animals were immediately examined and treated by a clinical veterinarian.

Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma,
overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.



This was corrected by the facility by retraining all animal care technicians and laboratory staff. Animal care technicians
involved in the incidents received individual training and additional monitoring from supervisors.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.

This inspection was conduction from 09/07/2022 to 09/08/2022.
