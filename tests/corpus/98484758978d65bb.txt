ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One guinea pig was observed to have an eye condition that had not been noticed by the staff and thus had not
been reported to the attending veterinarian. Light pink colored tissue below the globe of both eyes that appeared to
be swollen conjunctiva was protruding beyond the level of the eyelids. The swelling appeared to be causing a
downward distortion of both eyelids.
Failure to treat health conditions may lead to unnecessary pain and distress in animals. The facility should ensure
that animals are appropriately monitored and health conditions are conveyed to the attending veterinarian in a
timely manner.
Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
