Facilities, outdoor.
The facility currently houses one guinea pig outdoors without prior approval from the Deputy Administrator. Housing
guinea pigs in unsuitable environments can jeopardize their health and cause significant stress, especially as a prey
species. Guinea pigs shall not be housed outdoors unless such facilities are located in an appropriate climate and prior
approval for outdoor housing is obtained from the Deputy Administrator.

Primary enclosures.
The guinea pig primary enclosure is constructed of unsealed wood. Bare wood must be sealed or covered with a surface
that is impervious to moisture, allowing surfaces to be cleaned and sanitized sufficiently.
Primary enclosures shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the guinea pigs and hamsters
from injury. Such enclosures, including their racks, shelving and other accessories, shall be constructed of smooth
material substantially impervious to liquids and moisture.

Facilities, outdoor.
Rabbits were not provided with artificial cooling when the ambient temperature exceeded 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Though
the outdoor enclosure housing the seven rabbits provided sufficient shade from direct sunlight, the kestrel temperature
measured 93.6F at the time of inspection near one of the rabbits in the enclosure.
Rabbits are sensitive to excessive heat. Lack of additional cooling when ambient temperatures are elevated can result in
heat stress, extreme discomfort, or debilitating illness. The licensee shall provide artificial cooling such as a sprinkler
system or other means when temperatures exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

Watering.
The outdoor enclosure housing seven rabbits did not have clean drinking water. The housing area had a round water bowl
containing cloudy water with several chunks of substrate, straw, and materials settled in the bowl. Although daily
husbandry was performed this morning, the water bowl was not changed or cleaned.
The availability of potable water is necessary for the health, sustenance, and well-being of the animals. All water
receptacles shall be sanitized when dirty: Provided, however, that such receptacles shall be sanitized at least once every
two weeks.
