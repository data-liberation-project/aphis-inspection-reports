FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** On the northwest side of the pasture the fencing containing the cattle was in disrepair. There were three holes in
the fencing along the road and there was a large hole under the fencing. This hole was large enough for a
medium-sized dog to potentially crawl through. The fencing needs to be repaired or replaced for the safety of the
animals. The fencing shall be structurally sound and maintained to keep predators out and to contain the animals
within. Correct by March 30, 2015
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the attending veterinarian.
