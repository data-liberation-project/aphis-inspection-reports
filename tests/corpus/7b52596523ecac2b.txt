3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the cat enclosures there are surfaces that are not constructed or maintained in a manner that allows them to be
readily cleaned and sanitized.
There is a section of dry wall above the cat perches in the cat rooms where, in multiple places, the cats have
scratched into the drywall, and the surface is damaged and not impervious to moisture, which impedes cleaning and
disinfecting.
In an isolation ward, there are two cat enclosures that have significant rust, which can impede cleaning and
disinfecting.
Although significant improvements are in progress, there are still some areas in the cat area have wood that is
deteriorated, or that has been worn bare, with no sealant, which could impede cleaning and disinfecting.
Surfaces in the cat area should be constructed of appropriate materials, maintained in good repair so they can be
readily cleaned and disinfected, so as to maintain a healthy environment for the cats.

3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The enclosures for the deer and goats have some fencing that is in ill-repair, and may pose a hazard to the animals.
Some sections of fencing are bent outwards, with a gap between the cement flooring of the enclosure, and the
fence. Where the fencing comes together there are gaps with wire ends protruding, that could pose a risk of
entanglement and injury. A gate has mesh chain link fencing that is pushed down, and poses a risk of
entanglement. Some fencing does not appear to be sturdy enough to resist pressure that could be applied by the
animals.Enclosures should be maintained in good repair so that they protect the animals from harm or escape.
