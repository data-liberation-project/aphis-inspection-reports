On 9 March 2017 an adult sheep underwent a cardiac bypass procedure under "protocol C." This sheep was
euthanized by the veterinary staff on 13 March 2017 for complications. "Protocol C" was not approved for survival
surgeries or the cardiac bypass that was conducted on the sheep. Since Protocol C contained no survival surgeries,
the IACUC had not reviewed requirements for after care such as recovery, analgesia, post-operative monitoring.
Following the animals death, lab personnel tried to transfer the deceased animal to another approved protocol
which contained a cardiac bypass and recovery. The incident was investigated by the IACUC and according to
facility documentation the change was made by lab staff post-mortem to avoid noncompliance.
On 3 March 2017 another incident was noted involving a lamb was scheduled under "protocol A" for a cardiac
device implant. After the animal had been anesthetized and prepped for surgery it was decided by the investigator
that animal was not a candidate for the "protocol A" surgery. The animal was recovered from surgery and several
weeks later the investigator decided to use this animal under "protocol B" in which a by-pass would be conducted.
This animal was not approved for transfer between "protocol A" and "protocol B" prior to the surgery being
conducted. The by-pass conducted is not an approved procedure under the protocol in which the animal was
assigned.
The university has re-trained staff and created several safeguards to help prevent future re-occurrence. Under the
current Veterinary Verification and Consultation SOP, the veterinary staff will review animal transfers at least 24
hours in advance of the procedure.
Procedure conducted by investigators that are unapproved by the IACUC may lead to unnecessary pain and
distress for the animals. IACUC must review and approve, require modifications in (to secure approval), or withhold
approval of proposed significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities.

The large animal surgical suite cannot be appropriately sanitized to ensure that aseptic surgeries can be conducted.
The surgical suite and surgical prep areas have a concrete ceiling with many pipes running through the area. These
pipes are directly adjacent to the surgery table. These exposed pipes are difficult to clean and sanitize and harbor
dust and bacteria that can expose patients to unnecessary risk. The exposed pipes do not allow for the surgery
suite to be maintained under aseptic conditions. Major operative procedures on will be conducted only in facilities
intended for that purpose which shall be operated and maintained under aseptic conditions.
