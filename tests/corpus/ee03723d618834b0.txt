2.38(f)(1) CRITICAL
MISCELLANEOUS.
On 7-15-16 a breeding cage of peromyscus was found in the afternoon with an empty water bottle and one dead
adult and one dead pup. The other adult and two pups were treated, but died the next day. This strain of
peromyscus is particularly sensitive to environmental changes.
The assigned caretaker failed to make health checks to assure all animals had food and water. Water bottles in this
facility were periodically leaking, so the staff was told to be particularly attentive to the water bottles.
The animal caretaker failed to provide adequate observation and care of the animals assigned to her and this
resulted in distress and death of five animals.
The facility took multiple corrective actions by thoroughly investigating the incident, replacing the caretaker,
retraining all staff in proper procedures for daily health checks, replacing the water bottles, and moving the animals
to a possibly quieter room.

This item is found to be corrected at this inspection since no further incidents have occurred in the past year.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Attending Veterinarian and IACUC staff.
