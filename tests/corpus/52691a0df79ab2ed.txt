2.1(a)(1)
REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATION.
The facility failed to renew their exhibitor license. At the time of inspection it was discovered that the animals are
being exhibited to the public, despite the fact that the facility is not currently licensed. It should also be noted that
the facility had recognized this oversight, and requested a new application packet the day before. The facility has
agreed not to exhibit the covered species on site until the licensing process is complete.
Exhibiting animals outside of compliance with the Animal Welfare Act regulations could be detrimental to the
animals, as these regulations were devised to protect their welfare by providing for regulatory oversight.
Regulated animals will not be exhibited to the public beginning close of business day, 9/29/16, and until such time
as new license is obtained.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representatives.
