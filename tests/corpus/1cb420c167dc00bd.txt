Watering
3.10(a) Critical
On February 18, 2022, it was discovered that 20 dogs housed in the same enclosure had been without water for up to 24
hours. The dogs arrived at the facility on February 17, 2022, at 7:28 am. Prearrival checks showed water was flowing to
the enclosure. But at the 9:00 am check the next day, it was discovered that there was no water pressure to the water
supply for the enclosure. Two open valves in the water line were found to be the cause of the loss of pressure. All dogs
were examined, and 25% were found to be between 5 and 10% dehydrated. All dogs received treatment with fluids and
supplemental wet food and all fully recovered.
On May 6, 2022, 4 dogs sharing the same enclosure were found to be without water. An employee discovered the
problem when they heard water running. The water line to the enclosure had become disconnected. The waterline was
immediately reconnected. The dogs had been checked about an hour earlier and the water connection was fine. All dogs
were examined by veterinary staff, were healthy, and no treatment was necessary.
Since these incidents, the facility has increased their daily monitoring of the water system to go beyond the previous twice
daily checks of lixits (waterers inside the enclosures). Now those twice daily observations include checks of connections
between the enclosure and main water lines and checking valves in the line. Photographs of what the correct valve


positions should be have also been posted in the rooms. There are plans to install “quick connect” connections which
automatically stop water flow when not connected and investigations into electronic methods of constantly monitoring
water flow are also underway.
Potable water, essential for the health and wellbeing of dogs, must be continuously available.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
