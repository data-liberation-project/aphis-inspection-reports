MISCELLANEOUS.
Access and inspection of records and property.
1. The inspector arrived at the site location address at 2:25 PM on 6/3/14 to conduct an AWA inspection but there
wasn't anyone on the premises. The inspector then tried to contact the registrant by telephone but the call went
straight to voice mail and a message including the inspector's contact information was left. The inspector then went
to the facility mailing address location but there wasn't anyone on the premises.
An AWA compliance inspection could not be conducted because there was no facility representative available to
provide access to the property and accompany the inspector.
Unannounced inspections to determine compliance with the provisions of the AWA are required to assess the
facility
and the animals.
Correct from this date forward.
NOTE - This is the FIRST attempted inspection of this recently registered research facility. Report delivered by both
regular first class and certified mail.*END OF REPORT*
