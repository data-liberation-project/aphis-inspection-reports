SANITATION.
*Two fly strips above the treatment stall for the goats were full of flies. There were some cobwebs attached to the
back and sides of the stall.
Debris from older fly strips and cobwebs could allow for contamination of equipment during procedures or while
routinely handling the animals. In addition, as weather warms, fly strips that are full may not adequately control flies.
Premises shall be kept clean in order to protect the animals from injury.
Corrected at time of inspection.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the President.
