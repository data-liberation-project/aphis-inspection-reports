ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:35 pm on
24-Oct-17.
I arrived at the facility, knocked on the front door several times. I returned to the car and called the number on file. I
left a message stating I was at the facility for an inspection and asked for a return call. I left the facility at 2:48 pm
and waited in the area for another 1/2 hour. Please contact me with your hours of availability.
