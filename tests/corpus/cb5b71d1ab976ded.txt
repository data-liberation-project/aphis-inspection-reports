ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
At least twelve wolves were identified as having fly strikes on their ears. The tips of the ears were red and crusted.
The ears had a chewed up appearance. Flies were observed to be flying around the wolves' ears and heads. The
wolves appeared to be uncomfortable by this as they were frequently observed to be shaking their heads. Fly
strikes causes irritation and discomfort to the wolves. It can lead to infection and in severe cases the flies can lay
eggs in the wounds which will later hatch into maggots. The licensee has been treating the wolves for fly strikes,
but the treatment is clearly not working and needs to be reevaluated. The licensee must consult with the Attending
Veterinarian to determine what treatment should be given to the wolves from here on out. Correct by 7/18/17.
2.75(b)(1)(i)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
An artic fox was given (donated) to the licensee since the last full inspection that was completed on 10/25/16. The
person the licensee received the fox from purchased the fox from an unlicensed breeder/dealer, decided they didn't
want the fox, and then surrendered the fox to the licensee. The licensee was able to produce a record of where the
fox originally came from (the unlicensed breeder/dealer), but they were not able to produce any records showing the
name and address of who they received the fox from. Not properly keeping purchase or acquisition records does
not allow for proper tracking of the animals by an APHIS official. All purchase and acquisition records must be kept
for one year after the animal leaves the facility. Correct immediately.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
End of report.
