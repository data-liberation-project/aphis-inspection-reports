ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A pregnant female Golden Doodle, microchip # 0A01774913, was observed by an employee to be (cid:28)a little thin(cid:29) in
her outdoor enclosure on 3 November 2015. According to the licensee she brought the dog into a sheltered
enclosure and started her on puppy food, (cid:28)Dyne(cid:29) (a nutritional supplement), and dewormed her with pyrantel. On
approximately 9 or 10 November 2015 the licensee recalled that this dog was not eating. On 11 November 2015
the licensee recalled that the dog (cid:28)was not doing well(cid:29). On 12 November 2015 the licensee presented the dog to a
veterinarian for an emergency Caesarian section. The veterinarian that performed the emergency Caesarian
section noted that the dog had a body condition score of a 1 out of 9 (meaning emaciated), had liquid diarrhea, and
that while at the clinic had passed a handful of roundworms.
During the time period of 3 November to 12 November (9 days) the licensee did not contact nor consult with a
veterinarian about the worsening and debilitated condition of this dog. This could have been a medical issue that
required veterinary care. All animals must be observed daily for problems of animal health and their well-being.
These problems must be frequently and directly communicated to a licensed veterinarian for a diagnosis and
treatment to best provide for the health and well-being of the animals. The licensee must observe animals daily for
problems and communicate any problems to a licensed veterinarian in a timely manner.
To be corrected from this day forward.
This is a focused inspection specifically addressing veterinary care issues that were identified, obtained and
reviewed from a complaint on a female Golden Doodle, microchip #0A01774913. An inspection and a verbal exit
were conducted with the licensee and ACI Stephanie Osborne.
