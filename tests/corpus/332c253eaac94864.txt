2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Rottweiler (Allie, microchip #135259763A) has a green/brown discharge around both eyes. There are also
areas of brown crusty material located around the eyes. The licensee thought the dog might have an allergy. There
was no documentation from a veterinarian about this dog's condition. Discharge around the eyes could indicate an
underlying health problem. This dog must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for proper diagnosis and
treatment plan. The diagnosis and treatment plan must be documented and available to the inspectors upon
request.
3.4(b)(4) REPEAT
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
A plastic dog house being used by an adult female Shiba Inu within an outdoor enclosure does not contain any
bedding material. The temperature during the inspection was 38.0 degrees Fahrenheit. This can be uncomfortable
for the dog and could contribute to health problems. Outdoor shelters must contain clean and dry bedding material if
the ambient temperature is below 50 degrees Fahrenheit to help the dog conserve body heat. The licensee must
provide additional bedding when the temperature is below 35 degrees Fahrenheit.
The licensee provided a plastic dog house containing clean and dry bedding at the time of inspection.
Exit interview was conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI, Corbin Ranslem, ACI and the facility representative.
