FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Wallabies, kangaroo and muntjac are housed in a large enclosure with an 8 foot high primary enclosure fence but
the enclosure is surrounded by a perimeter fence which is only 4 feet in height. A fence less than 6 feet high for
these animals must be approved in writing by the Administrator. The fence must be constructed so that it protects
the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized persons from going through it or under it and
having contact with the animals in the facility, and so that it can function as a secondary containment system for the
animals in the facility. It must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical
contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence.
A request for a variance which describes the size of the property and current fence in place may be sent to :
