Housing facilities, general.
USDA inspectors identified an opening at the roof of an enclosure housing two white-faced capuchins. The metal shade
structures on the roof had collapsed inward, breaking the metal support structures holding the metal fencing together and
creating an opening large enough for the animals to escape. The two capuchins were immediately removed the from
damaged enclosure and reestablished in a secure one. Animals may be injured or harmed when they access outside
areas. Gaining unauthorized access outside could have resulted in animal or human injury. Housing facilities for
nonhuman primates shall be structurally sound and maintained to protect and contain the animals securely.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

Feeding.
USDA inspectors identified a plastic Tupperware container in the Munchkin land kitchen containing dry peanuts that were
growing a green fuzzy mold. The container top had been left slightly ajar and the peanuts subsequently grew mold.
Additionally, USDA inspectors observed deceased insect bodies on the same shelf that the peanut storage container was
found.
The ingestion of mold is inherently detrimental to the health and welfare of animals. Additionally, the top of the food


container was left unsecured and did not protect the peanuts from possible contamination from pests. Food must be
clean, wholesome, and palatable to the animals. The facility staff cleaned out the kitchen shelves and discarded the
moldy peanuts before the inspection was completed.

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
The current pest control program continues to fall short in its effectiveness in reducing contamination by pests in animal
areas. Deceased insect bodies were seen on the same shelf where food was being stored in the Munchkin land. A small
circular hole was identified in the wall of an indoor housing trailer in Emerald city. This is the same area where facility staff
observed a squirrel monkey mouthing the body of a deceased rat. Moreover, a racoon was spotted by facility staff in the
vicinity of Kansas City capuchin enclosures during the second day of inspections.
Mammalian and insect pests can both carry parasites and various diseases that could compromise the health and well-
being of nonhuman primates. Licensees are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective program for
controlling pests so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal
areas.

This inspection took place over two days (September 29th-30th) with the facility director and several employees. The exit
interview was conducted with the facility director on September 30th.
