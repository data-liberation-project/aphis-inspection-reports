FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***Several primary enclosures holding water buffalo, zebu and aoudad were wet and moist. The pen enclosing the
water buffalo was completely moist and it had not rained the day before. The moist conditions of the pens could
potentially cause hoof care issues and is a breeding ground for many insects. There needs to be a suitable method
to get rid of the moist conditons occuring in the enclosures holding the animals. Correct by May 19, 2015

SANITATION.
***The primary enclosures holding the zebu and water buffalo had moist mud mixed with feces. The mixture of feces
in the pens substrate smells and attracts pests. These enclosures need to be cleaned out in order to completely
eliminate the feces, to prevent contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and
to reduce odors. Correct by May 8, 2015.

SANITATION.
***The facility had a large amount of flies throughout the animals primary enclosures. The animals were seen
swatting and biting at the flies in frustration. It appears that the accumulation of feces mixed in the moist substrate
was attracting the insects and was a breeding ground for the pests. The feces needs to be cleaned to minimize the
flies. A safe and effective program for the control of insects shall be established and maintained. Correct by May 8,
