Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
There were three dogs that had arrived at the cargo office on British Airways Flight #285 from Heathrow Airport. Each
crate had a sticker on top with consignor and consignee information, but it did not include the time and date that the dogs
were last offered food and water. Dogs were on waybill #s 125-9476-2032 and 125-946-2253.

When accepting dogs for transport the airline must ensure that the consignor's certification regarding feeding and
watering is complete, so that the information is available to those handling the animals during transit. Failure to provide
the required information could result in handling that would be detrimental to the well-being of the animals.

Consignments to carriers and intermediate handlers.
There were three dogs that had arrived at the cargo office on British Airways Flight #285 from Heathrow Airport. Each
crate had a sticker on top with consignor and consignee information, but it did not include the consignor's signature and
time and date of signature. Dogs were on waybill #s 125-9476-2032 and 125-946-2253.

The consignor's certification should be signed with the time and date so as to clearly indicate the consignor's instructions


as to when the animals were last fed and watered, and what the consignor's instructions are for feeding and watering
during transit. Failure to provide this signed and dated certification by the consignor could put the well-being of the
animals at risk.
3.17

Food and water requirements.
There were three dogs that had arrived at the cargo office on British Airways Flight #285 from Heathrow Airport. Dogs
were on waybill #s 125-9476-2032 and 125-946-2253. The two smaller crates only had one food / water receptacle in
each enclosure.

Food and water receptacles should be attached inside the enclosure so that the dogs can be offered both food and water
during transit. When accepting dogs for transport, the airline should ensure that there are both food and water receptacles
in the enclosure. Failure to to do could be detrimental to the well-being of the animals, as it makes it difficult to offer food
and water per the consignor's instructions.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the cargo office personnel.
