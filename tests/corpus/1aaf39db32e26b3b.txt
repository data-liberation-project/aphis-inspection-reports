2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The attending veterinarian moved out of the area approximately five months ago. The licensee still has the
emergency veterinarians listed but does not have formal arrangements with a new attending veterinarian including a
written program of veterinary care and regularly scheduled visits to the premises. This needs to be addressed to
assure the health care needs of the animals are being met and that a vet has appropriate authority to ensure the
provision of adequate veterinary care.
