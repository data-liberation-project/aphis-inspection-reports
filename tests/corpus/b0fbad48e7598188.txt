ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The white tiger and leopard appear obese with no visible neck. There appears to be fat deposits over their spine
and tail base and their abdomen is distended. According to the diet these animals are receiving 10-15 lbs of meat
daily (tiger) and 7-10 lbs meat daily (leopard). Obesity is a health concern due to the chain reaction of problems it
can create, especially as these animals age. The diet of these animals needs to be re-evaluated by the vet to
assure the animals are maintained in optimal condition for their health and well- being.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The blue hanging swing in the Ring tail lemur holding area is cracked and in disrepair and needs to be replaced
for their safety.
*** The metal panels in the holding area for the baboons are rusted along the base and pitted and in disrepair in
some areas. This section of the holding wall can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized. This section of wall
needs to be replaced to facilitate cleaning and sanitizing of the area.
*** In this same area, there is a nail protruding into the enclosure that needs to be removed for the safety of the
animals.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The Marmoset(cid:25)s are currently housed in a Plexiglas cylinder type enclosure. There is ample perching material in the
enclosure but no hide box or shelter available for the animals to get into to away from the sun when it is directly
overhead. These animals need to be able to have access to a hide box or shelter to allow them to get out of thedirect sun for their health and well being.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
*** Two of the three Marmoset(cid:25)s have areas of hair loss on their tails. The facility manager stated that the animals
did not have hair loss as of last week when they were put out on exhibit. This abnormal behavior of over-grooming
could be a result of not having a hide box to allow the animals to engage in species appropriate behaviors or have a
way to (cid:28)hide(cid:29) from guests. In addition they cannot get out of the sun if it is directly overhead which can also be
stressful.
*** The Sykes monkeys were engaging in abnormal behavior patterns in their enclosure for several minutes during
the inspection. They were circling around the enclosure, stopping in the far left corner to stand, move their head in a
circular fashion and keep walking. Abnormal behavior patterns or stereotypic behaviors are an indication that the
animal is dealing with a stress or lack of stimulation in the environment and this needs to be identified and
addressed in the enrichment plan.
When abnormal behavior patterns are observed with non human primates, special consideration and attention must
be given to them and it should be documented in their enrichment plan. This can include additional opportunities to
forage, and or additional training sessions with handlers. This needs to be addressed for the psychological health of
the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The winter holding area for the primates needs to be cleaned. There was building materials, excess crates, dirty
empty enclosures and excess clutter throughout the area. This area needs to be cleaned and kept in good repair to
promote good housekeeping practices for the area.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There was an excessive amount of fruit flies throughout the holding areas for the lemurs and spider monkey. Some
method of pest control needs to be implemented to reduce the flies in the area for the health of the animals.Correct by: May 20, 2015

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The freezer storing frozen meat products for the carnivores at the facility needs to be addressed. The seal along the
freezer door is missing in some areas and the door is not sealing properly. Due to this issue, there is a build-up of
ice inside the freezer along all the boxes of food. This needs to be addressed to adequately protect the food
supplies against deterioration and for the health of the animals.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The two Capybara(cid:25)s have a small metal tub that only allows one animal at a time to stand in the tub. This tub was
empty at the time of the inspection. Capybaras are aquatic rodents and swimming is a species appropriate behavior
and a social movement the animals need to be able to engage in for their health and well-being. This needs to be
addressed by providing a larger pool that the animas can access and submerge in.

FEEDING.
*** The chicken being fed to the big cats is being given out frozen. There was visible ice still on the chicken in the
bobcat enclosure. The facility manager states they feed this way in the summer. It is currently spring and the
temperature at the time of the inspection was 48 deg F. Feeding out frozen chicken in this manner is not palatable
for the animals. APHIS considers frozen food wholesome when it is thawed in an appropriate manner (e.g. under
refrigeration) to prevent contamination.
*** The current diet plan lists that the big cats as receiving calcium and OASIS supplement on the chicken. At the
time of the inspection no OASIS was present at the facility and the manager states they have not had it for an
extended period of time. The facility needs to add supplementation to the animal(cid:25)s diet when only a red meat and
chicken diet is consumed. This diet is not nutritionally complete and can have negative lasting impact on the
animal(cid:25)s health.
Feeding practices need to be discussed with the attending veterinarian to assure the animals are being fed
nutritionally complete diets for their age, weight and body condition. 3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The Capybara shelter area needs to be cleaned. There is an excessive accumulation of feces in the shelter that
needs to be removed and there are cobwebs, dust and debris hanging from the ceiling almost to the tops of the
animal(cid:25)s heads. This shelter needs to be cleaned more frequently to reduce this accumulation and for the health
and comfort of the animals.
