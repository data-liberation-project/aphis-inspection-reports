2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male, black and white skunk has a small amount of pink flesh protruding from his anus. This is consistent with
problems such as prolapsing anus, parasite problems, or other intestinal problems. This condition can lead to
damage of the exposed tissue, interfere with defecation, and cause discomfort.
One male, white raccoon was seen holding his right front leg off the ground consistently during the time it was
observed. Abrasions were present on the top of the right foot. Alterations in gait can be associated with trauma or
other medical problems and indicates discomfort.
Two raccoons in one enclosure both had wounds on the top of their snouts. The wounds have worn through the
entire nose area, exposing bone and moist, red tissue in the nasal cavity. The licensee stated that he suspected
these injuries were caused by another raccoon who he has since removed from the enclosure. Wounds such as
these can be painful and lead to respiratory problems.
One ferret was observed to have a swelling on his chin and lower lip. Swelling in the mouth area can be caused by
dental problems and a variety of other medical issues and can be painful.
The licensee states that he has not communicated with the attending veterinarian about the medical care of any of
these animals. The animals listed above must be examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an
accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate treatment plan is developed and followed. This information,
including the diagnosis, treatment and resolution of the condition, must be documented and made available to the
inspector upon request.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL. Structural strength.
There are numerous ferret and raccoon enclosures with broken wires that protrude into the enclosures. Sharp,
protruding metal points can cause injury to the animals.
There are four skunk enclosures with holes on the walls where the wire is broken or missing. These holes are large
enough to possibly allow an animal to escape.
There was one ferret enclosure with a hole in the wall where the wire was missing. A ferret was seen coming into
the enclosure through this hole from the space between this enclosure and the next one. Also, during the
inspection, two ferrets were seen out of enclosures, one in the indoor building and one in the alley way of one of the
outdoor banks of enclosures. These animals were therefore not well contained. The licensee was able to capture
the ferrets during the inspection and place them in an enclosure.
The licensee must ensure that all housing facilities be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect
the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
3.126(c)
FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Lighting.
The rows of lights on one end of the indoor ferret building were not working during the inspection. The enclosures
and the animals within them in this area were difficult to assess due to the lack of light. Lack of light interferes with
the inspection process as well as the day to day cleaning of the enclosures and the daily observation of the animals.
The licensee must ensure that indoor housing facilities have ample lighting by natural or/or artificial means. Such
lighting shall be uniformly distributed and of sufficient intensity to permit routine inspection and cleaning.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Cleaning of enclosures.
There is a wooden nesting box attached to a wire enclosure within the outdoor housing area. The box has a
build-up of wet excreta covering the entire floor surface affecting one skunk.
Excessive excreta in primary enclosures can contribute to odors, insects and other pests, and can play a role in
disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that excreta be removed as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors.3.133
SEPARATION.
The remains of a skunk were found in an enclosure with another skunk. The licensee states that occasionally fights
can occur that lead to the death of one of the skunks. Injuries were observed on the snouts of two raccoons in one
enclosure. The licensee states he believed another raccoon (subsequently removed from the enclosure) caused the
injuries. Incompatibility can lead to injury or death of the animals involved. The licensee must ensure that animals
housed in the same primary enclosures must be compatible.
