ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
-A white and brown adult female bull dog identified by microchip (0C00110305) was present in the kennel that the
facility representative said belonged to another licensee and had been dropped off that morning. It was shaking its
head and had a 3/4 inch diameter area at the base of its left ear that had fresh blood, and yellowish colored moist
discharge around the edges, and a roughened surface. The hair on the face of the bulldog was thinning, and the
skin on the face of the dog had a reddened appearance. The facility representative did not know if the animal had
been evaluated by a veterinarian. The licensee stated that the dog was not isolated from his other kennel animals
before being brought in for a procedure and was housed amongst the breeding animals. Failure to
isolate/quarantine animals brought in from other facilities, particularly animals with signs of veterinary medical
conditions, could result in the introduction of diseases to the breeding animals.
-A brown and white adult female bulldog identified by microchip (1513361248) has an abnormal skin condition.
There are large patches of hair loss around the abdomen and sides of the dog covering approximately 20 percent of
its body. The hairless areas on the skin have an abnormal reddened rash-like appearance.
-An adult blue female Mastiff identified by microchip (0C00107945) has an abnormal skin condition. There are areas
of hair loss on the right shoulder, right thigh, and at the base of both ears. The dog also has a sore on its front left
leg approximately 2.5 inches in diameter. The sore is reddish-pink in color and rough in appearance. There is also
fresh blood present on the affected area.
-A tan adult female French bulldog (tattoo 61) has an approximately 1 inch, linear area on her central abdomen that

been applying an ointment and had not consulted with a veterinarian.
-A blonde adult male poodle identified by microchip (45284D3560) has a laceration on its back right leg. The wound
is approximately 2 inches long and 1 inch wide. The affected area is hairless and pink in color with a smaller circular
area that is a darker red color. The facility representative suggested the dog had received the wound during a fight
with another dog.
-An adult female Shih Tzu identified by microchip (087300544) has a pinkish-red colored swollen tissue along the
side of each eye. An adult female Lhasa Apso identified by microchip (151337172A) has a similar reddish colored
swollen tissue along its left eye. The size of the growths are approximately the size of a pencil eraser. These
swellings may indicate the presence of a veterinary medical problem which could progress if left untreated. Thefacility representative stated he had not notified the veterinarian of these problems.
-An adult female Mastiff identified by microchip (0A02617774) has a greenish-yellow colored discharge present
around both eyes. The matter is moist in appearance along the inside corner of both eyes. The fur around the eyes
is matted and crusty from the discharge.
-A tan and black adult, female shih tzu microchip (135218630A) had an abnormal appearing left eye. The fur around
the eye was matted with a black crusty material. The eye was mostly black with the pupil not being clearly visible.

discharge present along the inside corners of the right and left eye. The discharge is on the surface of the eye and
in the fur where it is becoming dry and crusty.
-A white adult female bulldog identified by microchip (4461165673) has a moist, light greenish colored discharge
present on both eyes. The eyes also have a crusty appearance around the edges. The licensee stated the dog was
being treated with eye drops but the product had been used up and more would have to be obtained from the
veterinary clinic.
-An adult male Golden Retriever identified by microchip (147373563A) has a heavily matted fur coat covering
approximately 30 percent of its body. Matted fur is tightly adhered to the skin along the dogs back making it difficult
to visualize the skin. Clumps of matted fur are present that range in size from small to large. Large clumps of matted
fur being approximately 2 inches long and 4 inches wide.
-A blonde adult male Wheaten Terrier identified by microchip (151340324A) has matted fur on its back, hindquarters
and rear legs covering approximately 40 percent of its body. The hair is heavily twisted and ropey to where it is
tightly adhered to the skin.
Open wounds can be painful causing discomfort and could lead to the spread of infection which affects the health
and well-being of the dog. Hairloss can occur due to a variety of veterinary medical problems, which could be
painful or spread to other animals. Eye problems can occur due to injury, infection, or other medical problems,
which can be painful, and could progress further if left untreated. Excessive matting can cause pain and discomfort
to the animals. Matting can foster skin infections and hinder the animal's ability to move or defecate normally. The
licensee needs to remove the matted fur on these dogs. As part of the facility's program of veterinary care, the
licensee must establish and follow a program of regular coat maintenance for all the dogs to prevent the
development of excessive matting.
The licensee must have the above animals examined by a licensed veterinarian and appropriate treatment plans
administered. The diagnosis and any recommended treatment must be part of the documentation. The licensee
must ensure that all animal receive adequate veterinary care all times.

3.1(c)(2)HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Within the "basement" housing area, there is an enclosure containing a Mastiff dog that has a white plastic pipe
running vertically through it along the backside. The lower half of the plastic pipe exposed in the enclosure is deeply
scratched and or chewed. This creates a surface that cannot be adequately cleaned or sanitized. The affected area
is also rough and brownish in color. Grime and animal waste material can collect in the grooves where the plastic
pipe is worn and damaged.
Within the "block" building there are at least two enclosures containing dogs that have areas of damaged wood
along the frame. The affected areas have been excessively chewed and or scratched creating a jagged, roughened
edge. Damaged wooden areas cannot be readily cleaned or sanitized. Potential health issues exist if the dogs
swallow the splintered ends.
Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis can lead to unsanitary conditions and potential disease or health risks.
The licensee must ensure all surfaces can be readily cleaned and sanitized or be replaced when worn for the health
and well-being of all dogs.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Minimum floor space was not provided for at least five enclosures housing adult dogs.
-An adult mastiff measuring 46 inches was housed in an enclosure that provided 16 square feet of floor space,
however it requires a minimum of 18.78 square feet.
-An adult husky (#21) in building 1 measuring 37 inches was housed in an enclosure that provided 12 square feet,
however she requires a minimum of 12.84 square feet.
-Two adult Lhasa apso dogs (#13 and #2) measure 21.5 and 25 inches in the (cid:28)block building(cid:29) were housed in an
enclosure providing 9 square feet of floor space, however they require a minimum of 11.92 square feet.
-An adult shih tzu (L12) and an adult Lhasa apso (#25) each measuring 21 inches in the block building were housed
in an enclosure providing 9 square feet of floor space, however they require a minimum of 9.39 square feet.
-Three adult Shiba Inu dogs (in the room above the basement housing area) that measured 22 inches each, were
housed in an enclosure providing 16 square feet, however they require a minimum of 16.33 square feet.
Adequate floor space that allows sufficient freedom of movement to make normal postural adjustments is
necessary to ensure the health and well-being of all dogs. The licensee must ensure that all animals are housed in
enclosures that meet or exceed the minimum floor space requirements at all times.

EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
According to the licensee, the dogs are allowed time to exercise by being removed from their enclosure and having
free access to run around the aisles of the housing facility. However, the licensee does not have a written plan that
reflects this current practice.
The facility's written exercise plan shows dogs housed individually will be provided with at least two times the
required floor space. It also shows the facility will group house dogs providing at least 100 percent of the required
floor space. During the inspection, inspectors identified individually and group housed dogs in enclosures that have
insufficient floor space and do not match the requirements as defined in the facility's written program of exercise.
The program of exercise must be developed in accordance with the attending veterinarian recommendations to
ensure the dogs are receiving adequate exercise. The licensee must develop, document and follow an appropriate
plan of exercise and the plan must be approved by the attending veterinarian.

3.9(b)
FEEDING.
At least three metal food bowls in the "basement" housing area being used by four dogs have fecal material mixed
in with the feed. There is also feed and fecal material caked along the inside and outer edges of these bowls. The
metal feed bowls are located on the floor surface where the dogs are able to defecate in them.
At least 12 blue plastic food receptacles being used by 24 dogs in the "block building" are excessively chewed and
worn. The chewed surfaces are rough and jagged to the point the affected surfaces are collecting fur and food
waste. Chewed and worn surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized.
When food receptacles are not being kept clean or sanitized on a regular basis it can lead to health risks for the
dogs. Food receptacles must be located in an area that will minimize contamination by animal waste. The licensee
must establish and maintain a program to ensure that all food receptacles are maintained in good repair at all times
to ensure adequate cleaning and sanitation can be accomplished.
