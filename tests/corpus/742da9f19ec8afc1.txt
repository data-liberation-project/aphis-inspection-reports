3.1(c)(2)

Housing facilities, general.
* One hole was observed on the exterior fiberglass wall of one outdoor housing unit. The hole is estimated to be ten to
12 inches in diameter. A jagged, roughened edge was observed. In addition, insulation was exposed from the hole in the
exterior wall. Two dogs are in contact with the affected area located in outdoor housing. Surfaces not maintained on a
regular basis cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. A chewed, roughened surface could harbor disease causing
agents which affects the health and well-being of the dogs. The potential exists for dogs to ingest chewed fiberglass and
insulation which could cause potential health issues. The applicant must ensure all surfaces are being maintained on a
regular basis. Surfaces that cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized, must be replaced when worn or soiled or altered in
a manner that allows for cleaning and sanitation to occur.
3.1(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on the interior fiberglass wall of four enclosures.
Eight dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in outdoor housing. The affected area covers approximately
20 to 30 percent of the interior wall area. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an accumulation of excreta and
other disease hazards. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could lead to potential disease or health
risks. Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly increase the risk of disease hazards for the dogs.

Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the animals. All surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and
sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices. The applicant must ensure
that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11
(B) of this sub part to prevent accumulation of excreta and reduce disease hazards.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class A license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the
applicant.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or by 2/14/2023 or the applicant will forfeit the license fee and
must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next Re-License Inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
