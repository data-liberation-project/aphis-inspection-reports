Facilities, outdoor.
The perimeter fence along the southside next to the main road and on southeast side next to the front entrance has areas
where the tree branches has grown over and into the top barb wire of the fence. These areas could potentially provide a
means for animals and unauthorized personnel to enter and exit the facility. Trees and brush along the perimeter fence
need to be maintained to ensure they do not comprise the fence in any way.

This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the Animal Curator.
