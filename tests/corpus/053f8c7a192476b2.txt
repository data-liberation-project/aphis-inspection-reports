FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Standing water (approximately six feet in diameter) and mud surround the elevated llama food tub. The two llamas
share an enclosure with one sheep and three goats. Their food tub is elevated to prevent the other animals from
ingesting their food. The llamas must walk through the mud and standing water to gain access to their food.
Excessive standing water and mud could cause injury to the animals.
A suitable method shall be provided to eliminate excess water around the food tub.
