ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The four large pigs had overgrown hooves, and all four animals needed their hooves trimmed. Three out of four
dogs needed their toenails trimmed. The overgrowth of hooves/nails may cause the animals discomfort and lead to
injuries or lameness if not appropriately addressed.
Two of the racing dogs, Pablo, a chihuahua mix and Buster, a Terrier mix had moderate calculi on the premolars
and canines. Dental disease can result in pain during eating and weight loss. A system of maintenance should be
in place to ensure that the facility is monitoring dental health and cleaning teeth as needed.
The facility shall establish and maintain an adequate program of veterinary care that includes timely, adequate
hoof/nail care and dental care as needed.

2.50(c)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
4 adult dogs did not have the required identification on the dogs or on their cage/holding area. A class ``C'' exhibitor
shall identify all live dogs and cats under his or her control or on his or her premises, whether held, purchased, or
otherwise acquired. This is important so that it can be determined that the animals are the animals on the records.
This is to ensure the well being and health and source of the animals can be tracked. A system of records must be
maintained to appropriately identify each dog with a tag as described in the regulations or microchip (microchip
reader must be available if microchips are used).

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Acquisition and disposition records were not complete and accurate. Required acquisition records (Form 7005)were not consistently available for all of the animals, including the four dogs acquired in 2010. The 8 pigs that had
been acquired recently did not have all the required information under b(1) available. A paper copy of the APHIS
Forms 7019 or 7020 may be used to track the required acquisition and disposition information in one place for all
animals except the dogs, or the information must be available in the individual animal records. A system of
recordkeeping that contains all the required acquisition and disposition information must be maintained.

HEALTH CERTIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION.
Owner is on the road with his hogs and dogs act and does not have current health certificates for any of the dogs
traveling in the act. Health certificates ensure dogs are healthy and free from contagious diseases before entering
into interstate commerce. Health certificates must be issued by a licensed veterinarian before dogs are transported
in commerce.
Correct before future travel.
2.126(c) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee was inspected at the Family Pet Expo at Orange County Fairgrounds, and no itinerary was submitted
to the home inspector, or present in the electronic files maintained by the regional office.
In the case of traveling exhibitors, itineraries must be submitted to USDA via fax, mail, or electronic mail at least two
days prior to any overnight travel. The itinerary should contain complete and accurate information concerning the
whereabouts of any animal intended for exhibition at any location other than the person's approved site. The
submission of itineraries allows USDA to conduct inspections in order to assess the welfare of the animals both at
home and while traveling. Current itineraries should be submitted to USDA in a timely manner.
3.8
EXERCISE FOR DOGS.
The facility does not have a current exercise plan for the dogs on file. Exhibitors must develop, document, and
follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. In addition, the plan must be approved
by the attending veterinarian. The plan must include written standard procedures to be followed in providing the
opportunity for exercise. The plan must be made available to APHIS upon request. The facility was provided with
the exercise plan form.
