ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:00 AM on
31-JAN-17.
We arrived at the facility at 11:00 AM. I knocked on the door and received no response. I called Mr. Vanneste on
his cell phone. I told Mr. Vanneste that Carrie and I were at his facility to conduct an inspection. He told me that he
was no where near his facility. He stated that he had the flu and was going to the doctor. He stated that he was
near Sterling Heights. I remarked that he had reported to me that he had been sick with the flu last Fall as well. I
also remarked that he was traveling a long way to see the doctor for the flu. Mr. Vanneste then told me he also had
a back problem and even if he was at the facility he would not be able to host an inspection as he could barley walk
due to his back condition.
Additional Inspectors
