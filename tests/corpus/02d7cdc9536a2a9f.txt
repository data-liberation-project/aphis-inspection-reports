2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Keeper error allowed a female lion to escape her enclosure on Aug 23, 2014. This animal was contained within a
hallway however sedation was required to move her back into her primary enclosure. Animals shall be handled in a
manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, or unnecessary discomfort. A sedation performed in this
type of situation is considered to be an unnecessary and stressful event. This facility needs to ensure these type of
events do not happen in the future.
To be corrected immediately.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee.
