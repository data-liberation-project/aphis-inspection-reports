HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The divider panels of 2 pens on the concrete kennel area housing cavalier type dogs, the bottom square tubing of
the panels has rusted and flaked away. This does not hold the horse panel solid, and allows the panel to move
when dogs jump on the panel. This affects 4 pens of dogs.
The flaking and rusting metal may result in sharp points and edges which are a potential source of injury to the
enclosed animals. The rusted areas need to be repaired or replaced and properly maintained in the future.
To be corrected by December 27 2014
