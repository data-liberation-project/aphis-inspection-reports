2.126(a)(2)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
**Required facility records (the program of veterinary care, animal inventory/acquisition records, and records of
animal dispositions) were not available for review at the time of inspection. The unavailability of the required
records does not allow APHIS Officials to determine if the records are accurate and complete, that the program of
veterinary care is being followed to ensure the health of the animals, or for the proper tracking of the animals.
Maintain all required records at the facility so they are available for review at the time of inspection.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
Correct from this date forward
