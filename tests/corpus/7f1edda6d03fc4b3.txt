Facility records indicate that the 6 deer are not included in routine observations . The deer are housed in a 17 acre
enclosure that consists of thick brush and trees making actual animal observation difficult. Frequent observation on a
routine basis is important to detect illness or conditions that may require veterinary care. A method must be developed to
attempt observe the deer in this enclosure on a daily basis .

The sheet metal which acts as a wind break on the north side of the Front Pen is deteriorating where it meets the ground
in 2 of the cattle holding areas. The rusted and jagged edges extend approximately 5 “to 10 “from the ground and poses a
risk of injury to the animals lower legs. The metal must be repaired or replaced to prevent injury to the cattle. Facilities
must be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. CORRECT BY : 9/30/2021



Records of an incident which occurred March 13. 2020 which involved stray dogs gaining access to the deer pen were
reviewed. The report states that 2 live pit bull type dogs and 1 deceased dog were found in Pen 2 which houses white
tailed deer along with 2 decomposing deer carcasses . Facility records also indicate that a census showed that there
were no longer 12 deer in Pen 2 and the disposition of the deer is unknown. Stray dogs have gained access to the facility
in the past by digging under the perimeter fence. Currently ,there is no method to prevent predators from digging under
the fence or otherwise gaining access to the animal facility. Stray/feral dogs may severely injury or kill deer or cattle . The
animal facility must be structurally strong to protect the animals from predators to prevent injury.

Feeding.
F.A.S.S. AG Guide Ch.3 pg 21
At time of the inspection , there are bags of cattle mineral and deer feed stored on a pallet near the edge of the open
sided Tractor Barn. An employee did verify that these supplies were currently being fed to the animals. Several bags of
mineral and deer feed have been torn open by stray dogs and scattered mineral and feed from these bags has spilled on
the floor around the feed. Storing feed in an area open to the weather allows for contamination of the feed by pests and
deterioration by weather. The quality of the feed/mineral can quickly deteriorate once the bag is torn. The spilled feed on
the floor serves as an attractant for pests which may contaminate the feed. Supplies of food must be protected from
contamination/deterioration to ensure feed quality .
