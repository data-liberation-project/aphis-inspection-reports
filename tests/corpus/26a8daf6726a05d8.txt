SANITATION.
At the time of inspection, the facility had a variety of miscellaneous items, clutter and debris in the sheep enclosure.
There were machinery parts present that can cause harm to the sheep.
The bobcat enclosure was overgrown with grass and weeds that were near waist level of the inspector. The
excessive vegetation can harbor pests and dangerous animals (ex: snakes) that are a potential risk to the animal.
All buildings and premises must be kept clean, cleared and in good repair in order to prevent animals from injury
and to keep them in good health. A system of maintaining effective housekeeping practices must be in place.
