ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A bottle of injectable flunixin meglumine (Flu-Nix D) that expired February 2012 was found in the back of the
medicine cabinet with other medications, and is therefore considered ready for use. The bottle was discarded
immediately.
Using expired medications can have an adverse or diminished effect, or not treat the condition for which it was
intended.
The licensee must develop and follow a plan to regularly check medications to ensure they have not expired.
To be corrected from this day forward.
Inspection and exit interview conducted by Lynn Clarke, ACI with facility representative.
