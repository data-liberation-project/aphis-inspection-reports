FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** At the time of the inspection, the 9 foxes that just arrived from IL overnight were not able to be moved to a
primary enclosure because their permanent housing was not ready for them. These animals need to be moved out
of the transport enclosures that do not provide enough room for movement as soon as possible and into enclosures
that are structurally sound and provide the animals with enough space to make species appropriate movements.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** The 9 foxes that arrived from IL overnight were placed for holding in the mudroom of the house in their transport
crates which is not behind the perimeter fence. The inspector was able to walk right into the mudroom and up to the
animals and potentially have contact with them when she announced herself for the inspection process. These
animals need to be moved to their permanent enclosures behind the perimeter fence to keep unauthorized persons
from having contact with them.

SANITATION.
*** The foxes that arrived overnight from IL were placed in the mudroom of the licensee's house. The animal crates
were stacked on top of each other and there was clutter and miscellaneous items throughout the room. The
inspector was not able to get a good view of all the animals based on how they were stacked and the items around
them. Premises housing animals even temporarily need to be kept clean and in good order to facilitate the care of
the animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
*** The licensee brought back 9 foxes from IL last night/early am and the animals were left in the transport crates in
the mudroom of her house. The crates were not large enough to ensure that each animal contained had sufficient
space to turn about freely and to make normal postural adjustments. The crates did not allow the animals to sit,
stand or for one fox in a wire catch crate to even lie down comfortably. These animals need to be moved to their
primary enclosure as soon as possible for their comfort and well being.

The inspection process was stopped by the inspector in order to give the licensee more time in daylight hours to be
able to properly care for the foxes and get them moved into appropriate and compliant enclosures.
The licensee was made aware of the direct items on this report prior in an exit briefing.
