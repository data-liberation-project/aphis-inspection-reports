2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
An adverse event involving an injury to a kangaroo rat was reported in the 6/20/2014 IACUC minutes. The injury
was a broken leg surmised to be from a crushing injury. The animal was euthanized.
All handling of animals must be as careful as possible to avoid injury and undue stress or discomfort.
This was corrected prior to the time of inspection. Alternate, safer, methods of handling the animals were
implemented and all associated personnel were retrained.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility personnel.
