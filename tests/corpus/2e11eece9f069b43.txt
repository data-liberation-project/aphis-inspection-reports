3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***During inspection, the facility representative informed the inspector that a singly housed, male Wolverine
“Casper” had escaped his primary enclosure in April 2017 and has not been recaptured. The facility staff has
reviewed this incident and identified an opening in the enclosure gate large enough in which the animal would have
been able to squeeze through and escape. The facility representative stated that the wolverine has been
periodically seen in the local area and that the facility continues to set traps to recapture it. Failure to identify
needed maintenance and repair issues of enclosures can lead to animal escapes and consequent injury of an
animal. The facility shall ensure that all enclosures are of appropriate material, structurally sound and maintained
in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.***This is a Critical non-compliant item.
Correct for all future inspections.
-The shelter structure in the wolf enclosure is in disrepair. The front section of the wooden roof over the entrance is
weakened and sagging from the weight of the mound of dirt above it resulting in loosely attached boards. Facility
enclosures and structures within enclosures that are not maintained pose a risk of injury to the animals and can
decrease the structural stability of the affected structures. A system of timely facility repair/replacement and
maintenance must be in place.

3.131(c)
SANITATION.
The inside surfaces of several, animal food storage freezers contained a heavy buildup of dirt and dried,
brownish-red residues in several areas. Premises used to store food must be kept clean to protect and ensure the
health and well-being of the animals and to facilitate good husbandry practices. A system of a more timely and
efficient cleaning schedule must be in place. Correct by 07/21/2017.
