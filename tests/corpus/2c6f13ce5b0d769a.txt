3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* There is a mixture of dirt, grease and other excreta accumulating on the exterior fiberglass wall of five
enclosures. Twenty dogs are in contact with the affected surfaces located in shelter housing. The affected area
covers approximately 50 percent of the exterior wall area. Cleaning of surfaces is necessary to prevent an
accumulation of excreta and other disease hazards. This indicates an unsanitary living condition exists that could
lead to potential disease or health risks. Surfaces which are not cleaned and sanitized properly increase the risk of
disease hazards for the dogs. Cleanliness is important to the health and well-being of the animals. All surfaces of
housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards
and practices The licensee must ensure that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact must be
spot-cleaned daily and sanitized in accordance with 3.11 (B) of this sub part to prevent accumulation of excreta and
reduce disease hazards. Correct by 5/17/19.
* The facility inspection and exit briefing done on 5/16/19 were conducted with the licensee.
