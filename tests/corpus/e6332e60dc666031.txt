WATERING.
In an outdoor enclosure, containing two dogs, the water receptacle has frozen water in it. An older male Shetland
Sheepdog (DOB 2002) was observed to be intermittently licking the frozen water. The inspector asked the facility
representative if he could give water to the dog. The facility representative removed the frozen water and filled the
receptacle with fresh water. This older dog then drank continuously for fifty-five seconds. The dog then stopped
drinking and left the water receptacle, but returned and drank continuously for forty-nine seconds. The dog then left
the water receptacle again, but returned to it and drank for approximately twenty more seconds.
The facility representative said the dogs are given water twice a day but had not been given water yet that day. The
inspection took place at noon when the temperature was 32 degrees F. The temperature the previous day had
reached a high of 26 degrees F according to AccuWeather.com. Insufficient amounts of available fresh water to
meet the needs of the dogs could cause them stress and have a negative impact on their health and well-being.
Fresh water must be offered to the dogs at least twice daily or as often as necessary to ensure the health and
well-being of the animals and reduce stress caused by lack of available water. The licensee must ensure that this
older dog is provided with enough fresh water to meet his needs. The licensee must also ensure the other dogs are
provided with enough fresh water to meet their needs, as well.
Correction date: From this day forward
Exit interview conducted with Kelly Maxwell, ACI and the facility representative.
