3.137(a)(6)

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
The transport enclosure present during today’s inspection lacks the required handholds. At the time of inspection, one
transport enclosure (holding 10 chinchillas) was loaded and ready to be placed into the transport vehicle. This enclosure
was constructed of wire and lacked any handholds on the exterior of the enclosure. External handholds or other devices
must be provided on the outside of the primary enclosure to enable lifting without contacting the animals contained within.
Transport enclosures that do not have handles are more likely to be tilted and can cause unnecessary stress or harm to
the animal and/or person. The licensee must ensure that all transport enclosures have adequate handholds or other
devices for lifting on the exterior of the primary enclosure to enable the primary enclosure to be lifted without tilting and to
ensure that the person handling the primary enclosure will not come into contact with the animal.

Primary enclosures used to transport live animals.
During today’s inspection one transport enclosure, housing 10 chinchillas, was not clearly marked with the words “Live
Animal” and arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright position of the container. Transport enclosures that
are not clearly marked can lead to misidentification and potential prolongment of recovery in the event of an emergency.
The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures used to transport live animals are clearly marked with the words

“Live Animal” in lettering that is at least 1 inch in height and with arrows or other markings to indicate the correct upright
position of the container.

Handling.
The transport enclosures used by the licensee to transport chinchillas are currently being placed directly on the floor of
the vehicle without measures to secure the enclosures in place to prevent shifting, tilting, or falling. One transport
enclosure containing animals was present during inspection, however, the licensee confirmed that securing the
enclosures is not currently part of their standard practices even when loading multiple enclosures. Enclosures that are left
unsecure in the transport vehicle can needlessly be tipped, tilted or fall when stacked or during abrupt stops or quick
breaking which can happen during ground transport. The licensee must ensure that all primary enclosures used to
transport any live animals are not tossed, dropped or unnecessarily tilted and shall not be stacked in a manner which may
reasonably be expected to result in their falling.
