2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Dog #52 (tag number) had signs of dental disease that needs veterinary attention. This dog was not under
treatment and its condition was pointed out to the licensee during inspection. The gums on its right upper premolar
(back upper tooth) were redder than the rest of the mouth and part of the tooth root was exposed and the gums
around it would lightly bleed when touched. Its lower right molar and a lower left premolar tooth were slightly loose
to the touch and the lower premolar and molar teeth on both sides were covered in a dark plaque and some pale
creamy material around those teeth would be seen when the gums were lightly touched. Increased gum redness,
loose teeth, creamy material around loose teeth are all signs of more advanced dental disease and could be painful
and lead to other health problems in this dog. The facility needs to ensure that the attending veterinarian evaluates
these dog's teeth and follows the recommended treatment plan.
2.80(b)
RECORDS, DISPOSITION.
Two dogs that were cited on the 19-Jul-2017 (#27 and "Alan') report needing veterinary attention per the licensee
were seen by the attending veterinarian and treated as instructed. Per the licensee, these two dogs were later
given away in September or October 2017 but the licensee doesn't remember completing a record of disposition
and a record of disposition could not be found during inspection. Also, the record of Animals on Hand (APHIS
7005) had been updated to reflect current animals on hand and records of #27 and Alan were no longer reflected on
APHIS 7005 and so #27's and Alan's disposition date were not available. Records of animals' disposition are
required to be maintained for at least 1 year after the animal's disposition.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
