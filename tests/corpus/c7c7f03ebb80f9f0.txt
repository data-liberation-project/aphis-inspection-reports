ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- At least 10 outdated medications intended for the animals were found in the refrigerator. Outdated medications
may not be effective, and may even become harmful. They must not be used.
The outdated medications were discarded at the time of inspection.
- Several medications were found that were not labeled for use in the covered animals present at the facility.
Examples: Revolution said to be used on the sloths, topical fungicide for use in the bears, and gas relief tablets
labeled for humans. Use of medications in exotic species is difficult in that there is rarely, if ever, a medication that
is labeled for them. Limited information is available regarding dosage and potential toxicities. Off-label use of
medications must be under prescription of the attending veterinarian, with clearly written instructions.
Correct immediately by only using medications that are prescribed by the veterinarian for those species.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female sloth, Maurice'mah, located in the free-standing sloth building, has thickened, scaly skin around her eyes,
nose, and along the bridge of her nose connecting those areas. The licensee said it was exzema, and that the other
licensee was treating it topically, but said she didn't know with what, or if the Attending Veterinarian (AV) had been
consulted. There were no records available to document veterinary instructions or the treatment being used.
Such skin conditions can be itchy or painful, can be associated with other conditions, and can predispose to
infection. Treatment of such conditions in a sloth must be under the direction of the AV because there are no
medications labeled for use in this species. All medication use must be prescribed by the AV, and must follow
written instructions. This sloth must be seen by the AV to ensure a correct diagnosis and to implement a treatment
plan.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The shelters in the enclosures of male howler monkeys Foster and Grouse, and in the enclosure of the breedingpair of howler monkeys have excess build-up of grime on all inside and outside surfaces. This grimy coating can
result in growth of disease-causing bacteria, and can result in odors that attract insects and other vermin.
Thorougly cleaning all surfaces at each cleaning for scent-marking species can be stressful to the animals. A
solution is to do rotational cleaning. For example, thoroughly clean all interior surfaces one week, then all exterior
surfaces the following week. The entire shelter is then cleaned often enough to prevent problems associated with
grimy buildup without undue stress on the animals. Daily spot-cleaning must still be done.

3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
- The floor of the enclosure holding the tamandua is damaged. The impermeable surface layer has been torn up,
exposing the permeable subsurface. That subsurface cannot be cleaned and sanitized adequately.
Inability to clean and sanitize adequately can allow disease-causing organisms to grow, and also contributes to the
odor in the room. Surfaces must be maintained in good repair to ensure adequate cleaning is possible.
- The den of the sloth bear named Kurt has scant straw bedding that is wet and dirty. The bear is unable to avoid
being in contact with the wet, soiled bedding if he is to seek shelter from the weather. Scant, dirty bedding does not
allow the bear to be warm and comfortable when inside his shelter. It can also contribute to skin conditions and
illness in addition to just being uncomfortable for the animal.
The den needs to be inspected daily, and cleaned and rebedded as often as necessary to ensure he has a clean
and dry place to escape inclement weather.

*Note - when reviewing the photos of the bedding, a few blood spots were seen in the bedding. The licensees were
notified of this and were asked to check on him. The reply was that it was from a torn toenail on his back foot.
The inspection and the exit briefing were conducted with a licensee, and in the presence of an IES supervisor.
