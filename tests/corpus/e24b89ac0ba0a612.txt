Inspectors attempted to contact licensee by knocking on door, calling available cell phone number and sending a text
message. This is the second attempted inspection.

The licensee failed to have a responsible person available to conduct an animal welfare inspection. The facility was not
able to be inspected for compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, regulations and standards to ensure the health and well-
being of the animals.
