2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A blue and tan, male Yorkshire Terrier, approximately nine years old and identified by tag number 047, is exhibiting
abnormal behavior. The inspector observed the dog constantly licking its teeth and gums. After about a minute, the
inspector requested the licensee to remove the dog for a closer examination. Most of the dog's teeth are missing,
but among the remaining, are two upper canine teeth and one lower canine tooth. All three are partially covered with
a dark brown tarter and have a creamy grey discharge along the gum line. The teeth also felt loose to the touch.
After the dog was returned to the enclosure, it continued to constantly lick its teeth and gums. A veterinarian has not
evaluated the dog's condition. The dog's abnormal appearance and behavior can be an indication of mouth pain
caused by loose teeth and/or dental disease.
The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate
treatment plan. Additionally, the licensee needs to consult the attending veterinarian to develop and follow a dental
maintenance plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector upon
request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.

*The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 18, 2016.
