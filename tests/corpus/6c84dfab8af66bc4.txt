SANITATION.
A build up of excreta and food waste was noted in the bins found under the rabbit enclosures. The bins were
stained and had areas of mineral build up. An odor was evident and there was increased insect activity including
flies and bees. Bins under the wire floor enclosures must be cleaned at least every week. Bins need to be kept in an
appropriate condition so as to prevent excessive odor and insect activity. A clean and well maintained environment
is necessary to prevent discomfort to the animals and discourage the spread of disease.
