The approved protocols 'Surgical Procedures Dog' and 'Surgical Procedures Cat' involve procedures (castration and
OVH) that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or distress. They do not provide a written narrative
description of the methods and sources used to determine that alternatives were not available in order to help
ensure that pain and distress will be minimized. The IACUC must ensure that the principal investigator has
considered alternatives to procedures that may cause more than momentary or slight pain or disress to the animals
and has provided a written narrative description of the methods and sources used to determine that alternatives
were not available.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two electric night lights have been added in the cat room just above the shelf holding cat beds. The electrical cords
have been partially covered but the last few inches of cord and the plug are not protected. The plastic of the cords
just adjacent to the plugs have an irregular almost frayed appearance as if cats have scratched or chewed at them.
This may lead to injury to the cats. The cat room must be constructed and maintained so that it protects the cats
from injury. Correct by 4/1/15.
Exit conducted with Attending Veterinarian.
