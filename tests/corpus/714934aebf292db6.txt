(c) Surfaces (2) Maintenance and replacement of surfaces.
****In the sheltered facility, there were three primary enclosures containing four adult dogs. Around the interior
surface of the doorways, the edges of the covering of the walls had been chewed away leaving the wooden studs
exposed. The exposed studs have also been chewed and scratched and have rough surfaces. The exposed wood
has not been sealed against moisture. Unsealed and chewed edges cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized and
increases the risk of disease to the animals.. The licensee must repair these surfaces and assure that all surfaces
are replaced or repaired as required.
To be corrected by January 20, 2015
