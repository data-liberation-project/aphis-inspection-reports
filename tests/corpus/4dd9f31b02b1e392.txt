Item 3.81 c 2
At the time of inspection non human primate Jade was noted to have hair loss on both its forelegs, while the facility
does have an enrichment program that includes special considerations for non-human primates with this type of
problem, this particular issue for this primate was not communicated to the attending veterinarian as indicated in its
enrichment program.
The facility veterinarian is looking at the primate and reviewing procedures for correction before the end of the day.
