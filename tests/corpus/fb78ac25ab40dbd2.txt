Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee is not following the Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) written by her Attending Veterinarian. The PVC
states that 33% of the adult dogs in the kennel are to be tested for heartworm annually and that all adult dogs are to be
tested for intestinal parasites annually. The licensee has not had this testing done in the past year. Following the PVC is
necessary so that the dogs receive appropriate preventative care for their health and well-being. The licensee must follow
the PVC as written by the Attending Veterinarian.
