2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
- In the sheltered facility, "Ziggy,"(cid:29) an 8 year old dappled Dachshund male (ID # 0A01705230 ) had an excessive
buildup of a dark brown material on the teeth extending up into the gum line. Most of the teeth could not be
visualized. The gums were swollen and reddened. There was a yellow, creamy material along the gum line near
one of the large cheek teeth on the right side (the large carnassial tooth). The buildup of abnormal material on teeth
with a discharge at the gum line can be painful, impact the ability of the dog to eat normally, and harm the health of
the animal. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
- In the sheltered portion located behind the licensee'(cid:25)s home a red female Chow Chow named, "Pearl" (cid:28)had a
clear discharge surrounding and draining from both eyes and down her face. The discharge completely circled
each eye and ran down her face toward the muzzle. The licensee stated that Pearl's(cid:29) eyes had been that way since
she was a puppy but no documentation could be provided from the attending veterinarian indicating a pre-existing
condition. Eye discharge can occur due to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could
be painful. The licensee must have this animal examined by a veterinarian to obtain an accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plan. The outcome of this consultation must be documented and provided to the inspector
upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
- One outdoor enclosure contained three adult Scottish Terriers, two females and one male. One black female
named, "(cid:28)Teddy Bear"(cid:29) appeared to be very sore and stiff when trying to walk. This could be an indication of an
altercation between one or more of the other dogs in the enclosure or be an indication of health issues. (cid:28)Teddy
Bear(cid:29) also had fecal material coating her bottom area indicating a quick release of feces associated with fear or
intimidation from another dog or diarrhea. The stiff, sore posture indicates a health issue and the underlying cause
must be determined and addressed. If the diagnosis is soreness due to fighting then the social hierarchy of this
group does not accommodate these two particular females with this particular male. The licensee must take this
animal to a veterinarian and determine the underlying problem and observe and establish appropriate compatibility
between mating pairs in order to prevent future injury and maintain compatible groups at all times.
2.75(a)(1)RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
- Official USDA dog on hand sheets (7005's) did not have a complete listing of all dogs on the premise. When the
records and dogs at the facility do not match it makes the records incomplete. Complete and accurate records are
needed to ensure each animal'(cid:25)s identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate the ability to trace dogs. The
licensee must maintain records which fully disclose all information concerning each dog in their possession. The
licensee must maintain complete and accurate records of all dogs at all times at their facility.

3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
- In the sheltered enclosure with concrete runs there was an excess buildup of animal waste covering 40-50% of the
concrete runs and 5-10% of the indoor portion and bedding. The licensee stated that the solid waste had been
removed four days prior to the inspection. Fecal waste buildup reduces available floor surface area that the dogs
have access to. Animal waste collecting under and around dogs creates an unsanitary condition and could lead to
potential disease or health risks for the dogs. The potential for increased insect and pest infestation exists when
animal waste is not removed in a timely manner. The potential for respiratory problems exist when the dogs are
subjected to the continual smell of animal waste that is collecting under and around them. Removal of animal
waste from the runs and inside the sheltered facility must occur daily to prevent an excessive accumulation that
could cause soiling of the dogs contained in the primary enclosures and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests,
and odors. The licensee must ensure that all excreta is removed from the primary enclosures on a daily basis.
