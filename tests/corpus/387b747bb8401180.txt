Watering.
The facility uses a large clear plastic water container to provide water to the guinea pigs. The container is located above
the enclosures and has a system of tubes and hoses running from it to each guinea pig enclosure. The water inside the
container was greenish in color and the bottom 3 inches of the container was coated with a brown material on the inside
of the container. In addition, the connecting lines to the watering nipples have a build-up of green material inside.
Failure to clean and sanitize waterers often enough to prevent accumulation of debris can result in decreased water
intake or spread of disease which can negatively impact the health of the animals.
Watering receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as necessary to maintain the health and well-being of the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
