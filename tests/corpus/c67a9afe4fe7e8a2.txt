2.131(c)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
In the wildlife exhibit area there is an enclosure containing two deer. The enclosure is made out of coated wire mesh
and is immediately adjacent to a public walkway. There is no barrier to prevent the public on the walkway from
touching and/or sticking their fingers through the wire mesh and having direct contact with the animals in the
enclosure. There is no attendant present in this portion of the facility to monitor this enclosure. This poses a hazard
to both the public and the animals within the exhibit. During public exhibition, there must be sufficient distance
and/or effective barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals
and the public.
To be corrected by September 8th, 2014.
This is a focused inspection addressing public barriers.
