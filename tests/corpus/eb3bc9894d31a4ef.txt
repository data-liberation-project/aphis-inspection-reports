ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A brown wether goat had front hooves that were overgrown and curled sideways and it was walking stiffly on its
front legs. The licensee reported that the goat had been trimmed in December 2015 and that the facility planned to
trim his hooves soon. If left uncorrected, overgrown hooves can be painful and cause other parts of the animals
legs to begin to have problems and pain. Ensure that animals' hooves are trimmed and maintained before the
animals' ability to walk normal is affected.
Note: Licensee trimmed this animal's hooves prior to the exit interview.

WATERING.
Three dead flies and a build up of green material were present inside of the macaques' water receptacle during the
time of inspection. Dead flies and green material are sources of contamination and could make animals sick.
Thoroughly clean and sanitize the macaques' water receptacle to assure that the animals have clean, potable
drinking water.

SANITATION.
Excessive amounts of black flies and fruit flies are present inside of the educational building. The flies were
observed near, in, and on the animals' enclosures. Fly spray, a single sticky fly trap, and fly bait are currently being
used at the facility, however; these methods are not effectively controlling the fly population. Flies can carry and
spread disease.
Establish and maintain an effective program to control the flies at the facility to promote animal health.To be corrected: 4-21-16
