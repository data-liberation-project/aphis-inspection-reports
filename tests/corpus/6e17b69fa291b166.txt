2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***The written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) on file is incomplete. Sections 3 and 4 of APHIS form 7002 have
not been completely filled out. The PVC is a written agreement between the exhibitor and the attending veterinarian
establishing standards of care for the animals. Failure to have a complete PVC could jeopardize the health and
well-being of the animals. The facility should establish and maintain a PVC to include all the regulated animals at
the facility.
To be corrected by 5/9/14.
Inspection was conducted at the Pima County Fair; Tucson, Arizona.
Exit interview was conducted on-site with facility representative.
