2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Saint Bernard identified as “Beckles” (DOB 12-2011, Microchip #A02396226) was observed to have an
open sore/wound on the top of the nose area. The sore area was approximately 3/4 to 1 inch in size and appeared
partially ulcerated,red and moist. Flies were observed landing around the affected area. The licensee stated that
the dog had been previously evaluated by a veterinarian and that she had been treating the sore area for flies on a
regular basis. Documentation of a general fly control program was provided by the licensee, but no treatment
records nor documentation were available at the time of inspection to verify "Beckles" had been evaluated by a
veterinarian for her current wound and an appropriate treatment plan established for resolution of the condition.
An open, non-healing wound on the nose area could be indicative of repeated trauma, sunlight sensitivity or a skin
disorder associated with an underlying medical condition. Ineffective treatment or non-treatment may lead to
further fly attraction, infection, inadequate wound healing and animal discomfort.
“Beckles” needs to be evaluated by a veterinarian to determine the cause of the sore and an appropriate treatment
plan established to help resolve the condition. Written documentation of veterinary evaluation and current treatment
need to be maintained and those records made available to the inspector upon request.

3.1(c) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two kennels, one containing four dogs and another containing two dogs, and located in the south sheltered kennel
building, were observed to have chewed and exposed wood surfaces in their interior compartments.

Exposed wood surfaces are difficult to sanitize and can absorb moisture and bacteria. The inability to effectively
clean and sanitize these surfaces can then lead to insanitary conditions and disease transmission. All contact surfaces with dogs must be properly maintained on a regular basis. Wood surfaces that become
damaged and are no longer sealed need to be repaired, sealed or replaced.

3.9(b)
FEEDING.
3.9 (b) Three kennels containing two dogs each and one kennel containing four dogs were observed to have no
food receptacles. Dry dog food was observed to have been placed directly on the concrete pads of the kennel runs
for feeding purposes.
Placing food on the ground or floor for feeding increases the risk of contaminating the food with feces and attracting
pests. This in turn may become a disease risk for dogs being fed on the ground.
Durable and easily sanitized food receptacles must be provided to all dogs for feeding purposes. Food receptacles
must also protect food from rain/snow and be located so as to minimize contamination by feces and pests.
