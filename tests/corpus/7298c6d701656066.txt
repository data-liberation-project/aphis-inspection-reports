3.52(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A rabbit is being housed outdoors with no fencing, beyond its primary enclosure, that would exclude predators.
In order to house the rabbits in this manner the licensee would need to request and receive a variance from USDA /
APHIS / Animal Care.
Steps should be taken immediately to protect the rabbits from any possible predators, and this issue should be
resolved, via variance or fencing, by 10/1/16.
3.56(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The rabbit enclosure is made of wire panels which have significant rust, impeding cleaning and sanitizing. Poor
sanitation could be detrimental to the health of the rabbit.
The rabbit enclosure should be maintained in good repair, free of debris and rust, so as to provide a clean, safe
environment for the rabbit.To be corrected by 9/1/16.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The animal enclosures were not structurally sound, and contained hazards that could injure the animals:
In the hoofstock enclosures there were corrugated metal sections in the fence-line, on the ground, and overhead,
that had sharp edges. Welded wire fencing panels fastened together, or to posts, with twine. Fencing is not sturdy
enough for species.
Enclosures should be constructed of materials, and of sufficient strength so as to be appropriate for the species.
They should be maintained in good repair. They should adequately contain the animals, and protect them from
injury.
The current state of these enclosures puts the animals at risk of escape and or injury. Steps should be taken to
repair and maintain the enclosures.
This issue was cited previously, and the correction date is past due.
3.131(a)
SANITATION.
In the enclosures for the cattle, goats, sheep, and llama, there is an accumulation of mud and excreta, with virtually
no dry area available to the animals apart from some straw and pallets that have been provided for the animals.
The animals must pass through excessive mud and manure in order to access food or water, or make normal social
and postural adjustments.
Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination of the animals.
Exposure to wet, accumulated manure and mud creates an unsanitary environment for the animals that can be
detrimental to their health.
The enclosures should be cleaned regularly so as to maintain a sanitary environment for the animals.
To be corrected by 9/1/16.3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was an excessive amount of clutter and an accumulation of discarded items on the grounds and in buildings
near the animals.
The buildings and grounds should be kept clean and in good repair, in order to facilitate good husbandry, and to
avoid creating habitat for vermin. Accumulations of trash should be removed. Failure to maintain good
housekeeping could be detrimental to the well-being of the animals.

An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
