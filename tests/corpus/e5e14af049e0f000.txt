3.1(c)(3)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The Plastic flooring for several enclosures, housing a total of 34 adult dogs, in the Bulldog Kennel had an
accumulation of fecal waste. The owner mentioned the hired hand did clean the enclosures on Wednesday. This
indicates daily spot cleaning is not taking place, and can increase the disease potential for the dogs.
For the prevention of disease and accumulation of fecal waste, all enclosures must be spot-cleaned daily.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and Randall Wagner (ACI).
This inspection will be sent by e-mail.
