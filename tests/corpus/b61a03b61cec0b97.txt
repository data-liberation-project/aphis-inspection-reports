ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 on
03-Oct-17. There was no answer at the door or on the listed phone so a voicemail message was left. The licensee
responded that he would attempt to contact his wife who he believed to be home, but he could not reach her. The
inspector waited the full 30 minutes to hear back from the wife before leaving the facility.
Without an available representative to accompany inspection, the regulatory process is impossible. The licensee
must ensure a responsible facility representative is available to accompany inspection during normal business
hours. Contact your inspector to establish available hours.
Correct from this time forward.
