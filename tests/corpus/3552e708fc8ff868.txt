2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****A male red Poodle named Turner (MC# 101-605-060) has an accumulation of dark brown material coating the
entire surface of the upper cheek teeth. Teeth and gum problems can be painful, can affect the animal's ability to
eat, and can result in tooth loss. The licensee must have this dog examined by a veterinarian. The licensee must
keep records of the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care and must make these records available to the
inspector upon request. The licensee must establish an effective program of dental maintenance for all dogs in the
kennel.
****Three dogs, a red male Poodle (MC#101-605-060), a white male Bichon (MC#000-729-5417), and a male red
Poodle (MC#096-782-377) all have matted hair on the legs, neck, shoulders and back covering at least 60 percent
of the body. Matted hair can cause pain and discomfort, trap dirt, debris and moisture and affect the skin. It can
foster skin infections, affect the animal's mobility or be able to defecate normally. Matted hair does not maintain the
same insulating qualities of normally groomed hair. The licensee must remove all matted hair and establish an
effective program for coat maintenance for the health and well- being of the dog.
The inspection and exit interview was done with facility representative.
