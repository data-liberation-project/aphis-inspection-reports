WATERING.
There were accumulations of dirt and debris by all the automatic water valves and PVC pipes around the water
valves. The water pipes and drainage pipes have accumulations of debris, grime, and dust. These accumulations
on the water valves and surrounding PVC pipes expose the guinea pigs to potential infections with bacteria, fungi,
and parasites. Inadequate cleaning and sanitation of the water valves and surrounding PVC pipes can result in
contamination and health problems of the guinea pig colony. Correct by keeping the water valves, water lines and
PVC pipes clean to ensure the health and well-being of the guinea pigs. Correct August 18, 2016.
3.31(a)(1) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Primary enclosures are not being cleaned adequately or often enough to remove accumulations of excreta, soiled
bedding, dirt, debris, and urine stains. There were accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, dirt, urine stains and
grime on sides and floors of enclosures. The majority of the enclosures had a fecal material consolidated in a moist
fecal pad on the floor area by the watering system and on the sides of the enclosures. Ineffective cleaning and
sanitation exposes the animals to disease hazards such as bacterial, fungal, and viral diseases. Primary enclosures
must be cleaned often enough to prevent accumulations of excreta, soiled bedding, dirt, urine stains and grime and
must be sanitized at least once every 2 weeks using one of the methods described in section 3.31(a)(4). Correct by
ensuring that all primary enclosures are kept clean and sanitized othen enough to prevent accumulation of excreta
and debris. Additionally, ensure that all primary enclosures are sanitized at least once every two weeks.
3.31(a)(4) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs are not being sanitized properly. There were accumulations of excreta, soiled
bedding, dirt, urine stains and grime on sides and floors of enclosures. The buildup of urine stains, dirt and grime on
sides and floors of enclosures indicates the enclosures are not being cleaned and sanitized adequately or
effectively. Licensee must ensure that primary enclosures are sanitized using 180 degrees and soap or detergent in
a mechanical cage wash, by ensuring washing with a detergent solution and then using a disinfectant, or by
cleaning with live steam. Sanitation of primary enclosures is necessary to minimize risk of disease to the animalshoused therein.
