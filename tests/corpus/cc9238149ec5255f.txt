Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The program of veterinary care states that the animals must be evaluated at least once a year for internal and external
parasite control. The animals had not been evaluated by the attending veterinarian since 2020. The deviation from
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases or injuries can lead to unnecessary pain or
discomfort to the animals. Correct by adhering to the program of veterinary care created by the attending veterinarian.

3.131(c)

Sanitation.
There was an accumulation of discarded feed material under the enclosure caging for 8 sugar gliders. The licensee
usually vacuums underneath the cages at least once a week, but a personal injury prevented her from doing so these
past two weeks. Accumulations of feed material can attract pests and cause unnecessary odors. Licensees should keep
the premises clean and in good repair in order to protect animals and their health.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
