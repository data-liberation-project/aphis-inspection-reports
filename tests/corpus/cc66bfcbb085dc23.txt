ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1320 on
20-NOV-17.
Upon arrival at the facility I found no one home. I then called the contact number provided and made contact with
the licensee. She stated that she was away from the kennel and would not be available for inspection today.
End of report.
