2.31(c)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Currently, the IACUC is only using one member to conduct the required semi annual site visit during their January
2015 inspection.
A minimum of 2 IACUC members is required to conduct any evaluations of the facility's programs and facilities;
providing further that no committee member wishing to participate in any evaluation may be excluded.
The IACUC developed a checklist since the last inspection that the member is using to provide guidance during the
facility inspection which has 3 columns: "A", "M", & "S". The IACUC member that performed the last inspection
indicated that the "A" column stands for items that are checked annually, "M" is for items that are checked monthly,
& "S" is for items that are checked semiannually (the common nomenclature used for these types of checklists for
these letters are: "A" indicates Acceptable, "M" indicates Minor deficiency, & "S" indicates Significant deficiency).
All applicable items are to be reviewed at least once every 6 months. There is no mechanism for identifying
significant deficiencies from minor deficiencies which must be reported to the Institutional Official & APHIS if not
corrected within 15 days2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
There are 33 protocols, all of which were last reviewed, and approved, by the IACUC on 2/26/14. The IACUC shall

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Several protocols involve teaching the students venipuncture or intravenous injections. None of the protocols (with
the exception of the rabbit) indicate how much blood will be withdrawn or the amount of fluid that would be injected
into the animals.
These protocols shall be revised, and approved by the IACUC, to indicate the volumes of blood that will be
withdrawn and the amount of fluids that will be injected into each species of animal.
