2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One of the opossums receives an oral daily glucosamine supplement. The supplement is labeled to administer one
treat to a sixty pound dog. One treat is divided into six pieces and one piece is given to the opossum once daily.
Though the attending veterinarian has indicated on the written program of veterinary care that Cosequin may be
given to older animals, the supplement being used is not the brand Cosequin, nor are there veterinary instructions
present for how to dose this supplement to opossums.
Pyrantel poamate, an oral dewormer labeled for dogs, is kept on hand and given to the opossums once monthly at
the dog dose. The written program of veterinary care indicates the opossums will have fecal exams done and
treated as necessary. There are no veterinary instructions present for how to dose the opossums with the
dewormer kept on hand.
Medications/supplements/treatments may be ineffective or even harmful when used off label. Specific instructions
including: The species for which it is to be used, the name of the medication/supplement/treatment, the dose to be
administered, the route of administration, the frequency of administration, and the duration of treatment must be
indicated for all medications/supplements/treatments used. All medications/supplements/treatments must be
approved by a licensed veterinarian. Each exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under formal
arrangements which includes a written program of veterinary care and specific instructions for use of all
medications/supplements and treatments.
