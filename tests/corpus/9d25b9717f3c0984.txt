INFORMATION AS TO BUSINESS; FURNISHING OF SAME BY DEALERS, EXHIBITORS, OPERATORS OF
AUCTION SALES, INTERMEDIATE HANDLERS, AND CARRIERS.
The United Airline representatives at Honolulu International Airport were asked repeatedly for records regarding the
escape of a cat in their care. Initially there was an on-site visit at HNL on 9-19-15 regarding this incident, followed by
email correspondence and five phone conversations. During these interactions the registrant's representatives were
asked to provide an account of what occurred when the cat escaped, what corrective actions have been taken, and
any records related to the incident. Despite these repeated attempts, no information was provided to APHIS, as of
10/9/15.
The registrant is required to furnish information to any APHIS official upon request. The information should be
provided in a timely manner. Failure to cooperate with APHIS regarding animal handling could impede APHIS's
ability to evaluate whether the welfare of the animals is being adequately addressed, and whether handling is in
compliance with AWA regulations.
To be corrected from this time forward.

HANDLING.
In approximately January, 2014, a cat named "Bogie" escaped from its kennel while under the care of United
Airlines Cargo personnel at the Honolulu International Airport.
After the cat was recovered, a United spokesperson issued the following statement to the press:
"Our agents were working to secure the door of the kennel with plastic ties to ensure Bogie(cid:25)'s safety throughout the
flight. However, during this process the cat escaped from his kennel..."
The cat was missing for approximately 19 months, and was then recovered near the airport, and returned to his
owners.During transit, animals should be handled in a manner that protects their well-being and minimizes distress. Steps
should be taken to ensure that personnel are adequately trained and protocols are in effect to prevent any similar
incidents.
To be corrected from this time forward.
An exit briefing was given over the phone.
