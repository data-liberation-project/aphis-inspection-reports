PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary enclosures for dogs and cats.
1. Each of the 3 enclosures used to house 4 puppies (1 enclosure) and 11 kittens (2 separate enclosures) had part
of one wall that was constructed using chicken wire. Some of the edges of chicken wire were noted to have sharp
points that curled inwards into the enclosures. Sharp wire points can cause injuries to the animals.
Per this Section of the Regulations, primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no
sharp points or edges that could injure the dogs and cats.
The licensee needs to repair or replace the chicken wire in the 3 enclosures.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Resting surfaces for cats.
1. The primary enclosure that housed 7 kittens did not have a sufficient number of elevated resting surfaces that
could hold all of the kittens at the same time.
Per this Section of the Regulations, each primary enclosure housing cats must contain a resting surface or surfaces
that, in the aggregate, are large enough to hold all the cats housed in the primary enclosure at the same time
comfortably. The resting surfaces must be elevated, impervious to moisture, and be able to be easily cleaned and
sanitized, or easily replaced when soiled or worn.
The licensee needs to ensure that all primary enclosures used to house cats are provided with a sufficient number
of elevated resting surfaces that can hold all the cats comfortably at the same time. This primary enclosure must be
provided with additional elevated resting surfaces.
