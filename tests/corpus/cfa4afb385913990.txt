FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The kitchen area has one very small sink - measuring approximately 12" x 10". This is the only sink available for
staff members carrying out feeding and cleaning duties. This sink is used for food preparation, cleaning out items
from animal enclosures, hand washing, and even dumping the mop bucket. The very small size of the sink makes it
difficult to maintain in sanitary condition, and makes adequately cleaning large objects nearly impossible.
Unsanitary conditions can be harmful to the animals. Adequate facilities should be provided in order to maintain
cleanliness, which helps to ensure the well-being of the animals.
To be corrected by 7/20/15.
A exit interview was conducted with the curator.
This was a focused inspection on the new / temporary site for the Randall Museum.
