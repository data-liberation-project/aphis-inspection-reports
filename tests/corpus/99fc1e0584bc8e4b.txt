FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the rear storage room, adjacent to the skunk enclosures, there are six bags of Better Bedding stored directly on
the floor. One of these six bags is open. Additionally, there are two unopened bags of chicken feed stored directly
on the floor, across from the skunk enclosures. Unopened supplies of feed and bedding must be stored up off of
the floor and away from walls to ensure that the bags are protected from vermin and to be able to clean underneath
and around such supplies.
Open feed should be maintained in containers with tight fitting lids to protect such supplies against deterioration,
molding, or contamination by vermin that are capable of chewing through bags. Supplies that are free from
contamination are necessary for the health and well-being of the animals.

In the smaller, rear storage room and hallway, there are no lights that are in working order. Additionally, there are
five chinchillas housed in this same hallway. Adequate lighting is unavailable for the proper inspection of the
animals or facility husbandry.
Adequate lighting must be provided and be of good quality for the animals involved. Such lighting shall be uniformly
distributed and of sufficient intensity to permit routine inspection and cleaning.

HOUSEKEEPING -
THE FOLLOWING ITEMS ARE STILL IN NEED OF CLEANING, REMOVAL, REPAIR, AND/OR REPLACEMENT:
1. All of the refrigerators that are utilized for storing food items for the animals have accumulations of spilled liquids
and food. Spilled items leave these refrigerators in an unsanitary condition. All refrigerators must be cleaned and
sanitized to prevent food borne illnesses and to ensure that uncontaminated food is provided to the animals for their
health and well-being.
2. Tables used to prepare food items were covered with food, dirt, grime and other debris. Tables, as well as
utensils used for food preparation, must be cleaned and sanitized to prevent contamination and food borne
illnesses.
3. Black mold is present on the base of the wall below the food prep table. This mold must be removed to prevent
illness to the animals and employees.
4. Dead insects are present in the light fixture of the quarantine room. Dead insects must be removed.
5. Tables used to hold animal enclosures were covered with spilled feed, bedding and other debris. These tables
must be cleaned and sanitized.
6. In the small holding room, an electrical outlet has been pulled out of the wall and is hanging by the conduit. This
exposed power outlet is dangerous and must be properly secured for the safety of the animals and employees.
7. The linoleum floor, in the room holding the coatimundi and sugar gliders, is still torn in several locations. The
coatimundi have destroyed the linoleum floor beneath their enclosure thus exposing the concrete floor.
8. There is one missing tile and one severely damaged tile in the room holding the sugar gliders, guinea pigs,
rabbits and skunk. The severely damaged tile is beneath the leg of the rack holding the guinea pigs.
Fecal material and other debris can accumulate in these damaged areas. The damaged linoleum and missing tiles
must be removed, repaired or replaced to keep the floors in good repair in order to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices.
9. Numerous empty boxes, that are used to transport animal purchases, are stored haphazardly on the floor next to
the skunk enclosures.10. The walls behind all of the sugar glider enclosures, as well as the skunk in holding, are covered with food
debris, grime and other organic materials. These walls must be cleaned and sanitized to maintain facility
cleanliness and to prevent the attraction of flies and other unwanted insects.
11. There continues to be a severe accumulation of tools, furniture, clothing, animal racks, empty enclosures,
tanks, boxes, spilled bedding, usable store items and other miscellaneous materials stored haphazardly throughout
the rear rooms of the facility. The haphazard storage of unnecessary items leave harborage areas for unwanted
pests and/or escaped animals.
This non-compliance has been documented on March 8, 2016 and November 4, 2016 and continues to be a chronic
problem. The unnecessary items must be removed and the items that are for store use must be appropriately
organized to ensure that the store rooms are clean and free from harborage areas to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
This inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the facility representatives.
