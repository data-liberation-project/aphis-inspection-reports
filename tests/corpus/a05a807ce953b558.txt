2.40(b)(2) DIRECT REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
We verified that the animals cited on the 3 April 2017 inspection report needing veterinary evaluation and treatment
were addressed by the licensee and the attending veterinarian. While walking through the facility we noticed two
animals that are in need of veterinary treatment that the facility had not noticed and was not treating at the time of
inspection:
In the area where sick animals were separated from the healthy animals, a beige chinchilla with yellow enclosure
tag 126 and yellow 72 was being treated for eye problems by the facility; however we noticed it had a large,
reddened, hairless swelling under its chin. While the eye problems had been treated and appeared to be resolving,
the abscess is a new problem that had not been noticed and treated by the facility. This swelling are a sign of
infection or other health problem and can cause the animal pain and can be contagious to other animals. Consult
with the attending veterinarian and treat this animal per the veterinarian's instructions promptly.
Indirect Non-compliance:
We noticed a chinchilla's (eartag GROS 139, licensee added yellow tag 143 to enclosure) left eye was crusted shut
and had some pale discharge when the licensee handled it. This animal's problem was pointed out to the licensee
by inspectors. An eye crusted shut and pale discharge are signs of active eye problems and can be painful and
contagious to other animals. Ensure that eye problems are promptly identified in the animals and that they are
treated per the attending veterinarian's instructions.
This was a focused inspection of the animals cited on the April 3, 2017 inspection report under 2.40 b(2).
Exit interview was conducted with a facility representative.
