2.40(b)(2) Direct Repeat

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There are five, adult white-tailed deer, at least five adult Nubian ibex and one sika deer with overgrown hooves, affecting
the angles of their feet due to a lack of hoof trimming. The veterinarian evaluated these animals on September 9, 2021
and provided contact information for a farrier to trim the hooves. As of the date of inspection, the hooves remain
untrimmed but the licensee has secured an appointment with the farrier to occur at the time of the next veterinary visit,
scheduled for September 23, 2021. Until the hooves are trimmed, the veterinarian's recommendation has not been
followed. Failure to appropriately maintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or case injuries.
The licensee needs to follow the veterinarian's recommendation.
3.80(a)(2)(iii) Critical Repeat

Primary enclosures.
In the lemur barn, there is a juvenile lemur seen outside of a primary enclosure. The animal is small enough to squeeze
through the 2X4" fencing on the parents' enclosure, giving it free roam of the barn, other lemur enclosures, and potentially
the outside areas of the facility through windows and doors opened in the barn to facilitate ventilation.
Primary enclosures that do not contain the animals can facilitate escape and/or injury. Primary enclosures must be
constructed and maintained so that they contain the non-human primates securely.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
