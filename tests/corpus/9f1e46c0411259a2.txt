3.1(a)

Housing facilities, general.
* Dug holes were observed under the enclosure divider fencing in two outdoor enclosures. The holes range in size from
six inches to a foot in depth and an estimated foot in length. Six dogs are in contact with the affected divider fencing. The
dogs could become entrapped in the holes under the divider fencing. In addition, one of the divider panels had exposed
ends protruding downwards into the dug hole. This affects the ability of enclosure divider fencing to contain the dogs
securely. It could lead to potential injury if the dogs try to escape under the fencing, affecting the safety and health of the
dogs. The licensee must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury, contain the animals
securely, and restrict other animals from entering. Correct by 2/24/22.
3.10(c)

Watering
* The tops of six plastic water receptacles were chewed with sharp, jagged edges. Twelve dogs are in contact with the
affected receptacles located in outdoor housing. A jagged, roughened surface cannot be adequately cleaned and
sanitized when the protective coating has been chewed. Sharp, jagged edges could potentially cause injury if the dog
chews on the receptacle. The licensee must ensure that all water receptacles can be readily cleaned and sanitized or be
replaced when worn. Correct by 2/24/22.


This inspection and exit interview done on 2/10/22 were conducted with the licensee.
