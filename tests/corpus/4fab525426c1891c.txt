ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a 4 month old German Shepard female that had a collar that was left on while she was growing and
became too tight, causing the collar to break the skin and bite into the muscle tissue of the neck. There were two
areas approximately 2 inches long, 1/2 inch wide of exposed muscle tissue that was caught in the buckle of the
collar. There was some yellow/green infected mucus with a very strong odor was oozing from the muscle tissue that
was caught in the buckle. The collar had been put on the pup and not checked as she grew, causing the collar to
cut into her neck. The injury had not been observed until during the inspection, so a veterinarian had not been
contacted.
Collars that are not monitored on growing dogs can grow into the neck tissue causing serious injury or strangle the
animals if left unmonitored.
The licensee must contact the attending veterinarian for proper treatment and care of the injury. All collars on the
regulated animals must be checked and loosened to prevent injuries.
The attending veterinarian was contacted during the inspection, and coming to the property by the end of the day.
The collar was removed and treatment being provided.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a 4 month old German Shepard female that had a collar that was left on while she was growing and
became too tight, causing the collar to break the skin and bite into the muscle tissue of the neck. The collar had not
been observed as being too tight until during the inspection.
Collars that are not monitored on growing dogs, or put on too tight on any dog can cause serious damage to the
necks of the regulated animals. These collars can grow into the neck tissue or strangle the animals if left
unmonitored. The licensee must increase their daily observation of the collars that are on their regulated animals, and monitor the
tightness on the growing pups to make sure they provide enough room for comfort and swallowing ability of the
dogs.

TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
There are 5 dogs on the inventory that have been at the facility since November 2016 that do not have proper
USDA ID tags. While the dogs are listed on the inventory and have collars, they do not have the proper ID tags on
the collars.
Proper USDA ID tags are required for proper management and traceability of the regulated animals.
All regulated animals must have USDA tags on their collars when they are added to the inventory and are old
enough to require permanent USDA identification according to USDA AWA.
