FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There were jagged and broken edges observed on the fence of the white tail deer stall in the petting zoo area. This
fencing was in between the white tail deer stall and a male goat stall. Both animals had access to this fencing.
Jagged wire edges can possibly cause injury to the animals housed within the stall. The facility needs to maintain
fencing in good repair. The fencing was repaired and the issue was corrected at the time of the inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with the facility representative.
