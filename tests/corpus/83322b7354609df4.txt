FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Section 3.125(a) Structural strength: The following wood enclosures must be repaired.
1) The last enclosure on the right side, housing one skunk, has broken floor wire next to the wood floor support near
the shelter entrance. The floor must be repaired to prevent injury to the feet/legs of the skunk and to be structurally
sound.
2) The enclosure on the right side under the trees, housing one skunk, has the wood roof separating from the
enclosure sides on the left front and left back, leaving a gap between the top of the enclosure sides and the wood
roof. The wood roof must be secured to the sides of the enclosure to prevent escapes.
3) The third to the last enclosure on the right side, housing one skunk, has broken wires at the bottom of its
self-feeder. The wire ends may cause injury to the mouth/face of the skunk when it eats. The self- feeder must be
replaced or repaired to prevent injury to the skunk.
Primary enclosures, including food and water receptacles, must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair
to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals. Correct items 1 & 3 by April 4, 2017. Correct item 2
by April 8, 2017.
