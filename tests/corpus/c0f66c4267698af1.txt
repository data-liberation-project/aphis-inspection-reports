ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:40pm on
19-SEP-19.
I arrived at the facility and knocked on the door, called out, left a message for the licensee at the phone number
provided, and waited 30 minutes before leaving. Licensee called later that afternoon and stated they were not
available for an inspection that day.
