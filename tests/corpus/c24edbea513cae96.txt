FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The chicken, pork, fish, and ground beef (used with medication) being fed to the large felids, raccoons, and otters in
the walk in cooler are not being stored and thawed at sufficient temperatures to adequately protect from spoilage,
harmful bacteria and other disease-causing pathogens. The walk in freezer has been not cooling adequately for at
least 2 days or more and is set to be repaired the day after this inspection.
(1) During this inspection at 1:30 PM, there was a bucket of chicken being thawed in water outside at the food
preparation area. Frozen foods should not be thawed by exposure to excessive heat (ambient outside
temperatures of 98 F, during this inspection) or in standing water. Thawing in standing water is not recommended
because of loss of nutrients and the possibility of increased microbial buildup. For the health and welfare of these
animals, thawed meat should be kept iced or refrigerated until a reasonable time before feeding.
2) During this inspection the temperatures inside the walk in freezer storing the meats and fish for the large felids,
raccoons, and otters were 32 F to 45 F. Due to the door not being able to close tightly after several minutes the
temperature rose to 45 F. The thermostat on the outside of the freezer prior to entering was 40 F. The chicken and
pork was thawed on the outside and partial frozen in the center. It was stated that this shipment of meat was
delivered in the last several days. The ground beef roll was thawed and brown in color and I was able to push into
the meat with my finger from the plastic covering. This ground beef appears to have been in the freezer longer than
the other meats. The mullet fish were in an uncovered box thawed, soft in touch, dry outside surfaces, unpleasant
odors and cloudy eyes.
Proper temperatures in refrigerated and freezer spaces should be—
Freezer: –22 to 0 F) Refrigerator: 40 to 43 F. Refrigeration should be repaired in a timely manner so that food is
stored at sufficient temperatures to protect it from spoilage and harmful bacteria, which could harm the animals at
this facility.
On August 18, 2015, this non compliance for inadequate food storage was cited.

FEEDING.
The mullet fish in the walk in freezer for two river otters and roll of ground beef used with medicine used for the
large felids are not wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination or nutritive value to maintain these animals
in good health.
1) The otters have recently stopped eating this old fish and given a diet of chicken and pork. These river otters are
known to eat mainly fish in the wild and some crustaceans, mollusks, insects, birds, oysters, shellfish, crabs,
crayfish, frogs, rodents, turtles and aquatic invertebrate and now given chicken and pork. The change in the otters
diet shall be prepared with consideration for the species and approved by the attending veterinarian to ensure its an
adequate diet. The mullet in an uncovered box had dry outside surfaces, cloudy eyes, soft when touch and foul
odor. It was stated that the fish were in the freezer one week, however the condition of the mullet appears this fish
had been thawed more than the two days in insufficient temperatures of 32 F to 45 F, that was recorded during this
inspection. Fish should be fed to these otters after being thawed 24 hours or discarded.
2) The ground beef was thawed, brown in color, and I was able to push my fingers from the plastic wrapping. This
ground beef has been stored at insufficient temperatures for at least several days or more and appears obtained
prior to the other meats.
3) The outsides of the pork and some of the chicken that is fed to the large felids and raccoons were thawed and
according to the curator was just obtained several days ago. The curator stated that the walk in freezer would be
repaired the day after this inspection which would be at least 3 days with possible insufficient refrigeration. Any
meats that are spoiled should not be use and once thawed shall not be frozen again.
Proper temperatures in refrigerated and freezer spaces should be—
Freezer: –22 to 0 F) Refrigerator: 40 to 43 F.

4) The tigers and lions are currently eating chicken and pork with a supplement, but no longer given beef which
was a part of their diet approved by the attending veterinarian. All diets need to be followed and the diet for the
overweight male adult white tiger needs to be reviewed by the attending veterinarian to ensure that its a complete
nutritional diet.
5) This facility is in the process of breeding their large felids, however there is no diet available if cubs would be
unable to feed from their mother. Often there are issues with the mother feeding her cubs, so there must be a
written alternative diet available.All animals at this facility must be given a complete adequate diet approved by the attending veterinarian and or
nutritionist.

TO BE CORRECTED IMMEDIATELY.
This inspection was conducted with the care taker and exit interview with the Curator.
