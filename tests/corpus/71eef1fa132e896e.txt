ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection, a two week old black and white Boston Terrier puppy was observed to be listless and not moving
around much. Upon examination, it felt as if the back of the puppy's head was swollen and possibly filling with fluid.
The licensee stated that this puppy was behaving normally within just the past couple of hours. She stated she had
not contacted the Attending Veterinarian as of yet because this was the first she had seen the dog in it's current
condition. I advised her that we should stop the inspection at that point so she could contact the Attending
Veterinarian. She responded that there wasn't much she could do for the puppy and she indicated to me that there
was no need to contact the Attending Veterinarian. After further encouragement by me, the licensee contacted the
Attending Veterinarian so the puppy could be treated per the Attending Veterinarian's instructions.
A listless puppy that isn't moving around much indicates the puppy is probably having a serious medical problem
and if left untreated the condition will most likely continue to worsen and the puppy will probably die. A swollen
head can be painful and again indicates that the puppy is having a serous medical condition that needs immediate
medical attention.
The Attending Veterinarian needs to be contacted and the puppy needs to be treated per the Attending
Veterinarian's instructions. Any future medical problems that arise with the puppies and adults should be addressed
by the Attending Veterinarian. Serious medical conditions should be addressed by the Attending Veterinarian
immediately. Correct by end of day.
Note: The licensee has contacted the Attending Veterinarian and treated the puppy per his/her instructions.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
Note: This inspection took place over the course of two days: 12/13/17 and 12/14/17. The inspection was stopped
on 12/13/17 so the licensee could address the veterinary problem that took place during the inspection. The
inspection was then concluded on 12/14/17.End of report.
