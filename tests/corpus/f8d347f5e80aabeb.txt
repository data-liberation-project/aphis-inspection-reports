The left eye of the shih-tzu "Mighty Max" was moderate to severely enlarged and black with no whites visible. There
was also a small amount of thick, greyish discharge around the eye. He is missing his right eye, which has been the
case since he was obtained, and there is a moderate amount of crusting around this eye. The owner was not sure
whether the left eye had gotten worse since this dog had last been evaluated by the veterinarian (in April). "Mighty
Max" seemed to be less active than the other dogs in his kennel.
Enlargement of eyes can be an indicator of several serious medical conditions, some of which may be especially
painful to an animal. A veterinarian must be consulted when animals display signs that may indicate illness in order
to appropriately control, diagnose, and treat these diseases and injuries. Failure to consult a veterinarian can result
in worsening illness and/or distress to the animal.

The following is an indirect non-compliant item:
Three of the small dogs examined had a thick layer of brown crusted material completely covering their back teeth
(molars). Gums of other teeth were mildly reddened.
Moderate to severe dental issues can cause discomfort to animals and lead to worsening overall health. Animals
must be regularly observed for evidence of dental issues and problems must be brought to the attention of the
attending veterinarian. This observation may be accomplished by someone other than the attending veterinarian
provided that there is direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding health concerns
observed by on-site staff. Correct by 8/6/2014.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted on 7/16/14 with the Owner.
