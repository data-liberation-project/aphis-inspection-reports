Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult female white and brown goat had eyes with an abnormal appearance. Both eyes had swollen tissue under the
eyelids and around the eyes (conjunctiva). There was moderate greyish white discharge in the middle corner of both
eyes, and the fur under the eyes was wet. Both eyes were squinted slightly. The surface of the eyeballs was cloudy with
some areas of redness. The licensee stated that he had observed the animal's condition and had treated it with an
antibiotic injection but had not consulted the Attending Veterinarian.
Eye conditions such as this can have a significant negative impact on the animal by causing pain and discomfort,
interfering with vision, and if untreated can potentially result in ulceration of the eye. Eye conditions may also be
contagious and may affect nearby goats.
Correct by promptly obtaining veterinary care for the animal in consultation with the Attending Veterinarian.

Facilities, outdoor.
The property, which houses animals including kangaroos, porcupine, and cavy’s in outdoor enclosures, is not completely
enclosed by a perimeter fence. An adequate perimeter fence is present along 3 sides of the property, but the wire fence
along the driveway is only approximately 4.5 feet tall.


A perimeter fence is required to prevent unauthorized entry of people and animals which could steal, injure, sicken,
harass, or kill the captive animals. Exotic animals such as these, housed in outdoor facilities, require a 6-foot-tall
perimeter fence around their enclosures.
Correct by constructing a 6-foot-tall perimeter fence of sufficient strength to prevent entry of unauthorized people or
animals. Alternatively, a variance may be requested in writing from the APHIS Administrator. A perimeter fence must also
be maintained around sheltered primate enclosures as required under 3.77(f).

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
