The kennel facility consists of five sheltered buildings. In the eastern side of the fourth building there is one nine
year old male Yorkshire terrier, chip# 071835025, which needs to be evaluated by the attending veterinarian.
During the inspection the animal was observed excessively salivating and upon examination had a tooth on the
bottom right side which was loose and the dealer was able to move it about. The dealer must maintain written
documentation of the evaluation and all treatment.
