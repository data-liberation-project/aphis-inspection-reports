SANITATION.
Rabbit cages: Cage #4 had an excessive build up of dirt, debris, and mixed excreta and urine waste in one corner
of the floor and along the front part of the enclosure where the wire mesh is attached to the wood. A build up of old,
caked food and debris trapped between the wire mesh and the outside of the self-feeders was present in both cage
#4 and cage #8. Primary enclosures shall be kept reasonably free of excreta, hair, cobwebs and other debris by
periodic cleaning. The cleaning schedule for these enclosures is inadequate, as evidenced by the build up present.
Additionally, enclosures with raw wood that cannot be properly sanitized must be replaced as needed. A system of
cleaning and sanitation must be in place. Licensee moved affected rabbits to clean cages at time of inspection.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
A pen housing an adult alpaca with cria, sheep, and goats had 3 metal stakes, each placed approximately 12inches
from a wooden fence, which were used with wire to support the wooden fencing. The gaps between the metal
stakes and wooden fence and the wiring create enough space in which an animal could become trapped and/or
injured. These areas must be identified, kept in good repair and maintained to protect the animals, prevent injury to
limbs, and ensure their well-being. Licensee moved animals into a different pen, and a facility staff member initiated
corrections at time of inspection.
