ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One female goat identified as "Shamrock" has large patches of hair loss on both sides of her body . The hair loss on
the right side covers an area about 12 " x 12" and the left side is about 12" x 24". The skin is slightly pink and a
small scab and bloody spot are noted on the skin on the left side. Shamrock appears to be good body condition
and no scratching or rubbing was observed during the inspection.The licensee states that the goat scratches these
areas with her horns and the hair loss has been present since Spring 2018. She states she has treated with
permethrin but the goat has not been examined by a veterinarian. The pink color to the skin, scabs and scratching
are a signs of irritation which can be expected to cause distress to the goat. The skin condition has become chronic
and has not resolved with treatment by the licensee. Shamrock must be examined by a veterinarian to determine
the best treatment for her skin condition to relieve distress.
