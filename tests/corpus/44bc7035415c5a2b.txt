In May 2013, two rabbits were given oral dosage of a study compound via gavage. The gavage tubing was placed
into the lungs instead of stomach in both instances causing lung trauma and the rabbits were subsequently
euthanized. The facility has taken corrective measures, including but not limited to, retraining the involved staff and
veterinary staff will retrain again and observe the next gavage dosing. This incident has not recurred since May
2013.
This item has been corrected.
An exit briefing was conducted on site with facility representatives.
