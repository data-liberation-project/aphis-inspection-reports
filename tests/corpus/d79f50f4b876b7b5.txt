ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The current Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) has guidance for an unacceptable method of euthanasia for the
guinea pigs at this facility. No records of recent euthanasia were noted at the facility.The licensee must contact the
attending veterinarian to discuss the euthanasia method and ensure that the method used is approved in the current
guidance for euthanasia by the AVMA. Failure to provide an acceptable method may lead to suffering in the
animals. Correct this by contacting the attending veterinarian to have the written guidance updated.
*** The current Program of Veterinary Care has written guidance for the use of pour-on ivermectin. The licensee
stated that she is also diluting this pour-on in a spray bottle and misting the animals. This method is not approved in
the written PVC and does not provide for a given amount to be administered to each animal. The licensee must
obtain additional guidance to ensure the administration of this drug is approved by the attending veterinarian.
Correct before any future euthanasia or misting with ivermectin and at least by June 30, 2017.

SANITATION.
*** Several of the primary enclosures are excessively dirty and have an accumulation of feces. At least half of the
enclosures need a thorough cleaning to ensure a clean environment for the animals and to satisfy this section of the
regulations. Correct this by increasing the frequency of cleaning.

SANITATION.
*** Currently this facility is only cleaning the primary enclosures for the animals. No sanitization schedule is in placeto ensure the enclosures are sanitized with a disinfectant at least every 2 weeks. Failure to provide regular
sanitization can lead to an increase of potential disease hazards to the animals. Correct this by developing a
sanitization schedule to adequately sanitize all enclosures at least every 2 weeks as required.
