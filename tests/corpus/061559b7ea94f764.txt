PRIMARY ENCLOSURES USED TO TRANSPORT LIVE ANIMALS.
The young wallaby was transported to the exhibition site in a soft sided open topped soft fabric pouch which was
hung by a strap over the headrest of the front seat. This soft pouch has an open top so the wallaby can exit the
pouch completely or extend its body parts out of the pouch. In addition the soft material may lead to injury if any
items within the vehicle shift or in the case of an accident. The facility shall transport all live animals in a primary
enclosure that is constructed such that the strength of the enclosure is sufficient to contain the animal and to
withstand the normal rigors of transportation. Correct by 6/19/19.
