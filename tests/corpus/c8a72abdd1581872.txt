2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Licensee does not have a current Program of Vet Care. Licensees' with part time attending veterinarians must have
a formal written arrangement with a veterinarian (PVC) that addresses the preventive care for all regulated species.
This is required so that USDA personnel can confirm that the licensee is working with a knowledgeable veterinarian
and is following the recommendations from that veterinarian.
In the case of multiple attending veterinarians, the species/duties that each veterinarian is responsible for must be
identified.
A program of veterinary care needs to be developed by one or all of the attending veterinarians that addresses all
regulated species owned/exhibited by the licensee and the division of duties/species between the veterinarians.
Topics that should be covered in the PVC include but are not limited to:
*The veterinarian's schedule for visits to the facility.
*Parasite control program if appropriate for the species.
*Vaccination recommendations if appropriate for the species.
*Routine medical testing if appropriate for the species.
*Instructions on necropsies for unexpected deaths.
*Hoof trims for animals with chronic hoof problems.
*Diets appropriate for each species
*Any other medical/husbandry recommendations the veterinarian feels necessary for this facility.
*Emergency contact information.
The PVC must be signed and dated by the attending veterinarian. This document must indicate to USDA
representatives that the licensee and the veterinarian have an active working relationship.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Daily observation of all animals is required to assess their health and well-being. If daily observation is performed
by someone other than the attending veterinarian, then frequent and direct communication with the veterinarian is
required whenever there are animal health issues
This is required so that timely and appropriate treatment for sick animals is provided.
Multiple animals need to be evaluated by a veterinarian.
Reindeer: one of the reindeer has a baseball size mass on the back of his left rear hock. Several have various
stages of patchy hair loss. All of them need their feet evaluated for trimming.
A ewe with 2 young lambs is extremely thin and limping on the right front leg.

SANITATION.
Premises shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate adequate
cleaning. Six of the reindeer are being housed in an enclosure approximately 10’ x 20’. This enclosure is also
being used as storage for bags of shavings, old pallets, an old patio swing, a child’s bicycle, and misc other objects
not suitable for an animal enclosure. Many of these objects could cause injury to the reindeer if a foot or antler
became stuck in the objects.
The reindeer enclosure needs to be cleared of all objects that should not be in an animal enclosure or the reindeer
need to be moved to a different enclosure.
