ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The cougar known as Mattie has several crusty appearing skin lesions. These lesions are located on the right hip
and on the back of the animal just above the base of the tail. These lesions appear very similar to the lesions on
tigers at the facility that are being treated for a diagnosed ringworm infection. If left untreated these lesions will
continue to spread and could cause this animal significant discomfort. The attending veterinarian should be
consulted regarding the condition of this cougar. Documentation of the veterinarian's treatment recommendations
and a treatment record must be maintained and available for review by APHIS officials. The facility CEO stated that
this consultation would be done by the end of the day.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The cougar known as Mattie has several crusty appearing skin lesions. These lesions are located on the right hip
and on the back of the animal just above the base of the tail. These lesions appear very similar to the lesions on
tigers at the facility that are being treated for a diagnosed ringworm infection. No one at the facility had noticed
these lesions. Failure to observe health issues and promptly treat and/or report them to the attending veterinarian
will lead to unnecessary suffering and in extreme cases even possible animal death. Thorough daily observations of
all animals should be made. In the face of ongoing contagious illness outbreaks even more stringent observations
should be made. Animals with known problems should receive extra scrutiny. Report all health issues promptly to
the veterinarian.
3.129(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
The food receptacle boxes for the enclosure housing two American black bears and the enclosure housing two
Asian black bears contained a large amount of rotting food debris. An inspector noticed two rats eating the food
debris in the Asian black bear enclosure. The grizzly bear feed area contained rotting food debris. Any food fed in
these areas is going to be contaminated by the rotting material present. These feeders need to be cleaned and
made sanitary to ensure that the food fed to the bears is wholesome and free from bacterial or pest infestation
which could result in health issues for the bears.3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The Asian black bear enclosure and the American black bear enclosure contained excessive rotting food waste.
The Asian black bear enclosure contained excessive fecal material. The grizzly bear enclosure contained
excessive rotting food waste. These enclosures need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis. This rotting material
and feces can lead to pest control issues. The rotting material present in these animals'(cid:25) enclosures and shelter
boxes can contaminate these animals as they lay in their enclosures. The animals can ingest this material when
they groom themselves. Not removing old food waste promptly can lead to contamination of new food. Ingesting
this rotten material can lead to potential health problems. Clean these enclosures more frequently to prevent a
buildup of food and fecal waste to minimize odors and prevent potential health problems.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The majority of the premises are filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash, buckets, tires and fence.
Several other buildings on the property are also filled with old equipment and debris and trash. Tall weeds are
located throughout the facility. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests and numerous
rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Two live rats were also seen at the facility. All this material must
be removed to help control pests.
The pool located in the grizzly bear enclosure is very dirty. It contains a large amount of green water and algae.
This pool must be drained and cleaned. The weather this fall has been unusually warm and stagnant water in this
pool can become a breeding ground for mosquitos which are vectors for several diseases which can make the
animals ill.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Rodent holes were located both inside and outside the
Syrian brown bear enclosure and the den for this enclosure. Rodent holes were located next to the North American
black bear enclosure. Two live rats were seen in the enclosure by one of the inspectors. Rodent holes were
located next to the tiger Pandora and the tiger Mohan's enclosures. Rodents can be carriers of disease which may
be harmful to the animals housed in these areas. A more effective means of rodent control must be established for
the facility.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES. A volunteer training was held since the time of the last inspection. Topics including animal husbandry and
observation of animals were covered. The facility was noticeably cleaner today and is evident that progress is being
made in this area. However, the cougar known as Mattie has several crusty appearing skin lesions. These lesions
are located on the right hip and on the back of the animal just above the base of the tail. These lesions appear very
similar to the lesions on tigers at the facility that are being treated for a diagnosed ringworm infection. No one at the
facility had noticed these lesions. Additional instruction should be given to the staff on the importance of thorough
daily observation of the animals at the facility. Documentation of this instruction should be maintained for review by
APHIS officials.
An exit interview was conducted at the conclusion of the inspection with the facility CEO, Board President and a
volunteer. AC personnel present were Kurt Hammel, Carrie Bongard, Rick Kirsten and Laurie Gage. A formal exit
interview was conducted with the facility CEO and Kurt Hammel on 11-19-15.
