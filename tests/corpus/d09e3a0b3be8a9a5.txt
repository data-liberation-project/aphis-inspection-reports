ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany inspector on a Animal Welfare Act inspection from 3:50pm to
4:20pm on 04/30/2014. Upon arrival at the facility there was a business truck in the driveway. I knocked on the
front door, honked my vehicle horn and called the listed phone number without a response.
Correct upon receipt.
This is a 1st attempted inspection.
