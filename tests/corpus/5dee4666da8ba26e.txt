FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The primary enclosures for 2 lynx does not have a completed 6ft perimeter fence. There is a wood stacked
perimeter fence approximately 5'5" tall surrounding 3/4 of the enclosure, however there is 30 ft on the one side that
has not been completed. The fenced walls are 16ft high, with 3ft 90 degree kickins around the top. The licensee is
working on putting up 1"x1" netting over the top to fill in the middle open area of the enclosure.
A perimeter fence around the primary enclosure is necessary to aid in the prevention of animal escape, and to keep
other animals and unauthorized persons out of the primary enclosures.
The applicant must provide an adequate perimeter fence at least 6 ft in height and at least 3 ft from the primary
enclosures for the lynx, or has the right to apply for a variance through the USDA\APHIS\AC office.
Currently a variance request has been submitted and is under review for the lynx enclosure.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with licensee.
