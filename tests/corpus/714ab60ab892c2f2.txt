2.30(a)(1)
REGISTRATION.
Ansh Labs is supplying a licensed B dealer with antigen and adjuvant that is being used for antibody production in
rabbits and goats. During a telephone discussion with a facility representative in July 2016 the facility was advised
of the requirement for a valid USDA research registration to be obtained to conduct activities in USDA regulated
animals. The western office has documented sending the facility a registration application package on August 9,
2016. The completed registration application has not been returned to the office and a valid research registration
has not been obtained.
During an inspection at the B dealer facility today it was discovered that the antibody production activities have
continued since July 2016 without a registration in place at the site of regulated animal use. The same facility
representative contacted in July stated today via phone that the application packet had not been received.

No regulated activities may be conducted until a valid USDA registration has been obtained.
