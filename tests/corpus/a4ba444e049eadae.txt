ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There was a bottle of Isoflurane (expiration date of June 30,2015 ) and a bottle of Euthanasia solution (expiration
date of August 2015)) located in the Surgery/Isolation area along with other expired medications which were
comingled with unexpired medications. Failure to properly label medications or other medical products as being
expired and storing them with unexpired medical materials may lead to the unintentional use on regulated animals.
As part of the program of adequate veterinary care, a system of timely and appropriate identification, separation,
and labeling of expired medications must be in place to ensure the health and well-being of the animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- Capuchin room: There was a non-working, air conditioning unit located on the floor level with no outer covering or
guard exposing gaps, openings and the inner parts of the unit. An uncovered electrical outlet was located near the
ground level of this room within reach of the animals. Also, there were at least two exposed screws with sharp
points in a skylight portion of the ceiling which was accessible by means of enrichment items or objects.

-Ring-tailed Lemur enclosure: There was an uncovered/unprotected electrical cord extending from the back side of
the shelter box and within reach and access of the animals.
Accessibility to electrical outlets or unprotected electrical cords poses the risk of serious injury from electrical
hazards. Also, exposed or uncovered equipment such as the air conditioning unit with open gaps and wires as well
as sharp, pointed, and protruding objects may cause injury to the animals. Housing facilities for nonhuman primates
must be designed and constructed to be structurally sound for the species of nonhuman primate housed in them.
They must be kept in good repair, and they must protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification,
facility repair and maintenance must be in place.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Red Ruffed Lemur Enclosure: There was an elevated, raw, unsealed wooden platform and a wire-mesh door of a
nesting box with a moderate amount of rust buildup.
Ring-tailed Lemur Enclosure: The large den box and wooden platforms in this enclosure contained unsealed raw
wood. A green-colored platform in this enclosure also had an excessive buildup of dirt and debris on the top
surface.
Owl monkey enclosure: In the outdoor portion of the enclosure there was a raw, splintered, plywood platform used
for a water bowl. The indoor/outdoor opening and small platforms on both sides were made of raw wood with a
moderate buildup of dirt and debris.
Tamarin enclosure: There was an excessive buildup of a dark, brown colored debris and dirt on multiple perches in
this enclosure.
Capuchin room: Several perches, swings, and other furniture-type fixtures in this room had an accumulation of dirt
and debris on the surfaces of these objects.
Surfaces which cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized such as unsealed, raw wood are porous and can trap
debris, bacteria, or other harmful organisms. The buildup of dirt, debris, or other waste material on all surfaces in
contact with the animals may contaminate them and pose a disease or health risk.
The surfaces of housing facilities-including perches, shelves, swings, boxes, houses, dens, and other furniture-type
fixtures or objects within the facility-must be constructed in a manner and made of materials that allow them to be
readily cleaned, sanitized, and maintained on a regular basis or removed or replaced when worn or soiled.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
The ambient temperature in the sheltered part of the sheltered housing for 2 owl monkeys was 90.7 degrees
Fahrenheit on the Veterinary Medical Officer's Kestrel device at approximately 11:00 am. Local weather forecast
showed temperatures reaching 103 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the day. Animals that are maintained at
inappropriate temperatures can lead to medical conditions including heat stress, dehydration and death. The
sheltered part of sheltered housing facilities should be adequately heated and cooled to ensure the ambienttemperature shall not be allowed to fall below 45 degree F, nor exceed 85 degree F for more than 4 consecutive
hours when nonhuman primates are present.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Capybara enclosure: There were several, metal bolts protruding out approximately one inch from the base of a
metal cage within this enclosure. The sides of the entrance to the den box have worn away exposing a wire
meshing material.
Squirrel enclosure: The entrance opening of a wooden, nesting box had worn sharp, splintered edges.
Caracal/Serval enclosure: A ramp in the outdoor part of the enclosure and two elevated resting platforms in the
indoor portion of the enclosure were covered with carpeting which had worn frayed, string edges.
Porcupine enclosure: Large, sections of once buried, underground wire meshing within the enclosure is now
exposed at the surface with a few areas containing pointed or protruded wire ends.
Sharp, protruding points or edges in areas of contact with the animals may lead to injury. String-type objects within
an enclosure also pose a risk of foreign body ingestion to the animals. All enclosures must be kept in good repair
and free of sharp points, protruding edges or other hazards in order to protect the animals from injury and properly
contain the animals. A system of timely identification, facility repair and maintenance must be in place.

SANITATION.
The Prevost(cid:25)'s Squirrel enclosure had several bamboo-type perches with a heavy buildup of a dark-brown colored,
material and debris on the surfaces.
A Ground-hog enclosure contained several wooden ramps and platforms which had an excessive accumulation of
dirt, debris and other waste material.
The buildup of dirt, debris or other waste material in animal enclosures poses a health risk to the animals. Primary
enclosures shall be cleaned as often as necessary to prevent the contamination of the animals contained therein
and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. The cleaning schedule of all enclosures should be more
timely and effective.Exit interview conducted with Facility Representative, Dr. Tyler Fields,VMO and Dr. Aaron Rhyner, VMO.
