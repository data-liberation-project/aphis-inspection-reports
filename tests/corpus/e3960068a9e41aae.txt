Time and method of identification.
The facility had ordered tags since the last inspection but during inspection found that the order had been backordered
and then cancelled. The licensee corrected the order prior to the exit interview to ensure that required identification will
be sent. Animal identification is important in maintaining animal health records and can be important if animal health
tracing needs to be completed. Ensure that tags are obtained and the adult dogs in the kennel are officially identified as
required.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The acquisition information for 5 younger dogs kept for breeding was incomplete on their kennel card (name and address
and date where and when acquired/or litter information if born on property) and these were not recorded on APHIS 7005

be important if health tracing needs to be completed. Ensure to maintain accurate records that disclose the acquisition
information for dogs on hand.
