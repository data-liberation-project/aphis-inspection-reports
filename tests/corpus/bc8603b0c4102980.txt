ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A black and white, adult male Chihuahua (#032-613-806) has excessively long toe nails. Some of the toe nails are
laying sideways when the dog is in a normal standing position. One of the toe nails on the right front foot is
approximately 1 1/4 inch in length.
Long toe nails can be painful and cause discomfort when a dog is trying to walk. The potential for injury exists if a
toe nail becomes caught in the coated wire flooring. The licensee must ensure that toe nails are trimmed on a
regular basis.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Within the whelping room, there is an enclosure missing a door latch. The enclosure which is off the ground, is
located on the far northeast end of the room. There is an adult female Yorkie/Maltese with three puppies being
housed in the affected enclosure. The licensee stated that the door latch had broken off. The inspector observed the
adult dog push the door open multiple times.
Failure to have a secure enclosure, could allow the dogs to escape and fall a distance of approximately 3' to the
floor. This can potentially cause injuries which affect the health and well-being of the dogs.
The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are designed, constructed and maintained so they protect the animals
from injury and contain animals securely at all times.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two enclosures in the Whelping Room have areas of excessively chewed wooden surfaces. The wooden entrance
in pen #7 is worn and chewed. Six puppies can come in contact with the affected area. An enclosure containing an
adult female Pug and four puppies also has areas of chewed and roughened wooden surfaces around the entrance.Bare (untreated) and excessively worn wood surfaces cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. Surfaces not
maintained on a regular basis could lead to potential unsanitary conditions, disease or health risks.
The licensee must ensure all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis at all times or be replaced when worn.
