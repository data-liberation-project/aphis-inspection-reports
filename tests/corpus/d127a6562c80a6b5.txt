2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 pm on
10-Jan-18.
** I arrived at the facility at noon and called the owner. No one answered so I left a message that I was there to
conduct an inspection and to call me at her earliest convenience. I waited for 45 minutes and called again. There
was no answer. I left the facility at 12:50.
