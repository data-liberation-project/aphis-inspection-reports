2.40(a)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The licensee is not following the written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) signed by the Attending Veterinarian (AV). The
PVC states that dogs should be given ivermectin once per month, but the licensee stated that he is administering
ivermectin to dogs every 3-4 months. The ivermectin on hand, which the license has been using for dogs, expired over a
year ago, in March 2021. The PVC states that Frontline Plus should be used monthly for external parasite control in dogs,
but the licensee stated that he is using a different topical product for flea control in dogs. The PVC states that regularly
scheduled visits to the property by the AV will be completed annually, but the licensee stated that the AV has not been on
site for approximately 2 years. The written program of veterinary care contains instructions from the AV about medical and
husbandry practices that are important to maintain animal health and wellbeing. Failing to follow the AV's instructions may
result in negative impacts on animal health such as infestation with internal or external parasites, infection with vaccine-
preventable diseases, or administration of the wrong dose or type of medications. Correct by 6/1/2022 by following the
instructions in the written program of veterinary care, and contacting the attending veterinarian regarding any questions or
clarifications that are necessary to fully follow the written plan.
2.50(c)

Time and method of identification.


Two new adult male border collie dogs (“Shep” and “Boy”), obtained in the last few months, are not individually identified
by USDA tag, microchip, or other means. Individual dog identification is required to ensure animal traceability and to
protect against animal theft. Correct by 6/1/22 by individually identifying all dogs with an official USDA tag or other
approved means of identification.
2.75(a)(2)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The licensee is not using APHIS Forms 7005 and 7006 to capture acquisition and disposition records for dogs. The
licensee does not have current dogs listed on APHIS Form 7005. The licensee has not used APHIS Form 7006 to capture
disposition information for an adult border collie re-homed in the last month. APHIS forms 7005 and 7006 are required to
ensure complete and accurate recordkeeping for dogs. Correct by 6/1/22 by using APHIS Form 7005 to capture
acquisition information for dogs on hand, and by using APHIS Form 7006 to capture disposition information for dogs who
are sold or re-homed.
2.75(b)(1)

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
Acquisition records did not exist or could not be located for 14 sheep and 2 adult white-throated capuchin monkeys (1
male, 1 female). Accurate recordkeeping is important for animal traceability and locating animals in the event of disease
outbreaks. Correct by 6/1/2022 by ensuring that accurate and complete acquisition and disposition records are
maintained for all animals on hand including sheep and monkeys.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs does not include the following required parts: An annual physical exam, a
schedule for sampling and treatment of parasites and other pests, and preventive care to ensure maintenance of healthy


hair coats, nails, eyes, ears, skin, and teeth for dogs. The PVC must address all of the required elements listed above to
ensure the health and wellbeing of dogs. Correct by 6/1/2022 by obtaining a written program of veterinary care from the
attending veterinarian which contains all of the required elements listed in 3.13.
3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
Medical records were incomplete for 4 adult border collie dogs. The licensee stated that he administers ivermectin every
3-4 months to the dogs but has not recorded the dates that this drug was administered. Accurate and complete medical
records are required for dogs in order to keep track of when problems arise, and when medications are given. Correct by
6/1/2022 by maintaining medical records for dogs which include all of the required elements listed in 3.13.
3.77(f)

Sheltered housing facilities.
The outdoor area of a sheltered housing facility containing two adult white-throated capuchin monkeys is not enclosed by
a perimeter fence. The outdoor area of the enclosure has chain link walls and roof, beyond which there is no perimeter
fence. A perimeter fence is essential for preventing contact between exotic animals and unauthorized people or animals.
A perimeter fence also acts as a secondary containment system in the event an animal escapes from its primary
enclosure. Correct by 6/12/2022 by installing a perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet tall around the outdoor area of the
primate enclosure, or by obtaining approval from the Administrator for alternative measures.
