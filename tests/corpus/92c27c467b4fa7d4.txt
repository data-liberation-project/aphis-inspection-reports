2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A 17-year-old black pot-bellied pig named Kim demonstrated lameness of both rear limbs during inspection. The pig
exhibited a persistent hunched posture with significant stiffness when moving each rear leg. While the licensee had noted
the lameness prior to inspection, the Attending Veterinarian (AV) had not been contacted. In a subsequent inspector
phone call with the AV, the AV stated that she was unaware of lameness in any of the 3 pigs. The AV then immediately
contacted the facility to request information so that a proper medical care plan could be made. A lack of direct and
frequent communication with the AV can result in untreated medical conditions negatively impacting the health of the
animals. Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain a program of veterinary care that includes daily observations of
animals. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and accurate information on
problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being in conveyed to the attending veterinarian. The lack of communication
regarding the pig’s lameness was corrected during the inspection and a treatment plan was started.
3.75(c)(3)

Housing facilities, general.
Eight puzzle feeders attached to enclosures in the indoor primate housing building were coated with brown debris. A lack
of proper cleaning and sanitization can lead to harboring of disease-causing organisms that can produce negative health


impacts on the primates. Hard surfaces with which nonhuman primates come into contact must be spot-cleaned daily and
sanitized in accordance with 3.84 of this subpart to prevent accumulations of excreta or disease hazards. Correct by COB

3.125(a)

Facilities, general.
The following enclosures had areas in need of repair or replacement:
-One board on the goat ramp was dislodged and was on the ground near the ramp. The open gap on the ramp poses a
tripping or limb entrapment risk to the goats in the enclosure.
-The right front corner post of the serval/caracal enclosure had rusted through to the point that the post’s ability to support
the primary enclosure fence is compromised.
-One-quarter of the length of the enclosure fence shared between the aoudads and the water buffalo was leaning at an
approximately 15-degree angle into the water buffalo enclosure. The leaning fence poses an animal containment risk due
to its compromised structural integrity.
-The primary enclosure fence in the kangaroo area had approximately five rusted areas along the bottom right and back
edges that can pose a laceration risk to the kangaroo.
-The back right corner of the red river hogs’ housing structure showed evidence of damage. The metal had been peeled
open leaving an approximately 8-inch wide opening with exposed sharp edges that pose a laceration risk to the hogs.

Structurally unsound enclosures, or structures contained within, can pose injury and escape risks to the animals. The
indoor and outdoor facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and to contain the animals. Correct by June 3, 2021.
