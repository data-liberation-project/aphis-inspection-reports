2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One adult Standard Poodle recently acquired had very a matted coat. The coat of the white female (Lynn, m/c #
90021700002269) was matted on the hip and front and back legs and along the back and hips. Matted, twisted hair can
pull at the skin and cause discomfort and possibly injury to it. Matted, twisted hair cannot insulate the dog for protection
from the sun and temperature. Each dealer or exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary
care that include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The
owner must ensure that the matted hair is removed. The owner must have a regular schedule of grooming to prevent
matted hair.

Time and method of identification.
Seven unweaned litters of puppies (32 total) less than 8 weeks of age did not have identification. Identification is required
in order to ensure that each animal's identity can be known with certainty and to facilitate record keeping requirements for
inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare documentation. The owner must identify all live regulated animals and
assure that records are kept at all times.
