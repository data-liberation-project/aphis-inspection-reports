2.31(c)(7) Critical

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
On 6/16/2020 four naked mole rats expired unexpectedly during a procedure approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee (IACUC) under protocol B-8-2020.

One arm of the study protocol specified that up to six animals would be placed in an anoxic environment for 15 minutes.
In the protocol proposal the investigator referenced a study that was published in a peer-reviewed journal where another
investigator had found that naked mole rats can withstand an anoxic environment for 18 minutes, and that there was no
adverse effect on 100% of those animals tested.

Protocol B-8-2020 specified that during the anoxia procedure the breathing of the animals would be monitored, and that if
the breath rate were to drop below one per minute that the animal would be removed from the chamber, and the animal
would be allowed to recover, and that if the animal did not resume a normal breath rate within two minutes it would be
euthanized.

The personnel involved in the procedure reported that the animals were each placed in the chamber sequentially, and that


each died during the anoxia exposure. Also that the animals were in the chamber for the full 15 minutes, which indicates
that the requirement to remove the animal when the breath rate fell below one per minute could not have been followed.
Once the animals were removed the personnel involved reported that they were not euthanized, because they had died
during the anoxia exposure. The personnel immediately reported the animal deaths to the Attending Veterinarian, the
procedure was discontinued, and corrective actions were taken to avoid similar incidents.

Those carrying out procedures in an IACUC-approved protocol must adhere to what was approved in the protocol. Making
significant changes to protocols without IACUC approval could be detrimental to the welfare of the animals.

To be corrected from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
