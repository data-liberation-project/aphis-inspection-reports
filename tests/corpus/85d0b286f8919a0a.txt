(f) Drainage and waste disposal.
***On the south side of the sheltered facility, at the edge of the enclosures, the waste material and water had run off
of the cement and had been left in close proximity to the enclosures. This area of waste material was attracting flies
and other pests. Waste material left in close proximity to the animals increases the risk of disease hazards by
attracting pests. The licensee must remove the waste material from the housing area and assure that all waste
material is disposed of as required.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
(e) Surfaces.
(1) The following areas in sheltered housing facilities must be impervious to moisture:
***At the sheltered facility, the indoor portion of the enclosures are constructed out of wooden products with a
cement floor. The boards at the bottom of the enclosures have dirt and grime imbedded in and on them. the cement
floors have urine and water stains. The outdoor portion of the enclosures are constructed of wire panels with
cement flooring. The majority of these enclosures are shaded for most of the day and have urine in them that is
soaking up in the cement flooring. The licensee stated that it had been "about a year" since the surfaces had been
sealed. Surfaces that are in contact with the animals and is not sealed creates a harboring place for pests and
diseases. These surfaces prevent appropriate cleaning and sanitation and can soil the dogs by not draining
properly. The licensee must make all surfaces with the animals impervious to moisture.

water bowls and water was added in the evenings if needed. Water receptacles that are not cleaned appropriately
