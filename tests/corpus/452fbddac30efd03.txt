2.40(b)(4)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Section 2.40(b)(4) Veterinary care: The written program of veterinary care (PVC) for this facility lacks guidance for
the method of euthanasia. There is no specific guidance in the PVC for the method of euthanasia to be used by the
facility, including its use, equipment, and personnel trained and authorized to perform the euthanasia for the various
species. The PVC states the method of euthanasia is carbon dioxide, but there are no details on its use at the
facility by personnel. Specific guidance and training in the procedure for euthanasia by the attending veterinarian is
required to ensure the animals are humanely euthanized according to the latest AVMA Guidelines for the
Euthanasia of Animals (2013 edition).
Additional specific guidance is required for the euthanasia section on the PVC. Failure to have specific, accurate
guidance does not ensure that the attending veterinarian is aware of the current practices at the facility and also
does not ensure the facility has accurate guidance to provide adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct by
developing and implementing a complete program of veterinary care that describes all methods of euthanasia used
by facility personnel for animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act. Correct by July 23, 2016.
