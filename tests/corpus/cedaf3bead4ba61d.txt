ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An adult female sugar glider was found dead in its enclosure during the time of inspection. The body of the sugar
glider was not stiff while the license holder pulled it out of the pouch within the enclosure. The license holder
indicated that the sugar glider was geriatric and that she had previously contacted the veterinarian because the
animal was "slowing down". It could not be verified that the veterinarian had been consulted regarding this animals
condition. The use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries must be
obtained through the veterinarian to provide for the health and well-being of the animals.
Assure that all animal health issues including those associated with advanced animal age are communicated to the
veterinarian. Follow through with any prescribed treatments and/or instructions.
To be corrected: From this day forward.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A adult male sugar glider was found dead in its enclosure during the time of inspection. The animal was completely
stiff as the license holder pulled it out of its pouch within the enclosure. The license holder indicated that she hadn't
observed the animal for a couple of days. Daily observation of all animals is necessary to identify any problems of
animal health, behavior, or well-being. The findings of any animal problems must then be communicated to the
veterinarian.
Assure that animals are observed daily and that any problems are communicated to the veterinarian.
To be corrected: From this day forward.

SANITATION.
Excessive mouse droppings and evidence of mouse nests were observed in three of the animal rooms at the
facility. The first room contained eight sugar gliders and two degus. A large mouse nest was observed on the floor
adjacent to the dresser with the two degu enclosures. The nest was approximately 4 inches in diameter. The
second room contained three chinchillas, three hedgehogs, and five gerbils. Excessive mouse droppings were
observed on the shelf, in between the two aquariums that housed the five gerbils. The final room contained nine
ferrets. Mouse droppings were observed on the floor and in one of the ferret enclosures.
At least five mouse traps were observed in two of the three animal rooms. These traps are not effectively
controlling the population of mice at the facility. Mice can carry and spread diseases that affect animals.
Establish, implement, and maintain an effective program to control the mouse population at the facility.
