3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
At least three feeders have a thick buildup of dark brown dirt and grime around the edges of the bowls. Cat hair is
entrapped within the grime coating the surface of the bowls. A total of six cats have access to these feeders. A
buildup of dirt and grime could increase the risk of disease towards the cats.
The licensee must clean and sanitize the feeders at least every two weeks or more often if necessary in order to
eliminate the buildup of dirt and grime and to reduce the risk of disease towards the cats. The licensee must ensure
that all surfaces remain free of a buildup of dirt and grime at all times.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with ACI Kelly Maxwell, an Animal Care intern and the facility
representative.
