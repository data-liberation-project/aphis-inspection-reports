3.1(c)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In several cat and dog enclosures there are surfaces that are not constructed or maintained in a manner that allows
them to be readily cleaned and sanitized. In the backstage area of the shoe, a cat enclosure had wire mesh that
was rusty and broken, making cleaning and sanitizing difficult and creating sharp points that might injure the cat. In
the foster dog magnum, the wooden baseboard had been chewed, exposing damaged raw wood that is not
impervious to moisture, which impedes cleaning and disinfecting. Approximately 3-5 crate doors of transfer cages
were excessively rusty, and could no longer be effectively sanitized. Surfaces in the cat and dog areas should be
constructed of appropriate materials, maintained in good repair so they can be readily cleaned and disinfected, in
order to maintain a healthy environment for the cats and dogs.
