ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The male approximately 7 year old Pug (#45) had an thick build up of tartar on all the remaining teeth. The tartar
was brown in color and encased the teeth. The lower right teeth could not be identified as individual teeth. The
tongue protruded from the mouth on the right side, also. The Pug also had a small mass of about 1/4 inch in
diameter on the right eye that had not been seen by a veterinarian. The licensee stated that she was not familiar
with that breed of dog, she only has one, and did not know the dog needed to be seen by a veterinarian.
Dental disease can cause damage to the gum tissue, and tooth and mouth structures, be painful, and impact the
ability of the dog to eat normally, affecting the overall health of the animal. Eye problems can be due to trauma,
infection, and other medical problems and can be painful and affect vision. The license must have this animal
examined by a licensed veterinarian in order to ensure that an accurate diagnosis is obtained and an appropriate
treatment plan is developed and followed. This information including the diagnosis, treatment, and resolution of the
condition must be documented and made available to the inspector upon request. TO BE CORRECTED BY: April

cobwebs covered in dust along the ceiling portion.
All used primary enclosures must be cleaned and sanitized once every two weeks, or more often if necessary to
prevent the buildup of dirt, grime and other disease hazards. This shelter must be cleaned, sanitized and
maintained in a way to prevent any further buildup of dirt and grime. Licensee must ensure that all enclosures
remain free of accumulations of dirt and grime in order to promote the health of the dogs.
