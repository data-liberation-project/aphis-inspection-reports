ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Several guinea pigs were identified at the time of inspection with problems of animal health.
1. In the second rack of enclosures, there is one black and white adult female guinea pig in the second enclosure
from the floor on the side of the row closest to the door with an abnormal right eye. This eye has a greenish white
opaque area on the surface of the eye, taking up approximately 30-40% of the surface of the globe. The visible
bottom half of the globe is red in color, and the redness appears to be on the inside of the globe itself. The fur
around the eye is wet with clear discharge, and a small amount of opaque green discharge is present at the corner
of the eye. These changes are consistent with a severe eye injury or infection. Eye injuries and infections are
usually painful conditions that require rapid identification and treatment to ensure the provision of adequate
veterinary care. This issue had not been identified by the licensee prior to inspection. There is a treatment plan for
this condition outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care. This animal was treated at the time of inspection.
2. In the second rack of enclosures, there is one brown, tan, and white adult female guinea pig in the second
enclosure from the floor on the side of the row farthest from the door with an abnormal right eye. The animal is
observed to be blinking more frequently over this eye and holding it partially closed intermittently. There is a small
amount of green disharge in the corner of the eye, and the fur beneath the eye is wet with a clear discharge. These
signs are consistent with an eye injury or infection, and the squinting and blinking is consistent with eye pain. This
issue had not been identified by the licensee prior to inspection. There is a treatment plan for this condition outlined
in the Program of Veterinary Care. This animal was treated at the time of inspection.
3. In the weaning pens downstairs, there is one juvenile black and white guinea pig in the top pen on the side
farthest from the door with an abnormal left eye. The animal is blinking this eye more frequently and holding it
partially closed in a squint. The fur around this eye is crusted with a clear to light tan discharge, and a small amount
of green discharge is evident at the back corner of this eye. These signs are consistent with an eye injury or
infection, and the squinting and blinking is consistent with eye pain. This issue had not been identified by the
licensee prior to inspection. There is a treatment plan for this condition outlined in the Program of Veterinary Care.
This animal was treated at the time of inspection. 4. In the second rack of enclosures, there is one tan and white adult female guinea pig in the second enclosure
down from the top on the side of the row farthest from the door with a patchy hair loss on her lower back. There are
small areas of disrupted skin that are pink with a dark red crusted material over them, consistent with scabbed
wounds. This problem had been identified by the licensee prior to inspection, but the licensee had not initiated
treatment according to the guidance in the Program of Veterinary Care. This animal was treated at the time of
inspection.
Daily observation to assess the health and well being of the animals must be conducted to identify health issues
that require treatment or veterinary consultation. Any health problems that are identified must be treated according
to the guidance in the Program of Veterinary Care, or the veterinarian must be contacted to provide guidance, to
ensure the provision of adequate veterinary care. The licensee initiated the treatment according to the Program of
Veterinary Care after these animals were identified by the inspector.
Corrected at the time of inspection.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The floors and front panels of 95% of the wood enclosures upstairs are not sealed. Many of these enclosures also
show wear along the edges of sealed wooden panels that has revealed raw wood surfaces, especially around the
openings for the waterers. The sanitation procedures and schedule are appropriate, but these worn and unsealed
surfaces cannot be adequately cleaned or sanitized due to the rough and porous nature of the material. This has
resulted in staining and warping of the wood where moisture has penetrated it and an accumulation of debris on the
rough wood surfaces despite appropriate cleaning.
Primary enclosures for guinea pigs must be structurally sound and maintained in good repair, and they must be
constructed of smooth material substantially impervious to liquids and moisture. These enclosures must be
repaired, modified, or replaced. The licensee stated at the time of inspection that he plans to replace these
enclosures.
