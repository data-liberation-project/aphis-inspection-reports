2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On April 15, 2016, the lead keeper for the tigers was killed after she entered den #4 and was attacked by a male
tiger. The keeper did not follow established safety procedures. Emergency personnel were unable to attend to the
lead keeper until the tiger was darted and sedated The need to dart and sedate the tiger subjected the animal to
behavioral stress, unnecessary discomfort and potential harm which could have been prevented if adequate safety
protocols were followed.
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
Along the back fence behind the tiger enclosure, where the maintenance crew has buildings and supplies, there
were several piles of discarded materials such as peat moss, fencing, tarps, ropes and other miscellaneous items
piled about. Weeds and grasses had grown up around these areas indicating that the debris had been there for
some time.. These piles provide a haven for vermin.
Along the keeper access area between two fences for the tiger enclosure, there were several tree limb cuttings that
were laying on the ground. These cuttings were cut in sections that could easily cause a keeper to trip and/or fall.
These cuttings need to be cleared from this area to prevent a keeper from possibly falling against the fencing for the
tigers enclosure.
Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury
and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed
in designated areas and cleared as necessary to protect the health of the animals.
