Feeding.
There are four vending machines containing pelleted feed for use by the public to feed the 66 rabbits at the facility. The
clear, plastic receptacles have ~1-2" of accumulated "fines" / food dust at the bottom, and some of the food dust appears
wet, with whitish material in some places. The facility representative stated that she did not know when the units were
last cleaned and sanitized and confirmed that the employees were just topping off the feed, rather than emptying and
cleaning them before refilling.
Storing food in a manner that does not sufficiently protect it from deterioration, molding or contamination and failure to
keep food receptacles clean and sanitized can cause food to be unpalatable or cause illness in the animals. All food
receptacles must be kept clean and be sanitized at least once every two weeks, and measures must be taken to prevent
molding, deterioration or caking of the food.
TO BE CORRECTED BY MARCH 21, 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
