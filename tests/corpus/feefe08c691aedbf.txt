3.4(b)(2)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
This facility has 2 types of outdoor enclosures for dogs--an open barn with pens partially under the overhang of the
barn and several open enclosures in a field with shade trees. There were two pens that had wooden shelters that
had large holes chewed through the wood. The last pen in the barn contained 2 adult dogs with 1 shelter structure
and there was a hole approximately the size of a basketball chewed through the wall near the floor of the shelter.
The shelter structure was not under the barn overhang and therefore not protected from the weather. The open pen
directly outside the back of the barn contained 5 adults dogs with 2 shelter structures and there was a hole
approximately the size of a banana in the roof of 1 shelter, where it joined the wall. The shelter was under a shade
tree but had no other protective barrier over it. In the early morning hours of the day of inspection, a severe storm
had passed over and it had rained approximately an inch in this area. The holes were large enough that the shelters
no longer provided the dogs with adequate protection from the direct effect of wind or rain. Shelters that are large
enough to contain all animals at once in a comfortable manner must be provided in all pens. Shelters must contain a
roof, 4 sides, and a floor, provide adequate protection from the weather, and be constructed with materials that are
impervious to moisture. Correct by: September 7th.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
