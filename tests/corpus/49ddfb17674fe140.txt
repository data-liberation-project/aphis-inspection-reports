2.33(b)(4) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care.
On June 8, 2020 a male dog approximately 6-8 months old was anesthetized for a surgical procedure. During the initiation
of the surgical procedure the isoflurane rate was increased from 2% to 5% with oxygen flowing. During the surgical
procedure the animal’s vitals were being recorded every 10-15 minutes by two technicians, however, the isoflurane rate
was never checked after it was increased to 5%. The animal was maintained at a 5% isoflurane rate for 1.5 hours before
going into cardiac arrest and dying.

The protocol states inhalational isoflurane needs to be maintained at 2%-3%. The facility must ensure that a balanced
surgical plane of anesthesia is consistently maintained for the procedures as outlined in the protocol. Not continually
monitoring the isoflurane rate during anesthesia can lead to pain, suffering or death of the animal.

In order to protect the health and well-being of the animals, the program of adequate veterinary care must provide
appropriate guidance to the principal investigators with regard to handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia,
tranquilization and euthanasia of the animals used at the facility.



Corrections had been instituted prior to the inspection on June 25, 2020 in order to prevent recurrence.

This inspection was conducted with facility representatives on October 29-30 and November 2-3, the exit interview was
conducted with facility representatives on November 3rd.
