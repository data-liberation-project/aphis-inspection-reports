2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The facility failed to submit a report to the Institutional Official reflecting the fall review of the human care and use
program and the inspection of the animal facility conducted on 15 November 2013. This does not allow the
Institutional Official to be kept informed of the IACUC activities and recommendations. Ensure that reports to the
Institutional Official are prepared and submitted at least once every 6 months. Correct from this time forward.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representative.
End of report.
