This inspection was conducted at Kimball Farms, Westford, MA, in order to determine if the licensee requires a site
at this address.
Mr. Laquidara currently has a license for a facility in Bolton, MA. However, he brings his animals to Kimball Farms
for exhibition.
In speaking with an employee, we were informed that all mammals are brought to and from the Bolton, MA facility
on a daily basis. The mammals are not left at the Westford site overnight. Therefore, this address will not need to be
added as a site of Animal Adventures.
An exit interview was conducted by Jan Baltrush and Dr.Tonya Hadjis of the USDA and a representative of the
licensee.
