ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A 5 month old grey male French bulldog, microchip #956000012337876, had skin issues. The entire ventrum of the
dog had patchy hair loss with circular to irregular shaped reddened, thickened, and raised areas. Some of the areas
were covered with brown colored crusts or scabs. Additionally, three 6 week old French bulldog puppies were
observed to have their ears taped with black electrical tape.
The attending veterinarian was contacted regarding both animal care findings. The clinic had no record on the male
French bulldog’s skin issues. Additionally, the attending veterinarian’s representative stated that the use of electrical
tape is not an acceptable tape to be used on ears.
Improper veterinary care can cause minor conditions to become chronic leading to additional animal discomfort. The
attending veterinarian must be contacted for proper diagnosis and treatment when treatment options are not present
within the program of veterinary care or when the condition is not responding to treatment.
