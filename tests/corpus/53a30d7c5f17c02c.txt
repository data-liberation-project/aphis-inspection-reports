2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This facility does not have a full-time veterinarian. There was a change in management at the facility and the new
authorized representative who is also an animal caretaker was unable to find the Program of Veterinary Care at the
time of inspection. He was not aware that the facility had a written Program of Veterinary Care. It is important for
personnel caring for animals to be familiar with the written Program of Veterinary Care to ensure care is provided in
accordance with the Attending Veterinarian's guidance. Additionally, it is important that the written Program of
Veterinary Care be provided at the time of inspection so the inspector can verify that an adequate program is in
place. The licensee must ensure that a written Program of Veterinary care is available for review at all future
inspections.

2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The facility did not have an updated, accurate list of the regulated animals present at the site. The authorized
facility representative did not know exactly how many animals were at the facility. The Attending Veterinarian was
scheduled to visit the facility the week after the inspection so all animals could be caught, examined, and tagged if
necessary. The facility planned to update animals on hand records at that time. Without knowing how many
animals are present at the facility, it is difficult to ensure all animals are being observed daily to assess their health
and well-being. The licensee must make, keep, and maintain records which fully and correctly disclose the
information required by 2.75(b)(1)(i-vii). APHIS Form 7019 may be used to keep this information but that particular
form is not required.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Structural Strength.The shelter structure for the buffalo had an area (a few feet in diameter) on its wood-framed, metal wall which had
apparently been damaged by the animals. The metal was torn and bent inward resulting in a sharp jagged edge
which could injure the animals. There was also a piece of wood from the damaged shelter laying on the ground just
a couple feet away from the shelter. This piece of wood had two screws in it which went all the way through the
wood and stuck out on the other side approximately one inch. The piece of wood was laying on the ground with the
pointy screw ends facing up so the animals could step on them. Jagged metal edges and sharp points in animals
areas could result in painful lacerations or puncture wounds which could become infected. The licensee must
ensure that the animal enclosures and shelter structures are maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury.
