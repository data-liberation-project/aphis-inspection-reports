Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
One of the breeding sows was observed to have excessively long rear toes on both feet. Feet need to be kept properly
trimmed in order to prevent a more serious situation from developing such as an injury to the toe or joint issues. Trim this
sow’s rear toes. Keep all animals’ hooves properly trimmed.

Space requirements.
Most breeding age sow pens contained too many animals. The facility is currently housing six or greater number of sows
in these pens. Primary housing enclosures should allow each animal to make normal postural and social adjustments
with adequate freedom of movement. Nearly all the sows housed in these pens had skin scrapes and wounds indicating
that the increased population density is leading to an increase in the aggression between individuals that is normally seen
in these animals. Provide these animals with more space.

This is a 1st Re-License Inspection for a Class “A” license. The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with facility
