3.125(a) Critical Repeat

Facilities, general.
Six prairie dogs lived in an enclosure consisting of a dirt filled solid walled and floored enclosure surrounded by a second
solid walled and floored enclosure (double containment system). The prairie dogs created and lived in burrows in the dirt.
On January 3rd, 2022 none of the prairie dogs were observed by the facility representatives. They had been observed the
day before when all appeared normal. The licensee stated that he doesn’t conclusively know what happened to the prairie
dogs but suspects that either predators (hawks were sighted) or torrential rain (collapsed burrows) led to their
disappearance. The housing facility for the prairie dogs did not sufficiently provide protection. Outdoor housing facilities
must be constructed and maintained such that they protect the animals from injury and contain the animals.

This inspection was conducted with a facility representative and the exit interview was conducted by phone with the
licensee.
