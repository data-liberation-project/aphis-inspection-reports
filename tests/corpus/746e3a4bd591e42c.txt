3.101(a)(3)

Facilities, general.
Multiple areas of cracked and peeling paint as well as exposed, unsealed broken or chipped concrete were observed
above the water line in all 4 of the dolphin pools of the original “Toyota” stadium. Although there are many areas in which
the concrete and paint have been repaired, multiple areas were still noted that needed attention. Cracked and/or broken
concrete as well as chipping paint could possibly constitute a health hazard to the animals if they were to fall into the
pools and be ingested, and does not facilitate cleaning and disinfection. All surfaces must be maintained in good repair as
part of a regular, ongoing maintenance program.
