TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
Two dachshunds housed in the whelping building and one Alaskan Klee Kai dog housed in the north enclosures
were not identified at the time of the inspection. Correct identification allows for tracking the movement of dogs and
facilitates the inspection process by enabling dogs' identity to be known. The licensee must identify all live dogs on
the premises as defined in section 2.50. To be corrected by 2 March 2020.
2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Five Dachshunds were acquired on approximately 18 Dec 2019. These dogs are not listed on the APHIS 7005 form
(Dogs on Hand). Three of these dogs are no longer on the premises. In addition to all of the information required on
the APHIS 7005, the date of disposition for the three dogs is not recorded..
There are discrepancies between the information recorded on records of disposition (APHIS 7006) and on records
of Inventory (APHIS 7005 and allowed alternative puppy inventory). The licensee's puppy identification system for
the APHIS 7005 forms uses a litter designation followed by a dash and the individual number (example JJ876-15).
The licensee lists the litter number (example JJ876) and number of puppies on the inventory but not which
individual numbers are assigned to each puppy.
-JJ876-15 (listed as Toy Aussie) has date of birth (DOB) on the APHIS 7006 of 5 Sept 2019. The puppy inventory
has DOB for litter JJ876 as 1 Dec 2019.
-JJ876-20 (listed as mini Aussie) has a DOB on the APHIS 7006 of 5 Sept 2019. The puppy inventory has DOB for
litter JJ876 as 1 Dec 2019.
-There are 8 puppies listed on the inventory for litter J831 (listed as mini Aussies). The inventory does not list the
individual puppy numbers. There are 10 puppies identified on 3 different APHIS 7005 forms as coming from the
J831 litter: J831-31 through J831-38 with disposition date of 3 Feb 2020, J831-40 with a disposition date of 1 Feb
2020, and J831-50 with a disposition date of 1 Feb 2020.-JJ831-40 and JJ831-50 (mini Aussies) were originally listed on the APHIS 7005 as having a DOB of 9 Dec 2019
and a disposition date of 1 Feb 2020. The licensee changed both DOBs to 5 Dec 2019 when the inspector started to
look at the paperwork, saying it was a mistake. There are other puppies from the JJ831 litter with DOB on APHIS
7005 listed as 9 Dec 2019. If these puppies were, in fact, born on 9 Dec 2019, they would have been transported in
commerce before 8 weeks of age.
-J802-51 (Cock-a-poo) originally listed on the APHIS 7005 as having a DOB of 9 Dec 2019 and a disposition date of
1 Feb 2020. The licensee changed this DOB to 5 Dec 2019 when the inspector started to look at the paperwork,
saying it was a mistake. The DOB listed on the inventory for litter J802 is 9 Dec 2019. If this puppies was, in fact,
born on 9 Dec 2019, it would have been transported in commerce before 8 weeks of age.
Correct inventory and disposition records of dogs are critical for tracking animal moment and investigation of
infection diseases. The licensee must make, keep, and maintain records or forms which fully and correctly disclose
the required information concerning each dog or cat purchased or otherwise acquired, owned, held, or otherwise in
his or her possession or under his or her control, or which is transported, euthanized, sold, or otherwise disposed of
by that dealer or exhibitor. The records shall include any offspring born of any animal while in his or her possession
or under his or her control. To be corrected by 2 March 2020.
3.4(b)(1)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are three enclosures in the north outdoor enclosures with shelter structures that do not provide enough space
and protection for the numbers of dogs housed in the enclosures. Dogs that are not provided enough adequate
shelter from the cold or heat can be at risk for an unsafe body temperature. The licensee must ensure that there is a
shelter structure in outdoor enclosures that provides the dogs with adequate protection and shelter from the cold
and heat. To be corrected by end of the day 21 Feb 2020.
3.6(a)(2)(x)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Two enclosures in the whelping building each contained a litter of puppies whose feet and legs were observed to
slip through the openings in the floor. Dogs and puppies can be injured if their their feet and legs can slip through
opening in the floor surface. The licensee must ensure that primary enclosures for dogs have floors that are
constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' and cats' feet and legs from injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted
construction, do not allow the dogs' and cats' feet to pass through any openings in the floor; Corrected at the time of
inspection.3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The outdoor enclosures have two areas with a thick coating of excreta, dirt. and hair coating a post and the
surrounding fence. Insufficient cleaning can play a role in disease transmission. The licensee must ensure that
excreta and food waste be removed from primary enclosures daily to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats contained in
the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.To be corrected by 4 March 2020.
