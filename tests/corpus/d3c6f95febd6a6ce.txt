Watering.
In an enclosure housing four adult and seven juvenile guinea pigs, one of the two water bottles has a green film on the
inside of the bottle. The licensee removed the bottle and examined it, stating that she needed to clean it better.
Water receptacles that are not kept clean and sanitized on a regular basis encourage microbial growth, could cause the
water to become unpalatable, and cause illness in the animals. The licensee must ensure that all watering receptacles
are sanitized at least once every two weeks and whenever visibly dirty.
CORRECTED AT TIME OF INSPECTION

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
