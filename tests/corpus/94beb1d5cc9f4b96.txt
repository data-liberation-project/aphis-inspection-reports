ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:00 pm on

I contacted the licensee on the phone when I arrived at their gate. Left a message and waited for 30 minutes and
called back and left a second message .
