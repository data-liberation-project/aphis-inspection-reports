3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On July 21, 2020 a male bobcat ("Tobias") escaped from its primary enclosure. Once the three remaining bobcats
entered their holding pens the next morning, the staff was able to search the enclosure yard for the male bobcat, but
were unable to locate him. A Game Camera was setup the same night. The male bobcat was seen on camera the
morning of July 23, 2020 outside of the bobcat enclosure. He was last seen on camera August 5, 2020. The facility
has been unable to recover the animal.
Animals escaping from primary enclosures are more vulnerable to harm from surrounding predatory animals and
further injury when they are not safely contained.
Housing facilities shall be structurally sound and maintained in good repair to contain the animals.
To be corrected by close of business today, August 12, 2020.
3.127(d)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
One North American Black bear was housed in the outdoor Large Animal Quarantine enclosure. This housing
facility is located outside of the perimeter fencing that encompasses the animals on hand at the facility. The current
perimeter fence surrounding the quarantine area measured 74 inches, 77.5 inches, and 79 inches for the back,
side, and front fence lines, respectively.
Having a perimeter fence in place protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. Additionally, it serves as
a secondary containment system for the animals in the facility.
The perimeter fence must be of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical
contact between animals inside the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence. Fences lessthan 3 feet in distance from the primary enclosure, less than 8 feet high for dangerous animals, or use of an
effective natural barrier to protect the outdoor housing facilities must be approved in writing by the Administrator.
To be corrected by September 12, 2020.
