3.132 CRITICAL
EMPLOYEES.
Over the last four months a number of sugar gliders and several hedgehogs died. The animals died at three
separate time frames due to temperature issues (heater problems) and lack of food/water. The facility's employed
animal caretaker left before the end of 2016. The owner was caring for the animals with no issues until, due to a
family emergency, she was not able to provide daily care starting in January 2017. Another family member was
asked to help care for the animals and was not reliable/trained in the day to day tasks of caring for the animals. The
owner was not available to supervise frequently enough to ensure all daily animal care tasks were accomplished.
The owner noticed the issue and started a daily task checkoff list. Even with the list, items would be noted checked
off but not 100% completed when the owner followed behind the caretaker. In order to ensure an acceptable level of
husbandry practices, to include temperature monitoring, feeding and watering, a sufficient number of adequately
trained employees shall be utilized under a knowledgeable, experienced supervisor. The situation has been
corrected prior to this inspection with the owner resuming daily care of the animals.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner.
