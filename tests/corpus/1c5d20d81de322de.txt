ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Female Shiba Inu (#25) is non-weight bearing in the right front leg. Closer examination of the leg showed a
ruptured lesion on the bottom of the foot between the second and third digit pads and the main foot pad. The lesion
is red, inflamed, warm to the touch, and a clear, sticky fluid is matted into the hair around the lesion. The dog is not
currently under any treatment for this condition.
Female Woodle (#8) is hesitant to rise into a standing position. When attempting to get into a normal posture the
dog was unable to bear full weight on the right hind leg and showed obvious lameness while walking. Closer
examination showed the dog was very tense when the lower back, the hip, and the bottom of the right hind foot
were gently palpated. The dog is not currently under any treatment for this condition.
Female Bichon (#7) has an abnormal appearance when she walks. She appears to stand and walk in an arched
position. Upon palpation the dog was found to be tense in her mid and lower back. The dog is not currently under
any treatment for this condition.
Female Bulldog (#7) is lame in the left front leg. Closer examination did not reveal the cause of the lameness and
this dog is not currently under treatment for this condition.
Female Wheaton (#127) is lame in the right hind leg. Closer examination showed that the dog wanted to pull away
when the leg was gently palpated, but no cause for the lameness was found. The dog is not currently under
treatment for this condition.
Pug (#3) has an abnormal area of inflammation between the toes on the right front foot. The area is round, has a
dark red center, is swollen and is tender to touch. The hair around the infected area is wet. The dog is not currently
under any treatment for this condition.
Lameness, failure to bear weight on a leg, failure to stand in a normal position and areas of inflammation could be
indicative of an under lying health issue. The above mentioned dogs must be evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and to establish an
effective treatment plan. The licensee must provide adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(1)(ii)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
One enclosure containing 2 adult dogs has an opening between two bars in the front of the kennel. The bottom of
the opening has an arrow-head shaped sharp point. The opening is large enough for the dogs to stick their muzzles
through and come into direct contact with the sharp point. Sharp points could cause injury to the dogs.
The enclosure must be free of jagged edges or sharp points that might injure the animals. The licensee must
remove the sharp point or alter the sharp point in a manner that eliminates the risk of injury to the animals. The
licensee must ensure that the enclosures remain safe for the dogs at all times.
