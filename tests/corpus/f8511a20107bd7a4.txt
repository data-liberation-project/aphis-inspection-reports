2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
This is an amended inspection report, to replace the inspection report that was conducted on 3-26-14.
***** An adult female Dachshund with microchip identification number 034276809 in building 11 was non-weight
bearing on her right front limb. She was not placing her toe on the ground when she stood still and she did not use
the limb at all as she walked around the enclosure. The dog also had a tannish brown material obscuring her teeth
that extended up into the gum line on all of the upper teeth. The gums were reddened on the upper right side of the
mouth.
*****An adult female Yorkshire Terrier with microchip identification number 0A099030831 in building 9 had a
tannish brown material on most of her teeth. This material obscured most of the teeth and extended up into the
gum line. The gums were reddened on the upper right and left side of the mouth. There was a whitish gray creamy
discharge at the gum line of the lower right teeth. There was also an irregularly shaped mass of a whitish gray
material that extended approximately one-half inch along the lower left incisors and canine teeth. The material was
soft to the touch.
***** A adult male Pomeranian with microchip identification number 941000013940744 in building 5 had a head tilt
to the right and also had a tannish brown material obscuring his teeth that extended up into the gum line on all of
the upper teeth. The gums were reddened on the upper left side of the mouth.
***** An adult female Pomeranian with microchip identification number 0A01555123 in building 5 was intermittently
non-weight bearing on his left rear limb. He was placing his toe on the ground when he stood still and he did not use
the limb intermittently as he walked around the enclosure. ***** An adult male poodle with microchip number 985121003306294 in building 2 had a tannish brown material on
most of his teeth. This material obscured most of the teeth and extended up into the gum line. The gums were
reddened on the upper right and left side of the mouth.
The licensee had not noticed any of these conditions prior to the inspection and these animals have not received
any veterinary care.
The buildup of abnormal material on teeth either with or without a discharge at the gum line can be painful, impact
the ability of the dogs to eat normally, and harm the health of the animals. Eye discharge, redness, crusting, and
swelling can occur due to infection, allergies, injury, irritation or other medical conditions that could be painful. Limb
injuries can occur and may be painful. The licensee must have these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian
in order to obtain an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plans. The outcome of these consultations must
be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all animals receive
adequate veterinary care at all times.
To be corrected by 3-29-14.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
3.6 (a) (2) (ii)
*****In building twelve the heat lamps hung inside the enclosures and did not have a wire guard to
protect the puppies and dams from thermal injury. One other enclosure with an adult female Sheba Inu and her
puppies also had a heat lamp in the enclosure that did not have a wire guard. Another enclosure housing a female
Pomeranian and her puppies had a heat lamp in the enclosure that did not have a wire guard. These heat lamps
were hung approximately 8 inches off the floor of the enclosure and could be touched by the dogs. Enclosures must
be constructed and maintained so that they protect dogs from injury.
This affects at least 11 animals.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.3.6 Primary Enclosures (a) (2) (xi)
***** In building twelve there was an enclosure with three Sheba Inus microchip numbers:
94100001449468,0A02111477, and 0A02236144, an enclosure with five Pugs microchip numbers: 0A02112622,
0A02112562, 0A01781329, one with four Schnauzers, one with three Corgis with microchip numbers: 0A02242324,
0A02237273, and 0A02240316, and another enclosure with three Sheba Inus. These enclosures were not big
enough for the number and size of dogs that they contained. Each dog did not have adequate space to perform
normal postural positions and move about freely. Each dog should be provided sufficient space that allows each
dog to turn and move about freely, stand, sit, and walk in a normal manner. This affects 18 dogs. To be corrected by
6-18-2014.
***** In building nine there were twenty-one Sheba Inus in enclosures that were not big enough for that breed and
size of dog. Each enclosure held three to four Sheba Inus per enclosure and didn't provide enough space for each
dog to perform normal postural positions and move about freely. There also was a female miniature Australian
Shepherd in an enclosure that was not big enough for her to make normal postural movements. Each dog should be
provided sufficient space that allows each dog to turn and move about freely, stand, sit, and walk in a normal
manner. This affects 22 dogs. To be corrected by 6-18-2014.
3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Section 3.11 (d) Pest control.
***** The building housing the dog food had an excessive accumulation of wild rodent feces
present on the floor. There were scattered blocks of rodent bait present throughout the building. The licensee must
establish and maintain an effective program for the control of pests to promote the health and well-being of the
animals and reduce contamination by pests in animal areas. This area must
be cleaned more often.
This affected all animals.
