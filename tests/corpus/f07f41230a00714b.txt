2.131(b)(1) Critical

Handling of animals.
On March 11,2021 the improper handling of an approximately 5 year old female Cheetah “Izzy”, caused behavioral stress
to the animal that resulted in the injury of another facility keeper/employee. Izzy was being transferred from her enclosure
to an exercise yard across an employee access road that is not open to the public when the incident occurred. The
facility’s internal cheetah handling protocol requires two handlers to use a primary harness with leash, as well as a
secondary prong collar and leash to be used at all times. The secondary collar allows the handlers to have a secondary
emergency control point to de-escalate any behavioral issues or stress indicated by the animal and ensure the animal is
transporting the animal as expeditiously and carefully as possible. According to the report provided by the facility, the two
handlers broke facility protocols by having Izzy solely on a harness for the transfer without the required back-up prong
collar. During this transfer, another facility employee was also using the access road to perform normal duties at the
facility. Izzy lowered her body and exhibited stalking behaviors as soon as she noticed the other employee approaching.
After the lead handler thought the cheetah was under control, the handler again broke the facility’s protocol by inviting the
other employee to approach the cheetah the cat then lunged and bit the approaching employee, causing injury. Both
handlers were reprimanded and will be retrained prior to reassuming normal duties as a Cheetah handler.
Improper handling of a Cheetah can cause unnecessary behavioral stress to the animals or even injury and/or death to all
individuals and/or animals involved. All employees/handlers must follow all facility protocols to ensure the safety of all

employees and animals. In addition, all handling of animals, including cheetahs, must be done as expeditiously and
carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm or unnecessary
discomfort.
