ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** The licensee did not have the ability to handle a 10 year old male Pomeranian with no id, that was recently
acquired. This dog caught the inspector’s eye due to an abnormal walking movement and appearance of being
matted. It was requested that the dog be brought out for closer observation and the licensee stated that she was not
able to get the dog without getting bit and was not going to try. It is important that the facility have appropriate
methods and personnel to treat and care for dogs. Not being able to handle the dog is not appropriate care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Multiple dogs are overly matted. Matted fur pulls and separates from this skin potentially causing painful skin
irritations. In addition, many of the matted dogs are wet from humidity or urine and this wetness can cause
additional skin problems. These dogs include # 110 a male Shih Tzu, male Yorkie #160 and a male Pomeranian
with no id.
*** Multiple dogs have long nails that are beginning to splay outward and curl underneath. Long nails pose a
potential hazard if they get caught in the wire mesh. These dogs include # 38 a female pug, #101 Shih Tzu, a male
Pomeranian with no id, dog # 110 Shih Tzu, # 160 Yorkie, # H20, # 190 French bulldogs, and a Pug # 038.
*** A male Pomeranian with no id was wet with overly matted fur and dirty ears with black tar like debris which made
it impossible to visualize the ear canal. This dog was shaking its head from side to side which indicated irritation.
This dog needs to be groomed and have the ears examined by the vet to determine treatment.
*** A Cavalier # C08 had ears that were dirty that needed to be cleaned. The dog was shaking its head from side to
side indicating irritation. This dog also have two inter digital cysts that were red, oozing and irritated on the frontright paw and left rear paw. This dog needs to be a seen by a vet for treatment.
*** Dog # 101 a male Shih Tzu had hair loss from the tip of the tail approximately three inches down the base. In
addition, the tip of the tail was red and appeared irritated. Because this dog keeps hitting the tail on the wire sides,
some method of treating the tail and preventing further injury needs to be addressed.
The facility must use appropriate methods such as grooming, nail trimming, and routine ear cleaning on a routine
basis to prevent these types of conditions that can cause distress and injury to the dogs.

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
*** The licensee is not accurately completing section 4 of the records of disposition (form 7006). Many of the
disposition records have a name and PO Box but no box number listed, or just have a name and no address or just
a business name and no address. Per this regulation, the name and address of the person is to be completely filled
out in section 4. This needs to be addressed to track the movement of dogs and puppies in the situation there is a
disease outbreak.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** The humidity level in the main kennel was 76.8% according to the handheld kestrel reader. The licensee states
that the high humidity level is what is making many of the dogs wet. Many of the dogs were wet to the touch.
Relative humidity must be maintained at levels that ensure the health and well-being of the dogs. The humidity level
in the kennel must be addressed for the comfort of these dogs. Correct by: June 23, 2017
3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
*** The outdoor enclosure housing puppies and adult dogs has wood that is no longer impervious to moisture. Many
sections of the wood are excessively chewed and scratched with rough edges. Some of the chewed wood has
splintered which can cause potential injury to the dogs. These surfaces must be maintained on a regular basis and
these sections of wood need to be sealed to facilitate cleaning and sanitizing of the enclosures.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** The outdoor enclosure housing puppies has a section of wire that is too wide at the entrance to their box area
and allows the puppies feet to fall through the wire. Floors must be constructed in a manner that protects the dogs'
feet and legs from injury. This wide section of flooring poses a potential safety hazard and needs to be addressed.

3.6(a)(2)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*** Several of the enclosures have coating that is coming off the wire mesh floors. This coating is meant to protect
the dog’s feet and keep the metal impervious to moisture to facilitate cleaning of the enclosures. These sections of
wire flooring need to be addressed for the safety of the dog’s feet, to keep the enclosure in good repair and to
facilitate cleaning.
*** A few of the enclosures have areas of wire mesh that are rusted. Once the metal begins to rust it can become
pitted and affect the structural integrity of the enclosure and can no longer be effectively cleaned and sanitized.
Primary enclosures must be maintained in good repair for the safety of the dogs and to facilitate cleaning.

3.9(a)FEEDING.
*** There were two cans of wet dog food in the refrigerator next to vaccines and old eggs. Both cans were Vitality
brand that had expiration dates of July 2010. Both cans were rusted around the bottom and one had a small hole
due to rust. These cans were maintained in the fridge where other items are currently in use with the dogs. Expired
food should be discarded and not maintained in a fridge where current animal supplies are used.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The outdoor wire mesh enclosures have feces that are not through the wire mesh. In addition the area
underneath the wire mesh enclosures has an accumulation of feces that is not being removed on a routine basis.
*** The shelter box for the outdoor puppies has old wet straw with insects living in the bedding. This box should be
cleaned daily and excreta and feces removed for the health and comfort of the puppies.
*** The outside enclosure in the back of the property housing several large breed dogs has an accumulation of
feces throughout the enclosure that is not being cleaned. This enclosure must be spot cleaned daily and feces
removed to prevent soiling of the dogs.
***Several of the wire mesh enclosures in the main kennel have feces that are not falling through the wire mesh. Old
feces that had turned white were found under pieces of cardboard or heating mats when they were moved.
*** One feeder in the sheltered building was filled with feces and the food was not able to get into the main trough
area due to the accumulation. Feces needs to be removed from enclosures and feeders daily for the health of the
dogs.
Fecal and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily, and from under primary enclosures as often
as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs and to
reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. These enclosures need to be cleaned for the health and comfort
of the dogs.
3.11(b)(2) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** The facility is not being sanitized on a routine basis. There is a buildup of dirt, debris and hair throughout theenclosures and underneath the enclosures. This excess hair can trap urine and fecal debris causing strong odors
throughout the kennel. For the health of the dogs, primary enclosures must be sanitized at least once every 2
weeks. This needs to be addressed and the corrective action may include creating a schedule and following through
with a cleaning routine.
3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*** To the right of the outdoor enclosure housing the large breed dogs, there are trash and debris items and
miscellaneous items with an overgrowth of weeds. Weeds must be controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the
premises and pest control, and to protect the health and well-being of the animals. This area currently promotes a
breeding and living ground for pests and vermin.
*** The sink area in the puppy room was filled with dirty dishes and there was miscellaneous items on the floor
around the sink area. This area is directly next to an enclosure where puppies have access to the dirty dishes. The
main kennel also had excess items around the grooming table and counter area making the area cluttered.
Animal areas must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury, and to promote good
housekeeping practices.
3.12
EMPLOYEES.
*** The facility currently does not have enough trained employees to carry out an acceptale level of husbandry
practices and care required for these dogs. The licensee's state that they expect their children to do a certain
amount of work and care for the dogs. One owner works in the kennel in the morning prior to going to his job and
the other owner has not had the ability to be in the kennel as much as needed to supervise the care of the dogs.
Based on the number of non compliant items in the report it is evident that the facility needs to hire additional staff
or reduce numbers of animals. This needs to be addressed to maintain an acceptable level of husbandry and care
for the dogs.
