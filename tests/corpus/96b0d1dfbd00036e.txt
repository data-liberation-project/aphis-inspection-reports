3.2(d)

Indoor housing facilities.
The visitor interaction area to meet and play with puppies is in disrepair and several surfaces are no longer impervious to
moisture. Multiple areas of drywall have paint missing or damage, exposing the paper surface covering the drywall. The
bottoms of the doors are chewed, revealing unsealed wood. Several areas on benches and the top railing of the
interaction area have worn off paint and sealant, exposing permeable wood which has areas of discoloration, indicating
chronic absorption of moisture. Surfaces that are not impervious to moisture cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized
which could increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs. Surfaces of indoor housing facilities, including floors
and walls, must be impervious to moisture. Correct by 12 December 2022 by ensuring that all indoor surfaces (floors,
walls, and those in contact with the dogs) are impervious to moisture. The licensee must also ensure that all surfaces are
appropriately maintained at all times in order to support the health and well-being of the animals.
3.13(a)(4)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility’s written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) for dogs is missing required elements. The PVC does not include
preventative care and treatment of hair coats, nails, eyes, ears, skin, and teeth. Basic maintenance and preventative care
of all dogs must be included in the PVC to ensure all animals are being evaluated on a routine basis for potential signs of


illness or disease. Animals not receiving routine preventative care and maintenance are more likely to develop
preventable conditions such as severe matting and skin infections, dental disease, overgrown nails, eye and ear
infections, etc. Correct by 20 October 2022 by ensuring the PVC for dogs addresses the preventative care and treatment
of all dogs to ensure healthy and unmatted hair coats, properly trimmed nails, and clean and healthy eyes, ears, skin and
teeth.
3.31(a)(4)

Sanitation.
The guinea pig enclosures are not being cleaned and sanitized correctly. The enclosures are cleaned with a disinfectant
solution and no detergent. According to the solution label, for disinfectant properties, surfaces must first be cleaned with a
detergent followed by application of the disinfectant. With no detergent step, the enclosures are not being adequately
sanitized. Proper sanitization of enclosures in necessary to prevent disease hazards to the animals housed within,
especially between new groups of animals. Correct by 20 October 2022 by disinfecting the guinea pig enclosures at least
once every 2 weeks in accordance with 3.31(a)(4) such as using a detergent and soap, followed by the disinfectant.
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
The ferret enclosure is not being cleaned frequently enough to prevent contamination of the animals within. The enclosure
has a bottom floor with three upper platforms and according to the facility representative, is typically cleaned out once
every 3 days. The first platform has large piles of feces and urine that cover approximately 2/3 of the platform. The
second platform also has some urine and fecal contamination. One ferret that was sleeping on the second platform was in
close contact with the waste material. The large amount of feces also attracted several flies to the area. Excessive
quantities of excreta can lead to contamination of the animals, attract unwanted pests, and lead to an increased risk of


animals contracting an infectious disease. Correct by 13 October 2022 by increasing the frequency of removing excreta
and cleaning the enclosure to prevent contamination of the ferrets and to minimize disease risks and reduce odors.
