HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
(c)(1)
***** At time of inspection the following areas of exhibition had insuffcient distance and barriers in place which would
prevent contact with the animals in these enclosures. The reindeer pen had portions of the chain barrier which is
between 12" and 18" in height that were missing, the plants which were present in some areas but not all areas also
did not prevent contact.
The board walk for the Kangaroo allowed for an individual if they desired to reach over the rail system and touch the
Kangaroo if it were present beneath them.
The board walk between the areas for the Wart hogs and the Tortoises allowed for the Wart hogs to come directly
up to the edge of their enclosure and directly underneath the public. A person could make contact with the animals
by reaching over the rail system which is in place.
These animal area need to have a barrier system put into place which will prevent contact with the public and the
animals or an adjustment in the enclosures need to be made which will not allow the animals the ability to get this
close to the existing barrier system currently in use.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(c) Surfaces--(1) General requirements. The surfaces of housing facilities--including perches, shelves, swings,
boxes, houses, dens, and other furniture-type fixtures or objects within the facility--must be constructed in a manner
and made of materials that allow them to be readily cleaned and sanitized, or removed or replaced when worn orsoiled
****A majority of the primate shelters are constructed of wood and wire or metal mesh. In many of them the paint on
the wood has worn away or the wood is rotting. All of the wire/metal has varying degrees of rust. Rotting wood and
rust cannot be adequately cleaned or sanitized. The inability to adequately clean and sanitize can lead to pest
problems and/or illness and disease in the animals. These shelters must be repaired or replaced with structures
that can be adequately cleaned and disinfected.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
(a) Structural strength. The facility must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the
animals involved. The indoor and outdoor housing facilities shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in
good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.
****Most of the mammal enclosures have varying degrees of rust on doors, cage furniture, cage walls and/or
enclosure fences. Rust cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized. Rust compromises the structural integrity of
the facility. The inability to adequately clean and sanitize can lead to pest problems and/or illness and disease in the
animals. Compromises in structural integrity can lead to animal escapes. The structures in mammal facilities with
rust problems must be repaired or replaced so that the area can be adequately cleaned and disinfected and to
ensure structural integrity adequate to maintain the animals.

***** At time of inspection the 6' chainlink fence used for enclosure construction and in some areas provide the
perimeter fence for the zoo had many areas that had areas of damage caused by tree limbs falling on it, ground
movement and in one area an accident caused the fence to become in disrepair. Top rails of the fence are missing
in some locations and have become seperated in many others.
This fence needs to be repaired and or replaced in areas if repair is not possible to keep these enclosures in good
repair and to provide for the security of the zoo as the perimeter fence is intended to do.TO BE CORRECTED BY: 9/3/14
***** At time of inspection in many of the exhibits there are broken wires, old wire used to hold limbs and logs in
place and wire cut to allow for roof trusses to be set in many exhibits. These pose an injury threat to the animals in
these enclosures and should be removed. Also there is one exhibit which has encompassed a tree into the exhibit
and the wood used to do this has become seperated due to the growth of the tree and needs to be repaired before
a potential animal escape should become possible and to keep this exhibit in good repair.

***** At time of inspection the concrete block wall in the food preperation building had in the area of the breaker
panel areas of the block which had been removed for work to be completed. This area now that the work is
completed needs to be repaired to make this area of the wall once again structurally sound and to keep it in good
repair.
TO BE CORRECTED BY: 6/3/14
***** At time of inspection the outer barns accessible from the public roadway had many items which are in need of
repair, or replacement. All wood on the exterior of the buildings which has rotted away in areas along the bottoms of
the buildings need to be repaired or the boards replaced.
On the interior of the buildings where the concrete has cracked and openings have become large enough for food,
fecal material, and waste to become trapped it is not allowing for good husbandry practices and sanitation to take
place. These cracks need to be repaired with a material which will allow for the required husbandry pratices for
these animals to be carried out.
On many of the buildings interior metal flashing has become structurally unsound and has rusted away and needs
to be repaired and or replaced to prevent injury to the animals. Also wood used to line the interior walls which has
become rotted should be replaced.
In one building there are several electrical junction boxes which do not have covers on them and this poses an
injury risk to the animals by electrocution in this building. All junction boxes should have covers that protect the
animals from injury.
There are fans in several of the buildings which have been positioned in the areas just above the feeders for the
animals. Many of these animals are hoof stock which are horned or have antlers and can reach the fans in the
current locations. These fans need to be moved to a location which will not allow for possible contact with theanimals.
There are two barns which have drains in the floor. The drains currently have a protective cover on them which
prevents an animal from stepping down into the drain pipe itself but does not protect them from a trip hazard as the
current cover is located inside the drain trap and not flush with the concrete floor. This is allowing for a 2" to 3" trip
hazard to possibly injure an animal if the animals currently in theses enclosures were to become startled and try to
flee all at one time causing an animal to step into this drain system.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
(d) Perimeter fence.
***** At time of inspection the 8' perimeter fence requirements for dangerous animals was not being met. The
exterior perimeter fence of the zoo itself in several areas was of 6' in height which would require that the dangerous
animal enclosures themselves have an 8 ' perimeter fence around them to act as a secondary containment system
in the event of an escape and to keep animals and unauthorized persons out. The perimeter fence around the zoo
needs to be elevated to an 8' height to meet this requirement or the individual enclosures for the dangerous animals
need to have an 8' perimeter system put into place that is at least 3' from the enclosure walls so that direct contact
with the animals is not allowed..

SANITATION.
(c) Housekeeping. Premises (buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the
animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in this subpart.
****The kitchen used to prepare animal diets had paint peeling off the ceilings in the cooler and the dry feed storage
room. The floor had peeling paint/sealer. Metal shelves holding clean food containers were rusted. Wooden
shelves holding clean food containers and utensils were falling apart or covered with old, dirty, sticky shelf paper.
Food and food receptacles must be stored in facilities which adequately protect them from contamination. The
peeling paint/sealer on the floor prevents the floor from being adequately cleaned and sanitized. Paint peeling off
the ceilings could contaminate food stored in the dry feed room or the cooler. Rotting wood, old sticky shelf paper,and rust cannot be adequately cleaned or sanitized therefore the food receptacles and utensils stored on these
surfaces will not remain adequately cleaned or sanitized. The inability to adequately clean and sanitize can lead to
pest problems and/or illness and disease in the animals. The animal kitchen needs to be renovated so that paint is
not peeling, the floors are cleanable, and work and storage surfaces can be cleaned and disinfected.

***** At time of inspection the ceiling in the food preparation building was tongue and groove pine. There was
spacing between many of the boards which looked to have possibly been sap, dust or other foreign material trapped
between the boards.This ceiling needs to be repaired or covered with a material such as paint or material which will
prevent any foreign material from falling into the food being prepared below and contaminating the food.
***** At time of inspection the lighting used in the food preparation building was flouresent lighting. The protective
diffusers which are used to diffuse the light as well as to prevent glass from broken bulbs from falling onto persons
or objects below and causing potential injury or in this case contaminated food were not present. Another means of
preventing this from occuring which was not used in the absence of the diffusers are protective sleeves which can
be put over each flouresent tube which if broken prevents the bulb from shattering onto anything located beneath it.
The lighting diffusers or a protective measure which will prevent broken bulbs from falling onto persons or objects
beneath the light fixutures such as food being prepared for the animals need to be installed.
***** At time of inspection the freezer unit for the zoo was in need of repair to the ceiling where the metal covering
which covered the wood and insulation on the roof section which is close to the entry door and freezer cooling unit
was missing and the wood had become rotted and was allowing for dripping of material onto the food shelf below.
This ceiling needs to be repaired so that this area is consistant with the rest of the ceiling in this unit.
The floor of the freezer unit was in need of cleaning as well as sthe storage racks of the unit. There was dirt, debris
and lots of build up in the floor tracks indicating it had been some time since a complete cleaning of this freezer unit
had been done.
This unit should be cleaned as food is removed and prior to new food being put into the unit.TO BE CORRECTED BY: 6/3/14
