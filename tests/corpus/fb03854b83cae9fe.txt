- The instructor of record (IOR) performed teaching surgeries on lagomorphs (rabbits) without an IACUC proposal
and approval to involve this species of animal. There are 6 lagomorphs that were induced for teaching surgical
procedures for dental, ovariohysterectomy (OHE), and castration. A 2.5 year old Dutch rabbit named "Stu"
(identification number 14-027) was induced on 04-02-14 for castration. A 3 year old lion head rabbit named
"Sheldon" (identification number 14-029) was induced on 4-21-14 for a castration. A 2 year old Holland lop named
"Maddie" (identification number 14-030) was induced on 4-21-14 for an ovariohysterectomy. A 3 year old Lop cross
named "Nibbler" (identification number 14-028) was induced on 4-21-14 for a castration. A Holland lop identification
number 14-025 was induced on 4-2-14 for a dental. Rabbit named "Tusk" (identification number 14-021) was
induced on 4-21-14 and experienced cardiac arrest (his heart stopped) and he died during induction. A proposal for
the use of lagomorphs must be created and approved by the IACUC prior to any animal use.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
- An IACUC approved animal use activity (14-01) involving 56 dogs for survival surgery contains provisions for pre
and post-operative care. However, the facility has not been following these provisions appropriately. Animals
undergoing anesthesia and surgery are not undergoing a sterile surgical preparation of the area. At least 40 of
these dogs had a surgical preparation of the surgical site using non-sterile examination gloves instead of sterile
surgical gloves. Of the 40 dogs not aseptically prepared for surgery 22 were castrations and 18 were
ovariohysterectomies (OHE). The Instructor of Record described the procedure as follows;" The patient was then
transferred to the surgery suite. After securing the patient..... the preparing individual would don new exam gloves
and again prep the area..." Surgical procedures without aseptic preparations may result in septic peritonitis for
dogs undergoing OHE in which the abdominal cavity is open, and is an infection of the skin and subcutaneous
tissues. Using non-sterile exam gloves in the last surgical prep clearly fails to provide an aseptic surgical site.
Activities that involve surgery must include appropriate provisions for pre-operative and post-operative care of the
animals in accordance with established veterinary medical and nursing practices. All survival surgeries must beperformed using aseptic procedures, including surgical gloves, masks, sterile instruments, and aseptic techniques.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
- The IACUC did not conduct appropriate continuing reviews of the animal activities for protocols 14-01 appendix F
to ensure that the investigators are following the approved protocols. The animal use activity involved dogs for these
protocols.
- Protocol 14-01 appendix F for surgery states in the "Surgical & Procedure time Section" " The supervising
veterinarian should strongly consider assisting or relieving the student surgeon when the surgical time exceeds 75
minutes. In the event the supervising veterinarian elects not to assist or relieve the student, documentation should
be made in the medical record as to the reason such action was not taken." Surgery and anesthesia logs indicate
that the dog "Doe", a 10 month old female Labrador/Pointer mix, identification number A024784, was induced on
10-24-2014 at 13:07 and the endotracheal tube was removed at 16:08. Her length of procedure according to the
surgery log book was 179 minutes. Her length of time under anesthesia was 179 minutes and there are no notes in
the medical records as to why action was not taken. A three month old border terrier mix "Aberdeen" identification
number A024852, was induced on 10-29-2014 at 13:15 and the endotracheal tube removed at 14:42. Aberdeen's
length of procedure according to the surgery log book was 87 minutes and there are no notes in the medical records
as to why action was not taken. Dog "Fransine" a 6 year old female Bassett hound with identification number
14-0455 was induced on 11-04-2014 at 2:03 pm and the endotracheal tube removed at 4:46 pm. Fransine's length
of procedure according to the surgery log book was 163 minutes and there are no notes in the medical record as to
why action was not taken.
- The IACUC approved animal use activity (protocol 14-01 appendix F) involving dogs. The IACUC must ensure that
the investigators are following the approved protocols.
- Protocol 14-01 appendix F for surgery states in the "Surgical & Procedure time Section" ".... While there is some
debate on the exact body temperature which defines surgical hypothermia, it is generally agreed that temperatures
below 97 deg. F (36 deg C) is cause for concern. To help mitigate hypothermia condition barriers will be
placed....Should patient's temperature drop below 97 deg F (36 deg C) additional steps will be taken..... The
additional steps taken or rationale for lack of action shall be documented in the medical record." Anesthesia logs
and medical records indicate that dog "Cricket" a 6 year old maltese mix with identification number 14-0975
undergoing a teaching dental procedure on 11-18-14 had a body temperature at 2:55 pm of 96.7 deg F at 3:05 pm
her body temperature was 96.3 deg F and at 3:11 pm was 97.0 deg F. There are no notes in the medical record as
to what action if any was taken. Anesthesia logs and medical logs indicate that the dog "Clementine" a 1-5 year old
Coon Hound with identification number 14-0610 undergoing a teaching dental procedure on 11-5-14 had a body
temperature at 14:10 of 97.1 deg F at 14:25 her body temperature was 96.8 deg F at 14:40 was 95.9 deg F and at
15:00 was 98.3 deg F. There are no notes in the medical record as to what action was taken. Anesthesia logs and
medical logs indicate that the dog "Houdini" a 3 year old Lab mix with identification number 14-0912 undergoing ateaching neuter procedure on 11-5-14 had a body temperature at 14:02 of 97.2 deg F at 14:09 his body
temperature was 97.3 deg F at 14:20 was 97.2 deg F at 14:23 was 97 deg F. and at 14:29 was 97 deg F. There are
no notes in the medical record as to what action was taken. The IACUC must conduct continuing reviews of
activities to ensure that they are being conducted as approved by the IACUC and in a manner consistent with the
AWA regulations and standards to protect the welfare of animals.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
- The course instructor of record (IOR) conducted teaching surgical procedures on animals with bloodwork
parameters outside the generally accepted range of normalities for these procedures.
- A female Basset Hound "Fransine" identification number 14-0455 was, according to medical records, Ehrlichia
positive, Anaplasma positive, and heartworm positive. Fransine underwent a teaching dental procedure and mass
excision from the left side of the tail even though her blood parameters for clotting were low. Her pre-surgical blood
parameters, obtained by an in-house hematology analyzer, revealed a hematocrit of 32.5 % (32-55%) and a platelet
count of 87,000/uL (170,000-500,000/uL). An estimated platelet count of 48,000/uL was obtained on blood film
review. Fransine(cid:25)'s post-surgical notes indicate significant bleeding overnight.
- A female boxer-mix "Nina" identification number C14-003060, was according to medical records mildly anemic,
thrombocytopenic, hookworm positive, and whip worm positive. Nina underwent a teaching OHE procedure even
though her blood parameters for oxygen carrying capacity and clotting were low. Her hematocrit was 27.9 %
(32-55%) and her platelet count was 28,000/uL (170,000-500,000/uL) obtained by an in-house hematology
analyzer. Her estimated platelet count was 72,000/uL obtained on blood film review.
- A female Rottweiler/German shepherd mix identification C14-003037 was, according to medical records mildly
anemic, thrombocytopenic and positive for hook worms and whip worms. She underwent a teaching OHE procedure
even though her blood parameters for oxygen carrying capacity and clotting were low. Her hematocrit was 30.5%
(32-55%) and platelet count was 73,000/uL (170,000-500,000/uL) obtained by an in-house hematology analyzer.
Her estimated platelet count from blood film review was 54,000/uL. The purpose of the pre anesthetic evaluation is
to accurately assess and document an animal(cid:25)'s health in order to prevent complications and improve patient
outcome.
Protocol 14-01 has the breed of animals and age as the only exclusion criteria for animals undergoing elective
surgical procedures consisting of OHE, castration, and dentals. Generally accepted pre-surgical bloodwork
parameters such as hematocrit (PCV) of 30 % or higher, and platelet count of 100,000/uL or greater are indicators
of oxygen carrying capacity, blood clotting ability, and health status. The facility must establish and maintain
programs of adequate veterinary care including the use of appropriate methods to prevent medical problems, such
as the appropriate screening and evaluation of patients prior to undergoing anesthetic procedures.- Animal number 14-098 Doberman/labrador cross on protocol 14-01 underwent surgery for a teaching OHE on
11-12-14. The student on 11-13-14 reported in medical notes a body temperature of 103.5 deg F. There is no
indication or record that the veterinarian examined this animal prior to it being released from the facility on 11-13-14
and returned to the shelter. This animal may have had complications from surgery, or an infection post surgical
procedure. The veterinarian did not observe this animal prior to the dismissal and release from the facility and did
not provide appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries including the surgical
site.
- The use of appropriate methods to document, prevent and, treat diseases must be established. A cat identified as
"Livi"(cid:29) was treated on 3-10-2014 with 0.45 mls of 0.3mg/ml Buprenex HCl and 0.25ml of 5 mg/ml Diazepam. No
medical records are available for this animal. Without medical records it is unknown why this animal received
treatment, whether the treatment was appropriate, and what the outcome was for this patient. Medication, and
especially controlled substances, must be prescribed and documented appropriately in medical records as a
standard of medical care. Medical records must contain a full and complete documentation of a patient(cid:25)s'
examinations, tests, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. The facility must record and maintain medical records for
all patients.
- On 4-21-2014 A Lagomorph identified as "Tusk " underwent a teaching surgical procedure of castration. Tusk
was induced at 10:34 am and at 10:40 am anesthesia records indicate he experienced a cardiac arrest (his heart
stopped) and died during the anesthesia induction. There are no medical notes of complications or arrhythmias.
There is no indication the patient was being monitored or if emergency resuscitation efforts were attempted. The
use of appropriate methods and standards of adequate veterinary care must be established and maintained.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
- Animal number 14-098 (Doberman/Labrador cross) on protocol 14-01 underwent surgery for a teaching
ovariohysterectomy on 11-12-14. The student responsible for post-operative monitoring on 11-13-14 reported in the
medical notes a body temperature of 103.5 degrees F. In a post-operative animal, a body temperature this high
indicates fever and possible infection, and should have been evaluated by the attending veterinarian. There is no
indication that the student notified the veterinarian of this condition and no indication that the animal was observed
by a veterinarian prior to the dismissal and release from the facility. There is no record of any treatment being
administered for this condition. This animal should have been evaluated by the veterinarian, and any treatment
recorded in the medical record. If the veterinarian determined no treatment was necessary, that should also be
indicated in the animal(cid:25)'s medical record. Post-operative animals showing any abnormalities must be evaluated andtreated appropriately by a licensed veterinarian.
