3.10(a)

Watering
There was no water available in an outdoor enclosure containing two dogs. There were 3 empty bowls and at least one
bowl was upside down in this enclosure. The inspector asked the facility representative to fill the bowl with water. One
dog drank shortly when water was added to the bowl. Another outdoor enclosure containing one small dog also had no
water available. The facility representative stated that this dog was previously in the house and had just been put outside
into the enclosure.

Water is essential to life. Water is the most important substance required to maintain the health of animals. All dogs must
be provided access to drinkable water at all times.

Potable water must be continuously available to the dogs, unless restricted by the attending veterinarian or excepted as
provided in § 3.17(a).

Correct from this time forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
