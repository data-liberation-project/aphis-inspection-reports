PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Records indicate that multiple breaches in security and unsafe practices have occurred in the last several years and
continue to present day. These unsafe practices have resulted in employee injuries in the years prior to 2014.
On March 7th 2015 “CJ”, a 15 year old chimpanzee attacked the licensee of Chimps Inc. through an unsecured
sliding feed door resulting in the licensee receiving puncture wounds to the back of hand and minor head injuries.
On May 15th 2015 “CJ” escaped his primary enclosure through a sliding feed door left open by the licensee. On
October 11th 2016 “CJ” grabbed a caregiver in a confined space area resulting in minor scratches and bruises to
the individual. On January 24th 2017 the pin securing a feed door in cage B was not put back in place by the
licensee.
These breaches in security have not been entirely a result of caregivers failing to following written protocol, but by
management’s manipulation of facility enclosures during and after regular business hours. This constitutes unsafe
and inappropriate handling by the licensee and amplifies the risk of injury and ability of the chimpanzee to escape
its primary enclosure.
Although the facility has an excellent written procedural and safety protocol that all caregivers must adhere to, the
licensee’s failure to adhere to these protocols has been problematic for caregivers; enclosure entrance doors and
feed doors have repeatedly been left unlocked during the day and/or found that way by staff upon arriving for work
in the mornings.
The facility’s procedural manual states that: “Chimps Inc. will deal with any deliberate or ongoing safety violation,
or creation of hazards, by any member through disciplinary action, up to and including termination.” These failures
to follow proper procedures and protocols for such dangerous animals put the care staff and chimpanzees at risk of
injury and even death.

Correct by: Established security and safety procedures and protocols must be adhered to and followed from this
point forward.
3.85EMPLOYEES.
Staff schedules reveal that only one caregiver was assigned to work at the facility on the 4th, 6th, 11th, 19th, 25th,
and the 26th of November 2016, on the 2nd, 4th, 9th, 14th-17th, 21st-24th, 28th, 30th, 31st of December 2016, and
on the 1st, 7th, 8th,14th,15th, of March 2017. The handbook of Chimps, Inc. and management has stated that on
the days when only one caregiver is scheduled, the executive director must be present, resulting in at least two
active personnel at the facility at all times. The executive director position by design requires significant time
commitments off grounds and in the office. On a number of occasions, staff stated that neither the executive
director, nor any back up was available to assist and that they felt in danger or at risk by being alone with the
chimpanzees. Given that chimpanzees are large, intelligent, and dangerous animals, there needs to be at least two
caregivers present and on duty at all times for the safety of the caregivers as well as the chimpanzees.
For safety working with dangerous animals, schedules need to be revised and constructed so that no caregiver is
working alone.
