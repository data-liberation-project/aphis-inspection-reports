2.40(b)(2) DIRECT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A weanling guinea pig was seen to be weak and reluctant to move. This was pointed out to the licensee during
inspection. This animal is sick and needs prompt veterinary care. Lack of prompt veterinary care in a poorly
responsive animal could allow discomfort in the affected animal and if contagious could spread sickness to other
animals in the building. The licensee called the attending veterinarian (AV) during inspection however the AV was
out on a service call. The facility must ensure that the attending veterinarian is contacted to evaluate and treat the
observed sick weanling.
