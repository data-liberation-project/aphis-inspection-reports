2.32(a) CRITICAL
PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS.
Two hamsters were severely injured during a social defeat model session conducted by a student researcher
on/about 6/21/18. One of the hamsters (18-12) was reported as not looking good on 6/21/18 via an email from the
student and was found deceased 10 minutes later by veterinary staff. The second hamster was found by veterinary
staff to have multiple fight wounds on its back, neck and haunches and was noted to be extremely lethargic and
grinding its teeth on 6/22/18. It was treated by veterinary staff on 6/22/18 and was found deceased on 6/23/18.
Review by facility and IACUC members included interviews with the student and the principal investigator. It was
determined that the student researcher was insufficiently trained. The student left the hamsters in the same cage for
the full five minutes of the defeat session as described in the protocol and did not separate them sooner based on
the aggressive actions exhibited by the hamsters as delineated in the protocol. In addition the student was not
keeping adequate procedural records and was not adequately trained in identifying and reporting hamster health
issues to include wounding. A retraining action plan was implemented by the PI for all lab student researchers. The
IACUC July 19, 2018 minutes state that the incidence was reported to the USDA but further investigation
determined that the statement was an error-the IACUC chair communicated that no report was made. Since the
retraining was conducted, no further hamster wounding issues have been reported. Continue to ensure that all
researchers using animals on this protocol are trained in the proper handling and proper post-procedural care of the
hamsters.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with undersigned Director of Operations.
