2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1305 on
17-JUL-17. I went to the licensee's house and knocked on the door. No one answered. I honked my car horn. I
contacted the licensee by phone. She informed me she would not be able to make herself available to do the
inspection with me. She gave me her optimal hours. I told her I would try back another time.
End of report.
