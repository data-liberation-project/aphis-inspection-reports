2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
The facility had records of water quality but no records of daily observations of the fish on an active protocol at the
facility. Staff at the facility monitors water quality and daily feed intake, however they were unaware of any health
issues such as fin condition, spinal abnormalities or skin lesions that were observed by the inspectors at the time of
the inspection. Approximately 10% of the fish had observable health issues during the inspection.
Failure to adequately observe animals on a daily basis and failure to communicate promptly with the attending
veterinarian may be detrimental to the health of the animals and cause unnecessary pain and distress. Daily
observation of all the animals to access their well-being and direct and frequent communication with the attending
veterinarian regarding health issues is necessary to ensure that the animals receive timely and adequate veterinary
care. A system should be in place to ensure that all animals are observed daily and the attending veterinarian is
notified when necessary.
