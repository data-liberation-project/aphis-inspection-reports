2.8
NOTIFICATION OF CHANGE OF NAME, ADDRESS, CONTROL, OR OWNERSHIP OF BUSINESS.
An adult working at the premises adjacent to the licensee's facility indicated that the licensee was no longer at the
facility and provided a new telephone number to reach the licensee. The licensee conveyed on the telephone that
he has indeed moved from the business address and into another state. The licensee shared that he moved
approximately 6-7 weeks ago.
Within 10 days of implementing substantial operational or business changes, licensees are required to provide
notification to Animal Care. The ability of USDA to ensure the welfare of animals protected under the Animal
Welfare Act is dependent on having accurate information regarding business locations. Because the licensee
indicated he will no longer be operating the business at the previously listed address, he received directions on
cancelling his current license and applying for a license within the new state of his residence.
