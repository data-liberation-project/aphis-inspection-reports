2.126 CRITICAL REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee refused an inspection and was verbally harrassing.
On March 26, 2018 at about 10:06 am Mr. Dukes returned my call from a few minutes earlier. I called ahead
because there is a note in ACIS indicating that inspectors should call a few minutes ahead to give Mr. Dukes time to
put his guard dogs up. When I answered his call he immediately started yelling at me “how dare you call me, you’re
not coming on my property” and “I’m dropping my license so you don’t need to come here”. He ranted in a loud,
angry voice and used offensive language. His tone was very hostile and repeated several times “you’re never
coming on my property again” and hung up.
In order to verify that he understood this was a refusal, I called Mr. Dukes back. He repeated again “you and
USDA are not allowed on my property” and several versions of the same sentiment all in an angry, hostile tone. In
his ranting it sounded like he was accusing me of talking about him to other people, and when I indicated to him that
I didn’t know what he was talking about, he then mentioned “your neighbors” and “that vet” followed by telling me he
has a lawyer and threatened me saying “I’m going after you too” .
I interrupted Mr. Dukes in the middle of another string of hostile and aggressive ranting and asked if I understood
correctly that he was refusing an inspection. He said he didn’t care, that he was dropping us. I told him that his
license was still active and he replied that it runs out in May and he isn’t renewing. At this point I just said “okay,
thank you” and he hung up on me.
There has been a prior interference citation on 8/30/2016 with hostility toward the inspector, an attempted
inspection on 11/16/2017, and now a hostile refusal. Additionally, a report from an attending veterinarian terminating
their relationship with the licensee about a year ago, in combination with this lack of access to inspect, creates
concern for the welfare of the animals at this facility.
