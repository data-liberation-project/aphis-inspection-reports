2.31(d)(5)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol APS062 was randomly selected for review during the inspection. The protocol has not had a minimum
annual review performed within its annual time period, to have been completed around January 13 2014. In
addition, the IACUC identified 2 other ongoing protocols (APS0068 and APS029) within the last year where annual
reviews were not conducted within an annual time frame. Protocols reviewed less than annually does not allow for
oversight by the IACUC to ensure animals are used appropriately and to protect their health and wellbeing. Review
Protocol APS0062. In addition, establish and maintain a procedure to ensure all ongoing protocols are reviewed no
less than annually by the IACUC. Correct by: 30 June 2014
Note: The facility's IACUC reviewed Protocol APS0062 on 6/17/2014 during their full committee IACUC meeting.
Inspection and exit briefing conducted with facility representatives.
