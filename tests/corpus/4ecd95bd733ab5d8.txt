ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***All of the goats and both alpacas had excessively overgrown hooves, while several of the animals had toes that
were curling abnormally. This is a result of not receiving routine hoof trimming.
Failure to appropriately maintain hooves/nails can cause gait abnormalities which could be painful or cause injuries.
As part of the facility’s programs of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive
appropriate hoof and nail care in a timely manner.
These 19 animals must have their hooves trimmed by November 9, 2016

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The wires holding the wooden boards to the metal fencing in one of the goat enclosures containing two goats
have several sharp points that could come into contact with the goats and lead to injury.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, or gaps/openings in order to
protect the animals from injury. A system of timely identification, facility repair, and maintenance must be in place.
