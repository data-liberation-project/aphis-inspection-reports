****
In the sheltered facility there were at least 4 enclosures, affecting 10 dogs, that had an accumulation of hair, dirt,
grime and cobwebs on back wall, wire divider panels, and pvc support pipes on the outside section. This
accumulation can become a disease hazard to the animals. The licensee must clean these enclosures and ensure
that hard surfaces with which the dogs come in contact with are spot-cleaned daily and sanitized at least once every
two weeks (or more often if necessary). All other surfaces of housing facilities must be cleaned and sanitized when
necessary to satisfy generally accepted husbandry standards and practices.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
Primary enclosures for dogs and cats must meet the following minimum requirements:
(a) General requirements. (2) Primary enclosures (x) Floors
****
In at least 7 enclosures, affecting 18 dogs, the inspectors observed several small breed dogs feet falling through the
openings of the wire floor. The licensee had recently replaced his wire floor with a 1 1/2' x 1 1/2" openings. The
measurement of one of the dogs foot was measured at approximately 1 inch. The openings of the wire flooring are
too large and the dogs could become injured. The licensee must repair or replace the wire flooring in the affected
enclosures and ensure that all floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from
injury, and that, if of mesh or slatted construction, do not allow the dogs' and cats' feet to pass through any openings
in the floor

3.9(b)FEEDING.
b. Cleaning and sanitizing of feed receptacles
****
In a self feeder in one enclosure, affecting 2 dogs, there were small black and brown bugs in the food. In at least 6
enclosures, affecting 15 dogs, the self feeders had an accumulation of caked feed in the trough area. When
questioned by the inspectors as to when the last time he had cleaned and sanitized these self feeders the licensee
replied "about a month ago". Inside some of these enclosures the licensee had placed a metal catch pan with a
rubber bowl under the self feeders to catch some of the food the dogs were digging out of the self feeders. On the
bottom of the catch pans there is an accumulation of old food, bedding, hair and some fecal material.
Bugs and fecal material can contaminate the food, caked feed in the self feeders and the old food in the catch pans
can lose its nutritional value and/or become contaminated.
The licensee must remove the old food and caked food from the self feeders and clean and sanitize the self feeders
and catch pans. The licensee must ensure all food receptacles are cleaned and sanitized at least once every two
weeks or more often if necessary and also ensure that measures are taken to ensure that there is no molding,
deterioration, and caking of feed.

Inspectors observed 2 solid floor sections of the primary enclosures, containing 7 dogs, that had compacted fecal
material and soiled straw bedding. Small black and brown bugs were also present in the bedding area. The licensee
informed the inspectors the last time he cleaned these enclosures was around April, 2014.
Licensee needs to remove the compacted fecal material and bedding and clean and sanitize the affected
enclosures
Licensee must ensure that excreta is removed from primary enclosures daily, and from under primary enclosures as
often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation of feces and food waste, to prevent soiling of the dogs
contained in the primary enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
