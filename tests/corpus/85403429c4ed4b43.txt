2.40(b)(3) Critical

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A male giraffe being temporarily housed by the licensee did not receive veterinary care in a timely manner. The
veterinarian was contacted to examine the animal the day prior to its death. According to the attending veterinarian, the
animal was very thin when it was examined, and instructions were given to increase the amount of feed the animal was
receiving. The animal died the next day.
The histopathology report states, “Given the apparent serous atrophy of fat found grossly, this would suggest a possible
nutritional deficient or management issue”. Licensees are responsible for daily observation of all animals to assess their
health and well-being and to have direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian so that timely and
accurate information on the health of the animals is conveyed to the veterinarian.
This animal may not have died if the veterinarian had been contacted prior to the animal going down the day before it
died.
The licensee needs to communicate more frequently and effectively with the attending veterinarian on problems of animal
health, behavior, and well-being.
