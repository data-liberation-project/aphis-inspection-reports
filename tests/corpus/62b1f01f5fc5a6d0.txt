ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A male reindeer calf was noted to still be limping on his right hind limb as much or worse than noted during the
inspection conducted on 8/26/2014. He was holding the limb off the ground when at rest, and the limb was noted to
be shaking after he had run around the pen 2-3 times with the herd during observation. Records from the attending
veterinarian were available to APHIS officials during the inspection and indicated that this condition actually first
presented on 6/2/14. This animal was re-examined and re-radiographed by the attending veterinarian on
8/29/2014 after being required following the inspection by APHIS officials on 8/26/2014. The APHIS AC VMO met
with the attending veterinarian (AV) at an off site location following this inspection. Review of the records and
radiographs was conducted with the AV. The AV had documented that she examined the reindeer calf during a visit
to the premises for herd health work on 9/9/2014. The AV stated that she flexed and palpated the animal's leg
during this visit and didn't feel any instability nor did the animal appear to be in pain and she considered the
lameness to be mild at the time of her examination.
Lameness is indicative of pain, possibly due to underlying problems with the healing of a fractured limb, which may
be intermittent and in need of monitoring daily. No detailed plan for monitoring the animal's progress, follow-up by
the AV to determine the level of healing, nor any criteria for when pain relief or ways to reduce pain or distress
noted during monitoring was documented as required following the citation for appropriate veterinary care during the
previous inspection. This was discussed with the AV and she stated she would provide this to the licensee so that it
can be properly followed and that APHIS can review to determine that appropriate care is being provided.
**A plan needs to be documented, approved by the attending veterinarian (AV), and be available for review by
APHIS officials for the monitoring of this reindeer by the licensee for pain and to recognize changes in the animal's
condition. This plan should include criteria for when pain relief or other methods for reducing pain and distress need
to be provided to ensure a good quality of life and to prevent worsening of the underlying condition. The licensee
should document that he is monitoring this animal and when pain relief or other methods are provided to reduce
pain and discomfort so the veterinarian and APHIS officials can evaluate if the plan is effective.
A reindeer cow noted on the previous inspection on 8/26/2014 to have excessively overgrown hooves was trimmed
on 9/9/2014 and hooves appeared to be more normal. No plan, as required under the previous citation from the8/26/2014 inspection, was documented by the AV for addressing hoof conditions more frequently to prevent
overgrowth and chronic problems with which overgrown hooves may be associated.
**A plan needs to be developed and documented, with the input of the attending veterinarian (AV), to address the
need for hoof trimming for any animals that may need more frequent trimming to prevent the development of chronic
foot and leg problems. This plan needs to be available for review by APHIS officials.(cid:29)
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries

RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
The licensee did have some records on hand for review during this inspection but the records did not fully and
correctly disclose the required information:
**There were 3 goats, 6 sheep, 1 alpaca, and 1 llama housed together but the record of animals on hand listed 3
goats, 5 sheep, 1 alpacas, and 1 llama (when compared to disposition records available).
**On the previous inspection on 8/26/2014, there was 1 llama, 3 sheep, and 2 goats on site. There were no
acquisition records for the added 3 sheep, 1 goat, and 1 alpaca seen on this inspection on 9/19/2014. The record
of animals on hand could be matched with older acquisition and disposition forms to account for 3 goats and 5 of 6
sheep but there is no way to tell if the 1 alpaca, 3 sheep, and 1 goat that were present for this inspection are the
same as those on the record of animals on hand form since there were no disposition and acquisition records made
if they had left the premises and then were returned or if animals were sold or otherwise disposed of and new
animals were acquired. There are notes in the disposition boxes on the form (APHIS Form 7019 is being used as
the record of animals on hand) that indicate 1 alpaca, 1 goat, and 3 sheep may have gone to another person/facility
("5/13 TBR Summer visit") and that 1 alpaca on "5/20/14 returned". These notations could not be compared to any
records of disposition and acquisition that were provided during the inspection. No alpaca was present on the
8/26/2014 inspection so it is unknown if the alpaca that left presumably May 2013 and returned 5/20/14 is the same
llama seen on 9/19/2014.
**There was incomplete information from persons from whom the following animals were acquired:
---2 male reindeer were acquired on 11/26/13
---2 goats and 2 sheep were acquired on 4/12/14
---1 alpaca acquired on 5/20/14
No USDA license/registration number if the person is licensed or no driver's license number and State and vehicle
license number and State for this person were documented on any of the records. Records which fully and correctly disclose the required information regarding the acquisition and disposition of
animals other than dogs and cats is required to ensure that the transactions are done legally, so that animals may
be properly tracked through during the inspection process, and to ensure the humane care and use of animals
during transport, housing, and exhibition.
To be corrected by 9/26/2014 and on all subsequent acquistions and dispositions of animals.
2.126(a)(2) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The licensee had some records available for review during this inspection but did not have records from a
consultant veterinarian who examined the reindeer, including a juvenile male calf that has since been diagnosed
with a fractured right hind leg, in May.
Records that are required under the AWA, especially those concerning the veterinary care of the animals, must be
available for review by APHIS officials.
Access to all required records for inspections is required for the Secretary to be able to enforce the AWA.
The licensee shall allow APHIS officials access to conduct inspections.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The outdoor enclosure housing 1 llama, 1 alpaca, 6 sheep, and 3 goats had bent and broken wires with sharp ends
protruding into the enclosure on the northeast side, posing a risk of injury to the animals. Corrected during the
inspection.
Also in this enclosure, a support post for the enclosure fencing had become loose with the sharp stake ends
exposed, posing a risk of injury to the animals and no longer making this south fencing structurally sound.
Corrected during the inspection.
The facility shall be constructed so it is structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from
injury and contain the animals.
Inspection conducted with licensee, facility representative, and 2 APHIS AC inspectors. Exit interview conductedwith licensee by telephone on 9/22/2014. Report delivered to licensee on 12/22/2014 by certified and regular mail.
