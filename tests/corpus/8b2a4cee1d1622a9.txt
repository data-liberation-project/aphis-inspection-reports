FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Perimeter Fence.
The outdoor housing facility where the primary enclosures for 2 Coatimundis, 1 African Crested Porcupine, and 1
Wallaby are located is surrounded by a perimeter fence that is constructed of wire fencing that measured 5 feet in
height. The gate into the fenced in area is the only part of the perimeter fence that is the required 6 feet in height.
Per this Section of the Regulations, all outdoor housing facilities where non-dangerous animals are housed must be
enclosed by a perimeter fence that is 6 feet high. The perimeter fence protects the animals housed outdoors by
restricting other animals and unauthorized persons from going through or underneath the fence and having contact
with the animals in the facility. In addition the perimeter fence functions as a secondary containment system for the
facility's animals that are housed outdoors.
The height of the perimeter fence surrounding the outdoor enclosures that house 2 Coatimundis, the African
Crested Porcupine, and the Wallaby needs to be increased to 6 feet to protect the animals.
