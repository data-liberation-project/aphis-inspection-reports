2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were three animals identified as needing veterinary care on this inspection:
***A young goat in the central section of the petting area, "Hailey," who is lame on the left rear limb. She will put
some weight on it occasionally, but consistently limps at the walk.
***An adult female goat in the northeast section of the petting area with an injury of some kind on the top of her
head. An area in the center of the skull appears to have hair loss, a small ulcerated wound, and scabbing of the
surrounding skin.
***An adult female white and brown goat in the pasture adjacent to the petting area who is limping on the right rear
limb. The limp is pronounced at the run and the walk.
Additionally, a shelf containing medications for the entire farm (which includes horses) has several bottles of
medications that are expired. The shelf does not designate between medications to be used only on horses or
those which can be used on any species, to include the petting zoo animals. Using expired medications on
regulated species is not consistent with the Animal Welfare Act regulations for the provision of adequate veterinary
care. Correct by ensuring that expired medications are thrown out or clearly marked so as not to be used in
regulated animals.
Failure to provide treatment for illnesses and injuries is not consistent with adequate veterinary care. These three
animals must be examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated accordingly. Additionally, a program must be in
place to ensure that the licensee provides adequate treatment and prevention for illnesses and injuries as they are
identified during the facility's daily observations.
Correct by: 20 May 2016
2.75(b)RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***The records on hand do not accurately reflect numbers of animals at the facility. There are scattered collections
of records of goat births and acquisitions, and there are no acquisition records for 5 pigs and 9 rabbits. Additionally,
the number of cows on hand versus those listed on current records differed by at least 4 animals. Missing,
incomplete, or inaccurate records impede in the inspection process and makes animal tracking difficult to
impossible. This is especially important in the event of a disease outbreak. Correct this by maintaining accurate
records which includes birth, death, sale, and acquisition of all covered animals.
Correct from this day forward.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***A loose strand of fence wire (approximately 8 feet in length) was found in the front pasture housing goats. The
facility employee accompanying inspectors removed this wire during the inspection.
***Loose sheet metal was found lying next to the front shelter for the goats and cows in the far back pasture.
***Several nails and screws were protruding from a wooden board in front of the water receptacle for one cow in the
pasture on the right.
All of these areas are potential injury hazards to the animals and require repair to ensure their safety. Correct this
by removing the loose sheet metal, nails, and screws. Primary enclosures including all pastures must be
monitored/maintained on a regular basis to ensure they are kept free of injury hazards.
This is a repeat non-compliant item that remains uncorrected.
The inspection was conducted with petting area manager, and the exit interview was conducted with the owner's
son by Randy Coleman, ACI, and Kathy Campitelli, VMO.
