ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1135 on
31-May-17. I went to the licensee's house. A lady answered the door and informed me that the licensee was not
available. She said no one was around to be able to do the inspection with me. I told her I would try again another
day.
End of report.
