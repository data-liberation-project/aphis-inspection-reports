2.50(b)(1)(i)

Time and method of identification.
None of the dogs that are 16 weeks of age or older at the facility were wearing their official USDA identification tags. The
licensee has the tags and stated that he had them on the dogs in the past, but he had taken them off. Lack of official
USDA tags on the dogs does not allow for proper identification or trace backs of the animals. Licensee must identify all
dogs over 16 weeks of age on the premise with official USDA tags.

Housing facilities, general.
The gate to a large enclosure constructed of wire mesh fencing was observed to have a hole in the bottom corner that
was approximately 4 inches long and 4 inches high. The enclosure houses a Boston Terrier mix, a Miniature Australian
Shepherd, and a Corgi. During the inspection these 3 dogs were seen continuously sticking their heads through the hole.
Enclosures that are not properly maintained could cause injury or death to the animals or allow for the animals to escape.
Enclosures must be maintained so that they are structurally sound and free from sharp points, loose wires, and holes.
