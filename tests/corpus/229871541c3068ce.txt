FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Shelter from inclement weather. The enclosure housing 10 goats had one shelter that was approximately 72 inches
by 69.5 inches. This shelter was not big enough to house all the goats comfortably during inclement weather.
Shelter from inclement weather must be provided for all animals kept outdoors to afford them protection and to
prevent discomfort. Once APHIS officials identified the small shelter, facility personnel moved 5 of the goats to a
different enclosure with adequate shelter size. Corrected at time of inspection.
An exit briefing was conducted with the zoo director; Robert Markmann, ACI; and Mary Geib, VMO.
