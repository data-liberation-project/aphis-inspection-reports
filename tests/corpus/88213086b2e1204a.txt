CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Excessive accumulations of dog feces and food waste are present underneath the far west enclosures located in
the outdoor housing facility. There are three separated wire enclosures that contain five Pomeranians, one Bichon,
one Poodle and one Shih-Tzu. The coated wire enclosures are raised above the cement flooring and mounted on
cinder blocks stacked two high. The food and fecal waste material completely covers the surface of the cement
flooring. Numerous flies and maggots are present under the enclosures. The licensee stated that it had been about
two weeks since the excreta and food waste had been removed from underneath.
Excreta and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures daily and from under primary enclosures as
often as necessary to prevent an excessive accumulation and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors.
To be corrected by: August 26, 2016.

*The inspector completed this inspection report when Animal Care was transitioning to a new information
management system. Because the inspector re-typed the inspection report into the new system when it was
deployed, the “prepared by” date on this inspection report is different than the date the inspector prepared the
original inspection report, which occurred on August 23, 2016.
