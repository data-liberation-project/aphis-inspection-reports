Facilities, indoor.
Interior surfaces. The wooden floor of the guinea pig building and a 5.5 foot by 8 foot section of the front wooden wall are
not sealed. Surfaces that are not impervious can absorb moisture, hold odors, and do not allow adequate cleaning and
sanitization. Indoor building surfaces must be constructed and maintained so that the surfaces are impervious to moisture.
