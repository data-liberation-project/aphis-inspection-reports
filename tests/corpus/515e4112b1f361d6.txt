licensee.
At approximately 5:13 p.m. the inspector texted back, “Are you saying the inspection will not work or that the puppy
sale will not work?”
At approximately 5:21 p.m. the licensee texted the inspectors, “Inspection will not work”.
Then at approximately 5:30 p.m. the inspectors texted back, “Are you refusing an inspection at this time?”
The licensee did not respond to this text and this was the end of the text communication.
Inspectors returned to licensee facility at 5:45 p.m. and met licensee as he was going to his mailbox. The licensee
stated that they could not do the inspection at this time. Licensee stated a customer had texted that they were late
and would be coming at 6:10 PM. Inspector asked if the licensee was refusing inspection at this time. The licensee
stated that they were not refusing inspection but nobody would be available tonight for inspection. The licensee
stated that they did not want the inspectors present when the customer arrived. Inspector told the licensee that if
they were not able to inspect that it would be considered a refusal to inspect. Inspector further explained that
today’s inspection was intended to be a focused inspection and would likely be no longer than 15 minutes to check
two dogs ( previously cited on the March 21 2017 inspection report).
Unannounced inspections are required to allow APHIS officials to assess the health and welfare of the animals in
order to enforce the Animal Welfare Act regulations and standards. Failure to allow access for inspection interferes
with the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture to enforce the Animal Welfare Act. If the licensee cannot be
available during normal business hours, a person (over age 18) should be designated to accompany the inspectorduring the inspection.
From this day forward, the licensee must provide inspectors access for inspection when requested by APHIS
officials.
