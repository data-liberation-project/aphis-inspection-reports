FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Waste disposal.
There is an accumulation of cobwebs, hair and other debris hanging in between enclosures and from underneath
enclosures for the dark shed ferret raised enclosures. The waste underneath is increasing pest and odor issues due
to the amount of excreta, food waste, hair and standing water and there was a presence of maggots in the waste.
Excess excreta, food waste and other debris increases disease hazards, pests and odors. The waste must be
removed and maintained on a more frequent basis to prevent such an accumulation. Correct by July 31, 2015.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
Drainage.
There was excess water underneath the raised ferret enclosures in the dark shed housing area. The licensee stated
the water was from cleaning and refilling the water receptacles. Due to the water not being rapidly eliminated from
the dirt substrate, insects and odors have become an issue. The water, excreta, food waste and other debris
underneath the enclosures have attracted flies and maggots are now present in the accumulated waste and excess
water. A suitable sanitary method must be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water from indoor housing facilities
to reduce these risks. Correct by July 31, 2015.

SANITATION.
Pest control.
The housing area for the breeders and weaned ferrets had an excessively high number of flies present. Although fly
bait stations and traps are present throughout the area, it is not effectively managing the insect population. Insects
can spread disease, contaminate food supplies by landing on excreta and then food, and may also affect the
comfort of the animals. More effective measures must be taken to minimize the presence of these insect pests.Correct by July 27, 2015.
