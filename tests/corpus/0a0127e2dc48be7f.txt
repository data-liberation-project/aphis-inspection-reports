ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
During inspection, two dogs were observed to have problems with their eyes that were not previously discussed
with the Attending Veterinarian. The first dog was a tri colored female Shih Tzu (microchip # 900164001254712).
The dog had a reddish bulge protruding out of its right eye. The licensee noticed it two days ago, but did not
document it or contact the Attending Veterinarian. The second dog was a white female Malta-Poo (microchip #
01254625). The dog's left eye had a discharge coming out of it that was turning the fur surrounding the eye a
reddish brown color. During observation the dog was squinting and it appeared the eye was bothering the dog.
Untreated eye conditions can cause the dogs unnecessary pain and discomfort. The infection or condition can get
worse when left untreated causing further problems and if it's contagious it can spread to other dogs. The Attending
Veterinarian must be consulted with in regards to both dogs and treated per his/her instructions.

While inspecting a medicine cabinet, a bottle containing Garlic Oil was noted to have expired on 12/14. Expired
medications or other products doesn't ensure that the product is safe to use. All expired medications and products
must be discarded once they expire.
Correct immediately.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
During inspection, the licensee was asked how often he is disinfecting his primary enclosures. He informed me that
he doesn't disinfect the primary enclosures as he wasn't aware that he had to. Not disinfecting the primary
enclosures doesn't ensure that the various types of germs (such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, etc.) have been
killed and that the cage is safe to use for new incoming dogs.All primary enclosures must be disinfected once every two weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an
accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta, and other disease hazards.
Correct by 6/1/16.
Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
