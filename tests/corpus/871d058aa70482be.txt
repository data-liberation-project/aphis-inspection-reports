Watering.
A total of 23 of 29 guinea pig enclosures had dirty water bowls with feces and bedding present in the bowls. Applicant
stated that the water bowls are cleaned and fresh water is provided at least twice a day. Water receptacles must be
placed in or attached to the primary enclosures in a way that minimizes contamination from feces. Failure to keep water
receptacles clean can expose the guinea pigs to health and disease risks. Applicant must develop a method or way to
keep water receptacles clean.

This is the 1st re-license inspection for a Class A license. The inspection was conducted with the applicant and the exit
briefing was conducted with a family member.

All items must be in compliance within 2 more inspections or within 60 days of today, or the applicant will forfeit the
license fee and must wait 6 months to reapply. Please contact your inspector to schedule your next re-license inspection.

Regulated activity can continue under your existing USDA license until it expires.
