***There were at least nine outdoor enclosures housing adult dogs (Cocker Spaniels, Poodles and Yorkshire
Terriers) with shelters that did not contain adequate bedding. Some of the dogs were group housed and two dogs
were individually housed. According to the National Weather Service, the air temperature for the area at the time of
inspection (approximately 10:30am) was 18 degrees F. There was only a small amount of bedding material inside
the shelters. Some of the shelters had a thin layer of bedding that was fairly evenly distributed on the floor with
parts of the floor easily seen. A couple of the shelters had portions of the floor exposed with only a small amount of
bedding pushed up along the inside walls of the shelter. Housing dogs in enclosures without providing a sufficient
source to keep them warm increases the risk of stress, hypothermia, illness and discomfort. Shelters in outdoor
facilities for dogs must contain clean, dry, bedding material if the ambient temperature is below 50 [deg]F (10
[deg]C). Additional clean, dry bedding is required when the temperature is 35 [deg]F (1.7 [deg]C) or lower. To be
corrected by: immediately on February 2, 2015 and from this point forward.
