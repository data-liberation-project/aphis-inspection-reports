Sanitation.
There is a large accumulation of unused wood, construction materials, and general clutter stored inside the barn that
houses the sheep and goats. Additional unused materials are housed directly behind the barn. The clutter prevents
visualization around the edges of the barn to monitor for the presence of parasites and pests and provides ideal locations
for certain pests to aggregate and live. Premises where housing facilities are located, must be kept clean and free of
clutter in order to facilitate husbandry practices and to protect the animals from disease. Correct by 30 August 2022.
