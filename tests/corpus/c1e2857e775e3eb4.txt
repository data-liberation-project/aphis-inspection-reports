2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 10:55AM and
11:22AM on 16-AUG-19.
We arrived at the facility at 10:55 and called the licensee who reported he was out of town for a work appointment
and would check the afternoon schedule. He called us back at 11:22 and confirmed he had two afternoon
appointments that likely would take the rest of the afternoon. I requested future availability and the licensee said
that he would send us an updated calendar of availability.
