ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30 PM on
07/11/2016.
The licensee called on my way home. The licensee was home, but did not hear me knocking at the door and there
is no cell service to call at the facility. A plan was set up to ensure that if the licensee is at home this wont happen.
