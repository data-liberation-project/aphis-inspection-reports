2.126(b) REPEAT
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:52 p.m. on
02/05/2016. The inspector knocked at the front door of the residence and honked the horn on the GOV several
times. After no response, the inspector then called the licensee's cell phone number. The licensee stated he was
not available and wouldn't be returning home until tonight. He also stated the two authorized adults were not
available either.
