CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Housekeeping for premises.
The outdoor area where housing facilities are located is cluttered with various objects and materials. There are
wooden pallets stacked against the wire on the Bengal cat enclosure. Overgrown vegetation is in and along the
enclosure containing a domestic cat and African serval. Premises where housing facilities are located, including
buildings and surrounding grounds, must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
reduce or eliminate breeding and living areas for rodents and other pests and vermin. Premises must be kept free of
accumulations of trash, junk, waste products, and discarded matter. Weeds, grasses, and bushes must be
controlled so as to facilitate cleaning of the premises and pest control, and to protect the health and well-being of
the animals.
