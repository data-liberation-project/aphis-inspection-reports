SANITATION.
In the food preparation room, portions of the epoxy flooring do not appear to be sealed. There are several areas
along the base of the wall under a sink and a small section in the center of the room where the paint/sealant has
peeled off and the underlying material is exposed.
Surfaces which are not adequately sealed may potentially trap debris or bacterial organisms and inhibit proper
cleaning and sanitization. Kitchens and other food handling areas where animal food is prepared or stored must
have surfaces, including floors and walls, which can be readily cleaned and sanitized to ensure the health and
well-being of the animals.
