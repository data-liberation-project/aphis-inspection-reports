3.1(a) CRITICAL REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
a) Structure; construction.
An adult, male Cocker Spaniel was discovered missing from the facility 15 days prior to the inspection and had not
been found. It was last seen in the exercise pen. One of the gates in the exercise pen had a gap so wide (6-8
inches) that the latch was no longer functional. The licensee had placed a piece of plastic over the gap; however,
during the inspection the gate was not secured and easily swung open. Housing facilities that are not structurally
sound can allow animals to escape. The licensee must ensure that all housing and fencing are structurally sound
and will contain the animals securely.
3.1(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
3) Cleaning.
Most of the sheltered enclosures had an excessive amount of fecal matter in the outdoor portion of the enclosures.
The licensee uses gravel as ground cover. It had rained the night before and the fecal matter was mixed into the
gravel. Many of the dogs were not able to avoid stepping in feces. The licensee stated the fecal matter had not been
removed from these enclosures since Monday (4 days earlier). The feces in one pen was dried and covered in
mold. Enclosures which are not properly cleaned and sanitized pose a health risk to the dogs because they contain
microorganisms which can cause disease. The licensee must remove waste from enclosures on a daily basis and
replace contaminated gravel floors whenever spot cleaning is not sufficient to eliminate fecal matter.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
