3.1(c)(1)(i)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Several outdoor dog kennels had a buildup of rust on the chain link fencing. Surfaces that come in contact with
dogs and cats with excessive rust may trap dirt and debris creating a potential source of contamination and
prevents the required cleaning and sanitation. A system must be in place to ensure that all surfaces with excessive
rust must be replaced or repaired to allow for proper cleaning and sanitation of the surfaces and to prevent any
potential for structural damage.

3.1(c)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There was a worn, splintered piece of raw wood inside the kennel den box for canine, Blackjack. Surfaces made of
raw wood with worn, splintered edges cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized and may be a potential source of
contamination to the animals. A system must be in place which ensures that surfaces in contact with all dogs be
properly cleaned and maintained or replaced when worn or soiled.
