3.6(a)(2)(ix)

Primary enclosures.
The wooden structures inside of the wolf hybrid and fox pens, that were used to hold the bowls, and the wooden support
ledges at the front of the enclosures have become worn and scratched or chewed, leaving deep grooves that are
accumulating excreta and other waste material. These surfaces are no longer able to be properly cleaned and sanitized
in accordance with section 3.11(b) of this subpart. These surfaces or structures shall be repaired or replaced to facilitate
cleaning and sanitization of the enclosures thereby protecting the wolf hybrids from disease hazards. Correct by

3.13(a)(2)

Veterinary care for dogs.
There are no records to indicate all of the wolf hybrids have had a full physical exam within the past 12 months. Records
indicate that only one was examined during that time period. All wolf hybrids are required to receive full physical exams
including dental exams no less than once every 12 months. Correct by January 31, 2023
3.131(a)

Sanitation.
There is excreta, hair and waste material building up behind and between the raccoon dens and along the base of the
fencing on the ledge at the back side of the enclosures where the excreta is being washed out of the enclosures.


Incomplete washing of the enclosures and the accumulations of such material causes an increase in flies and other
disease hazard that may cause illness. When washing the enclosures the waste material shall be completely washed out
of the enclosures and away from the enclosures to protect the raccoons from disease hazard. Correct by September 12,
2022.
