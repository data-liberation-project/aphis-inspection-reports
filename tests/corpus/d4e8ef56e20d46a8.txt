2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care (PVC) is incomplete. The following information is lacking on the PVC:
1) There is no information on the dosage, frequency, and route of administration for ivermectin.
2) Section E, items 1 and 2 are not completed listing who will carry out euthanasia and the method of euthanasia to
be used.
The program of veterinary care must be complete to provide adequate guidance to the licensee and to maintain the
heath and well-being of the animals. The dosage, frequency and route administration of ivermectin, person
preforming euthanasia and the method of euthanasia must be completed on the PVC. Failure to provide a written
PVC with sufficient detail will lead to a lack of adequate veterinary care to the animals. Correct by June 20, 2016.
An exit briefing was conducted with the owner.
