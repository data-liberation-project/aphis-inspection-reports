FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The adult African crested porcupine has dug up and exposed a section of the wire fencing placed underground
near the door to her enclosure. Some sharp metal wire pieces about 4-6 inches long are exposed and sticking
straight up. The porcupine may injure herself on the points and may get a foot/leg trapped in the exposed wire
openings.
*The metal shelter structure in the sheep and camel enclosure has a loose piece of metal siding along one edge
starting near ground level and extending upwards about 18 inches. The animals may injure/cut themselves on the
sharp edge.
Outdoor housing facilities must be kept structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals.

3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The facility cancelled a previous perimeter fence request after moving the animals from one isolated barn to
enclosures closer to the house. These enclosures however are not surrounded by a six foot high perimeter fence at
least three feet away from the enclosures on all four sides. The animals currently housed include one young camel,
two African Crested porcupines, and three zebu. A perimeter fence is necessary to contain animals that may
escape their primary enclosure and to prevent unwanted animals or people from having contact with the animals.
The facility shall construct a secondary perimeter fence for the above listed animals or shall obtain a variance from
the Regional Office.
Exit conducted with undersigned facility representative.
