3.6(a)(2)(v) Critical

Primary enclosures.
On December 25, 2022, when two wolf/hybrids were returned to their primary enclosure, the owner failed to close the
gate securely to prevent escape. These two wolf/hybrids were able to come in contact with a smaller wolf/hybrid that was
housed in an adjacent enclosure. The smaller wolf/hybrid’s right, front leg was significantly injured to the point that the
limb required amputation. The enclosure gate was not maintained properly so that it could contain the wolf/hybrids
securely and protect other wolf/hybrids from injury.
A method to ensure that gates are appropriately secured should be implemented to protect the wolf/hybrids from injury.
Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they protect the wolf/hybrids from injury and contain them
securely.

TO BE CORRECTED FROM THIS DAY FORWARD: JANUARY 20, 2023
