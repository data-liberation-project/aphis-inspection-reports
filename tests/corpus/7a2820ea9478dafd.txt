ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The adult, male tiger with the name Star has a small, red, growth on the lower, right eyelid. The keeper noticed the
growth on December 10, 2017. The attending veterinarian has not been contacted concerning this growth since it
was noticed.
Each exhibitor shall establish and maintain programs of veterinary care that include daily observations. These
observations can be conducted by someone other than the attending veterinarian as long as there is a mechanism
of direct and frequent communication with the veterinarian on problems of animal health and well-being.
The veterinarian must be notified promptly of any health problems with animals held at the facility.
Correct by end of business today.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Zoo Director.
