ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***There was no Program of Veterinary Care available for review at the time of the inspection.
The written Program of Veterinary Care is needed to ensure that the facility understands the expectations of the
attending veterinarian in regards to the veterinary care of regulated animals. It outlines preventive veterinary care
practices, such as deworming and vaccinations. The facility should ensure that the written program of veterinary
care is available for review during all USDA inspections.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
***An adult, male, Dromedary camel, Zo, has a large growth on his chest pad that is irregular in shape,
approximately 4 inches by 8 inches extending approximately 6 inches down from the body wall. The growth had
numerous flies crawling on it. At the time of inspection, the licensee was still unable to provide documentation of a
physical exam, diagnosis, or treatment plan provided by the attending veterinarian.
***An intact adult male tricolor goat that had been non-weight bearing on his right front leg during the APHIS
inspection on March 9, 2017 was observed during this inspection to still be non-weight bearing on this limb. The
most recent veterinary exam occurred on May 27, 2017. The attending veterinarian recommended in his
documentation that 1) more diagnostic work needs to be done (radiographs, bloodwork, appropriate serology), or 2)
if the facility representatives do not want to proceed with more diagnostics then it is his recommendation to cull the
animal. To date, the licensee has not followed the veterinary recommendations.
***A brown and white female goat has overgrown right front and right hind hooves. Additionally, she was exhibiting
an abnormal gait with her hind legs. She was walking in a stiff manner on her hind limbs.
***Five goats and three pigs have overgrown hooves due to a lack of recent hoof trimming. Failure to appropriatelymaintain hooves can cause gait abnormalities which can be painful or cause injuries. As part of the facility’s
program of preventative veterinary care, the licensee must ensure that all animals receive appropriate hoof care in a
timely manner.
***A adult black goat had an area of hair loss underneath the left eye. The hairless region was white and the skin
was dry and flaky. This area was swollen compared to the same area underneath the right eye.
***An adult female Fennec fox, Foxy, has hair loss over the knuckles of all four feet and has excessively long nails
that need to be trimmed.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan.
Additionally, the facility must ensure the availability of emergency, weekend, and holiday care for all of the animals
at the facility. The animals mentioned above must be examined by a veterinarian to obtain accurate diagnosis and
appropriate treatment plans for the problems cited above. From this date forward, the licensee must ensure that all
animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the attending veterinarian and the
program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall include the use of appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
***At the time of inspection, the facility representatives were unable to locate any animal records. They were unable
to present the records that contained the required information regarding the acquisition and disposition of animals,
as well as a record of "animals on hand".
Records containing the required information for animals acquired for use in regulated activities, including those
offspring born on premise, are necessary in order to accurately track animals being used in regulated activities to
ensure their humane care and use. Records must be maintained that fully disclose the acquisition and disposition of
animals whether purchased, owned, held, born on premises, or leased. They shall include the age or birth date of
the animals, their acquisition date, the name and address of the person from whom the animals were obtained or to
whom they are sold, the number of animals, species, USDA license number or registration (if licensed). A record of
the animals on hand shall be created, maintained and made available for review during USDA inspections.

2.131(d)(2) REPEAT
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.***The public is permitted to walk directly up the primary enclosures and feed the animals. There are no barriers or
signs present to discourage public contact and the guests are encouraged to feed food that is sold on the premises.
There was only one attendant present during this inspection and when APHIS inspectors arrived at the facility, she
was inside the office with a member of the public. At that time, three visitors were seen to be petting and feeding the
sheep. The attendant failed to supervise the visitors’ interaction with the animals.
Continued unattended public contact does not ensure safe public interaction with these animals. Licensees must
ensure that during periods of public exhibition, a responsible, knowledgeable employee or attendant is present at all
times during periods of public contact.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***In an enclosure housing nine goats, two portions of the chain linked fencing were in disrepair. The bottom of the
chain linked fence along two opposing sides of the enclosure was not secured to the ground, creating a gap
between the bottom of the fence and the ground. The sharp points at the bottom of the fence were facing into the
enclosure where the animals could come into contact with them.
***A portion of the ceiling of the coati enclosure was in disrepair. Several of the wires were broken, creating gaps in
the structure. Additionally, there were loose metal wires with sharp points that were protruding into the enclosure.
These damaged wires are in close proximity to the top of the coati’s night house, where the animal was observed to
be laying during the inspection.
***On the bottom of the back side of the nesting box in the coati enclosure there were several exposed screw tips
that could injure the coati.
***The fencing surrounding the enclosure of one male camel, “Humphrey,” was in disrepair. Parts of the enclosure
consisted entirely of four metal cables that were strung horizontally in order to contain the camel. The bottom most
strand of cable was loose in some areas and either hanging low or entirely on the ground. These structural issues
cause the fence to be less effective in containment of the animal and can lead to entrapment or escape of the
animal. Other portions of the enclosure had a wire mesh surrounding the metal cable. This wire was not securely
fastened to the fence either at the top of the bottom in numerous areas, allowing it to curl and fold over, creating
gaps and sharp points that were pointing into the enclosure.
***An enclosure that housed both sheep and goats had a broken wood board that was hanging down into the
enclosure. The edges of the broken wood boards were jagged and splintered, and were directly exposed to the
animals in the enclosure and present a risk of injury.
***An enclosure that housed eighteen sheep had broken metal fencing with sharp points and broken wooden boardswith jagged, splintered edges. There were gaps in both the metal and wooden fencing that were large enough for
the animals’ horns, head, or limbs, could become stuck.
***In the enclosure housing two pigs, there was an exposed nail head on the lower portion of the night house that
was pointing outward where the pigs could easily come into contact with the edge.
***An enclosure housing one Dromedary camel, “Coco,” contained sharp points and had fencing in disrepair. Metal
wires, which were in place to tie wooden boards to the bottom of the chain linked fence for support, had sharp
points that were protruding out into the enclosure. A segment of the lower portion of the chain linked fence on the
opposite side of the enclosure was not secured to the cable running along the ground. This created gaps between
the ground and the chain linked fencing large enough for the animal’s limb to become entrapped.
***An enclosure that housed a Dromedary camel, “Pinkie,” had fencing in disrepair. A metal wire panel was attached
to a portion of the fencing separating “Pinkie’s” enclosure from the enclosure containing two adult female
Dromedary camels, “Freya” and “Alexa”. The top of this wire was damaged, creating sharp points that pointed
upward and outward, into the enclosure containing “Freya” and “Alexa”.
***In an enclosure housing seventeen sheep, a portion of the metal fencing material, along the bottom, was bowing
out of the base of the pen. This has created a gap large enough for the animal's horns or head to become stuck and
therefore poses the risk of injury to animals in the enclosure.
***In an enclosure housing seventeen sheep, one of the metal legs stabilizing the shade structure was severely
rusted, creating sharp edges which could injure the animals, as well as potentially affecting the stability of the
structure.
***In an enclosure housing seven goats a portion of the wire fencing was in disrepair. The lower edges of the metal
fence was bent upward with sharp points protruding toward the animals that could cause injuries.
***In an enclosure housing seven goats, there was an exposed screw head on the lower portion of a wood structure
in the exhibit that could come into contact with the animals.
***The enclosure housing nine goats in the barn had rust along the lower parts of the metal walls, which extended
up the wall at least 10 inches in height in some areas. The rusted metal exposed many areas of jagged, splintered
pieced of wood underneath. In the areas where the metal was rusted through, sharp metal edges were created and
pointed into the enclosure.
***There was a hole in the floor along one side of the indoor enclosure housing nine goats. The hole was several
feet long and approximately 2 feet deep. A facility representative had placed a wooden beam across the hole,
however, portions of the hole remained uncovered and were large enough for an animal to become entrapped orinjured.
***In an enclosure housing fifteen goats, several panels of the chain linked fencing were in disrepair. The bottom of
the chain linked fence was not secured to the ground, creating a gap between the bottom of the fence and the
ground. The sharp points at the bottom of the fence were facing into the enclosure where the animals could come
into contact with them.
***In the enclosure housing fifteen goats, there was a blue plastic bin in the middle of the pen. This bin was cracked,
had holes, and broken sides with jagged edges which could injure the animals.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, holes, and gaps/openings in
order to protect the animals from injury. A system of facility monitoring and maintenance should be in place and to
ensure all animal facilities are structurally sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or escape.
3.127(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***An enclosure containing two adult camels, “Freya” and “Alexa” did not have adequate shade to protect the two
animals from direct sunlight.
The areas of shade provided were not large enough to allow both of the animals within the enclosure to be
protected from direct sunlight. During the inspection, the shade structure provided two small strips of shade inside
the enclosure, however the majority of the shade provided was outside of the enclosure and not benefitting the
animals. At the time of inspection, the temperature registered on the Kestrel 4000 was 81.2 degrees Fahrenheit.
Inadequate protection from direct sunlight may lead to overheating or discomfort from squinting. Sufficient shade by
natural or artificial means shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct
sunlight.
3.127(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***There were pools of standing water around the water receptacle in an enclosure containing one zebu and two
sheep. The animals were unable to drink from the receptacle without standing in the mud.
***In an enclosure containing two adult water buffalo, the area surrounding the water receptacle consisted of mud
and pools of standing water. The animals were unable to drink from the receptacle without standing on the wet
ground. The plastic water receptacle had a large rip in the material, which caused the receptacle to continuously
leak, creating the standing water. Standing water can pose a health risk to the animals as it can contain bacteria and parasites. Additionally, animals
standing in water for excess periods of time are at risk for foot/hoof rot. The facility must have a suitable method to
prevent the water from initially accumulating in the enclosure or rapidly eliminate excess water from the enclosure.
3.127(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***Near the camel enclosure, containing “Camela” and her baby, a portion of the perimeter fence is approximately
five feet tall.
***Near the eland enclosure, a large portion of the perimeter fence is in disrepair. One of the metal poles stabilizing
the chain link is leaning outward, away from the property at approximately a 30 degree slant. Another metal
stabilizing pole is leaning inward. Along one section of the fence, the metal bar at the top of the fence is broken into
two pieces.
*** At the front of the property, near the mini-hinny and sheep enclosure, an approximately 100 foot long segment of
the perimeter fence is less than 6 feet tall.
***Near the enclosure containing the coati, a tree is leaning on the perimeter fence.
All of the issues cited above decrease the efficacy of the perimeter fence to function as a secondary containment
system for the regulated animals and to protect them from outside animals entering the premises. The perimeter
fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals and unauthorized
persons from having contact with the animals, and so it can function as a secondary containment system. It must be
of sufficient distance from the outside of the primary enclosure to prevent physical contact between animals inside
the enclosure and animals or persons outside the perimeter fence.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
***A gopher carcass was observed to be lying in an enclosure housing seven goats. A dead animal has the potential
to transmit disease to the regulated animals. The facility representative removed the carcass at the time of
inspection.
***In the enclosure housing twelve goats, there was a bundle of baling twine on the ground. This is a hazard, as the
twine could be consumed by the animals in the enclosure.
***In an enclosure containing five goats, baling twine was used to tie panels of the metal fencing together. Fivestrands of the twine were running into the enclosure along the ground. This twine could be consumed by the
animals in the enclosure.
***In the barn housing nine goats, an accumulation of cobwebs was present in the corners of the enclosure and on
the feeders. Cobwebs can be areas for harboring pests which can affect the health of the regulated animals and
may be an indication of substandard husbandry practices.
Animal enclosures must be kept clean and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate good
husbandry practices. A regular program of housekeeping in and around all animal enclosures needs to be
implemented and maintained.
