2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
An adult male Yorkie named Mackey had a golf-ball sized collection of dried fecal matter trapped in the matted hair below
his tail. Matted hair can result in skin and/or eye problems, can collect foreign material, can be painful, and can
compromise the hair’s ability to provide protection from the heat or cold. The licensee must establish an effective
program of haircoat maintenance.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JANUARY 12, 2022. NOTE: The licensee removed the fecal matter from this dog's haircoat
during the inspection and scheduled a visit for his groomer for later in the day.
2.50(a)(2)

Time and method of identification.
A litter of three Yorkie puppies less than 16 weeks of age did not have any form of identification. Appropriate identification
of dogs is necessary to meet recordkeeping requirements for inventory, disposition, transport, and healthcare
documentation. The licensee must properly identify puppies with an acceptable form of identification, which include a
cage card (if litters are not comingled), a microchip, a collar and tag, or a plastic-type collar with the required information
legibly written.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JANUARY 15, 2022.


3.6(a)(2)(ix)

Primary enclosures.
Many of the metal wire doors of the primary enclosures on both the inside and outside of the sheltered building had
excessive rust that caused severe pitting of the wire. Excessive rust prevents adequate cleaning and sanitization of metal
surfaces, which can allow the growth of organisms that can cause disease in the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all
surfaces in contact with the dogs can be readily cleaned and sanitized in accordance with § 3.11(b) of this subpart, or be
replaced when worn or soiled.
TO BE CORRECTED BY FEBRUARY 10, 2022.
3.9(b)

Feeding
At least four metal self-feeders in the shelter building were severely rusted. These food receptacles contained dog food
and were currently in use by at least four adult dogs. Surfaces with excessive rust cannot be adequately cleaned and
sanitized which can allow the growth of organisms that are harmful to dogs. The licensee must ensure that food
receptacles are maintained in a condition that allows adequate cleaning and sanitization.
TO BE CORRECTED BY JANUARY 15, 2022.

The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee on January 10, 2022. The inspection report was hand
delivered on January 11, 2022, and another exit briefing was conducted.
