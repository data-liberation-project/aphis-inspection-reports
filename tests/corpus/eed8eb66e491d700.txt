ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A white Russian hamster was in distress during the time of inspection. The hamster was found in an enclosure
laying on its side. The hamster's was missing fur and tissue (a hole approximately one inch in diameter) on the
back of its neck. A portion of the spine and muscle were visible through the lesion. The hamster did not move and
was observed breathing for several minutes before it died.
The hamster was housed with two other Russian hamsters that have fur loss on their bodies. Both hamsters were
intermittently scratching themselves. The tissue on both animals appeared to be reddened. A facility employee
indicated that these two hamsters were segregated into their current enclosure approximately two weeks ago
because of their condition. The three hamsters were occupied an enclosure marked "sick animals". The facility has
not contacted the veterinarian regarding the condition of these animals.
Assure that all veterinary care issues are promptly communicated to the veterinarian. Follow through with any
instructions from the veterinarian.
To be corrected: The facility shall contact the veterinarian regarding the condition of the two Russian hamsters by11-7-14
