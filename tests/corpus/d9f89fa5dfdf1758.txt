2.33(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
*** The Health Check Log for the marmosets indicate that a marmoset named "Pat" was noted to be "moving more
slowly than usual" on 5/31/14. On several occasions between 5/31 and 6/7/14, further notations indicated that "Pat"
continued to move more slowly than usual and, at one time, appeared "shaky". Beginning 6/8 until the time of this
inspection (6/10) no further comments regarding "Pat's" health were made and apparently the animal is presently
doing OK; however, for the health and well-being of the animals at a facility, it is important that when daily
observations are made by someone other than the attending veterinarian there be a mechanism of direct and
frequent communication with the attending veterinarian regarding problems of health, behavior and well-being.
From 5/31 until the time of this inspection there does not appear to have been a communication mechanism, as
described above, in place.
Correct by 6/16/14
NOTE - This inspection was conducted on 6/10/14 and 6/11/14.

An exit interview with facility personnel was held on 6/12/14.
