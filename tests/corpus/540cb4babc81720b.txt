FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
A reindeer cow (white with brown spots) housed outdoors with two other reindeer was seen to be panting during the
inspection. Atmospheric temperature was 93.7 degrees F (per Kestrel reading) at the time of the inspection and,
though these 3 animals had access to a shade structure, it was at the far end of their enclosure. These 3 reindeer
were noted to spend most of their time in an "alleyway' between their enclosure and an adjacent enclosure housing
4 other reindeer. Since these animals are best acclimated to colder climates, sufficient shade is necessary to their
comfort and health. Panting is not a normal presentation in this species and indicates this reindeer was
uncomfortable at the time of the inspection and that additional shade or more accessible access to shade was
necessary.
When sunlight is likely to cause overheating or discomfort of the animals, sufficient shade by natural or artificial
means shall be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight.
The licensee did move the shade structure closer to the adjacent reindeer pen and will restrict the group of 3
reindeer from the "alleyway" between the enclosures so they can better utilize this shade structure but still remain in
sight of the other 4 reindeer.
Corrected during the inspection.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the licensee.
