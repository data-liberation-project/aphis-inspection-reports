INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The search for alternatives for antibody production in animals is not current. The search was performed in October
2007 and included dates from 1992-2004. The search did not specifically investigate the potential pain and distress
of repeated anesthetized cardiac bleeds in a guinea pig.
It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that pain and distress are minimized to the greatest extent possible.
Failure to question the use of repeated, invasive, potentially painful procedures (cardiac bleeds), and investigate the
use of viable alternative procedures, can result in unnecessary pain and distress for the animals under study. The
IACUC should ensure that procedures involving animals will avoid or minimize discomfort, distress, and pain to the
animals.

INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) did not adequately review animal activities being
performed under the guinea pig protocol.
The IACUC approved protocol specified that serum would be collected by venipuncture, collecting 1-3 mls at a time
under anesthesia. The facilities' Guinea Pig Care & Use SOP referenced in the protocol does not describe
venipuncture as a route of blood collection in guinea pigs. The SOP describes cardiac bleeding under anesthesia.
The approved protocol referenced the guinea pig SOP for specifics of blood collection, which specified that two
technicians are required to perform anesthetized cardiac blood draws on guinea pigs. During inspection, a single
technician was observed performing cardiac blood draws under anesthesia on guinea pigs.
Adequate IACUC review of animal use is necessary to ensure that activities involving animals are being conducted
appropriately. The IACUC should make certain that all activities relating to the care and use of animals receiveadequate oversight and are conducted in accordance with the approved protocol and the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct from this day forward.
2.31(e)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
The IACUC approved protocol for Guinea Pigs did not contain a complete description of the proposed use of
animals. The protocol specifies venipuncture for blood collection, with a terminal cardiac bleed yielding more blood
as an approved study end-point and references an SOP that describes cardiac bleeds, not venipuncture. There is
no detail regarding the frequency and duration of blood collection in the protocol or the SOP to determine the impact
on the animals.
Review of the IACUC approved project starts with animal numbers did not include the bleed schedules, blood
collection procedures and duration of the project. The IACUC is not able to review a complete description of the
use of the animals without this information. The project schedules were reviewed for several projects, documenting
that animals are bled via cardiac bleed every two weeks after injections of antigen.
It is the responsibility of the IACUC to ensure that the investigator provides a complete description of proposed
activities that involve the use of animals in order that these activities may be adequately reviewed and determined
to be in accordance with the Animal Welfare Act. A system should be in place to ensure that a complete description
of each procedure is provided to the IACUC.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
Over the last two years, a total of four animals have been found dead in their enclosures in conjunction with recent
cardiac bleeds and a gross necropsy has been performed. The two earlier animals were found dead the day after a
cardiac bleed was performed and the cause of death was recorded as a cardiac tear in July of 2015 (12 previous
cardiac bleeds) and July of 2016 (26 previous cardiac bleeds). In the last four months, two animals have been
found dead in their enclosures. On 23 January 2017, animal 764 (38 previous cardiac bleeds) was found dead, 12
days after the last cardiac bleed on 11 January 2017 and the necropsy noted "Thorax noted w/ hemorrhage.
Cardiac tampanade. Spontaneous myocardial rupture". On 22 April 2017, animal 781 (4 previous cardiac bleeds)
was found dead, 3 days after a cardiac bleed on 19 April 2017 and the necropsy noted "pericardial sac full of
hemorrhage - secondary to needle sticks most likely".
This recent increase in unexpected mortality related to cardiac abnormalities on necropsy in animals undergoingrepeated cardiac bleeds is a change in the previous pattern. Adequate veterinary care includes guidance regarding
the care and use of animals during the conduct of research. Repeated anesthetized cardiac bleeds is not a widely
used method for survival blood collection in guinea pigs and in conjunction with the recent animal deaths after 4-38
cardiac bleeds in individual animals, additional guidance needs to be provided by the veterinarian regarding the
care and use of animals.

This inspection was conducted with facility representatives over several days. The exit interview was conducted
over the phone.
