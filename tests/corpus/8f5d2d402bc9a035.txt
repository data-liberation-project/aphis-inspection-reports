2.38(f)(1)
MISCELLANEOUS.
In September 2013 a rabbit on an IACUC approved protocol died within a half hour after use and transport. The
rabbit was transported in an IACUC approved transport container in a personal vehicle to a collaborating institution
for use on a training protocol. The trip is an approximately 5 minute drive. Two rabbits are utilized 3-4 times yearly
by the collaborating institution for about 1.5 hours, then returned. A registered veterinary technician facility
employee transports the rabbits and accompanies them while at the collaborating institution.
Upon return to the facility, the rabbit was placed into its home enclosure. No significant behavioral or physical
deficiencies were noted in the rabbit at that time. About ½ hour later, the rabbit was found dead. Necropsy
performed was non-diagnostic for cause of death.

The weather on the day of the incident was hot. Though the personal vehicle had a working air conditioning system
that was used, the IACUC determined that heat stress may have been a contributing factor in the rabbit(cid:25)'s death.
Therefore, a new policy on animal transportation was developed. Animals are no longer transported in personal
vehicles or in the old enclosure system. New rabbit transport enclosures were purchased which include individual
filters and ventilation fans for each animal. A dedicated animal transport van was purchased by the facility which
provides a more climate controlled environment.

The rabbit(cid:25)'s death is a serious animal welfare impact. The most likely contributing problem was immediately
identified and the facility has taken corrective action to prevent recurrence. Handling of all animals shall be done as
expeditiously and carefully as possible to prevent trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress,
physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
