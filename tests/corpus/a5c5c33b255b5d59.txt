OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
***Shelter from the elements***
An adult German Shepherd in the northwest corner of the kennel area was provided a igloo type shelter. This
shelter had a large entrance with no additional structures surrounding that reduced the potential for wind and rain to
enter the shelter. All outside shelters must have structures in place or be placed such to reasonably reduce the
amount of wind and rain that enters the shelter to be minimal. Wet bedding and wind are not beneficial during times
that conservation of body heat is necessary and should be reduced or eliminated. To be corrected by: 11/24/14
This inspection and exit interview was conducted with the owner. The report is being sent via email.
