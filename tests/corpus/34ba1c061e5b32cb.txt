3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
There were two containers of bedding for dogs that were lidded yet not leakproof.

Containers of bedding that are not leakproof does not fully protect the bedding from spoilage, contamination, and vermin
infestation, which can cause disease hazards in dogs.

All open supplies of bedding must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids to prevent contamination and
spoilage.
3.1(f)

Housing facilities, general.
There was a trash container in the housing facility that did not have a lid on it.

Keeping trash containers without lids on them does not fully minimize contamination and disease risks in the animal
housing facility, creating the potential for disease hazards in dogs.



Trash containers in housing facilities and in food storage and food preparation areas must be leak-proof and must have
tightly fitted lids on them at all times.
