2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The attending veterinarian has visited the facility and completed a new written program of veterinary care since the
last inspection. However, the new plan is still lacking some details important in ensuring delivery of adequate
veterinary care to the animals. The following information needs to be addressed in the program: the frequency of
visits by the vet to the facility, route of administration for euthanasia drugs, information regarding TB testing of
non-human primates, dosages for ivermectin administration for the multiple species at the facility and whether
"twice yearly" under the internal parasite section refers to fecal testing or treatment, and the contact information for
a veterinarian for emergency care. The facility representative states that she has not yet contacted the attending
veterinarian to update the program since the last inspection and the current written program is the same one
reviewed at the last inspection. Lack of detail in the written program of veterinary care can lead to lack of adequate
veterinary care for the animals. The facility shall, with their attending veterinarian, complete a written program of
veterinary care that includes all aspects of veterinary care needed for the animals at the facility.
3.81 REPEAT
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
Since the last inspection, the facility has developed an environment enhancement plan for the marmoset. The
attending veterinarian has not approved/signed off on the current plan. The facility representative states that she
has not yet contacted the attending veterinarian to review and approve the plan since the last inspection and the
current written plan is the same one reviewed at the last inspection This plan must be in accordance with currently
accepted professional standards, must specifically at a minimum address social grouping, environmental
enrichment and all special considerations and must be directed by the attending veterinarian.
This is a focused inspection on the areas cited on the previous inspection report.
Exit with undersigned facility representative.
