ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Yorkie #006 has severe dental disease, with excessive tartar built up and gums that bleed with gentle
manipulation of the mouth. Several teeth on the lower right jaw are loose and cemented together with the tartar
build-up. Dental disease can be painful, can reduce the dog's ability or willingness to eat, and can cause infection
in other areas of the body that can become severe if left untreated. This dog must be examined by the attending
veterinarian and treated accordingly.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee did not adequately observe the condition of the Yorkie female listed above and communicate with the
veterinarian the status of the dog's health and well-being. Lack of effective observations and subsequent direct and
frequent communication with the veterinarian does not ensure adequate veterinary care is provided. The licensee
must establish an effective method of daily health and behavior observations, as well as direct and frequent
communication with the veterinarian regarding the health status of the animals.
Correct by: from this time forward.
Inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee by the undersigned VMO.
