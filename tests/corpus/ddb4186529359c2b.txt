ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1237 on
04-Apr-17.
Inspector arrival to facility at 1237. No answer at door and no person visible on premise. Contacted phone #s listed
in ACIS for owner contact. Spoke with licensee (PA). PA stated that there would not be anyone available on
premise until after 5 pm and that they (the licensee) had planned to cancel their license and would not be resuming
their business. I recommended the licensee contact the Ft Collins Office prior to having a 3rd attempted inspection
if they were no longer continuing in business. Left premises at 1310 following leaving my card and optimal hours
information sheet in storm door (note: no visible or auditory signs of an active kennel on premise at time of
attempted inspection)
