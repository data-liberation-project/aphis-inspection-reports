2.31(c)(7)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Protocol 2014-04, reviewed and approved by the IACUC describes use of the anti-cholinergic medication Atropine
pre-operatively. Animal records indicate that a different anti-cholinergic medication (Glycopyrrolate) is currently
being used. This medication is commonly used in veterinary medicine, although the currently used medication is not
described in the protocol.

Significant changes regarding the care and use of animals in ongoing activities, including changes in medications
used for major procedures outlined in a protocol, must receive IACUC review and approval prior to implementation.
The above changes and all future significant changes must be reviewed by the IACUC to ensure appropriate IACUC
oversight as required under the Animal Welfare Act.
Correct by next procedure.
