2.40(a)(1) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The written program of veterinary care still does not include bobcats. Bobcats are now present at the facility. It is
essential that these animals be included in the program of veterinary care. Veterinary recommendations for care of
these animals should be included in the program. APHIS inspectors then use this information while inspecting the
animals in order to determine if veterinary recommendations are being followed by the facility. This program is a
valuable tool in order to ensure the continuing health and comfort of these animals. Bobcats need to be included on
the program of veterinary care.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The primary enclosure housing three foxes still has several areas of the wire lining the enclosure exposed by the
digging of the foxes. Some of this wire has broken with exposed points and is an injury hazard. A section of
exposed wire along the front of the enclosure has a gap that could allow a fox to escape. It is possible that a fox
could escape or become trapped or injured by the broken wire while attempting to escape. This enclosure needs
immediate repair to contain and protect the foxes housed in it.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The produce cooler contains spoiled produce. Raspberries covered with white mold, cucumbers with big white mold
spots, and cauliflower with dark spots were all present in the food produce cooler. Molding and deteriorating
squash, jalapenos, a water melon and pumpkin were also in the produce cooler. Spoiled produce must be removed
promptly to prevent contamination of food intended to be fed to the animals. Sort and remove spoiled produce
promptly. This cooler needs to be cleaned and have spoiled and deteriorating items removed in order to prevent
contamination of food items that will be fed to the animals.
3.125(d) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL. Bones old bedding and food waste is on the ground outside the door to the service area for the lion and the tiger JJ.
This material had been removed from their den areas. A cart of fecal material was present in the lama enclosure.
Food and fecal waste needs to be removed promptly in order to minimize odors, vermin infestation and disease
hazards. Remove this and all other waste materials in a prompt manner.
3.127(d) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The president of the facility was not on site at the time of the inspection and had to be contacted to return to the
facility. This took approximately 30 minutes. The perimeter fence gate near the primary residence of the property
had been left standing open. This gate is located about 20 yards from the primary drive to the property. The
perimeter fence gate near the grizzly bear enclosure was not locked. The lock had been set to appear that it was
locked but when the inspector pulled on the lock it came open. The president of the facility stated that he had
unlocked it earlier in the day. This gate is located on the far side of the compound at least two hundred yards away
from and not visible from the primary residence. This facility gives guided tours only and so public barriers for the
dangerous animal enclosures are in conjunction with the tour guides to keep patrons safe. Barrier gates were in
place and locked for all dangerous animals but it would still be possible for unauthorized members of the public to
climb these barriers and have contact with dangerous animals through their primary enclosure fences. The
perimeter fence gates must be kept locked when not under direct supervision. Contact with these dangerous
animals could be potentially fatal to a member of the public. It could lead to lethal consequences for the animals as
well, if local health officials would require rabies testing. This test requires removal of the brain. These perimeter
gates need to be kept locked at all times that they are not in direct observation by an employee of the facility in
order to ensure that members of the public do not enter without supervision.
There are several cooler wall units stacked within two feet of the perimeter fence. If an animal does escape from its
primary enclosure it could easily breach the perimeter fence by leaping over it using this stack of cooler walls as a
platform. Relocate these wall units away from the perimeter fence.
3.129(a) REPEAT
FEEDING.
An opened bag of pig food was noted in the produce cooler. Opened bags of food need to be placed in covered
containers to prevent possible contamination or infestation with pests. Opened feed that is accessible to rodents
also serves to attract them to the facility. This is very important at this facility as it is overrun with rodents.
Numerous rodent holes were present throughout the facility and a rat and mouse were both seen by inspectors
during the course of inspection. Rodent feces has been observed by the inspectors in this produce cooler on a
previous inspection. Rodents can be carriers of disease which may be harmful to animals at this facility.3.130 REPEAT
WATERING.
The water receptacle for the enclosure containing the tiger known as Sher Kahn had a green algae scum lining its
interior. It also had what appeared to be tiger feces floating in it. The water receptacle in the enclosure housing
one fox had a layer of algae scum lining its interior. These receptacles are not being kept clean and sanitary. Dirty
water receptacles can affect water palatability. It can also lead to contamination of the water by pathogenic
organisms. Water palatability is very important as poor water palatability can lead to decreased consumption.
Decreased water consumption can lead to renal function problems. The majority of the large cats at this facility are
advanced in age, making them especially susceptible to kidney problems. Clean this water receptacle. Clean all
water receptacles as often as need to keep the water clean.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
There was excessive feces in the enclosures housing the tigers, Xena, Sher Kahn and Sundar. The Asian black
bear enclosure contained excessive fecal material. This fecal material was turning white an indication to the
inspectors that it had been present in the enclosure for some time. The enclosure housing the white tiger contained
excessive fecal material. The enclosure housing three alpacas contained excessive fecal material. These
enclosures need to be cleaned on a more frequent basis. The fecal material present in these animals'(cid:25) enclosures
can contaminate these animals as they lay in their enclosures. The animals can ingest this material when they
groom themselves. Ingesting this fecal material can lead to potential health problems. Clean these enclosures
more frequently to prevent a buildup of fecal material to minimize odors and prevent potential health problems.
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
The alleyway leading to the butcher area as well as the buildings along this alleyway is filled with various trash,
debris, fencing pipe and old equipment. The area directly outside the building housing the butcher area and the
alleyway and building next to the butcher area are also filled with various debris, old equipment, boards, trash,
buckets, tires and fencing. These areas provide ample hiding areas for rodents and other pests. Numerous rodent
holes were located throughout the facility. A rat was seen in the butcher area used to prepare the meat fed to the
big cats and a mouse was seen in the warm room area. All this material must be removed to help control the rodent
infestation of this property.
3.131(d) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Numerous rodent holes were located throughout the facility. Rodent holes were noted in the enclosure for the tigerXena as well as the den area for this enclosure, located on leopard row. The empty enclosure on leopard row
contained rodent holes. Rodent holes were seen in the service area for the tiger Pandora's enclosure and the tigers
Lenny and Squiggy's enclosure. A rodent hole was noted in the service area for the lion and the tiger JJ. A rodent
hole was noted going under the shelter box of the Asian black bear enclosure. Numerous rodent holes were seen
near the white tiger enclosure. Rodent holes were seen going under the den for the cougar enclosure. Rodent
holes were also seen inside the den area for the cougar enclosure. A live rat was seen by the inspector in the meat
butchering area. A live mouse was seen by both inspectors in the warm room. Rodents can be carriers of disease
which may be harmful to the animals housed in these areas. A more effective means of pest control must be
established for the facility.
3.132 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
It is evident that due to the nature and severity of the animal husbandry issues at the facility that there is a lack of
adequately trained employees. The facility relies on volunteer workers. The president of the facility stated to
APHIS inspectors that there was no formalized scheduling of workers at the facility. A lack of properly trained
employees can result in facility and animal conditions that result in unnecessary animal suffering. Animal numbers
must be reduced or more properly trained workers need to be added. Workers need to be trained in the basic
needs of the animals at the facility. Topics should include at a minimum: the importance of adequate water, the
need for adequate bedding during times of extreme weather, the importance of cleaning and good housekeeping
procedures, proper diet for different species of animals and observation of animals for abnormal conditions and
behaviors. This training should be done in conjunction with the attending veterinarian or his designee. A list of
topics covered and attendees must be documented for review by APHIS. A facility schedule needs to be developed
that allows for adequate employee coverage in order to address all animal husbandry needs. Also the facility
president is the only one authorized to work with the dangerous animals at the facility. All animal work must be
done with the dangerous animals under his direct supervision. This limits the amount of time that is available to
service the dangerous animal enclosures as the facility president is often offsite. This leads to poor sanitation in the
dangerous animal enclosures. The facility president needs to find a way to be onsite more or hire trained staff to
help run the facility.
This inspection was conducted with the facility president on 11-4-14. An exit interview was conduct at that time and
all non-compliant items were explained to the president. A formal exit interview was conducted with the facility
president on 11-6-14.
