ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 2:05 PM on
16-Sep-19.
No one was at the facility. Called and texted the cell phone number. The licensee returned my call. The licensee
was out of town acquiring supplies and unable to return for inspection.
