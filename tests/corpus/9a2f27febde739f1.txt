SANITATION.
An abundance of dried urine scale is located on the back wall of the enclosure containing four chinchillas. The urine
scale appears to be leaking from the floor of the rabbit enclosure located directly above the chinchillas. The urine
scale is accessible to the chinchillas. Urine scale can harbor disease causing hazards that affect animals.
Clean the urine scale from the chinchilla enclosure to promote animal health.
