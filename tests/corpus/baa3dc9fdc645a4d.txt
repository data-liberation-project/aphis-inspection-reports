FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
***One Dromedary camel does not have a perimeter fence. Currently, the perimeter fence for the facility is acting
as a portion of the primary enclosure fence for the camel. The licensee must ensure that all non-dangerous animals
have a secondary perimeter fence of at least 6 feet in height around the primary enclosure fencing. This is required
to ensure a secondary containment system for the animals should they escape their primary enclosures and also to
keep unwanted animals and people out of primary enclosures. Correct this by ensure a functional perimeter fence
is in place for all animals.

FEEDING.
*** This facility does not have a written feeding plan for the large felids on the property. A written plan approved by
the attending veterinarian is required to ensure the special dietary needs for these large carnivores is documented
and followed by the facility. This plan must include guidance for supplements to be added to the diet if a complete
commercial diet is not being fed to the animals. Correct this by contacting the attending veterinarian to develop and
approve this plan.
