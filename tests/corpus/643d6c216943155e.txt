PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
On Thursday, 09 July 2015, a juvenile, female Sulawesi Macaque scaled a wall in the outdoor portion of her
enclosure, and escaped her enclosure. The enclosure did contain electric wire, which was tested and in working
order; however, the animal was able to navigate around the wire in order to escape. The animal was recovered
without incident, and was evaluated by the facility veterinarian who determined she was healthy and unharmed.
This animal is being housed in the interior portion of her enclosure until the facility ensures that the outdoor portion
of her enclosure is able to be secured. The licensee must repair or reformat the aforementioned enclosure to ensure
that the enclosure contains the animals, and prevents escape.
