RECORDS: OPERATORS OF AUCTION SALES AND BROKERS.
During the September 2019 exotic auction the records made and kept were not complete as they did not include the
vehicle license number and state and the driver's license number and state of the following two persons consigning
animals who are not licensed under the Animal Welfare Act: PS who consigned 4 coatimundi (tag numbers
228-231) and HS who consigned one male zebra (tag 8814). Accurate and complete records are necessary to
provide information regarding animal ownership. The auction operator shall make, keep and maintain records which
fully and correctly disclose all the required information including the driver's license number and state and vehicle
license number and state of the persons consigning animals who are not licensed under the AWA. Correct by Feb.
28, 2020.
2.132(d) REPEAT
PROCUREMENT OF DOGS, CATS, AND OTHER ANIMALS; DEALERS.
Review of the September 2019 and November 2019 exotic auction records show multiple instances in which
animals were consigned for auction by the auction operator without the person consigning the animal being licensed
under the Animal Welfare Act.
September 2019 auction: TL consigned 3 female and 2 male cavy (tag numbers 110-114), PS consigned 2 female
and 2 male coatimundi (228-231), GG consigned one male and one female cavy (355-356), CL consigned one male
red kangaroo (8527), and SR consigned one male kangaroo (8470).
November 2019 auction: RF consigned 4 male and 1 female coatimundi (230-234), and DV consigned 1 male red
kangaroo (7772).
These consignors are not licensed under the Animal Welfare Act as required to sell exotic animals. No one time
exemption form was noted on file. The facility may not consign any animal from a person required to be licensed but
who does not hold a current, valid, unsuspended license.
