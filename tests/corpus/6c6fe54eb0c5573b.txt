*** A male poodle avid # 841053378 "Mocha" had matted fur underneath the belly and along the back legs. Matted
fur can pull and separate from the skin causing potential skin irritations. This dog needs to be groomed on a routine
basis to prevent this matting and for the comfort of the dog.
*** A female Maltese avid # 026080336 "Cindy" has a large build up of tarter along the back teeth and the gum line
is red and irritated. This dog needs to be addressed by the vet to determine the best course of action for dental care
and preventative measures established for overall dental health for this animal.
