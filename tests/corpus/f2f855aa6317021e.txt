FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*** On 12-18-15 the deputy director with the Jackson Zoological Society contacted me and informed me that five
dogs had broken into the African hoof stock enclosure and attacked and killed 5 springbok and 1 gazelle.
Enclosures that allow other animals into the housing facility can cause injury or death. The facility must be
constructed of such material and maintained in good repair to protect the animals.
3.127(d)(1)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*** On 12-18-15 the deputy director with the Jackson Zoological Society contacted me and informed me that five
dogs had gained access into the zoo. Perimeter fences that allow other animals into the housing facility can cause
injury or death. The fence must be constructed so that it protects the animals in the facility by restricting animals
from going through it or under it and having contact with the animals in the facility. Correct immediately.
This was a focused inspection of the springbok and gazelle enclosure. The inspection and exit interview were
conducted with the deputy director and myself.
