3.13(b)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The licensee could not locate all medical records for the dogs. The licensee had the dogs physically examined by the
attending veterinarian, yet the licensee stated that the adults received their distemper vaccines per the Program of
Veterinary Care but could not locate the records. Additionally, there was a litter of puppies that received an antibiotic
treatment but the licensee did not have records that would have identified which litter needed the treatment and when
treatment was administered to them.

Medical records are necessary for APHIS officials to ensure that the animals are receiving adequate veterinary care.

Dealers must keep copies of medical records for dogs and make the records available for APHIS inspection. The licensee
must ensure that a medical record is created for all aspects of veterinary care provided to the dogs including vaccinations
and examinations.

To be corrected by: From this day forward the licensee must maintain all required medical records and make them
available for APHIS inspection.



This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
