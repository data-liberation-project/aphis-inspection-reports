SANITATION.
Of the 7 rabbits held at the facility 2 of the rabbit enclosures have excess feces in them. The singly housed
lion-head rabbit has too much feces in the sheltered area and the outside area of the enclosure. A smaller gray
rabbit also has an excessive amount of feces in the sheltered area of its enclosure.
Primary enclosures shall be kept reasonably free of excreta.
Clean the enclosures as often as necessary to prevent soiling of the animal, odor and disease hazards.
