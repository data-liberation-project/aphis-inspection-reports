Feeding.
Five of six knives in the food preparation area had a layer of grime on the blades. Three cleavers had rust present where
the blade joined the handle. Using unclean utensils for food preparation can introduce disease-causing organisms and/or
contaminants to the food. Per the regulations, the food must be clean, wholesome and palatable to the animals.
Corrected during inspection.
