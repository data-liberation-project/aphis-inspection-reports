2.40(b)(2) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A silver, black, white, and brown (Blue Merle) male Welsh Corgi (# 054) had an open wound on it's left ear. The wound
was oozing a yellowish mucousy substance from the ear. The licensee stated the dog got into a fight three days ago. He
has been trying to treat it himself, but has not contacted the Attending Veterinarian.

An open wound may be painful for the dog. In addition, if not treated correctly, it could become infected and cause further
problems.

The Attending Veterinarian must be contacted and the dog must be treated per the Attending Veterinarian's instructions.

Correct by 12/17/21.
3.6(c)(1)(i)

Primary enclosures.
Four puppies were not provided with enough space in the enclosure. Two of the puppies measure 13 inches while the
other two measure 12.5 inches. Together the four dogs require 1,406.5 square inches of space. The enclosure
measured 35 X 30 inches for a total of 1,050 square inches of space. The enclosure was short by 356.5 square inches of

space.

Cage space requirements ensure that the dogs have enough room to move about freely within their enclosures. It
minimizes the dogs from stepping or sitting in their feces or urine and also minimizes the spread of disease. The licensee
must ensure that all enclosures containing dogs and puppies have enough floor space to meet the minimum floor space
requirements for the number of and the size of the dogs in that enclosure.

Correct from this day forward.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
