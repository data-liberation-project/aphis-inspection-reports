2.31(c)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
Records since July 2013 show environmental readings outside of set limits. While no adverse effects on the animals
were noted, the IACUC did not identify the problem on two semi-annual inspections during the same time. The
IACUC inspections need to be comprehensive using 9 CFR as a guide and problems identified and elevated to a
level that they can be corrected in a timely manner. This assures that the animals are being maintained under
conditions that are conducive to good health. Correct by: next semi-annual inspection.
Exit interview conducted with facility veterinarians.
