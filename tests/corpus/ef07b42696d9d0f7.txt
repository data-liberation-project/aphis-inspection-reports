PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***There were at least 10 cages (primary enclosures) in the puppy room housing dogs that were rusted. These
rusted surfaces can not be readily cleaned or sanitized and should be repaired or replaced to ensure the health and
well-being of the animals. Primary enclosures for dogs must be constructed and maintained so that they enable all
surfaces in contact with the dogs to be readily cleaned and sanitized or be replaceable when worn or soiled. Correct
