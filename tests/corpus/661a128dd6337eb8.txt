CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In a food storage area in the Comparative Medicine Annex there were stacked bag of medicated primate feed that
had multiple rodent dropping and urine staining present on top. These bags were located near refrigerators storing
produce.
Also in the same room along the far corner wall near the door to the loading dock there was an accumulation of
rodent droppings some of which were lighter in color demonstrating that they were drying out.
In an adjoining kitchen area there was a fly on a dirty counter that also had an unwashed knife.
In an empty animal room #137 in the Comparative Medicine Annex there were rodent droppings noted on the floor.
An effective program for control of insects, external parasites affecting nonhuman primates, and birds and mammals
that are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and
reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
Correct from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
