2.40(b)(2)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There was a discrepancy between the dose of medicine prescribed and the dose given to three tigers and a black
leopard. During inspection of medications to be distributed to the animals, only one half of the prescribed doses of
Enalapril were designated to be given to each animal. The formulation/concentration of the pills in a newer bottle were
reportedly half of the concentration from the previous bottle. Distributing incorrect doses of medications could have
negative impacts on the animals. Assure animals are receiving the prescribed amounts of medications.
Note: The facility representative contacted the veterinarian and communicated the dose discrepancy. The facility
representative also indicated she will confirm the dosage of the medications before distribution from this day forward.

Housing facilities, general.
The semi-trailer used to store dog food has several bags of unopened dog food on pallets directly next to the wall.
Additionally, several other bags are stored on the aisle way floor. The food must be stored off the floor and away from the
walls, to allow cleaning underneath it, around it, and to inspect for evidence of pests.
3.125(a)

Facilities, general.

The enclosure containing the female tiger, Tia, is in disrepair. The enclosure is constructed from wood telephone pole
type posts and heavy chain link fence. On the northeast side of the enclosure, one inspector was able to move two of the
wood posts approximately one to two inches when pushing them. These comprised posts, if not addressed, could
potentially affect the safe containment of the tiger.
The enclosure containing the three bobcats has a metal post that has rusted through. The post is located on the center
dividing fence, nearest to the shelter. The edges on the rusted post could injure the animals.
Assure all animal enclosures are structurally sound and maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to
contain them.
