2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A cream and grey colored adult male Lhasa Apso (microchip 101-595-513) has a heavy coating of dark brown
matter on most of its teeth. The abnormal buildup of material on the teeth can cause damage to the gum tissue and
tooth structure, be painful and impact the ability of the animal to eat normally and harm the health of the animal. The
dog also has an accumulation of green-colored mucus covering about 75 percent of the right eye. There is a buildup
of black crusty material matted in the fur around both eyes. Not having clear vision can cause discomfort and affect
the health and well-being of the dog. The presence of eye discharge can be a sign of injury, infection or other
painful veterinary medical conditions. The potential for injury exists if the dog is not able to see clearly. The licensee
must have this animal examined by a veterinarian and appropriate plan administered. The outcome of this
examination must be documented and provided to the inspector upon request. The licensee must ensure that all
animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
3.1(c)(2) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On the sheltered facility the lower third of the galvanized sheet of tin attached to the east side of the exterior wall
around the dog doors is rusted. Rust is covering an estimated 20 to 30 percent of the surface area of four
enclosures where dogs are. The owner stated that he had tried painting the surface but the dogs scratch it off.
Surfaces not maintained on a regular basis cannot be readily cleaned and sanitized. The licensee must ensure that
all surfaces are maintained on a regular basis so those surfaces can be readily cleaned and sanitized at all times or
be replaced when worn. The licensee must replace or repair this part of the siding that is rusty to help insure that
good cleaning and sanitizing practice can take place to help maintain a disease free environment for dogs.
3.6(a)(2)(12) REPEAT
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
The plastic coated wire flooring of the outside dog runs on the south and east side of the sheltered facility is losing
its covering. Wire flooring that is not at least a diameter of 9 gauge must be coated with a material such as plastic or
fiberglass. Inadequate flooring can lead to sore feet and open wounds. Dogs must have safe flooring to stay healthy
and comfortable. The licensee must repair or replace the areas of flooring that are not adequately coated.3.11(c) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There is an accumulation of dust, grime, cobwebs and dog hair on the interior walls, ceiling and enclosure pens of
the sheltered facility. This indicates a living area exists for rodents, other pests and other vermin. Unsanitary living
conditions are created if the building is not kept clean and this could lead to health issues for the dogs. The licensee
needs to put into place a good program that continually keeps areas where dogs are free of cobwebs. Also,
surfaces where dogs come into contact must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks and more
often if needed to help maintain a disease free facility for dogs. The licensee must clean/remove the cobwebs from
the inside of the sheltered facility where dogs are housed.
3.12 REPEAT
EMPLOYEES.
This kennel facility does not have enough employees to adequately in a timely manner take care of the
maintenance and daily routines that a kennel of this size requires. Each facility subject to the Animal Welfare
regulations maintaining dogs must have enough employees to carry out the level of husbandry practices and care
required .
Note: The adult female Lhasa Apso (microchip 068-825-363) and adult female Pekinese (microchip 101-258-797)

Exit interview conducted with the owner.
