3.101(a)(3)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a wall along the back side of the enclosure, below the large overhead structure, opposite from the ocean,
that has significant deterioration along the bottom edge where it meets the water. It appears that pieces have
become detached, in which case they would fall into the water. The deteriorating section is discolored, with brown,
green, and black areas. Part of the wall is painted, and edges of the painted wall are missing. The dolphins have
access the this deteriorating section of wall. Debris falling into the water could introduce contaminants, pieces that
could be ingested, and also makes adequate cleaning of surfaces difficult.
All surfaces in a primary enclosure must be constructed of durable, nontoxic materials that facilitate cleaning, and
disinfection as appropriate, sufficient to maintain acceptable water quality. All surfaces must be maintained in good
repair as part of a regular, ongoing maintenance program.
To be corrected by 7/1/15.
An exit briefing was conducted with facility representatives.
