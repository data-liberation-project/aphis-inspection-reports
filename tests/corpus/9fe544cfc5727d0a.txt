FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is an electrical cable near the water receptacle in the whitetail deer enclosure that appears to be hanging low
enough for the deer to potentially make contact with it. This drooping cable is a potential injury hazard for the deer
should they run into or brush against it. Remove or repair the drooping cable. Correct by March 21, 2017.

WATERING.
The water receptacles in the bison, elk and whitetail deer enclosures all have a yellowish-green colored material
coating their sides and bottoms. The bison receptacle also has this material floating in the water. Unsanitary water
receptacles do not promote good health and increase the risk of disease. Clean the water receptacles as often as
necessary to keep them free from contaminants. Correct by March 23, 2017.
