3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
Within at least eight enclosures housing eight Sheba Inu dogs, there were rubber water bowls that had a green
discoloration (algae like substance) along the inside surfaces. The water inside the receptacles appeared to be
greenish and difficult for the dogs to drink without getting the algae like matter. Water receptacles which are not
properly cleaned or sanitized can harbor disease-causing organisms. This could decrease the animals' acceptability
of the water, as well as increase the risk of disease. The licensee must ensure that all food and water receptacles
are sanitized at least once every 2 weeks and more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris,
food waste and other disease hazards.
