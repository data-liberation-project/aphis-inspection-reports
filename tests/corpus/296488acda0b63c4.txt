ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
Section 2.126(b) - Access and inspection of records and property: A responsible adult shall be made available to
accompany APHIS officials during the inspection process.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 12:30 on
10/06/2015.
Upon arrival I spoke with the licensee who stated that she could not stay for the inspection process but had to go to
a meeting. We discussed future hours of operation and optimal hours for inspection.
This is the first attempted inspection.
