3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
The Bengal cat off exhibit holding area had inadequately applied caulking to the baseboards. The caulking was easily
pulled away from the wall and could have been ingested by one of the cats. Not only could this be a possible ingestion
health hazard for the cats, but the area under the caulking was dirty. This indicates the caulking was not performing it’s
intended job, to seal the area from water and dirt, allowing the area to be adequately cleaned and disinfected.
The junction of the walls with the floor in the Bengal cat off exhibit holding area need to be adequately sealed so that it
does not pose an ingestion risk for the cats and the area can be adequately cleaned and disinfected.
Facilities must be constructed of such material and of such strength as appropriate for the animals and the facilities shall
be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury and to contain the animals.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
