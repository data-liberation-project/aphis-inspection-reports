ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female shihtzu/poodle cross (USDA #106) was observed to favor her left front foot when walking. Close
observation revealed a red dime-sized swollen sore between her toes on the front left foot. Swollen foot sores can
be painful if not addressed appropriately. This problem had not been communicated to the attending veterinarian.
Prompt communication of any health problem must be made with the attending veterinarian so that the problem can
be assessed and appropriately treated.
