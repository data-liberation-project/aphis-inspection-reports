prominent. She also had a severe hourglass shape to the waist and obvious loss of muscle mass. There were
several sores, severe hair loss on her right upper hind quarters and lower left hind quarters. The left eye was cloudy
and the surface of the eye is uneven. The right eye has excessive opaque greenish-white discharge covering the

and partially obstructing the view of the eye. The surface of the eye appears to be broken and uneven. There were

A veterinarian must be consulted when animals display signs that may indicate illness in order to appropriately
control, diagnose, and treat these disease and injuries. Failure to consult a veterinarian can result in worsening
illness and/or distress to the animal.
2.50(a)(1)
TIME AND METHOD OF IDENTIFICATION.
***In the 1st barn there were two chihuahua's named Cherub and Dragon that were not wearing their ID tag collars
around their necks. The owner stated that they would repeatedly take them off. The option of chipping and the
importance of identification was explained to the owner. All live dogs held on the premises, purchased, or otherwise
acquired, sold or otherwise disposed of, or removed from the premises for delivery to a research facility or exhibitor
or to another dealer, or for sale, through an auction sale or to any person for use as a pet, shall be identified by an
official tag of the type described in Sec. 2.51 affixed to the animal's neck by means of a collar made of material
generally considered acceptable to pet owners as a means of identifying their pet dogs, or shall be identified by a
distinctive and legible tattoo marking acceptable to and approved by the Administrator. Correct by September 2,
2014.
3.6(a)(2)(4)PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
***In a primary enclosure holding 6 adult dogs there were holes that extended into the adjacent enclosure. The
adjacent enclosure was empty and two dogs that belonged in that enclosure were no longer there. Two dogs from
the adjacent enclosure tunneled into the primary enclosure with 4 other dogs. The primary enclosures must be
constructed and maintained so that they keep other animals from entering the enclosure. Correct by August 26,
2014.
3.11(a)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***In the chihuahua shed the last run to the left had an abundance of old feces in the outdoor run area. Excreta
must be removed from primary enclosures daily, and from under primary enclosures as often as necessary to
prevent an excessive accumulation of feces, to prevent soiling of the dogs or cats contained in the primary
enclosures, and to reduce disease hazards, insects, pests and odors. When steam or water is used to clean the
primary enclosure, whether by hosing, flushing, or other methods, dogs and cats must be removed, unless the
enclosure is large enough to ensure the animals would not be harmed, wetted, or distressed in the process. Correct
