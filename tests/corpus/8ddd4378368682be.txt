FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The interior opening latch for the access door of the two red ruffed lemurs enclosure has a wire woven over it. Two
sharp wire points protrude off the end of the latch and can potentially inure the animals. This area needs to be
repaired or replaced to protect the animals from injury.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
The north west side of the chain mesh perimeter fence has a small rotting tree that came down on the top of it. This
needs to be cleared away so that it doesn't damage the fence or provide an escape route in the event of an animal
escape. The vines and overgrowth needs to be cleared off the fence in this same section so the fence can easily be
inspected and maintained.

SPACE REQUIREMENTS.
The lockout of the enclosure for the female white tiger named "Blue" was used for her protection during the night of
hurricane Matthew. The sides of the lockout are too narrow for her to turn around without bumping her hips and she
has hairless pink spots on her hips from the night in the lockout. The licensee has closed the shift door to the
lockout and she has protection from the elements. This lockout can not be used until it is modified or replaced.
Enclosures shall be constructed and maintained so as to provide sufficient space to allow the animal to make
normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement.
