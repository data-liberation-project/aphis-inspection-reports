FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
Temperatures were in the upper 80's on the day of inspection and the llama and goats in the main pasture had no
access to shade. For their health and well-being, whenever temperatures might cause discomfort, animals must
have the choice to avoid direct sunlight. Either a shade structure must be provided, or the animals must be granted
access to areas with shade. Correct by the next hot day or immediately if any signs of discomfort are noted.
This inspection was conducted at a new location where animals are being housed: 11017 White Hall Trail, Ivor, VA.
The main location in Elberson, VA was not inspected. An exit interview was conducted with the employee.
