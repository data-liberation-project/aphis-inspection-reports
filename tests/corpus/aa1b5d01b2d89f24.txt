2.131(b)(1)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On April 16, 2014 3 Wolves escaped from their enclosure. The animals also gained access to the exterior of the
property. 2 of the animals were recaptured within the following 24 hours.
The third animal was never recaptured and was found dead outside of the installation around May 11 2014,
presumably hit by a car.
Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause
trauma, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
During the time in which this animal was loose, it was shot and hit by a immobilizing dart "14 times" , yet it never
went down and ran into the dense forest that is around this area, (Shooting and hitting the animal with a dart at
least 14 times is not considered adequate handling ). Also Wolfrun used 2 types of traps to try to catch the animal
with no positive results.
Although the roughness of the area and the dense forest did not facilitate the recovery efforts and the multiple
attempts of the facility to recover the escaped animal, the measures taken were not sufficient and/or appropriate.
This facility does not have staff trained to handle dangerous animals specifically regarding capture, handling,
immobilization, anesthesia, and tranquilization. A facility representative stated: "one person on the dart team is
retired Navy and the other has been hunting since he was age six; both men have excellent skills with guns" ( the
second person was not an employee of the facility). "Excellent skills with guns" is only part of an adequate
qualification. The failure to re-capture this animal and its subsequent death puts in serious doubt the
appropriateness of the measures taken to recapture the animal.
Without proper training the staff doesn't know how to handle the anesthetics and/or tranquilizers to use in the
recapture of escaped animals. (Type of medicine, dosage, size of the darts, etc.) In addition, the facility personnel
have not demonstrated that they know how to use the darts, prevent injuries, and put them in the most suitable area
depending on the species of the animal.The failure to handle the animal properly and in a timely manner (recovered) evolved into the death of the animal
and this is not in compliance with the requirements of the AWA 2.131 (b) (1) Handling: "Handling of all animals shall
be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does not cause trauma, behavioral stress,
physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort."
The escape and re-capture plan lacks information and guidance about which medicines can be used, when it can
be used, and how to use them (dosage, etc.). It also lacks guidance on when and how to quickly remove animals if
they are a threat to public safety.
The licensee must develop and maintain a complete and current plan to follow in the event of escape of any of the
animals; in addition it is necessary that all the employees receive basic training in this plan, and that this facility
regularly performs escape drills exercises with all the employees and volunteers. Also all necessary measures must
be taken to prevent the reoccurrence of this kind of outcome, including additional training in the safety measures
necessary for the prevention of escapes for the entire staff of this facility.

Professional training in adequate Humane Capture and Handling of the animals is recommended for this facility.
Some possible options include: the workshops from organizations like Safe Capture Group, the invitation of
specialists in the management of captive wild animals and/or training from recommended personnel from other
facilities with good escape and re-capture plans can be some of the possibilities to use for this training.
All the preventive measures, trainings and plans must be documented and must be available to the APHIS officials
at the time of inspection.
