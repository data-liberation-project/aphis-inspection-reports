ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three camels on pasture with 17 other camels appear to be in thin body condition with no other observed clinical
issues. The health status of these three camels has not been communicated to the attending veterinarian so that
an evaluation and possible diagnosis can be made. Direct and frequent communication of any animal health
problems needs to be conveyed to the attending veterinarian for the health and well being of the animals.

SANITATION.
The barn containing 2 adult female camels and 4 juvenile camels has an excessive accumulation of fresh feces and
fecal material matted in the straw such that there was no available clean space for resting within the sheltered area.
The outdoor paddock adjacent to the barn also has a substantial amount of fecal material covering the ground near
the entrance to the barn. Areas housing animals need to be kept clean and free of fecal debris to minimize risk of
disease and maintain the health of the animals.
