HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In an enclosure housing a non-human primate, there are approximately fifteen 1-inch long blunt bolt screws
identified protruding into the enclosure. The bolt screws are accessible to the non-human primate. Failure to remove
protruding hardware from the enclosure can have the potential to injure the animal housed within. A system should
be in place and maintained to ensure the animal enclosure is free of hardware which may injure the animal.
