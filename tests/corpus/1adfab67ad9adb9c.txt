Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
There are no records for the 27 puppies present in the kennel at the time of the inspection. Complete and accurate
records of all adult dogs and puppies that are in the kennel are crucial for tracking the movement of these animals. The
licensee must make, keep and maintain records of all animals including any offspring born in the kennel or while in your
possession or under your control. Correct by 28 April 2022.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with a facility representative.
