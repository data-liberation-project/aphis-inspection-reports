2.40(b)(2) REPEAT
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
An Italian Greyhound (microchip #106810261) was observed to have an irregular shape to its muzzle. Observation
of the mouth showed grayish material on several of the upper teeth. The outline of the teeth cannot be seen. There
were also some lower and upper teeth missing. While the facility has a dental program in place (this dog had its
teeth cleaned on 2/24/13), the facility is not following its dental program to prevent dental problems that can make it
difficult for the dog to eat, can be painful and lead to other health problems. Have this dog evaulated for dental
problems and provide treatment guided by the attending veterinarian. Ensure that the dental protocol outlined on the
program of veterinary care is followed.
