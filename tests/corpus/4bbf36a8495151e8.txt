3.1(c)(1)(i) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The metal pipe under the entrance gate to one enclosure is rusted to the point that there are now jagged edges
present. The lower metal pipe between two enclosures is also rusted to the point that there are now jagged edges
present and a complete section is missing.
The lower section of one metal food receptacle is rusted resulting in a hole through this section and producing
jagged edges.
Rusted surfaces cannot be adequately cleaned and sanitized and can affect the structural strength of the material.
All surfaces must be constructed in a manner that allows them to be readily cleaned and sanitized and remain
structurally sound.
3.9(b) REPEAT
FEEDING.
There is still at least one metal "(cid:28)self-feeder"(cid:29) that has a buildup of food residue and grime on the interior in contact
with the food. In the "bowl" part of this feeder was some moldy feed. Dirty food receptacles can contaminate the
food and affect the nutritive value of the food. If self-feeders are used, the licensee must keep them clean and
sanitized in accordance with 3.11 b.
3.11(a) REPEAT
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
According to the owner, feces were last removed from the outdoor housing facility 3 days ago. In two of these
enclosures a large portion of the floor area was covered by excreta. Also, excreta covered approximately one-third
of the outdoor section of the sheltered whelping enclosure. This was last cleaned two day ago.
Accumulation of excreta can soil the dogs, increase disease transmission, and attract flies and other pests. Excreta
and food waste must be removed from primary enclosures on a daily basis or more often to prevent the soiling of
the dogs in the enclosure.
3.11(b)(2)CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are at least 5 water receptacles that have some brown residue in the bottom and some green algae growing
along their sides. Water receptacles that are not kept clean can contaminate the water and impact the dogs
willingness to drink. All water receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized at least once every two weeks, or more
often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of dirt, debris, food waste, excreta and other disease hazards.

3.11(d)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There were mouse droppings observed on the concrete floor under one food receptacle. These mice were attracted
to the food that had fallen through the hole in the bottom of this food receptacle. Mice can transmit diseases to the
dogs. An effective method of pest control must be established and maintained to reduce pest infestation. Correct
