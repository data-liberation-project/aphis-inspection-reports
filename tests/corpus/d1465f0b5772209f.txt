2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The licensee stated that the attending veterinarian had not been to the new location, but was aware of the new site.
Without regular visits to the site(s) the attending veterinarian does not have knowledge of all parts of the facility and
therefore cannot give accurate guidance to licensee in reference to all aspects of the animals' health. The license
must have the attending veterinarian perform a site visit before or at the time all new locations are put into use.
This was a new site inspection for site 002. No regulated activity may be conducted at this site until the facility is in
full compliance. Regulated activity may only occur at approved sites.
The inspection and exit briefing were conducted with the licensee and ACI Bartels.
Please contact ACI Bartels for another inspection at site 002.
