A focused inspection was conducted to follow-up on veterinary concerns identified during the inspection on
1/21/2015 involving one ewe and one juvenile male lamb. The licensee had contacted the attending veterinarian
(AV) on 1/21/2015 and he evaluated both animals on 1/22/2015. The AV recommended euthanasia for the ewe
which was performed humanely on 1/22/2015. A plan for monitoring and reevaluation of the male lamb was
documented. At the time of this inspection, the AV had reevaluated the male lamb and he appears to have fully
recovered from his injury.

Exit interview conducted with facility representative.
