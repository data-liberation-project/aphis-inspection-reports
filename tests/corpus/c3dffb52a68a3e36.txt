Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
The last record of visit from the attending veterinarian (AV) for the guinea pigs was June 2018 and a phone call with the
AV found that a visit hasn't been conducted at the new guinea pig site. Licensees are required to schedule regular visits
with the AV to the premises to ensure adequate veterinary care is in place. Contact the attending veterinarian to conduct
regularly scheduled visits at the guinea pig facility.
2.50(a)(1)

Time and method of identification.
Adult dogs do not have official identification and do not have identification numbers (although the facility does know each
by name and have records using dogs' names). Official identification and numbers for each dog are important for
husbandry records and required for licensed facilities. Ensure that official identification is assigned and attached safely to
each adult dog in the facility.

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
The adult dogs were not listed on APHIS 7005 Record of Acquisition of Dogs and Cats on Hand. Complete records of
acquisition can be important for husbandry and health tracing and is required to be maintained on APHIS 7005. Ensure
each adult is listed with complete information on APHIS 7005.


3.1(e)

Housing facilities, general.
A pallet with about 5 bags of food are stored in the same room as the dogs. Also an open bag of bedding is in a tote but
the tote doesn't have a lid. Only food or bedding currently being used may be kept in the animal areas if in leakproof
containers with tightly fitting lids. Unopened bags not in use have to be stored in a different space (not in the same room
as the dogs), off the floor and away from the walls, to allow cleaning underneath and around the supplies. Ensure that
food and bedding is stored properly to prevent it from getting dirty (contaminated) from the animals in the room.
3.13(a)

Veterinary care for dogs.
The facility has an attending veterinarian for dogs that regularly visits the dog area and is following a vaccination and
deworming schedule, however does not have a written Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) that is signed by the attending
veterinarian. A written PVC is required and helps APHIS officials determine if adequate veterinary care is being provided.
Ensure that written Program of Veterinary Care is developed and followed and is available for inspection.
