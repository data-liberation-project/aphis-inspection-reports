3.127(d)

Facilities, outdoor.
In the safari drive through, there was not a continuous perimeter fence at an adequate height for the species present.
Non-dangerous animal enclosures for the badgers, binturong, small-clawed otters, and a spider monkey were not
surrounded by a 6 foot tall perimeter fence, nor was a wolf enclosure surrounded by an 8 foot tall fence as required for
dangerous animals. At the zoo, one portion of the 8 feet tall perimeter fence was serving as one side of an African
Crested porcupine’s primary enclosure. A perimeter fence that is at least 6 feet high (for non-dangerous species) and 8
feet high (for dangerous species), as well as a minimum of 3 feet away from the primary enclosures is needed. There
also must be sufficient wire spacing to prevent unauthorized humans and other animals the size of dogs, skunks, and
raccoons from going through or under it. The perimeter fencing is necessary to keep unwanted species of animals and
humans out, as well as serve as a secondary containment. The facility shall ensure the primary enclosures for the
dangerous and non-dangerous species listed above, are enclosed by an appropriate perimeter fence, or a variance, if
appropriate, needs to be obtained and can be requested from the Administrator/Regional Office.
MUST BE CORRECTED BY: DECEMBER 25, 2022
