HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
In the drive through park the patrons in personal vehicles are instructed to keep their windows completely down to
feed the animals. Buckets of feed are sold at the entrance to the park. Animals in this area of the park include
camels, llamas, zebra, elk, bison, and various other hoof stock. In the walk through park, there is no barrier at the
giraffe exhibit and members of the public are allowed to feed and touch them. There is no barrier in the petting farm
area where the public feeds and contacts the animals. There are also no public barriers in the kangaroo walkabout.
Animal Care was made aware of a camel biting a child who then needed medical attention. The facility verified that
the incident did happen. The incident happened on a wagon ride and the camel reached over the primary fencing
grabbing the childs arm with the feed bucket. The facility has addressed this incident by placing a 6' wide area of
large jagged rocks under the primary enclosure fence to prevent the public from approaching the camels and the
camels from approaching the public.
During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the
public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing public so as to assure
the safety of animals and the public.
Vehicle windows can serve as public barriers. However, by keeping the windows of the vehicle completely down
the barrier between the public and animal is removed. The lack of barriers needs to be corrected to protect the
health and safety of the animals and to ensure the safety of the public.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
In the drive through park the patrons in private vehicles are instructed to keep their windows completely down tofeed the animals. Buckets of feed are sold at the park entrance. Although park employees regularly drive this area,
it is impossible for them to adequately supervise all private vehicles within this area of the park. In the walk through
park, the giraffes have a feeding platform with no uniformed attendant present. There are two food dispensers
available on the platform for park guests to purchase food. The petting farm area has no attendant, nor does the
kangaroo walkabout. There is also a barn and enclosure housing Boer goats which does not have an attendant. In
all these areas, there are no public barriers to keep members of the public separated from the animals.
Unsupervised contact between animals and the public increases the possibility of injury to the animals and the
public. In any situation where there is contact between animals and the public, there must be a responsible,
knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant present at all times.
If there are no public barriers in these areas, the facility must ensure that these sections of the park are adequately
supervised by readily identifiable employees when members of the public are present.
To be corrected from this time forward.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- Several exposed screws are present in the wooden branches in an enclosure housing a single female tamarin.
The screws are intended to connect branches together to provide a stable play structure for the tamarin. Sharp
points and edges provide a risk of injury to enclosed animals, and must be removed or repaired to protect the health
of the animals.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
- Two sharp nails were exposed in a section of a broken wooden trough in the petting barn area of the walk through
park. Numerous adult and juvenile animals had access to this area, including goats, pigs, llamas, and camels.
Sharp points are an injury risk, and must be removed or repaired to protect the health and welfare of enclosed
animals.
Corrected on the spot
3.127(a)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
- In the walk through portion of the zoo one of the two giraffe enclosures, housing three giraffes, did not havesufficient shade to accommodate all animals. At approximately 3 pm, the only available shade was a small section
within the public feeding area. Although all animals had access to this feeding area, there was not enough shade to
comfortably cover all the animals. Lack of shade can lead to discomfort and overheating, and may have a negative
impact on the health and welfare of the affected animals. The facility must ensure that there is sufficient shade
provided to all animals, at all times of day.

SANITATION.
The animals in the drive through park appear to have a heavy infestation of flies, especially on their heads and
shoulders, and are constantly moving, twitching and rubbing to get the flies off. Animals in this area include bison,
camels, llamas, elk and various other hoofstock. There is a large accumulation of yellow jackets on the door to the
black buck shelter.
Insects are a source of discomfort to the affected animals, and can lead to physical injury due to animals rubbing
and scratching themselves in an effort to remove the pests. Insects may also cause contamination of feed and
water, negatively impacting the health of the animals. The facility is currently attempting to control flies and insects
with a combination of sprays carried by employees, and the use of mineral blocks with additives to prevent fly eggs
from hatching. However, the current attempts at control are not adequate. Per facility representatives, only certain
animals can be safely sprayed. The facility must take further steps to address fly control in all animals within the
drive through area. A safe and effective program for the control of insects, ectoparasites, and avian and
mammalian pests shall be established and maintained.
A safe method for fly and yellow jacket control for all of the animals in the drive through park must be established for
the health and comfort of the animals.
