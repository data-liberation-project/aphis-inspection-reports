HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the enclosed yard on the premise, there were chewed disposable plastic bowls, socks, paper and other discarded
materials. The enclosed yard is used as a turnout yard for the animal and therefore is an animal area. Animal
areas must be kept neat and free clutter, including accumulations of trash, waste material and other discarded
matter in order to facilitate husbandry practices. A system of maintenance must be in place to ensure that the
premises are kept clean in order to protect the animals from injury.
