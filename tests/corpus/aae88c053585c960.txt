3.127(d) Critical

Facilities, outdoor.
In the IACUC meeting minutes from October 27, 2020, the “attending veterinarian report” section reported that 4 sheep on
2 separate protocols at the Foothills facility were predated and killed. It was determined that this attack was from a bobcat
and a trapper was hired. The IACUC agreed that no further action was required. During the inspection, the attending
veterinarian explained that there has been a total of 8 sheep killed or euthanized due to predation between October 19,
2020 and November 23, 2020, which includes 4 more sheep since the IACUC meeting where the predation was first
reported. Per the attending veterinarian, these were all thought to be separate, individual attacks and were most likely
from both a bobcat and a mountain lion. The initial effort to trap the bobcat was not successful.
The attending veterinarian reports that the perimeter fence surrounding the facility is 10 feet high in all areas except for
the gate where it is 6 feet high. The fence is constructed from “no climb” wire which consists of approximately 4x4 squares
with 3 inverted triangles in each square. The fence extends vertically from the ground with no kick out, barbed wire, or
electrified sections. No other deterrents are used on the fence.
The perimeter fence has not restricted animals from entering the facility multiple times and killing sheep. An effective
perimeter fence protects the animals within from any outside animals that could cause injury or death. Perimeter fences
are not required for domesticated farm-type animals, such as sheep, as long as the facility has effective security


measures in place. These multiple predation incidents indicate that security measures are not effective to protect the
animals from harm.
The perimeter fence must be of sufficient height and constructed in a way that protects the animals within by restricting
predators from entering the facility. Security measures used must be effective in protecting the animals. A corrective plan
with a reasonable timeline for completion must be developed.
TO BE CORRECTED BY 18 JANUARY 2021.

This inspection was conducted from 12/14/20 to 12/16/20 and the exit interview was conducted on 12/16/20 with facility
representatives.
