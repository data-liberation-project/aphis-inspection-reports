HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
On October 12, 2019, a 6 month old juvenile tiger was exhibited at Sheldon’s K9s Fall Festival. A video recording of
the licensee and a tiger on exhibition was reviewed with the licensee. The licensee acknowledges that this is him
and his tiger, Sheldon at this exhibition. Per the video recording, the tiger remains laying on its side, panting and
mostly unresponsive to external activity for most of the recorded time it is exhibited to the public. The tiger does not
respond with normal feline behavior to stimulation by the owner, his daughter, or the surrounding public in this
video. The cause for this abnormal posture and behavior of a juvenile tiger in an unfamiliar setting surrounded by
the public cannot be determined from the video, but may include general exhaustion, heat exhaustion, and/or
sedation. Exhibiting a juvenile tiger in this condition may cause harm to the tiger’s health and well-being. Per the
regulations, handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefully as possible in a manner that does
not cause trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, physical harm, or unnecessary discomfort.
Correct from this date forward.

HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
A video recording of the licensee and a tiger on exhibition was reviewed with the licensee. The licensee
acknowledges that this is him and his tiger, Sheldon. The tiger used during the public exhibition at Sheldon's K9s
Fall Festival was 6 months old and weighed approximately 50 pounds at the time of the exhibition. The tiger was
restrained by a harness attached to a leash, held by the owner. Insufficient physical barriers were present to protect
the public and the animal. A 6 month old tiger used for public display in this manner does not protect the public, the
handler and the tiger. Per the regulations, during public exhibition, any animal must be handled so there is minimal
risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficient distance and/or barriers between the animal and the
general viewing public so as to assure the safety of animals and the public. Correct from this date forward.
This inspection (November 13, 2019) and exit interview (December 4, 2019) were conducted with the facility owner.
