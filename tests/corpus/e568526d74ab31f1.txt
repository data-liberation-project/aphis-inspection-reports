HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The Spider monkey enclosure had rusted metal bars which need to be replaced and painted.
In order to facilitate and properly clean and sanitize the enclosure and to provide proper husbandry practices, any
surfaces that come in contact with nonhuman primates must be free of excessive rust.
The licensee is currently working on the enclosure but additional work has to be done.
To be corrected by 2-28-2015.
***An exit interview was conducted with the licensee.
