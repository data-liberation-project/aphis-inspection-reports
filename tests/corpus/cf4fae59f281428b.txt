2.31(d)(1)(4)(1)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
**Protocol #16 involved procedures that have the potential to cause more than momentary pain and/or distress,
however, there was no provision for providing analgesia for the animals. There was no explanation given in the
protocol for not providing the appropriate analgesia. Procedures that have the potential for more than momentary
pain and/or distress should be performed with the appropriate analgesia unless there is written scientific justification
for withholding analgesia.
