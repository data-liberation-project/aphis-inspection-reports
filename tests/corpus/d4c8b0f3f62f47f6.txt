3.8

Exercise for dogs.
There was no written exercise plan for dogs available for review. However, the size of the pens meet the requirement for
exercise and the dogs are given access to open exercise areas daily.
Failure to have a written exercise plan can result in failure to provide adequate exercise to dogs.
Facilities must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan to provide dogs with the opportunity for exercise. The
plan must be approved by the attending veterinarian and be made available to APHIS upon request.
