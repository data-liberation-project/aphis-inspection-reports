2.31(e)(3) REPEAT
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
A teaching protocol, discussed with the IACUC chair, does not provide enough detail to ensure that the IACUC
understands what will be happening with the animals on the protocol. The principal investigator describes many
basic training protocols, but it is unclear as to which of these will be used on the regulated species. Sedation (and
the use of isofluorane) is briefly mentioned, but there is no description as to when these would be used, nor how
they would be administered or how the animals wil be monitored during induction and recovery. The protocol also
states that following immunization, animals will be monitored for adverse reactions, but no detail is given to how
often or how many days monitoring will occur, or how the monitoring will be recorded. It is also unclear what the
dosing schedule is for the animals; one part of the protocol discusses delivering 1.5 mls SC twice weekly, then it
later discusses giving 3 mls one time followed by boosting on a weekly basis. There is no discussion of needle
gauge for the immunization or for the blood drawing. As this is a teaching protocol, and the students will be learning
how to draw blood, there should be information provided by the principal investigator as to how many attempts a
student is allowed to draw blood. A complete description of the proposed procedures is necessary for the IACUC to
determine that all the animals are being used in a humane manner. Failure to include such descriptions may result
in misunderstanding between the IACUC and the principal investigator and could result in misuse of the animals.
Inspection and exit interview conducted with the IACUC Chair.
