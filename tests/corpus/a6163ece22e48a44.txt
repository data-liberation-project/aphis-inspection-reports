ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A female Beagle (ID #90008500004166) was observed to have a yellowish colored mucous covering the surface of
her right eye. Some of the mucous was also located along the lower eyelid and in the corner of the eye. The
licensee stated that the dog had not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for the condition of her eye.
A female Beagle (No ID found) has a discolored area on her right front leg. The affected area is on the lower
outside portion of the right front leg. Closer inspection of the area revealed that it is brownish in color and some
sections of hair are missing leaving the skin exposed. There are also some hairless areas that are red and crusted
over with scabs. The licensee stated that the dog had not been evaluated by a licensed veterinarian for the
condition of her leg.
Poor eye health and skin issues can cause pain and discomfort to the dog as well as lead to further health issues.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the building housing one adult female Beagle and five puppies there is a large number of unused plastic
self-feeders stored across from the dogs. There are also tools, sealant and other materials stored on top of bales of
straw used for bedding. The clutter created by unused material can collect dirt, interfere with access to the dogs,
and could contaminate the straw bedding.
Animal areas inside housing facilities must be kept neat and free of clutter including equipment, furniture and stored
material. The licensee must store the unused feeders, sealant and tools away from animal areas. The licensee
must ensure that all animal areas remain neat and free of clutter at all times.Correction date: June 07, 2016
3.1(c)(1)(2)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In one small outdoor housing enclosure, containing female Beagle "Mya", the sharp end of a screw has penetrated
through the shelter box wall and is located alongside the metal access door.
In the large outdoor enclosure, containing nine Beagles, there are multiple sharp points located at the level of the
dogs created by wire used to attach electric fencing and plywood wind breaks to fence posts.
There is one shelter in the large outdoor enclosure that is covered in sheets of metal. The metal sheet along the
front of the shelter has bent outward at the bottom creating sharp points and edges.
Sharp points and edges can cause injury to the dogs. All housing facilities must be free of sharp points and edges
that could injure the dogs. The licensee must remove the sharp points and edges or alter them in a manner that
eliminates the injury risk to the dogs. The licensee must ensure that all enclosures are safe for the dogs at all times.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the building housing one adult female Beagle and five puppies there are three bales of straw sitting on the floor
across from the dogs. The licensee said that the bales are to be used as bedding for the animals. Bedding placed
directly on the floor can become contaminated and attract vermin such as mice.
Supplies of food and bedding must be stored in a manner that protects the supplies from spoilage, contamination
and vermin infestation. Only bedding currently being used may be stored in animal areas. The supplies must be
stored off the floor and away from the walls to allow for cleaning around and under the supplies. The licensee must
store the bales of straw away from animal areas and off the floor and away from the wall to prevent any
contamination and vermin infestation. The licensee must ensure that all food and bedding is properly stored at all
times.

INDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the building housing one adult female Beagle and five puppies the ammonia level is high. The inspector
experienced a burning sensation in her throat when entering the building. Once the ammonia was brought to the
licensee's attention, she opened a window which quickly lowered the ammonia level. High levels of ammonia could
have a negative impact on the health of the dogs.
Indoor housing facilities must be sufficiently ventilated at all times when dogs are present to minimize odors, drafts,
moisture condensation and ammonia levels. The licensee must ensure that all indoor housing is adequately
ventilated at all times to eliminate the buildup of ammonia and to promote the dogs' health and well-being.
Corrected during the inspection by opening the building window.
3.4(b)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
There is one large outdoor enclosure, containing nine Beagles, that has no area of shade at the time of the
inspection. The licensee stated that she has a shade structure for the dogs but has not put the shade up yet. It
was partly sunny and the temperature was 78 degrees F at the time of the inspection according to
Accuweather.com. The lack of adequate shade does not allow the dogs to escape the direct rays of the sun which
could have a negative impact on their health.
All outdoor housing enclosures must have one or more outside shaded areas that are large enough to
accommodate all the animals at one time and protect them from the direct rays of the sun. The licensee must add
enough areas of shade to the enclosure to provide for the comfort of all nine dogs. The licensee must ensure that
all dogs housed in outdoor enclosures have access to shaded areas at all times of the year.
A verbal correction date of Friday, June 03, 2016 was given at the exit interview.
3.4(c)
OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
In the small outdoor housing enclosures, containing three Beagles, the shelter boxes for the dogs are constructed of
wood. The enclosure containing male Beagle "Copper" has excessively chewed and scratched wood framing the
metal access door of the shelter box. In the enclosure containing female Beagle "Mya" there is a hole chewed in
the wood of the front of the shelter box. The enclosure containing male Beagle "Shiloh" has excessively chewedwood framing the access door and chewed pieces of wood running along the length of the inside of the shelter box.
The damage caused by the dogs to the surfaces of the wood does not allow for it to be properly cleaned and
sanitized and does not make it impervious to moisture.
Building surfaces in outdoor housing facilities must be impervious to moisture and all surfaces must be maintained
on a regular basis. Any surface that cannot be properly cleaned and sanitized must be replaced when they become
damaged and worn. The licensee must replace the damaged wood or alter it in a manner that makes it impervious
to moisture and allows for proper cleaning and sanitization to occur. The licensee must ensure that all surfaces
remain in good repair at all times.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In the "Whelping Building" the floors of the enclosures are constructed of wire. In one enclosure at least three
puppies have their feet and legs hanging through the openings in the flooring. One puppy was observed to slightly
struggle to pull its legs back through the openings. Injuries can be caused when the legs and feet pass through
openings in the floor.

Enclosures must have floors that are constructed in a manner that protects the dogs' feet and legs from injury and
does not allow the dogs' feet and legs to pass through any openings. The licensee must alter the flooring in a
manner that does not allow the feet and legs of the puppies to pass through any openings. The licensee must
ensure that the flooring of all enclosures is safe for the dogs at all times.
A verbal correction date of Friday, June 03, 2016 was given at the exit interview.
3.11(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the large outdoor enclosure containing nine Beagles, there are five metal pans and one rubber pan containing
water. There is a layer of dirt on the inside of the bottom of the pans. The pans also have green algae growing in
side of them and clumps of algae and insects floating in the water. Dirt, algae, and insects in the water can
increase the risk of disease hazards towards the dogs.

The licensee dumped out the contaminated water from the pans at the time of the inspection and added clean
drinking water for the dogs. The licensee must ensure that the water remains clean and free of contaminates at all
times in order to promote the health of the dogs.In the smaller outdoor housing enclosures containing three Beagles, the water receptacles are made of hard plastic.
The dogs have excessively chewed and torn the edges of the water receptacles and the damaged areas have
brown dirt embedded into the scratches and grooves. The damage caused by the dogs does not allow for the
surfaces of the water receptacles to be properly cleaned and sanitized which could increase the risk of disease
hazards to the dogs.
In the smaller outdoor enclosures containing three Beagles, feces have become compacted into the wire flooring.
The compacted areas are located along the top of the wood framing that supports the wire floor and the feces
appear dried and have hair embedded in them. In the enclosure containing female Beagle "Mya" a wooden board
beneath the metal access door has a buildup of feces and dirt compacted onto its surface.

In the same enclosures the metal access doors used by the dogs to enter/exit their shelter boxes have a buildup of
thick brown dirt and grime on them. In the first building there is one enclosure, containing one Boston terrier, which
has a thick buildup of dark brown dirt and grime on the metal access door. Within this building there is one
enclosure containing two dogs, which has a buildup of dark brown dirt and grime on the wall next to the access
door.
In the large outdoor enclosure containing nine Beagles, the metal shelter has a buildup of cobwebs hanging from
the ceiling inside of it. The cobwebs have entrapped a heavy amount of dirt and the top part of the back wall is
covered in thick sections of dirt. The buildup of dirt, grime, hair, feces and cobwebs can increase the disease risk
towards the dogs.
Used primary enclosures and food and water receptacles for dogs must be cleaned and sanitized once every two
weeks and more often if necessary to prevent the buildup of dirt, debris, excreta and other disease hazards. The
licensee must remove the buildup of dirt, feces, cobwebs and hair from the access doors, walls, flooring and shelter
to allow for proper cleaning and sanitizing of these surfaces. The licensee must replace the chewed water
receptacles or alter their damaged areas in a manner that allows for proper cleaning and sanitization to occur. The
licensee must ensure that all surfaces within housing enclosures are kept in good repair at all times and free of a
buildup of potential disease hazards.
