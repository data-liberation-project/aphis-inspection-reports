NON-INTERFERENCE WITH APHIS OFFICIALS.
At the beginning of the inspection the licensee was asked by APHIS officials if any additional animals under his
control were housed at other sites or locations. He stated there were no other animals except those housed on the
current premises. Toward the end of the inspection the licensee told Brazoria County officials, who were present
during this inspection, that animals were in fact housed where he was currently living at a location that had not been
disclosed to APHIS.
Providing fraudulent or false information to federal officials regarding the location of animals available for inspection
is paramount to interfering with APHIS officials trying to carrying out their duties. The licensee was attempting to
prevent inspection of animals for the purpose of evaluating his compliance with the standards and regulations under
the Animal Welfare Act.

ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
The facility'(cid:25)s written Program of Veterinary Care was not available for review. This does not allow the inspector to
determine if the plan is current, reflect the care being provided to the animals and is appropriate for the species of
animals. The acquisition forms were not available upon request for 5 brown lemurs, 5 prairie dogs, 2 owl monkeys,
and two striped opossums that the licensee acquired since the last inspection. The documented inventory of
animals on hand at the facility was not available for review. The Program of Veterinary Care, acquisition
documentation and record of animals on hand must be made available for examination by APHIS officials.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The door on one of the wire dog kennels is in disrepair. The metal strips have separated from the frame of the door
and sharp ends are pointed inward. The bottom right part of the door is bent upward causing a gap large enough
for the dog to escape. The pointed ends pose a risk of injuring the animals and the large gap in the gate does not
securely contain the animal. The broken gate must be repaired or replaced to securely contain the animal and
protect the animal from injury. Correct by: June 10, 2015

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the room containing the dog enclosures, there is an excessive accumulation of feces and dried urine on the floor.
The piles of feces exceed 35 in number and 2 dogs reside on the premises. Multiple and excessive piles of feces
were also noted in the general living area of the building that the dogs have access to. Animal waste can be a
harbor for vermin, disease hazards, and odors. Eliminate the excessive buildup of animal waste through proper
waste disposal to minimize infestations, odors, and disease hazards to protect the health and well-being of the
animals.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The primary enclosures housing the brown lemurs are constructed of black metal panels on the upper half. In
multiple areas the bottom of the panels in both enclosures are excessively rusted. Many of the rusted sections flake
to the touch and the damage is extensive enough to result in holes in the metal. This level of deterioration likely
impacts structural integrity of the enclosure.
* The brown lemurs, owl monkeys and spider monkeys have tarps on top of the enclosures to provide shade and
weather protection. In these enclosures sections of the tarps had been pulled through the wire panels and were
hanging inward into the enclosures accessible to the animals. The tarps were damaged and had frayed ends. The
frayed pieces could be accidently wrapped around a body part or ingested resulting in injury or illness in the
animals.
Housing facilities must be designed, constructed and maintained in a manner to be structurally sound and protect
the animals from injury. Housing facilities must be kept in good repair. The damaged areas above should berepaired or replaced. Correct by: July 9, 2015.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The elevated plastic shelter structure in the primary enclosure housing two Java macaques is no longer secured at
the middle seam and appears unstable. The shelf underneath the shelter designed to provide support is wobbly and
bent.
*The gibbon and spider monkey enclosures have green garden hoses installed for the animals to use as brachiating
features and for perching. This type of hose when attached only in a single vertical direction presents a risk of injury
to the animal. The hose could be inadvertently wrapped around a body part. Additionally, the hoses are thin enough
to be easily damaged by the animals. Two unattached ends of the hosing in the gibbon enclosure were noted to
have ingestible size pieces broken off at the ends. Accidental ingestion by the animal could cause life threatening
gastrointestinal illness.
Furnishings and cage accessories must be sturdily constructed and strong enough to provide for safe
activity.These enclosure furnishings should be repaired or replaced. Correct by: June 24, 2015.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
* The enclosure housing the owl monkeys contains an elevated plastic shelter structure that is coated with dark
debris on the interior and exterior surfaces.
*The enclosure housing the spider monkeys contains a plastic shelter structure that has been placed on the floor.
The interior floor of the shelter has a confluent layer of loose dirt and debris in it.
The licensee stated that he does not sanitize enclosure furnishings. All surfaces that come in contact with
non-human primates must be cleaned and sanitized as necessary to minimize opportunity for disease transmission
and meet acceptable husbandry standards. A program should be implemented to address cleaning and sanitizing of
all surfaces inside enclosures that come in contact with the animals. Correct by: June 23. 2015

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An open bag of non-human primate biscuits was stored on the floor in the sugar glider housing facility. This building
is infested with cockroaches, flies and spiders. The risk of contamination by pests is very high for any food source
that is not sealed. Food must be stored in a manner that minimizes the risk of contamination, spoilage, deterioration
of nutritive value and vermin infestation. Open food must be kept in leakproof containers with tightly fitting lids and unopened bags must be kept off the floor
to allow cleaning underneath.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*The primary enclosure housing two red ruffed lemurs has a broken, dislodged wire panel on the interior of the
enclosure on the south side adjacent to the secondary. The broken wires, with a sharp points were jutting inward
toward the enclosure and were accessible to the animals.
*The primary enclosure housing three brown lemurs had a broken wire panel on the interior of the enclosure on the
west side.The broken wire, with a sharp point was jutting at a 90 degree angle into the enclosure with a high risk
and probability of access to and contact with the animals. This non-compliance was corrected during the inspection.
Wire strands with sharp points can injure the animals. Primary enclosures must be maintained so that they have no
sharp points or edges that could cause injury to the animals. The remaining broken wire should be repaired or
replaced.

PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
*The primary enclosure housing two spider monkeys had multiple pieces of broken glass on the floor of the
enclosure.*A large light bulb was on the floor of the same enclosure housing the spider monkeys.
Shards of glass can cause serious injury to the animals. Although the light bulb appeared unbroken the risk for
breakage and subsequent injury to the animals is very high. Primary enclosures must be maintained to prevent
injury to the animals.

WATERING.
*The enclosure housing two brown lemurs had two water bottles attached that were noted to be empty. After
requesting the licensee to provide water to the animals, the lemurs became excited and appeared anxious as the
bottles were re-attached to the cages. Both lemurs drank from the bottles profusely and continuously for 5-6
minutes. Lack of adequate drinking water can cause distress and dehydration. Insufficient water can contribute to
life threatening health conditions. Water must be provided in sufficient quantity as often as necessary to ensure
health and well-being. This non-compliance was corrected by the licensee during the inspection.
*One of the water bottles used in the brown lemur enclosure had an almost confluent, thick layer of green algae
coating the interior surfaces of the bottle. Water receptacles must be cleaned as often as necessary to keep them
free from contamination that could adversely effect the health of the animals.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
*Plastic bags, pieces of plastic and sections of frayed plastic tarp were noted on the floor of the gibbon, lemur and
spider monkey enclosures.
Plastic, if accidently ingested by the animals could cause serious life threatening illness. Premises, including
housing facilities and primary enclosures must be kept free of trash and discarded materials to meet acceptable
housekeeping standards and protect the animals from injury. Correct by: June 9, 2015.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
The licensee stated that he has no pest control program in place. The non-human primates are housed adjacent tobuildings that are infested with cockroaches, flies and spiders. During this inspection numerous flies were noted in
and around the non-human primate enclosures and seen to rest on water bottles, food receptacles, and debris on
the floor of the enclosures. Multiple spider webs containing large spiders were noted adjacent and attached to the
enclosures.
An effective pest control program appropriate for the non-human primates housed outdoors should be designed and
implemented in order to treat and control applicable pests including insects. Insects can facilitate disease
transmission as well as cause distress to the animals from biting or swarming. Correct by: July 9, 2015

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
*The prairie dog enclosure is lifted up off the ground by four wooden leg posts. The back right leg post is leaning
inward and is not structurally sound. The cage is at least 2 foot off the ground and does not appear to be safe for
the animals contained. The enclosure needs to be structurally sound and in good repair in order to protect the
animals from injury and to contain the animals.
*Inside building #2, the paint on the ceiling is peeling off. The ceiling needs to be repaired and maintained in order
to be cleaned and sanitized. Part of the door trim to building #2 has come off. The inspectors observed roaches
coming out of the door where the trim should be. The door trims needs to be repaired in order to protect the health
of the animals from pests and maintained in good repair.
*During the inspection there were 3 sugar gliders outside of their enclosure. Two of the animals were loose inside
the building, while one sugar glider was inside of a condensation tub that was full of water. Animals loose outside
their enclosures could potentially be injured. The enclosures must be structurally sound to protect and contain the
animals. This non-compliance was corrected during the inspection.
*There is excessive amount of rust on many of the sugar glider cages and most cage stands. The cages and metal
stands holding the cages have severe pitting and parts of the rusted metal have broken off due to the excessive
rusting. Due to the excessive rust, the stands are not structurally sound and the cages cannot be sanitized
properly. All enclosures must be free of rust that affects the structural strength of the enclosures and allow for
proper sanitation of the cages. The licensee must repair or replace the rusted cages and stands in order to
maintain the structural integrity of the cages.
3.125(d)
FACILITIES, GENERAL. The two buildings containing the sugar gliders, has an excessive accumulation of trash, animal and food wastes,
and animal bedding lying between the cages. The trash, debris, and animal waste can be a harbor for vermin,
disease hazards, and odors. Eliminate the excessive buildup of animal waste, trash, and debris through proper
disposal from the facility to minimize vermin infestation, odors, and disease hazards.

FACILITIES, INDOOR.
*The sugar glider buildings have a strong ammonia odor at the entrance of the doors. The inspectors had difficulty
breathing during the inspection and experienced discomfort. The strong ammonia odors remained throughout the
inspection of these two buildings. Chronic respiratory irritation can contribute to medical compromises in the
animals.
*In March 2015 the licensee left the area and caretakers were responsible for the animals in his absence. Eleven
sugar gliders died prior to his return. The cause of death was related to excessive moisture condensation in the
room housing the effected sugar gliders according to the licensee. Dehumidifiers are run continuously in the sugar
glider buildings as a normal husbandry practice at this facility. A dehumidifier was not operational or present in the
room during the time of death of the animals. Both buildings housing sugar gliders were noted to have functioning
dehumidifiers at the time of this inspection.
Indoor housing facilities shall be adequately ventilated by natural or mechanical means to provide for the health and
to prevent discomfort of the animals at all times. Such facilities shall be provided with fresh air either by means of
windows, doors, vents, fans, or air-conditioning and shall be ventilated as necessary so as to minimize drafts, odors,
and moisture condensation. Frequent cleaning of enclosures (as often as necessary) and increased ventilation will
help maintain healthy air quality to protect the health and welfare of the animals.

FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
*The facility perimeter fence is damaged on the north end. The fence is leaning, loose and a gap exists at the
bottom of the damaged area that can allow small animals to pass through.
*On the north end of the facility brush and weeds adjacent to the perimeter fence are dense and high prohibiting any
visual access of the fence. The perimeter fence must be kept in good repair to prevent unwanted animals and persons from gaining access to
the facility, and to function as a secondary containment system in case of animal escape. Visual and physical
access to the fence must be maintained so that the fence can be inspected for structural integrity and repairs.

3.131(a)
SANITATION.
The sugar glider cages have excreta and food particles inside and along the edges of the cages. The catch pans
for fecal matter and urine has accumulation of excreta built up on the pans. Excreta should be removed as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals contained, reduce disease hazards and odors. The cleaning
schedule of these enclosures should be more timely and effective to prevent the build-up of excreta and odors.

SANITATION.
*The two sugar glider buildings have an accumulation of brownish material on the ceilings, walls, and window sills.
*There is excessive amount of dirt, brownish material, and debris on the floors throughout each building.
*The coati-mundi babies are housed in an enclosure located inside a room that houses two dogs. The room had
an excessive amount of dog urine and feces throughout the entire room.
*The premises have debris and trash lying on the ground throughout the facility. Inadequate cleaning of the
buildings and premises can lead to pest infestation, odors, and harbor diseases that are harmful to the animals. All
buildings and premises must be kept clean, cleared, and in good repair to protect the health of the animals.

3.131(d)
SANITATION.
The two buildings containing the sugar gliders have an excessive amount of flies, roaches, and spiders throughout
each of the buildings. At the undisclosed site, the baby sugar glider cage had an accumulation of flies swarming
around inside of the cage. Pests can transmit disease and can act as an irritant. The excessive accumulation of
flies, roaches, and spiders is an indicator of an ineffective pest control program. The facility needs to develop an
effective pest control program to control insects and other pests.
