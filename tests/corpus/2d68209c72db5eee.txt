ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:40 am on
17-MAR-17.
Went to the SEA site listed on the registration. Suite 14 appeared vacant; no signage was present, and no answer
when I knocked on the door. In addition, Suite 15 was not present at this address. Called the contact number on
March 20, 2017; however, the message stated that a voicemail had not been set up.
