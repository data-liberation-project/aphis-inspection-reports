Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
There is a failure to provide follow up veterinary care for the following animals that were placed on treatment and
monitoring plans by the AV on September 9, 2021. These animals were to be re-evaluated by the veterinarian on
September 23, 2021 but were not:
***One male white-tailed deer previously under veterinary care for emaciated body condition was slated for re-evaluation
on 09/23/2021 but died after that date, without receiving a re-evaluation by the veterinarian.
***One female white-tailed deer has a poor hair coat with patches missing with pink skin showing beneath in multiple
places along both her sides; another female white-tailed deer in the same enclosure remains thinner than the others.
***One adult male white-tailed deer is observed to be emaciated, with an enlarged abdomen. The vertebrae, hips, and
long bones are visible, and each rib is easily seen by both APHIS inspectors upon inspection.
***There is a male sika deer with prominent ribs, vertebrae and hips and very little muscle covering the hindquarters. The
hair coat and overall body condition are poor.
***There is one, adult male camel that is thin, with prominent vertebrae below the hump and decreased musculature over
the ribs and hip bones.
***There are approximately nine adult addax that are thin, with ribs, vertebrae and hip bones prominent and very little


muscle over the hindquarters; depressions alongside the tail head are obvious in many of these animals.
***There are five to six adult oryx that are thin, with ribs, vertebrae and hip bones prominent and some with very little
muscle over the hindquarters.
***There is one, very thin female oryx with a mass on its chest; the mass appears to have a tag or scab on the underside
but otherwise remains the same as previously noted. The vertebrae, ribs and hip bones are easily seen.
***One lame female ibex remains lame and still carries her left foreleg forward.
***One adult female muntjac is observed to have left forelimb lameness and carries the leg outward in front of her without
bearing weight on it. The licensee had not noticed the lameness the day prior but mentioned that he thought it might be
from males attempting to mount the female.
The facility must ensure that all animals showing potential signs of veterinary medical problems are evaluated by a
veterinarian in a timely manner in order to receive an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan, including any
follow up evaluations and further recommendations by the veterinarian. Poor body condition can be an indication of health
issues, including parasitism, poor dentition, malnutrition, and systemic disease. Lameness can be caused by a variety of
issues including infection, injury, or other medical conditions and can be painful and distressing and affect the health and
well-being of the animal. Masses may represent a condition that is painful or even life-threatening to an animal and
should be duly evaluated and managed under veterinary care. In all of these cases, the failure to assure initial and follow
up veterinary care to the animals (to include diagnostics where appropriate) in a timely manner can contribute to
worsening health and well-being by delaying treatment and recovery, and prolonging suffering.
The licensee must ensure that all animals at the facility are provided with adequate veterinary care, as described by the
attending veterinarian and the program of veterinary care. The program for providing adequate veterinary care shall
include the use of appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries. The licensee was


verbally instructed on the day of inspection that all animals listed in this citation must be evaluated by a veterinarian, with
diagnostic/treatment plans and written guidance provided which must be followed by close of business on October 7,
2021.
2.40(b)(3) Direct

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
***There is an adult red deer buck that is in thin body condition, with prominent ribs, vertebrae and hip bones in view. The
licensee has not noticed that the animal is in unsatisfactory body condition.
***There is an adult female addax with an ~4” diameter mass on the right jaw. The licensee first reported that he hadn’t
noticed the mass, but toward the end of the inspection told the inspectors that the mass was mentioned to the veterinarian
the day prior.
Poor body condition can be an indication of health issues, including parasitism, poor dentition, malnutrition, and systemic
disease. Masses may represent a condition that is painful or even life-threatening to an animal and should be duly
evaluated and managed under veterinary care. The facility must ensure that all animals are checked daily and that any
potential problems are discussed as soon as possible with the veterinarian in order to receive guidance or assistance in a
timely manner.
The licensee was verbally instructed on the day of inspection that all animals listed in this citation must be communicated
to and evaluated by a veterinarian, with diagnostic/treatment plans and written guidance provided which must be followed
by close of business on October 7, 2021.
2.75(b)(1) Repeat

Records: Dealers and exhibitors.
At the time of inspection, there are no records available for inspection to reflect the acquisition or birth of two muntjacs,
and no disposition records to document the absence of three ibex. Records containing the required information for


animals removed from the inventory for any reason or acquired for use in regulated activities, including those offspring
born on premise, are necessary to accurately track animals to ensure their humane care and use. The licensee shall
make, keep, and maintain records of acquisition and disposition of all animals that fully and correctly disclose the required
information.
3.80(a)(2)(i)

Primary enclosures.
In the lemur barn, the primary enclosures containing a total of one neonatal and nine adult ring-tailed lemurs have multiple
areas that are rusted through and broken to produce sharp edges. Damaged enclosures with sharp edges can injure the
animals. Primary enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that they have no sharp points or edges that could
injure the non-human primates. TO BE CORRECTED BY OCTOBER 13, 2021.
3.81 Repeat

Environment enhancement to promote psychological well-being.
At the time of inspection, the plan for environmental enhancement for the nonhuman primates, which covers two spider
monkeys, three lar gibbons and 12 ring-tailed lemurs is inadequate and is not being followed. There is limited
environmental enrichment within the enclosures, which consists of items for climbing and swinging, but none that facilitate
cognitive/sensory enrichment. Several enrichment tactics/objects are mentioned in the plan but not seen in the primary
enclosures. Many of the ropes and other items are very soiled and have not been changed out for quite some time,
meaning that they are not easily cleaned and that they are no longer novel and engaging for the animals. Environmental
enhancement is important to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. Plans developed for
environmental enhancement of non-human primates should addresses social grouping, environmental enrichment, and
other special considerations such as juveniles and individually housed animals, and they must also be followed for each


nonhuman primate at the facility. Environmental enhancement plans for non-human primates must be in accordance with
the currently accepted professional standards and approved by the attending veterinarian.
3.84(a) Repeat

Cleaning, sanitization, housekeeping, and pest control.
***In the enclosures housing a total of one neonatal ring-tailed lemur, two juvenile ring-tailed lemurs and nine adult ring-
tailed lemurs, there are accumulations of feces covering areas as large as 24”X6” and dozens of other, smaller fecal piles
scattered throughout the enclosure floors– indicating that cleaning and sanitation frequencies or methods are not
adequate.
***An enclosure containing one juvenile ring-tailed lemur has cobwebs, hair, dirt and debris or fecal matter caked along
the bottom of one side.
Routine cleaning and sanitation must be done daily to protect the health and well-being of nonhuman primates. Dirt, fecal
material, food waste, and other debris must be removed daily to prevent contamination of food, prevent nonhuman
primates from becoming soiled and to reduce disease hazards.
3.85 Repeat

Employees.
The facility owner states that he and the other licensee do what they can to provide adequate cleaning, feeding, general
husbandry and facility maintenance for all of the non-human primates and other animals. The licensees previously stated
that they knew they did not have enough help to do all that is needed and hired a part time helper. However, it is evident
throughout the facility as noted in the non-compliances cited throughout this report that there is still not enough labor help.
Without an adequate labor force, animals and facilities cannot be properly managed and cared for, leading to
circumstances that compromise the health and well-being of the animals. Every person subject to the Animal Welfare
regulations maintaining non-human primates must have enough employees to carry out the required level of husbandry


practices and care. The licensee must acquire sufficient help to manage the animals and facilities according to the Animal
Welfare regulations.
3.125(a) Repeat

Facilities, general.
***In the enclosure containing 25 hog deer, the wire fence material has sharp edges exposed. These sharp points at the
bottom of the fence face into the enclosure where the animals could come into contact with them.
***In the enclosures housing the white-tailed deer, five sika deer, 20 addax, 11 oryx, 1 barbary sheep, 12 axis deer, one
female ibex and five muntjacs, the shade structures have metal panels and are worn and rusted; the exposed metal has
jagged edges that the animals could come into contact with.
***The shade material covering the fence enclosure of the five muntjacs is in disrepair and coming loose from the fence to
which it is attached. The shade material is creating gaps along one side of the enclosure that can come into contact with
the animals. The loose shade material could lead to entrapment or injury of these animals.
All enclosures must be kept in good repair and free of sharp points, protruding edges, holes, and gaps/openings in order
to protect the animals from injury. Failure to maintain housing facilities in a structurally sound manner can cause injury to
the animals. A system of monitoring and maintenance should be in place so that all housing facilities remain structurally
sound and in good repair to protect the animals from injury and/or escape.
3.127(a)

Facilities, outdoor.
In the enclosure housing most of the Nubian ibex, there is no structure to protect the animals from the sun or other
elements. Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause overheating or discomfort to the animals. Sufficient shade by
natural or artificial means must be provided to allow all animals kept outdoors to protect themselves from direct sunlight.
TO BE CORRECTED BY OCTOBER 13, 2021.


3.130 Repeat

Watering.
The enclosure containing most of the Nubian ibex has a single water receptacle containing water that has become
greenish brown and very cloudy, with debris floating on the surface. Unpotable water can be unpalatable to animals and
lead to illness. It is the responsibility of the licensee to make sure that potable water is accessible to the animals at all
times or be provided as often as necessary, and that all water receptacles are kept clean and sanitary for the health and
well-being of the animals.
3.131(c) Repeat

Sanitation.
***In an enclosure containing one adult male bobcat, the round, plastic container that serves as the litterbox has an
excessive accumulation of fecal material in the litter, leaving little loose litter for use and producing an unpleasant odor.
The degree of accumulation suggests that the litterbox has not been cleaned for multiple days. Fecal accumulation
attracts pests and can cause soiling of the animals. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as
necessary to prevent contamination of the animals, minimize disease hazards and reduce odors.
***Throughout the property and areas surrounding animal buildings and enclosures, there are piles of debris containing
old furniture, cardboard, machine parts and numerous other materials that are covered in layers of dust and dirt. Some
piles are present against the walls and near the entrances of animal housing areas. Accumulations of debris such as
these harbor vermin and insects that can contaminate food or spread disease to animals kept nearby. Premises
(buildings and grounds) shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate
the prescribed husbandry practices set forth in the regulations.
3.132 Direct Repeat

Employees.


The facility owner states that he and the other licensee do what they can to provide animal care and husbandry, cleaning
and maintenance of facilities for all of the animals. The licensees previously stated that they knew they did not have
enough help to do all that is required and hired a part time helper. However, it is evident throughout the facility (as noted
in the non-compliances cited throughout this report) that there is still not enough help. Without an adequate labor force,
animals and facilities cannot be properly managed and cared for, leading to circumstances that compromise the health
and well-being of the animals. A sufficient number of adequately trained employees shall be utilized to maintain the
professionally acceptable level of husbandry practices as set forth in the regulations.
