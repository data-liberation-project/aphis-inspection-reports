ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
****An adult male blue and tan Yorkshire terrier "Cody" ID# 407 has a thick hard brownish material adhered to his
upper left canine tooth, and the upper front tooth next to the canine. This upper left tooth next to the canine was
loose to the touch. There is a dark colored discharge along the gum-line. Other teeth could not be visualized due
to the dog's reluctance to let the inspector handle his mouth.
****A male Yorkshire terrier "Trump" ID #347 has a thick hard brownish material adhered to at least half of the
surface on most teeth and the gums were receded on most teeth. On the dog's upper right front part of the mouth,
the tooth in front of the canine tooth was loose to the touch. The bottom front long teeth had hair matted around
them making it difficult to see the gum-line. On the upper left side of the mouth the middle tooth behind the canine
tooth was loose to the touch and had a pale colored discharge along the gum-line.
Dental problems can be painful, make it difficult to eat, lead to the development of other health problems, and affect
the well-being of the animal.
The licensee must have these dogs evaluated by the veterinarian for proper diagnosis and treatment, and provide
the inspector the documentation of this visit upon request.
