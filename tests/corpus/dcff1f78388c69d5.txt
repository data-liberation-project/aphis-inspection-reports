INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***The IACUC committee meets "officially" twice a year with regular discussions via email occurring as needed. The
unaffiliated member has not attended the last two official meetings which are also the semi annual inspections. The
absence of the unaffiliated member/community representative indicates the committee is not fully constituted. An
active community representative must be added to the committee to consider it fully constituted. Correct by October
13, 2014.
2.31(c)(3)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***The semi annual reports reviewed for October 2013 and March 2014 do not include a program review. The
reports submitted include the facility site inspections but there is no review of the humane care and use of animals
or program review. A narrative describing the nature and extent of the research facility's adherence to this
subchapter must be included in the semiannual report to be sent to the Institutional Official as required in this
section. Correct by October 21, 2014.
2.31(e)(2)
INSTITUTIONAL ANIMAL CARE AND USE COMMITTEE (IACUC).
***Several of the teaching protocols reviewed do not provide an adequate rationale for the appropriateness of the
use of animals in the studies. These protocols use a blanket statement that there are no satisfactory substitutes but
there is no rationale or description on how they arrived at that conclusion. The protocols must provide the rationale
used to determine it is appropriate to use animals. Correct by October 2014.
3.11(b)(3)(3)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***There is a buildup of a greyish substance which appears to be a combination of dust and residue on the surfaces
of the concrete walls of the dog runs. I was able to easily scrape some of this substance off by hand but it was not
being removed by the wash down process observed during this inspection. The washing of soiled surfaces withappropriate detergent solutions and disinfectants or by other methods as described in this section should be
effective in facilitating a thorough cleaning by removing organic material and residues. The enclosures shall be
thoroughly cleaned to prevent buildup, thereby minimizing the risk of disease hazards and protecting the health and
well-being of the dogs. (affects 12 dogs)Correct by June 4, 2014.
3.11(c)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
***Several structures or items in the cat room (sink, window sills, vents, tables, etc) do not appear to have been
cleaned during the daily room cleaning processes. There is dust and hair accumulating on these surfaces. These
areas in the room housing the cat enclosures shall be regularly cleaned to prevent buildup of dust and hair to
facilitate good husbandry practices. Correct by May 29, 2014.
