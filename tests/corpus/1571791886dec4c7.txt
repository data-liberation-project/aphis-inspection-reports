Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
Two adult llamas had noticeably overgrown hooves. Although the llamas’ forelimb footpads maintained their normal
positioning and placement, the toenails were strikingly overgrown, deviating to the side. The facility representative stated
the llamas’ hooves had not been trimmed due to recent weather conditions, as they’ve been waiting for drier
accommodations at the facility.
Overgrown hooves can lead to pain, discomfort, and subsequent lameness. Under chronic conditions, the conformation of
the toes can become compromised, resulting in long-term malformations. All animals needing feet trimming should have
their hooves trimmed in a timely manner, and as frequently as necessary for foot health.

This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the facility representative and licensee.
