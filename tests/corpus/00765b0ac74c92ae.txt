2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
One kinkajou was seen not weight bearing on its left hind limb and it would not use the limb to move around the
enclosure. The injury had been observed by a caretaker the day before but the attending veterinarian had not been
contacted and the program of veterinary care on file did not provide instructions on how to care for this observation.
Failure to seek proper diagnosis and treatment for an injury may result in pain to the animal and worsening of the
condition. The licensee must establish and maintain programs of adequate veterinary care that include appropriate
methods to prevent, control, diagnose, and treat diseases and injuries.
The kinkajou was taken to the veterinarian after the inspection.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
At the time of inspection, there was no written plan in place for environmental enhancement for any of the
nonhuman primates, including 29 ring-tailed lemurs, 3 gibbons, 2 spider monkeys, 2 brown capuchins, 2 cotton-top
tamarins, 1 Geoffery's tamarin, and 1 squirrel monkey. There was no evidence of environmental enrichment within
the enclosures and multiple nonhuman primates were housed individually, including the juvenile squirrel monkey
and the three gibbons. Environmental enhancement is important to promote the psychological well-being of
nonhuman primates. A plan for environmental enhancement that addresses social grouping, environmental
enrichment, and other special considerations such as juveniles and individually housed animals, must be developed
and followed for each nonhuman primate at the facility. This plan must be in accordance with the currently accepted
professional standards and approved by the attending veterinarian.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
In the enclosure housing two adult spider monkeys, there was an accumulation of hair and feces on the wire meshabove the door and on the floor.
In the enclosure housing two adult brown capuchin monkeys, there was an accumulation of food debris and feces
on the bench inside the shelter.
Routine cleaning and sanitation must be done daily to protect the health and well-being of nonhuman primates.
Fecal material, food waste, and other debris must be removed daily to prevent nonhuman primates from becoming
soiled and to reduce disease hazards.

WATERING.
3.130
Multiple enclosures throughout the facility had water bowls or troughs that were covered in thick, slimy green-brown
material and had debris floating on the surface. It is the responsibility of the licensee to make sure all water
receptacles be kept clean and sanitary for the overall health and well-being of the animal.
