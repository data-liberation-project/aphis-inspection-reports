ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
*** Male Maltese #118 was found limping on the right rear leg during this inspection. Upon examination, the right
rear foot appears reddened in between the pads. The licensee was not aware of the dog limping and did not have
any documentation of the any problem with this dog. The licensee did begin treatment on this foot per the written
recommendations in the Program of Veterinary Care. Failure to identify animals with health problems so treatment
can be given can result in animals suffering unnecessarily. Correct this by ensuring all animals problems are
identified and documented during required daily observations.
Correct from this day forward.
Facility inspection conducted on 21 July 2015, records inspection and exit interview conducted on 22 July 2015.
Both inspection days conducted with the licensee, Randy Coleman, ACI, and Liz Bartels, ACI.
