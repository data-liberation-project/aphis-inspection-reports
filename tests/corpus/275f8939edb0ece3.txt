ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE.
***On May 2, 2013, a 1-month old male pig-tailed macaque (ID #Z13068) along with its mother, were introduced to
their assigned breeding group following a 2 day protected contact period when the infant was attacked.
Approximately 15-20 minutes after open contact was established, the single adult male of the group attacked the
infant. The infant sustained extensive trauma and was euthanized by the veterinarian.
In a separate breeding group, on May 30, 2013, a 6-month old male pig-tailed macaque (ID #Z13080), was attacked
by the adult male in its group. That animal (ID #Z13080), subsequently died from its injuries. In another separate
incident on June 12, 2013, a 9-month old female pig-tailed macaque (ID #Z12341) was attacked by an adult male,
through mesh contact and was euthanized by the veterinarian.
Following the May 2nd attack, the veterinarian notified the facility behavioral management group of the incident. The
veterinarian and the behavioral group also discussed the temperament and behavioral history of the male that was
involved in the May 2nd attack. There were no subsequent dam/infant pairs placed with the male involved in the
May 2nd attack. Following the May 30th attack, all males were removed from breeding groups until new group
assignments and behavioral assessments were complete. Mesh contact remained following the May 30th attack, as
to not completely disrupt the groups.
It is common for males, including male primates, to attack and kill young offspring of their species (known as
infanticide). Knowing this behavior (as stated by the facility) and that it was occurring at the facility, it is the
veterinarian's and the facility's responsibility to prevent this behavior and any subsequent injuries. Preventative
action should have been taken following the May 2nd attack, before the attacks on May 30th and June 12th. The
facility has implemented changes in their group housing policy. After June 12, 2013, young primates are no longer
housed with adult males, in order to prevent future attacks.
An inspection was started on 7/14/14 and finished on 8/1/14 to review animal enclosures and animal medical
records.Exit interview was conducted on-site with the veterinarian on 8/7/14.
