HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** Against "Juanita" the olive baboons primary enclosure there was a cracked dead tree that was leaning on the
outside of the primary enclosure that could potentially damage it and possibly cause injury to the animal. The
primary enclosure shall be maintained to protect the animals from injury. It was corrected by the exit interview
3.75(c)(3) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In "Juanita" the olive baboon, "Chucky" the rhesus macaque and "Pamela" the spider monkey's night houses
there was old feces, dirt and debris in the rear of it and had not been spot-cleaned daily. Hard surfaces in which
nonhuman primates come in contact must be spot cleaned daily and sanitized to prevent accumulation of excreta or
disease hazards.
3.80(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
** In "Juanita" the olive baboon's primary enclosure there was a 2 x 6 board that was attached to the border of the
night house that had an exposed nail. In the brown lemurs enclosure there was also an exposed nail head and a
gap between to supporting post on the primary enclosure in which the animals could potentially get hung or stuck in.
The primary enclosure shall be designed and constructed to prevent the animals from injury. Correct by August 26,
2015
** In "Chucky" the rhesus macaque's primary enclosure there was a triangular hole in the wire approximately eight
inches at one end and about eight inches long. There is potential for the animal to become entrapped, escape or
another animal to enter the primary enclosure. The housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be kept in good
repair and protect the animal from injury, contain the animal and restrict other animals from entering. Correct by
August 23, 2015.3.82(d)
FEEDING.
** The spider monkey and the bonnet macaque had feeding bowls that were sitting in the dirt outside the enclosure.
They are required to reach through the fence to retrieve the food from the feeding bowls. The area outside the
enclosure is not required to be cleaned or sanitized and not secure to keep vermin and pests from contaminating
the feed. The feeding bowls shall be located so as to minimize any risk of contamination by pests and vermin.

FACILITIES, GENERAL.
** In the primary enclosure containing a tiger, the front part of the enclosure is 16 feet tall straight up at the highest
point. There is vegetation growing up the side of the fence causing the fence to sag several feet in two areas. At
several points there were pieces of 2x4 lumber that were supporting the uppermost part of the fence that were
rotten and needs to be repaired and/or replaced. The primary enclosure fence needs to be maintained to ensure
that the fencing is the height that can appropriately contain the animals and in good repair.
(cid:9)
** The coatimundi's cage has an old rusted wire fence on the inner side of the newer fencing. Parts of this older
fencing has broken pointy ends. The coatimundi's climb all over the cage and the pointy ends could potentially
injure the animals. The fencing of the primary enclosure shall be structurally sound and shall be maintained in good
repair to protect the animals from injury.
** In the cougars primary enclosure there was a hole in the top of the platform. A nail head was also exposed. The
wood platform was also cracked in the middle. There is potential for the cougars to entrap their foot in the hole and
cause injury. There is also potential for the cougars to injure themselves on the exposed nail head and for the
platform to break under the weight of the cougars. The platform shall be maintained in good repair to protect the
animals from injury.
** Around the black bears primary enclosure there are posts stabilizing the fencing horizontally that needs repairing
and replacing. There is potential for the fencing to come down allowing the animals to escape. The post shall be
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury.
** In the grizzly bears primary enclosure there is a large hole that is directly beneath a thin concrete slab. Since the
concrete is so thin and the hole beneath it is so large, with the constant traffic of the bears walking on it, it could
potentially collapse causing injury to the bears. The flooring in the enclosure shall be structurally sound and
maintained in good repair to protect the animals from injury. It was corrected by the exit interview.3.127(c)
FACILITIES, OUTDOOR.
** In the grizzly bear's enclosure there was an area adjacent to the pond that was muddy that the bears were
walking through. An area that doesn't drain and that allows water and mud to accumulate has the potential to cause
sanitation related diseases. A suitable method shall be provided to rapidly eliminate excess water. Correct by
September 18, 2015
3.131(c)
SANITATION.
** The top of the tigers enclosure was covered in decomposing old leaves and debris. The top of the sheet metal
roof could not be observed and could potentially degrade the roof causing it to be in disrepair. Please keep the roof
of the enclosure cleaned and free of old leaves and debris. Correct by August 20, 2015
** In the goats and sheep enclosure there were several strands of green hay twine scattered across the ground and
it needs to be removed. The animals could potentially ingest the twine or get tangled in it. It was corrected by the
exit interview.
** In the black bears enclosure there was a pool that appeared dirty and in need of cleaning. The facility stated that
they clean the pools once a week. There are 4 bears in this enclosure utilizing this pool. The frequency in which this
pool is cleaned out for the black bears may need to be increased to prevent disease hazards or illness of the
animals. Correct by August 23, 2015.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the owner and Bart Sutherland, VMO.
