ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 1055 on
06/23/2016. I knocked on the door and the landlord came out. The landlord informed me the licensee was not
home. I called the licensee and left a message. I waited for 30 minutes in my car before leaving. After I left, I
received a phone call back from the number I left a message on. The person who called back informed me I had
the wrong number.
End of report.
