LOST TAGS.
Approximately 21 adult dogs do not have official identification because their tags have been lost and not replaced.
Official identification is necessary to track dogs throughout the kennel. Whenever tags are lost the licensees must
make an attempt in locating them and reapplying them to the dogs. If lost tags are not located the licensees must
affix another tag to the dog. Correct by 9 April 2015.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The following areas are in need of repair:
The wooden support for the shade material in one enclosure is broken allowing the shade material to sag.
The welded wire fence lining the wire panels in one enclosure is bunched up exposing the dogs to openings in the
welded wire fencing.
Pieces of carpet are being used for door flaps on two enclosures. These have been shredded and now strands of
carpet are hanging into the doorway.
These areas could cause injury to the dogs housed in these enclosures. All housing facilities for the dogs must be
designed and constructed so they are structurally sound and must be kept in good repair to protect the dogs from
injury. Correct by 26 April 2015.
