FEEDING.
In the “mom & baby” room, one plastic tub enclosure had a large amount of fecal material smeared on enclosure
wall above and around the food bowl. This and another enclosure had fecal material and bedding contamination of
the feed within the food bowl. This situation can negatively impact the health and well-being of animals and
increase the risk of disease and illness. All food bowls shall be kept cleaned and sanitized and replaced when
soiled. The food bowls should placed in enclosures in such a way as to minimize contamination to ensure a clean
food supply at all times. Correct by 1/9/2017.

SANITATION.
In the adult hedgehog room, three exercise wheels had heavy fecal contamination affecting 6 hedgehogs and
another two wheels (4 hedgehogs) had milder fecal contamination. Fecal material was built up inside the wheel
covering most of the running surface and up the sides. Some large chucks of fecal material were stuck to outer
edges of wheel. Fecal material build up on items in the enclosure can pose risks to the health of the animals and
lead to pest problems. Excreta shall be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent
contamination of the animals and to minimize disease hazards and to reduce odors. All enclosures and items within
need to be cleaned appropriately and/or replaced to prevent fecal material buildup. Correct by 1/9/2017.
