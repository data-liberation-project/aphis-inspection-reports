ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A responsible adult was not available to accompany APHIS Officials during the inspection process at 11:30am on
15-Feb-18.
I arrived at the facility at 11:30am. There was a loose yard dog that prevented me from knocking on the door. I
called the owner on the phone and left a voicemail. I waited 30 minutes for a return call. I called the number again
before leaving at 12:00pm.
