2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
In the surgery at the veterinary hospital it was discovered that the anesthesia machines had not had routine
maintenance performed on them. There was no record of maintenance and calibration, and no "service due" dates
were on the machines.
The facility should ensure that appropriate methods are employed when administering anesthesia, and this includes
ensuring that anesthesia machines are maintained in optimal condition. Failure to maintain such standards could
result in adverse effects for animals undergoing anesthesia.
To be corrected by 10/22/15.

HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
On 6/24/14 a chimpanzee escaped from its enclosure, twice. The animal was successfully returned to its enclosure
without any further incident, and modifications were subsequently made to the enclosure to prevent a recurrence.
Enclosures for non-human primates must be constructed in a manner so that they contain the animals securely, in
order to protect the animals and the public. An enclosure that allows escape puts the animal and the public at
serious risk.
Modifications have been made to the enclosure, which the facility believes have corrected the problem. The facility
should constantly review the integrity of the enclosure, its appropriateness for the animals contained, education of
personnel responsible for moving the animals and positioning furniture in the enclosure, and the emergency
response for animal escapes, assuring that all members of the team are in agreement, and know the approved
response tactics. These issues should be reviewed immediately, and regularly from this time forward.
3.75(c)(1) REPEAT
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL. Whereas some repairs have been made to the surfaces within non-human primate enclosures, the following
problems were observed:
Chimpanzees - Metal fixtures around windows and gates had some missing paint and rust, inside the night house.
Walls had some discolored areas, and there were spots where the smooth surface material was missing, and might
be flaking and / or exposing non-sealed, porous concrete.
Lemurs - Rust discoloration around the opening that goes from the night house to the display yard. Peeling paint on
the guillotine door for this opening. Missing patches of paint / epoxy / concrete on the floor.
Siamang - In night house - Bare patches on the flooring surface that may be peeling off. Missing paint patches on
the wall. Paint peeling off of metal perches.
Francois Langurs - Walls and floor in the outside main yard have areas where the surface material is missing, or
flaking off, exposing concrete that may be porous.
Golden Lion Tamarins - These animals had nest boxes in their enclosures that were made of plywood. One was
removable, but the other was not, which would make it very difficult to clean. Both had interiors comprised of bare
plywood, which cannot be readily cleaned and disinfected.
All surfaces in the housing facilities for nonhuman primates must be constructed in a manner that allows them to be
adequately cleaned and disinfected. Surfaces should be kept in good repair and maintained or replaced on a
regular basis, in order to facilitate adequate cleaning and disinfection, and to protect the animals from harm. Peeling
paint and corrosion could present an ingestion risk, could threaten structural integrity, and impede adequate
cleaning and disinfection. Bare wood nest boxes cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected.
This issue has been cited previously, with correction dates previous to this inspection.
An exit interview was conducted with facility representatives.
