FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Four tiger enclosures: The lower panels of wood at the bottom of the openings of the den boxes were broken and
splintered with jagged top edges. The den boxes must be kept in good repair to protect and prevent injury to the
animals from the edges of the wood panels upon entry and exit of the den boxes. A system of timely identification
and replacement or repair of maintenance problems must be in place to protect the animals from injury.
Fox enclosure: In the southeast corner and in front of the shelter box area of the enclosure, there is wire flooring
material with approximately 2 inch gaps exposed above the ground. The presence of exposed or inappropriately
placed wiring material may lead to animals being trapped or injured. These areas must be identified, kept in good
repair and maintained to protect the animals and prevent injury to limbs and keep them from being entrapped
between flooring/wiring materials.
Mule deer enclosure: The shelter structure located in the southeast corner of the pen had an approximately 2.5 ft
long X 3/4 inch wide gap in the corrugated metal sheeting on the shelter'(cid:25)s west wall. The gapping in the metal
created sharp, protruding edges along its length. Failure to maintain primary enclosures in good repair may lead to
injury to the deer, including puncture wounds from sharp edges and trapping limbs or antlers in holes or gaps. A
system of maintenance and repair must be in place.
