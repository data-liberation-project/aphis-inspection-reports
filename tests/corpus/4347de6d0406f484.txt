3.31(b)
SANITATION.
There is a build-up of dust, dirt, and cobwebs on the walls, ceilings, vents, and filters of the three rooms housing the
hamsters. There are also accumulations of bedding material and rodent droppings on the floor within the hamster
rooms. Failure to clean animal facilities regularly can adversely affect the health of the hamsters and can potentially
attract pests. The facility must maintain the premise by keeping it clean and in good repair in order to protect the
animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed husbandry practices. The dusty filters in animal rooms must be
replaced or cleaned to ensure appropriate air quality, and the shavings and droppings must be removed to prevent
pests.
