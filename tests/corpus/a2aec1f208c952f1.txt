**On inspection, a one year old adult female cougar appeared to be severely underweight. The shapes of all
individual vertebrae are showing. The outline of the entire lateral aspect of the hip and shoulder blade are visible.
The thighs appeared to be sunken as often seen with muscle loss. The staff was aware of weight-loss, but did not
contact a veterinarian.
**A three year old female white tiger appeared slightly underweight. The vertebral bodies were slightly showing and
the hips appeared sunken in. The licensee reported he gave 20 pounds of chicken to this tiger in the afternoon. At
direction from APHIS officials, the licensee gave an additional 10 pounds of raw chicken. The tiger quickly ate 7-8
pounds and gradually finished the remaining chicken. A veterinarian was not contacted in regards to this animal(cid:25)s
weight loss.
Weight-loss can be a sign of multiple diseases or an improper diet. Under-weight animals do not have the adequate
energy reserves for normal body functions and is highly stressful to the animal. On example, the immune system is
often severely hampered in times of stress and poor body condition. An animal with significant weight-loss at the
beginning of winter is especially dangerous, because there is little to no reserves for the animal to keep itself warm
in the cold weather. Significant weight-loss can cause death or other serious medical conditions. At the first sign of
weight-loss, a veterinarian must be consulted and an appropriate treatment must be enacted to increase weight in
the animal.
** The 18 year old Siberian tiger was observed moving very slowly and his hind quarters would sway unsteadily as
he walked. Both of his hind legs appeared very stiff as he moved. His right hind leg appeared to be a little stiffer
and less functional than the left hind leg. He appeared to counteract the discomfort by adjusting his weight to his
other legs as he walked. This caused him to hold his body in an abnormal position. Given the observations and age
of the tiger, the licensee indicated he believe the animal had arthritis. The Licensee stated that he knew the animal
was in pain. He stated that the animal had started showing these signs about two weeks ago and has steadily
gotten worse with the cold weather. Licensee made contact with the attending veterinarian by phone at the time of
inspection. After talking to the veterinarian, Licensee informed inspectors that the attending veterinarian had called
in a prescription to the local pharmacy for Meloxicam. Serious signs of pain and discomfort need to be addressed as soon as they are identified. Although the Attending
Veterinarian has called in a prescription for this animal, it will still need to be seen by the attending veterinarian for
proper diagnosis. Documentation of examination, diagnosis and treatment plan must be maintained by the
Licensee and made available for inspection.

On inspection, three tigers mentioned above were in need of veterinary care. Licensee stated that he had observed
the issues during daily observation but did not communicate any of the issues to the attending veterinarian. Failure
to report underweight animals or signs of sever health issues to a veterinarian results in diseases not being treated
in a timely manner and can result in the further progression of the weight loss. Other illness not reported results in
delayed treatments which further an animal(cid:25)s pain and discomfort. Provide an accurate and timely means of
communication so that all problems (including weight loss) for all animals are reported to a veterinarian in an
accurate and timely manner. Correct this day forward.

SHELTERED HOUSING FACILITIES.
There are two Japanese Snow macaques are housed in a shelter type enclosure. The non-macaques have access
to an outside yard and an inside portion of a building. Inside the building, there is a platform with a heat lamp
directed towards the under portion of the platform. Inspectors observed the female macaques sitting on the
platform. She was huddled in and making her body as small as possible. She was also observed to be shivering.
Inspectors took two different temperatures at 1:09PM during the inspection. The first temperature was 26.3 degrees
and was taken inside the building where the non-human primate was actively sitting. The second temperature was
28 degrees and was taken outside of the building in the outdoor weather conditions.
When inspectors went back to the facility, the heat lamp was re-adjusted and directed towards the upper portion of
the platform. The female macaque was sitting directly in front of the heat source and was no longer noticed to be
shivering. The inspectors took two more temperatures at 6:04PM in the exact same locations they were taken at
1:09PM. The first temperature was 28 degrees and was taken inside the building where the non-human primate was
actively sitting. The Second temperature was 14.4 degrees and was taken outside of the building in the outdoor
weather conditions. Licensee moved the heat lamp to allow inspectors to get an accurate reading of the
temperature under the heat source. The temperature approximately one foot away from the heat source was about
64 degrees. To protect nonhuman primates from temperature extremes and to provide the health and well-being, the ambient
temperature in the facility must not fall below 45 degrees for more than four consecutive hours when non-human
primates are present. Cold stress also affects the immune system leaving the animals susceptible to illness. All
areas housing nonhuman primates must be maintained at a temperature no lower than 45 degrees for more than
four consecutive hours. Correct By: 1/16/2015
This is a focus inspection of the direct non-compliances.
