3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
***The primary enclosure fence and the fence that divides the enclosure into two separate enclosures if necessary,
are in disrepair. The wire composing the fence is rusty with several areas of corrosion which weaken the structural
strength of the fence.
***There are portions if chicken wire. wire shelving and hardware cloth that have been attached along the lower
portions of the primary enclosure fence to patch gaps or holes considered large enough to allow a baby muntjac to
escape. There are several sharp points on the edges of some of these panel which may cause injury and the
amount of patching leaves the structure weakened.
***The muntjac enclosure is heavily wooded. Some of the trees are dead or dying and there are several branches
or limbs that have fallen into the enclosure as well as onto the primary enclosure fence. The larger fallen limbs have
damaged the fence in some areas. The excess broken limbs and branches create a stumbling hazard that may
allow the muntjac to become injured when spooked or running.
***The center divider fence has a section of wire fence that is not fully attached and it has been left dangling into the
enclosure which could allow the muntjac to become entangled or injured.
***There is a black tarp or curtain type material (approx. 2 ft high) being run along the bottom of the divider fence.
The curtain has not been completed but it has been left flowing loosely into the enclosure leaving a pocket that may
allow the muntjac to enter and become trapped and possibly allow suffocation. The excess material shall be
secured or removed to prevent access.
All structures shall be repaired or replaced and broken limbs and branchs removed from the fence to prevent
damage. Excess broken limbs shall be removed from the enclosure to protect the safety of the muntjac and protect
them from injury.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Owner.
