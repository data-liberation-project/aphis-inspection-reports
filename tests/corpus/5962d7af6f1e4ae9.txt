ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
* One cream and white colored male Persian ( tag number 3114-1653189 ) has a brown greasy appearing foreign
matter attached to the hair surrounding both eyes. The representative stated that approximately one year ago the
cat was examined by a licensed veterinarian. There was a three by five card attached to the program of vet care
stating that the cat has chronic eye problems due to anatomy. The representative stated that the cat has not been
examined by a licensed veterinarian since. The representative stated that it had been longer than two weeks since
the eyes of this cat had been washed with water. In addition, eye drops had not been applied to the eyes if needed
as directed by the veterinarian's instructions. Eye problems can be painful causing discomfort which affects the
health and well- being of the cat. The licensee must ensure all animals receive adequate veterinary care at all times.
*******************************************
* The following medications were past the labeled expiration date. There was one 473 ml bottle of Albon with an
expiration date of 07/2009. There was one - 60 ml bottle of Albon with an expiration date of 06/2006. There was
one bottle of Pyrantel Promate wormer with an expiration date of 04/2008. These medications were intermingled
with other products that are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. The usage of
expired medical materials on regulated animals is not considered to be an acceptable veterinary practice and does
not constitute adequate veterinary care. The effectiveness of the dosage level and expected results when expired
drugs are administrated could be drastically changed or may not work as anticipated. The licensee must ensure
that all medications used have not gone past the recorded expiration date.
****************************************
* The following medications had no expiration date recorded on the bottles. Two bottles containing Flagyl tablets
and one bottle containing Chloramphenicol tablets. These medications were intermingled with other products that
are currently being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. These medications were obtained from the
attending veterinarian. Medications must be labeled with appropriate and accurate information to ensure that the
contents and dosage rates of the container can be known with certainty and not used past their expiration date. If
the expiration date is unknown, the effectiveness of the medication is unknown.
The licensee must ensure that all medications are labeled with an expiration date.******************************************
* The label on one glass medicine bottle has a brown appearing liquid on it. This makes it difficult to read and
follow the written directions on this label. This medication was intermingled with other products that are currently
being used at the facility and are therefore ready for use. Medication labels must contain appropriate and accurate
information that is legible to ensure that the contents and dosage rates of the container can be known with certainty
and not used past their expiration date. The licensee must ensure that all medication labels are labeled with the
contents (name and concentration of drug), dosing instructions (specific for the species of the animal being treated)
and an expiration date that are legible at all times.
**********************************************
* The written program of veterinary care had incomplete information pertaining to the parasite control at the
facility. The section pertaining to ectoparasites had the words " screens and insecticide if needed " listed in this
section. In addition, the section pertaining to blood parasites had the words "screens" listed in this section. When "
screens and insecticide if needed" or "screens " is listed under the frequency of sampling or treatment the licensee
is providing the cats, it is not considered to be adequate veterinary care. More detailed information on parasite
treatment or control must be listed in these sections. The licensee, in coordination with the attending veterinarian,
must provide more specific information on the type of products used at the facility and the frequency of use. The
licensee must ensure that the program of veterinary care is updated with current preventive practices to ensure that
the cats are provided adequate veterinary care.
