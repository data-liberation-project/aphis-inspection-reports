Facilities, outdoor.
3 red kangaroos are contained in a large enclosure with 8-foot-tall chain link fence. The perimeter fence around the
kangaroo enclosure is made of wire farm fencing and is approximately 4.5 feet tall. A perimeter fence must be strong and
tall enough to prevent entry of unauthorized people and animals, and to act as a secondary containment system in the
event that an animal escapes from its primary enclosure. Correct by maintaining a perimeter fence around the kangaroo
enclosure that is at least 6 feet tall and 3 feet away from the animals primary enclosure, or by obtaining a variance from
USDA. A perimeter fence must also be maintained around any existing or new exotic animal enclosures in accordance
with the Animal Welfare Act regulations.
