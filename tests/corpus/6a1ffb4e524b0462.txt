2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is no written Program of Veterinary Care. Each animal exhibitor shall employ an attending veterinarian under
formal arrangements, and in the case of a part-time attending veterinarian or consultant arrangements, the formal
arrangements shall include a written program of veterinary care, in order to document agreed standards for
preventive health, diet, and other veterinary care issues. Failure to have a written program of veterinary care signed
by both the veterinarian and the animal exhibitor could jeopardize the well-being of the animals.
To be corrected by 5/9/14.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A seven year old tiger named (cid:28)Dana(cid:29) was treated on 10/1/12 for recurring eye problem, which improved, according
to veterinary records. Then on 1/11/14 it was noted on site records that the eye was (cid:28)runny(cid:29) again, and vet records
show that the vet authorized a refill on triple antibiotic ointment for the eye. At the time of inspection, the left eye
appeared painful, with a protruding third eyelid, redness, and staining on the face from discharge. The eye had not
been evaluated by the veterinarian, nor was it currently under treatment.
Two felids- one serval named (cid:28)Zindzhi(cid:29), and one bobcat named (cid:28)Ranger(cid:29)- are grossly obese. There is no notation in
site or veterinary records to indicate that this issue has been recognized or discussed.
A five year old Lynx, (cid:28)Nasha(cid:29), appears to move very cautiously, as if there may be pain in the limbs. This symptom
has not been noted or consulted with the veterinarian. Upon questioning this, the inspector was told that the animal
moved this way because he was very old; approximately 10 yrs, but records list date of birth as 2009.
It is essential that there is daily observation of all animals to assess their health and well-being, so that the
veterinarian can be consulted. A mechanism of direct and frequent communication is required so that timely and
accurate information on problems of animal health, behavior, and well-being is conveyed to the attending
veterinarian. Failure to recognize medical or other issues and to convey those to the attending veterinary staff in atimely manner can jeopardize the health and well-being if the animals.
To be corrcted by 5/2/14.

ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
There are two lemurs, but there is no written program of environmental enhancement. Those exhibiting non-human
primates must develop, document, and follow an appropriate plan for environment enhancement adequate to
promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates. The plan must be in accordance with the currently
accepted professional standards as cited in appropriate professional journals or reference guides, and as directed
by the attending veterinarian. This plan must be made available to APHIS upon request.

3.129(a)
FEEDING.
At the time of inspection it was observed that non-frozen meat was left out without refrigeration in main garage and
house for more than an hour. The bears had been fed fruit that was moldy, and (cid:28)cheezits(cid:29). Additionally, there was
a an unrefrigerated box containing deli meats, tandoori chicken burritos, lunchables, and crackers, and a volunteer
indicated that these items could be fed to bears and coyotes. Produce stored in the garage without refrigeration
was found to have significant molding and deterioration. The food is being fed on wooden planks that are not being
adequately cleaned between feedings. The food prep area has worn surfaces, worn cutting boards, and rusty
cutting implements. Some food storage areas have chemicals stored next to foodstuffs, including bleach, paint,
bags of cement, and car batteries. Food storage areas have many food bags or containers that are open, and
some have spilled food present. Three freezers have accumulated meat juice or other material and require cleaning.
There was a rodent bait block sitting unprotected adjacent to stored and spilled foodstuffs in a food storage shed.
There was no feeding plan by species approved by the veterinarian. What was being fed was unclear, as it seemed
to depend somewhat on daily donated foodstuffs. There was a letter from the veterinarian stating that she had
reviewed the diet, and that it was appropriate, but it was unclear what that approved diet was since it was not
documented. \
The food should be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value
to maintain all animals in good health. The diet shall be prepared with consideration for the age, species, condition,
size, and type of the animal. Measures should be undertaken to ensure that the food is appropriate as per these
guidelines.

WATERING.
In the both of the two bear enclosures the only available water was water troughs large enough for the animals to
enter the trough. The water was brown in color, and there was silty material present, with the bottom of the trough
being barely visible in one, and completely obscured in the other, due to the opacity of the water. The facility
representative stated that this water was not for drinking, but rather water was provided in buckets, but the animals
had overturned the buckets. All water receptacles shall be kept clean and sanitary so as to safeguard the health of
the animals.
To be corrected immediately.
3.131(c)(1)
SANITATION.
In a garage used for food storage, here is accumulated clutter consisting of cardboard boxes and miscellaneous
discarded items. In the food preparation area where the sinks and meat cutting boards are located there are tarps
and cardboard boxes piled on the ground. In the three additional food storage structures, bags of feed were piled
up and broken open, and the areas had accumulated dust and debris. In the outdoor area used to clean food
receptacles such as buckets and bowls, and crates and cages, these items were found to be dirty, and appeared
not to have been cleaned for more than a day, with accumulated rain water and decomposing organic material
present.
The presence of clutter can provide habitat for vermin. Unsanitary conditions can expose the animals to disease
risks. The buildings and grounds should be kept clean and in good repair in order to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices set forth in this subpart. Accumulations of trash shall be placed in designated areas cleared as
necessary, and food preparation and transport items should be kept clean and sanitary, so as to protect the health
of the animals.
To be corrected by 5/25/14/
3.131(d)
SANITATION.
In the food storage area there was evidence of mice infestation. Vermin can contaminate foodstuffs, which could be
hazardous to the health of the animals. An effective vermin control program should be used, including assuring that
foodstuffs are not accessible to vermin, so as to safeguard the well-being of the animals. To be corrected by 5/9/14.
An exit interview was conducted with a facility representive.
