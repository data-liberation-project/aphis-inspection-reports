OUTDOOR HOUSING FACILITIES.
The outdoor housing areas have some areas (<10% of all surfaces) of concrete that have not been made
impervious to moisture. Having concrete that is not impervious to moisture does not allow for the enclosure to be
properly sanitized. The concrete surface areas must be fixed so they are impervious to moisture. Correct by
10/3/19.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with the licensee.
