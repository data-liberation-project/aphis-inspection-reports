2.40(a)(1)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The Written Program of Veterinary Care the licensee provided at the time of the inspection is not complete.
Licensee does not have adequate written guidance from the attending veterinarian to provide preventative care or
treatment for routine and common veterinary problems. In order to ensure problems of animal health are addressed
adequately, a written program of veterinary care should include the species used in regulated activities, what
common health problems they may have and how these will be addressed by the licensee and the Attending
Veterinarian.
The formal arrangements with the Attending Veterinarian shall include a detailed written program of veterinarian
care.
Correct by 22 February 2015.
2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There is a container of FastTrack Liquid with an expiration date of 02/2012 and several other expired medications.
There are two unlabeled syringes containing a dark liquid material stored in the food storage refigerator. One Bag
of Horse Strongid-C pellets that the licensee stated she is feeding to the hoof stock has an expiration date of
06/2012. The bag of feed and medications were found inside the commissary intermingled with other items being
provided to the animals, and therefore are considered ready for use. Expired and unlabeled medications can
experience spoilage or have reduced efficacy. Use of expired and unlabeled medication could lead to prolonged
illness or suffering for the animals needing the medication.
The drugs that were observed by the inspectors currently on hand, are being used off labeled for the species
involved. There was no written approval for use by the attending veterinarian or any dosage instructions for the
proper use of these drugs. Using drugs in an extra label manner may be harmful to the animals if not administered
appropriately and under the direction of a veterinarian.
Ensure that all medications used in the facility are not expired, are labeled properly in accordance with standardveterinary practices and are approved for use in the animals present in the facility by the attending veterinarian.

2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
Licensee did not have available for review any records which fully and correctly disclose the required information on
the acquisition and disposition of the animals. Licensee stated she had sold one Serval, but had no documentation
showing the disposition of this animal. Licensee could not locate the acquisition records of the animals that are
housed at the facility. Licensee stated she had added one llama and one red kangaroo since the last inspection but
could not locate the record of these transactions. The record of acquisition must include the name, address and
USDA license number and date of acquisition of all animals at the facility, including any offspring born on the
premises. Maintaining current records of animals on hand, including those acquired and disposed of, is required in
order to be able to accurately track the animals. Licensee must make, keep, and maintain records which fully and
correctly disclose the required information regarding acquisition and disposition of animals. Correct by next
inspection.
3.75(a)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The divider fence of one ring-tailed lemur enclosure in the long primate building has come loose from it's support.
This has resulted in a gap between this fence and the wall. There are two wooden resting surfaces in the outdoor
portion of the snow macaque building that have holes in them. These areas may not securely contain the animals
or may cause injury to the animals. All surfaces must be kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
securely contain the animals. Correct by 22 February 2015.
3.75(c)(1)(1)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are rusted surfaces in a spider monkey enclosure in the long primate building, below two egress doors in the
long primate building, and on the metal resting shelves in the DeBrazza's monkey building. Also there is a rusted
hole behind the resting shelf of the DeBrazza's monkey enclosure. Surfaces that are rusted cannot be readily
cleaned and sanitized and can result in an increase of disease transmission. All surfaces must be free of rust that
prevents the required cleaning or affects the structural strength. Correct by 22 February 2015.
3.75(e)
HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Two opened bags of monkey biscuits were present in the food storage building. Opened supplies of feed may
become contaminated. All opened supplies of feed must be stored in sealed leak-proof containers to preventcontamination and rodent infestation. Correct by 23 January 2015.
A young pata's monkey is housed in a room in the food storage building. Placed on the floor next to this monkey
was a container of gasoline and a chainsaw. Also parked in this room is a utility vehicle. The vapors and exhaust
from this equipment may be hazardous to this animal. All substances that are toxic to animals must not be stored in
the animal room nor in the food preparation and storage areas. Correct by 23 January 2015.
3.80(a)(2)(9)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
There is peeling paint on the wall near the floor of the lemurs and spider monkey's enclosures in the long primate
building. Also there is peeling paint on the bars of the outside portion of the lion-tailed macaque enclosure.
The paint has been chewed off the wood in the indoor colobus enclosure as well as the three enclosures of the
patas monkey building. Peeling paint and raw wood does not allow the surfaces to be properly cleaned and
sanitized. All surfaces in contact with non-human primates must be kept in good repair to enable surfaces to be
readily cleaned and sanitized. Correct by 22 April 2015.
3.81
ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
The plan for the environmental enhancement to promote the psychological well-being of the nonhuman primates
was not available to review during the inspection. The plan, at a minimum, must address social grouping,
environmental enrichment, and special considerations (such as juveniles, those showing signs of psychological
distress and individually housed nonhuman primates). The plan and all environmental enrichment items must be
approved by the attending veterinarian (AV) and documented when provided to the animals on the environmental
enhancement plan. During this inspection, there was no written plan denoting any enrichment and no log book or
calendar showing that enrichment takes place. Nonhuman primates have complex social and intellectual needs that
need to be addressed when in captivity. A written plan that is directed by the AV, guided by current professional
standards, and available for review by APHIS officials is required to ensure that the psychological well-being of
these animals is being appropriately addressed. The licensee must develop, document, and follow an appropriate
plan for environmental enhancement of nonhuman primates that is in accordance with currently accepted
professional standards and as directed by the AV. Correct by 22 February 2015.
3.84(b)(2)
CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are mouse droppings on two sliding door supports in the snow macaque building. The presence of these
droppings indicate that these surfaces are not being cleaned and sanitized on a regular basis. All surfaces must be
kept clean and sanitized at least once every two weeks, or more often if necessary to prevent an accumulation of
dirt, debris and excreta. Correct by 23 January 2015.3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There are several places throughout the facility where the animals' enclosure fences are in need of repair:
-The lower section of the white-tailed deer fence is curled up in towards the enclosure. Also there are places where
this fence is broken resulting in wire points.
-The lower section of the adult addax enclosure fence near the feeder is exposed with wire points present.
-The material covering the enclosure fence of the young addax has been ripped in places resulting in gaps and
holes between this material and the enclosure fence.
-There are wire points in the enclosure fence of the zeedonk enclosure.
-There are several wooden posts that are attached to the steel fence of the camels' enclosure that have been
broken off. This has resulted in holes in this fence that are two to three feet tall.
-The two camels in one of the north enclosures have leaned over the top of their enclosure fence in several places.
This has resulted in that fence being been pushed down from its original height to now being only a few feet tall.
Two metal building panels of the shelter for two camels in one of the north enclosures have been kicked in. This
has resulted in these panels bowing out into the enclosure exposing metal edges to the animals.
Enclosure fences and housing facilities that are not kept in good repair can result in injury to the animals or may not
securely contain the animals. All building materials must be constructed of materials that are structurally
appropriate for the animals and must be maintained and kept in good repair to protect the animals from injury and
securely contain the animals. Correct by 22 April 2015.
3.129(a)
FEEDING.
Salt block and hay is being fed directly on the ground for one male white-tailed deer. The hay was contaminated
with excreta and the animal was observed walking through the hay. The pile of hay with the excreta is unfit for
consumption. Contamination of feed can lead to intestinal parasitism or overgrowth of microorganisms which pose
a risk to the health of these animals and feeding off the ground reduces this risk. Food must be wholesome,
palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to maintain all animals in good
health.
