FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Evidence of rodent infestation was observed at the floor of main dry food storage building. Also, the dry food
storage structure has several gaps of approximately 1/2 inch in length at the floor/wall junctions, which do not
prevent vermin entry/infestations. Additionally, nine 50-pound bags were observed in direct contact with the floor;
same area where rodent feces were identified. Supplies of food shall be stored in facilities which adequately protect
such supplies against deterioration, molding, or contamination by vermin. Facilities shall be structurally sound and
shall be maintained in good repair to protect the animals from disease and medical conditions related to food
contamination and/or infestation. The licensee needs to repair or replace the damaged wood and all affected areas
of the dry food storage building as soon as possible to avoid any potential health hazards to all regulated animals at
the premises.
