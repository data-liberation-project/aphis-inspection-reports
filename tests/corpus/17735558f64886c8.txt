3.9(b)
FEEDING.
- Most of the food receptacles in use were dirty with hair clumps and grim on the interior surface where the food is
dispensed to the dogs. The facility representative stated theses receptacles were cleaned once a year. The food
receptacles must be cleaned frequently enough to provide uncontaminated, wholesome food. They must also be
sanitized at least every two weeks. These food receptacles must be cleaned and sanitized before they are used
again.
