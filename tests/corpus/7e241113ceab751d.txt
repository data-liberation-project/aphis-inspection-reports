3.125(a) CRITICAL
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
During a study involving ferrets, one ferret was entrapped by a perch and subsequently died. The facility
determined that the cause of death was related to effects of the entrapment.
The housing facility should be constructed such that it would protect the animals from injury.
As a corrective action, the facility removed all of the perches from the ferret primary enclosures.
Corrected prior to this inspection.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
