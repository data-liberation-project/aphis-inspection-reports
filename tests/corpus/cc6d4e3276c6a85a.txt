3.80(b)(1)

Primary enclosures.
One female vervet was recently acquired. The licensee is working on introducing her to the other two male vervets. To
coordinate introductions, the licensee allows the female vervet free access to the male enclosure while present at the
facility. The licensee stated that is approximately 10-12 hours per day. During the remaining 12-14 hours, the female
vervet resides in a wire crate. The crate measured 30in x 19in which gives the vervet approximately 3.96 sq. feet and was
22 inches tall. However, group 3 non-human primate enclosures must provide at least 4.3 sq. feet and be 30 inches tall.

Primary enclosures must meet the minimum space requirements provided in this subpart. The minimum space that must
be provided to each nonhuman primate, whether housed individually or with other nonhuman primates, will be determined
by the typical weight of animals of its species. The vervets at the facility have been determined to be in non-human
primate group 3 with a minimum floor space of 4.3 square feet, and a minimum height of 30 inches.

The licensee must provide an appropriate sized enclosure to ensure the psychological and physical well-being of the non-
human primate.
