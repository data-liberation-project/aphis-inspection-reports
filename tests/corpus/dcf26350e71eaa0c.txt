2.40(b)(3)

Attending veterinarian and adequate veterinary care (dealers and exhibitors).
A more recently acquired male yorkie #0819 (DOB 11-22-19) some build-up of material on his teeth and two teeth were
loose to the touch (an upper incisor and an upper left canine tooth). The license said the tooth problems had not been
observed on this dog. Build-up with loose teeth are signs of dental disease that needs veterinary attention. Ensure that
dog's mouths are routinely observed so that signs of dental disease can be reported to the attending veterinarian for
appropriate treatment. Ensure that this dog's dental problems are evaluated by the attending veterinarian and treated per
the veterinarian's recommendations.
