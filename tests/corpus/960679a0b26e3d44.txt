ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
The following guinea pigs were identified as needing veterinary care:
1) A brindle smoothed hair male guinea pig in Pen 22 that housed 8 adults and 6 juveniles was found with a 2 cm
draining wound behind its left ear.
2) Two female Abyssinian guinea pigs (one white/beige/blue roan, one white/red roan/red) in Pen 30 that housed 4
adults and 6 juveniles had extensive hair loss over the back half of their bodies.
These three animals were not on any treatments and had not been evaluated by the attending veterinarian. Failure
to properly diagnose and treat animals’ condition can result in a worsening in the condition. The draining wound
may spread disease to the multiple other animals in the pen. In the case of the hair loss the condition, depending on
its cause, could spread to the animals in the pen. The licensee is responsible for providing veterinary care to ensure
optimal animal health. These animals must be seen by the attending veterinarian and treated appropriately by 12
pm on June 22, 2017.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Three guinea pigs were observed by the APHIS inspectors as requiring veterinary care:
1) A brindle smooth haired male guinea pig in Pen 22 that housed 8 adults and 6 juveniles was found with a 2 cm
draining wound behind its left ear.
2)Two female Abyssinian guinea pigs (one white/beige/blue roan, one white/red roan/red) in Pen 30 that housed 4
adults and 6 juveniles had extensive hair loss over the back half of their bodies.
The licensee had not noted these veterinary issues during his observations. No treatment had been started and theveterinarian had not been contacted. Animals in your care must be observed on a daily basis to assess their health
and well-being so that problems with animals’ health can be addressed by the attending veterinarian in a timely
manner. Correct by closely observing your animals on a daily basis from this day forward.
2.75(b)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
A current record of the animals on hand was not available for review during this inspection. The last facility inventory
provide to the APHIS inspectors was done in March 2017. Records are required in order to adequately verify the
total number of animals housed at the facility and for evaluating the facility animal care program. Correct by
ensuring there are current records for animal totals, including births and deaths, maintained and available for review
for all the animals at the facility. Correct by June 28th, 2017.
3.28(a)(1)
PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
All pens in Room 1 and 2 were found to no longer be impervious to liquid and moisture. The animals’ primary
enclosures must be able to be cleaned and sanitized appropriately to prevent the spread of disease and ensure
optimal animal health. Once the enclosure are no longer impervious to moisture they are not possible to sufficiently
clean. The enclosures must be resealed,repaired or replaced. Correct by September 28, 2017.
3.29(d)
FEEDING.
All of the feeders in Room 1 and 2 were found to be no longer in good repair. All feeders were rusted to the point
that they could no longer be appropriately cleaned, multiple feeders had caked on food, were covered in hair,
contained feces or had sharp edges. Food receptacles must be kept clean and sanitized as often as necessary or at
least every 2 weeks. Sharp edges can injury animals attempting to feed from broken feeders. These feeders must
be repaired or replaced. Correct by August 3, 2017.
3.30
WATERING.
There is an accumulations of dirt and debris by the automatic water valves, metal rings used to create the hole for
the water nipple and around the wood by the water valves. The water pipes have accumulations of debris, grime,
dust and cobwebs. These accumulations on the water valves, metal rings and unsealed wood by the water valves
exposes the guinea pigs to potential bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Inadequate cleaning and sanitation of the
automatic water valves and the surrounding areas can result in contamination of the guinea pig colony. Correct by
keeping the water valves, water lines and surrounding areas clean to ensure the health and well-being of the guineapigs. Correct by June 28, 2017.
3.31(a)(1)
SANITATION.
The pens in both Room 1 and 2 were found to have fresh bedding on top of soaked bedding especially around the
water valves, excessive excreta build up, and smelled excessively of ammonia. The pens have cobwebs in the
corners with spiders (see section 3.1( c)), dirt and debris is found around and on the support frames. Housing
enclosures that are not clean exposes animals to potential disease hazards such as, bacterial, fungal and viral. The
licensee must ensure animal enclosures and the surrounding area is kept clean to maintain the health of the
animals. Correct by June 23, 2017.
3.31(b)
SANITATION.
Housekeeping: The windows, walls and ceiling are covered in cobwebs that contained live spiders and dead flies.
There is dust and dirt on the window sills and on the windows and walls. Housing enclosures must be kept in a
sanitary manner to prevent exposing the animals to potential disease hazards including fungal, bacterial and viral
agents. The licensee must ensure the building housing the animals is kept clean to maintain the health of the
animals. Correct by June 28, 2017.
3.31(c)
SANITATION.
Pest Control: An extreme number of spiders were observed in the pens as well as throughout the building. No pest
control measures appeared to be in use. An effective program for the control of pests must be established and
maintained to protect the health of the guinea pig colony. Correct by June 28, 2017.
