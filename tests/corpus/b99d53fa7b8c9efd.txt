ENVIRONMENT ENHANCEMENT TO PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.
***There is 1 male capuchin nonhuman primate that is individually housed at the facility. This animal was acquired
on 9/4/14 and has been housed individually since arrival at the facility, due to quarantine procedures and
compatibility issues. Additionally, the nonhuman primate is unable to see or hear other nonhuman primates. The
attending veterinarian is not reviewing this animal's exemption from participation in the enhancement plan.
The attending veterinarian may exempt an individual nonhuman primate from participation in the environment
enhancement plan because of its health or condition, or in consideration of its well-being. The basis of the
exemption must be recorded by the attending veterinarian for each exempted nonhuman primate. Unless the basis
for the exemption is a permanent condition, the exemption must be reviewed at least every 30 days by the attending
veterinarian.
To be corrected by 4/24/15.

***On 3/8/15, a kit fox escaped its temporary enclosure. The licensee stated, during the night, the animal dug under
the gate and was able to gain access to the shift area. Once in the shift area the animal was able to squeeze
between the gate and fence post and escape the enclosure. The facility has set-up live traps but has been unable to

FEEDING.
***The facility is feeding the tiger and bear raw meat on enclosure surfaces that are not cleaned and sanitized.
During the tiger feeding, the APHIS inspector and Veterinary Medical Officer noted the tiger meat was placed on an
enclosure rock and concrete pad. The rock had dried blood, other debris and flies on it. The bear meat is set up on
a log that also had dried blood and debris on it along with splintering wood. Surfaces in which food is placed should
be clean so that the food does not become contaminated. Contaminated food may harbor pathogens and cause
disease in the animals. Also, the nutritive value of contaminated food is unknown. The licensee must ensure that all
food shall be wholesome, palatable, and free from contamination and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to
maintain all animals in good health.
