2.36(b) REPEAT
ANNUAL REPORT.
The annual reports for the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years are incorrect. No animals are recorded in the 2014 annual
report; however, the facility acknowledges using both goats and rabbits in the 2014 fiscal year. The 2015 annual
report list a smaller, incorrect number of goats used in the fiscal year. Additionally, not all facility locations are listed
in the annual report. Accurate reporting of animal species and numbers are necessary to maintain communication
with the USDA regarding animal use and animal welfare in research. Correct by sending an accurate annual report
for both 2014 and 2015 to the regional office. THIS IS A REPEAT NON-COMPLIANT ITEM THAT REMAINS
UNCORRECTED.
The inspection and exit interview were conducted with the Lab Manager.
