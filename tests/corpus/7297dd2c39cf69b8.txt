Mobile or traveling housing facilities.
On August 5, 2020 a facility representative exhibiting 2 uncaged juvenile lemurs during a live video segment at the facility
allowed the 2 juvenile lemurs to perch on the reporter's arms with no direct control of the lemurs. While the lemurs were
perched on the reporter's arms, the lemurs were then seen jumping freely to the camera person and then back to the
reporter's arms. It was apparent that the facility representative did not have direct control over the lemurs to prevent the
jumping of the lemurs from the reporter to the camera person or to another location at will. Failing to have direct control of
uncaged nonhuman primates (lemurs) during public exhibition may cause injury to the animals and/or the public. Exhibit
uncaged nonhuman primates (lemurs) during public exhibits only under the direct control and supervision of an
experienced handler or trainer at all times when the public is present. Corrected prior to this inspection.

Inspection conducted at the Maplewood Mall in Maplewood, MN.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with Manager.
End of report.
