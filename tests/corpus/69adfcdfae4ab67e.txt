FACILITIES, GENERAL.
In the primary enclosure were the camels are kept after the zoo closes, there was a metal frame on the ground.
When the representative was questioned about the metal frame she explained that the owner of the camels
put the frame on the ground to prevent the camels from lying in the mud. An alternative method to the
metal frame on the ground must be implemented to keep the animals from lying in the mud. The fame could
be stepped on by a camel or one accidentally trip over the frame causing an injury. Owner must ensure that all
primary
enclosures are constructed so that the animals are contained safely and protected from hazards.
