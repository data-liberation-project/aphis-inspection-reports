ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On January 28, 2014, an adult bull bison was euthanized. The attending veterinarian was not notified of the
euthanasia and thus was not present. The Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) specifically states in an attached
letter, "Euthanasia of animals will be performed under the supervision of a local veterinarian."

Notifying the veterinarian ensures proper methods and procedures are followed during euthanasia, that a humane
death is produced by ensuring that unconsciousness is rapidly achieved, and pain and distress are minimized.

The licensee must ensure the veterinarian has direct authority to provide adequate veterinary care for all animals at
the facility.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
According to the licensee, an adult fallow deer buck was found dead in his enclosure the early part of the first week
in June, 2014. The licensee stated, "He had slowed down some over the last few weeks, but I assumed he was just
getting old. He was always moving quickly when it was time to be fed." The licensee stated the veterinarian was
not notified.
Changes in animal behavior may be due to an illness, injury, or disease.
The licensee must ensure that they establish and maintain adequate veterinary care that include the use of
appropriate methods to prevent, control, diagnose and treat diseases and injuries and the availability of emergency,
weekend, and holiday care.

ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
On January 28, 2014 at 7:15am an adult bull bison was euthanized by two gunshots to the head with a rifle. The
Program of Veterinary Care (PVC) states that "Euthasol injection" is the approved method of euthanasia, and only
performed under the supervision of the attending veterinarian. Gunshot is not listed on the Program of Veterinary
Care.
The PVC should always be followed by the licensee in all veterinary matters for the animals under their care to
ensure any medical treatments or procedures are administered accurately and with the direction and knowledge of
the attending veterinarian.
The licensee must establish and maintain adequate programs of veterinary care that include guidance to the animal
caretakers regarding handling, immobilization, anesthesia, analgesia, tranquilization, and euthanasia.

2.131(d)(2)
HANDLING OF ANIMALS.
Three coin-operated "gumball-type" animal feed dispensers are available at the facility for the public to feed the hoof
stock on exhibition, including donkeys, llamas, and deer. The facility is open to the public at all times. According to
the facility representative, an attendant is only present during the "workweek." There is no public barrier to prevent
contact between the animals and the public when the attendant is not present.
Without an attendant, there is a safety risk to both the animals and to the public.
The licensee must ensure there is a responsible, knowledgeable, and readily identifiable employee or attendant
present at all times of public contact, including when feeding of the animals by the public is occurring.

3.125(a)
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
An adult bull bison pushed through the steel cattle panels of its enclosure. The bull, along with two yearlingsescaped into the larger enclosure around the lake. The area of escape has been temporarily repaired with welded
cattle wire panels and steel T posts. This lacks the structural strength needed to secure this species.
Without a secure enclosure the bison could possibly escape and injure themselves or create a danger to the public.
The licensee must ensure that all animal enclosures are constructed of such material and have the structural
strength as appropriate for the species involved. They must be maintained and in good repair as necessary to
contain each species safely and securely.
