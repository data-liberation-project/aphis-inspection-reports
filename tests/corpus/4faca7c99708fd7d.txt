Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
In the IACUC approved protocol 3189, there is not an adequate rationale for the appropriateness of the numbers of
animals to be used. The protocol does not include an explanation for the number of animals that were requested which
does not allow the IACUC to determine if this number of animals is appropriate for the proposed work.
Failure to provide and review this detail can result in an excess of animals used and euthanized. The registrant must
ensure that all protocols contain not only a rationale for involving animals and the appropriateness of the species, but also
the rationale for the appropriateness of the numbers of animals to be used.

Sanitation.
-There is an accumulation of feces in the two veterinary teaching sheep pens that covers a majority of both shelter floors.
At the time of inspection, the sheep were utilizing the shelter in the north pen for shade and there was no space in that
shelter that they could occupy that was free of excreta.
-There is an accumulation of feces in the veterinary teaching sheep barn pasture that covers a majority of one of the
shelter floors. At the time of inspection, the sheep were utilizing the shelter for shade and there was no space in that


shelter that they could occupy that was free of excreta.
Accumulations of excreta are especially of concern when they occupy an animal's shelter structure or interfere with its
access to food and water sources. These areas also attract pests and can play a role in disease transmission. The
registrant must ensure that excreta be removed from primary enclosures as often as necessary to prevent contamination
of the animals contained therein and to minimize disease hazards and odors.

This inspection was conducted from 8/9/22 to 8/11/22 and the exit interview was conducted on 8/11/22 with facility
representatives.
