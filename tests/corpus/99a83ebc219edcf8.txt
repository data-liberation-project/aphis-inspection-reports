ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
A mature female dromedary camel “Cleo” who is possibly older than 20 years, was dorsally recumbent in an open
pasture. The camel appeared thin and stiff, inflexible and when the animal attempted to walk it seemed to do so
with difficulty. A round growth, approximately the size of a baseball, was observed at the base of her tail and a
smaller was observed by her right eye. The attending veterinarian has seen and diagnosed the animal, however
the recommended treatment plan has not begun. The animal must begin the veterinarian recommended treatment
plan.
This was a focused inspection to address veterinary care noncompliances in the previous inspection. Inspection
and exit interview were conducted with the owner.Additional Inspectors
