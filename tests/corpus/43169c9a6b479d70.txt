PRIMARY ENCLOSURES.
In three of the buildings, (Bobby's,Tapioca's and Freddy's) the paint on the interior and exterior walls of the night
house enclosures are peeling, bubbling and flaking off. The peeling paint must be addressed so that the walls are
able to be readily cleaned and sanitized. The facility requests a three month correction time as new outdoor
exercise areas are being built and shifting of animals will occur once the construction is completed.

CLEANING, SANITIZATION, HOUSEKEEPING, AND PEST CONTROL.
There are approximately twelve light panels in each of the animal buildings. Insects and debris are visible through
the plastic covers of these fixtures. These fixtures need to be cleaned and pest control needs assessed. An
effective program for control of insects, external parasites affecting nonhuman primates, and birds and mammals
that are pests, must be established and maintained so as to promote the health and well-being of the animals and
reduce contamination by pests in animal areas.
