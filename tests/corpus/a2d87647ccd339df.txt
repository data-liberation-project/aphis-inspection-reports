2.75(a)(1)
RECORDS: DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS.
* At the time of inspection, the licensee could not produce up to date records of the dogs on the premises. Licensee
admitted that the Record of Acquisition (Form 7005) is not up to date. The current records do not accurately reflect
the nine actual dogs in the facility. There were also no disposition records (Form 7006) to reflect adult dogs that had
left the facility through sale/donation. Lack of documented information does not allow for accurate information as to
whom the dogs were acquired from nor where they are sold/donated to. Licensee must make, keep, and maintain
records or forms which fully and correctly disclose the information concerning each dog acquired, or in their
possession, is transported, euthanized, sold, donated or otherwise disposed of. Licensee ordered more forms
today.
* To be corrected by: Dec. 1, 2014. (verbal instruction at exit interview)
Inspection and verbal exit inspection conducted with facility representative.
