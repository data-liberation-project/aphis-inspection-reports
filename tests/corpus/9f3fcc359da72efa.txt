HOUSING FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a metal ladder for enrichment within the vervet enclosure that is dirty. There is a thick layer of brown to
black grime on the top (handles) of the ladder. There is an excessive amount of bird feces on and/or within all of the
enclosures within the sheltered portion of the "primate building". The bird feces is mainly located on the enclosure
fences of all three enclosures, housing a total of two macaques and four baboons, but there is also an excessive
amount of bird feces within the macaque enclosure. The bird feces in the macaque enclosure is covering nearly the
entire top of one perch and feces was seen mixed in with some of the bedding. In addition, bird droppings were
located on the floor throughout the human walk-ways and on the wall separating the two rooms of baboons. Failure
to clean housing facilities and enrichment items within primary enclosures can lead to disease hazards, pests and
odors. The licensee must ensure that hard surfaces with which the nonhuman primates come in contact are spot
cleaned daily and sanitized at least every two weeks. Furthermore, the licensee must ensure that all other surfaces
of the nonhuman primate housing facilities are cleaned and sanitized when necessary to satisfy generally accepted
husbandry standards and practices.
3.125(a) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
There is a large gap under the fence of the Santa Cruz sheep enclosure. The gap under the fence is large enough
to potentially allow the animals to leave the enclosure. The license holder indicated that some juvenile animals had
left the enclosure via the gap to graze in the alleyway, but returned to the enclosure earlier this year. There are at
least thirty-five sheep in this enclosure.The animals could potentially escape or predators could potentially enter the
enclosure.
Repair or replace the fence to protect the animals from escape and/or injury.
3.131(a) REPEAT
SANITATION.
Excessive animal and/or food waste is present in the shelter of the enclosure housing the single pig. The pig doesnot have a dry, clean place to lay down within the shelter.
Excessive amounts of bird feces are present along the wooden fence line of the zebu enclosure. The feces are
concentrated above the hay and feeding area of the zebu. In addition, there is bird feces on the two plastic feeders
sitting among the hay.
Excessive animal waste is present on the shelves within the enclosure containing three chinchillas. On one shelf
the feces is piled up in one area, but on the rest of the shelves it is scattered throughout the shelf.
Failure to clean animal enclosures can lead to health hazards, pests and odors. Primary enclosures shall be
cleaned and excreta and other waste shall be removed in order to prevent contamination of the animals contained
therein and to minimize disease hazards, pests and odors.
