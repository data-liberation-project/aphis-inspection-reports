CLASSIFICATION AND SEPARATION.
During inspection, two rabbits were housed within the pig enclosure and four rabbits were housed within the goat
and alpaca enclosure. Rabbits are a prey species and can become easily stressed when housed with other
species. The feces may also contaminate the food for the rabbit and the surfaces of the enclosure. Fecal material
may contain bacteria and parasites and cause the rabbit to become ill. On inspection, the rabbits did not appear
stressed by the presence of the pigs or goats and no harmful interactions between the two species were seen.
A system must be put in place to ensure that rabbits are not be housed in the same primary enclosure with another
species unless required for scientific reasons.
Corrected during inspection and from this day forward.
This inspection and exit interview were conducted with facility representatives.
