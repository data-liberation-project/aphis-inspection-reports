2.40(b)(2)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
There were three sheep and one goat found in need of veterinary care: #1334 a white-faced ewe, and an
unidentified mottled-faced ewe, and an unidentified white-faced ewe, all with overgrown hooves to the point that
they were curling upward and/or into each other. Additionally, a white goat #1333 was seen holding up the left rear
leg while standing/eating, and was limping at the walk. Overgrown hooves and other limb abnormalities can be
painful, can cause difficulty walking and performing normal postural movements, and can predispose the animal to
infections. Correct by having these animals examined by a licensed veterinarian and treated according to their
recommendations. A record of this examination, veterinarian(cid:25)s recommendations, and treatment shall be
maintained by the licensee and must be made available to APHIS Officials upon request. Additionally, the licensee
must establish and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care that includes the use of appropriate methods to
prevent, control, and treat hoof problems as directed by the attending veterinarian.
Correct By: 3 December 2015.
2.40(b)(3)
ATTENDING VETERINARIAN AND ADEQUATE VETERINARY CARE (DEALERS AND EXHIBITORS).
Four animals were found in need of veterinary care that the licensee had not observed or communicated to the
veterinarian prior to inspection. Daily observation is critical to the maintenance of animals(cid:25) health and well-being,
and direct and frequent communication with the attending veterinarian is essential for the provision of adequate
veterinary care. Correct by ensuring that all animals are observed daily to assess their health, behavior, and
well-being, and that timely and accurate information regarding the animals is communicated with the veterinarian.
Correct By: from this time forward or 12/02/2015.
2.126(a)
ACCESS AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS AND PROPERTY; SUBMISSION OF ITINERARIES.
A complete inspection of the facility was unable to be conducted on 12/01/2015. The Licensee stated that his wifekeeps track of the records and he was unable to provide inspectors access to the Acquisition, Disposition, Animal
Inventory or Vet Care records at the time of inspection. The licensee stated that his wife would be available the
following day to complete the inspection and that the records would be made available at that time. The licensee
agreed to have his wife call that evening to set up an appropriate time to complete the inspection and discuss the
report, however, the inspectors did not receive any calls from the Licensee or his wife on 12/1 or 12/2. The
Licensee stated that his wife may be home late on 12/1. So Inspectors made numerous attempts to contact the wife
of the licensee by phone the morning of 12/2 leaving messages on all available phone numbers. All attempts to
contact the Licensee or his wife by phone were unsuccessful and the calls were not returned.
Inspectors returned to the facility the afternoon of 12/2 at which time both the licensee and his wife pulled into the
facility right behind the inspectors. The wife of the licensee stated that she had received the messages from her
husband and that she knew we were trying to contact her. However; she refused to complete the rest of the
inspection because she had somewhere to be and things to do. The licensee and his wife were informed that
providing inspectors access to relevant records is part of the inspection process and that a refusal to complete the
inspection process would result in an additional citation. When asked again, the wife of the licensee stated (cid:28)No, I
have some where to be and I have things to do(cid:29). At that point the inspectors asked if she would be willing to review
the results of the inspection to that point and the wife of the licensee agreed. Inspectors reviewed the remaining
non-compliant items and informed the licensee and his wife that the inspection report would be sent by certified mail
with an additional citation for refusing to complete the inspection process.
All licensees must allow APHIS Officials to enter their place of business during regular business hours and examine
all records required to be kept by the act or necessary to enforce the provisions of the act. Refusal to allow access
to these records prevents APHIS Officials from ensuring animal welfare by ensuring adherence to the Act,
Standards, and Regulations. Correct by ensuring that the Licensee or an authorized representative has access to
all animal areas and required records and will be made available for all portions of the inspection within a
reasonable timely manner during the inspection.
Correct By: From this day forward
3.125(a) DIRECT REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
Throughout the facility there were areas of fencing that were broken, falling down, or otherwise in disrepair. These
areas presented possible escape routes or sources of injury through puncture, abrasion, or entrapment. In addition,
one goat was noticed to have its head stuck in the wire fencing of the enclosure. The goat made several attempts
to get its head unstuck but was unable to get its head out on its own. The goat was only able to get free from the
fencing after inspectors, with permission from the Licensee, assisted the animal. All enclosures and areas of the
facility shall be structurally sound, shall be maintained in good repair and protect the animals from injury. Correct By: Although this is a repeat citation and remains uncorrected, the Licensee must ensure that there are
methods in place to protect the goats heads from getting caught in the fence no late than 10 December 2015.
3.125(c) REPEAT
FACILITIES, GENERAL.
The facility is currently using a semi-trailer to store their feed bags. On inspections, there were several open bags
that were not being stored appropriately. Open bags of feed are exposed to the elements and are easily accessible
to vermin. Although there were no signs of a vermin issue on this inspection, all food must still be stored in a
manner in which it is adequately protected against deterioration, mold or contamination by vermin.
Correct By: This citation remains uncorrected and is a repeat citation
3.131(c) REPEAT
SANITATION.
An excessive amount of clutter was evident throughout the building around the animal enclosures. This clutter could
cause injury to the animals and serve as harborage for pests and vermin. About 90% of all solid surfaces of the
enclosures as well as the shrouding areas within the facility are covered with cobwebs or contained large amounts
of dust, dirt and debris which could lead to respiratory issues in the animals confined there. Inspectors noticed and
heard at least one sheep and one goat that coughed during today(cid:25)s inspection. Premises (buildings and grounds)
shall be kept clean and in good repair in order to protect the animals from injury and to facilitate the prescribed
husbandry practices.
